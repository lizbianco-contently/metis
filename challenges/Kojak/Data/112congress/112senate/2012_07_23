Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nobserve a moment of silence for the victims of the shooting in \nColorado.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (Moment of Silence.)\n\n\n                       Aurora, Colorado Shootings\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this afternoon the Senate pauses to remember \nthose killed in last week's horrific shooting in Colorado.\n  Among the dead was 26-year-old Jonathan Blunk--a graduate of Hug High \nSchool in Reno, NV, a Navy veteran and father of two. My heart goes out \nto his loved ones and to all the victims and their families as they \nstruggle to make sense of the senseless. How can you make sense of \nsomething that is so senseless? We may never know the motivations \nbehind this terrible crime or understand why anyone would target so \nmany innocent people.\n  Friday's events were a reminder that nothing in this world is certain \nand that life is precious and short. Today we pause to mourn the dead \nbut also to honor how they lived. We pledge our support to the people \nof Aurora, CO, both as they grieve and as they begin to heal from this \nterrible tragedy.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                       Aurora, Colorado Shootings\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have all been sifting through the \nevents of last Friday, and I think it is entirely appropriate for the \nSenate to take a moment today to acknowledge, as we just did, the \nvictims of this nightmarish rampage, their families, and the wider \ncommunity of Aurora.\n  In the life of a nation, some events are just so terrible they compel \nall of us to set aside our normal routines and preoccupations, step \nback, reflect on our own motivations and priorities, and think about \nthe kind of lives we all aspire to live. This is certainly one of those \ntimes.\n  As is almost always the case in moments such as this, the horror has \nbeen tempered somewhat by the acts of heroism and self-sacrifice that \ntook place in the midst of the violence. I read one report that said \nthree different young men sacrificed their own lives in protecting the \nyoung women they were with. We know the first responders and nurses and \ndoctors saved lives too, including the life of an unborn child.\n  I think all of us were moved over the weekend by the stories we have \nheard about the victims themselves. It is hard not to be struck by how \nyoung most of them were, of how many dreams were extinguished so \nquickly and mercilessly, but we were also moved by the outpouring of \ncompassion that followed and by the refusal of the people of Aurora to \nallow the monster who committed this crime to\n\n[[Page S5240]]\n\neclipse the memory of the people he killed.\n  President Obama, Governor Hickenlooper, and the religious leaders in \nand around Aurora are to be commended for the time and effort they have \nput into consoling the families of the victims and the broader \ncommunity. I think the best thing the rest of us can do right now is to \nshow our respect for those who have been affected by this terrible and \nsenseless crime and to continue to pray for the injured, that they \nrecover fully from their injuries.\n  There are few things more common in America than going out to a movie \nwith friends, which is why the first response most of us had to the \nshootings in Aurora was to think: It could have been any of us. It is \nthe randomness of a crime such as this that makes it impossible to \nunderstand and so hard to accept. But as the Scripture says, ``The rain \nfalls on the just and the unjust.''\n  So we accept that some things we just can't explain. Evil is one of \nthem. We take comfort in the fact that while tragedy and loss persist, \nso does the goodness and generosity of so many.\n  Now I would like to join Governor Hickenlooper in honoring the \nvictims by reciting their names:\n  Veronica Moser-Sullivan, Gordon Cowden, Matthew McQuinn, Alex \nSullivan, Micayla Medek, John Larimer, Jesse Childress, Alexander Boik, \nJonathan Blunk, Rebecca Ann Wingo, Alexander Teves, Jessica Ghawi.\n  We too will remember.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Defense Authorization\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to once again urge the majority \nleader of the Senate to bring to the floor for debate one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation that comes before this body each year; \nthat is, the national defense authorization bill.\n  On several occasions I have approached the majority leader and asked \nhim to consider this legislation which, for the last 50 years, this \nbody has taken up, debated, amended, passed, conferenced with the House \nof Representatives, and sent to the President for the President's \nsignature.\n  Last week, the majority leader, the Senator from Nevada, stated that \nSenate consideration of a controversial and flawed bill on \ncybersecurity--a bill that has not been considered in the regular \norder--is more important and of a higher national security priority \nthan the Defense authorization bill. I respectfully but vehemently \ndisagree with that statement.\n  According to the majority leader, ``We're going to have to get to \ncybersecurity before we get to the defense authorization bill because \non the relative merits, cybersecurity is more important.''\n  Let me repeat this. The majority leader of the Senate is arguing that \nlegislation dealing with cybersecurity--which is a subset of national \nsecurity, of national defense--is more important than legislation \nresponsible for ensuring that the men and women of the Armed Forces \nhave the resources and authorities necessary to ensure our national \nsecurity--a bizarre statement.\n  I have been involved in national security issues for a long time. I \nhave been involved with the bills concerning national defense, and I \nhave never heard a statement that cybersecurity is more important than \nthe overall security of this country. That either was the majority \nleader misspeaking or the majority leader having a lack of \nunderstanding of what national security is all about.\n  He is arguing that a controversial and flawed bill on cybersecurity--\na bill of such ``significance'' that it has languished for over 5 \nmonths at the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, \nwith no committee markup or normal committee process, no amendments--\nshould take precedence over a bill which was vetted for over a period \nof 4 months by the Senate Armed Services Committee and reported to the \nfloor with the unanimous support of all 26 members, which certainly \nwould not have been the case if there had been a vote on cybersecurity \nlegislation as it is presently proposed, because I am a member of that \ncommittee and I and others certainly would never have supported this \nlegislation and at least we should have been allowed the amendment \nprocess. But that is not the case with ``cybersecurity.''\n  Also, I might add, I understand we will have to have a motion to \nproceed, which then will drag us into next week, when we could--I \nemphasize could--finish the Defense authorization bill in 1 week and at \nmost 2.\n  I remind my colleagues that consideration of the Defense \nauthorization bill is more than a simple right of this body. It is an \nobligation to our national defense and a fulfillment of our \nresponsibility to the men and women in uniform that the Senate has \nhonored over the past 50 consecutive years.\n  I would say to my colleagues, today I went out to Bethesda Walter \nReed to visit with our wounded. It is always an uplifting and always an \nincredible experience for me to make that visit. Cannot we--cannot we--\nas a body, for the sake of those men and women whose lives are on the \nline, pass a defense authorization bill that is responsible for their \nsecurity, their training, their weapons, their equipment, their morale, \ntheir welfare? Cannot we pass a defense authorization bill through this \nbody? Are we so parochial? Is the Senate majority leader oblivious to \nthe needs of the men and women who are serving this Nation? They \ndeserve better than what they are getting from the leadership of this \nSenate.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee version of the fiscal year 2013 \nNational Defense Authorization Act provides $525 billion for the base \nbudget of the Defense Department, $88 billion for operations in \nAfghanistan and around the world, and $17.8 billion to maintain our \nnuclear deterrent.\n  In the area of pay and compensation, the bill authorizes $135 billion \nfor military personnel, including costs of pay, allowances, bonuses, \nand a 1.7-percent across-the-board pay raise for all members of the \nuniformed services, consistent with the President's request. The bill \nimproves the quality of life of the men and women in the Active and \nReserve components of the all-volunteer force. It helps to address the \nneeds of the wounded servicemembers and their families. It also \nauthorizes important military construction and family housing projects \nthat cannot proceed without specific authorization.\n  All major weapons systems are authorized in this legislation, \nincluding those that will benefit by the committee's continuous \nrigorous oversight of poorly performing programs. Every piece of \nequipment--large or small--that the Department of Defense needs to \ndevelop or procure is authorized in that legislation.\n  With the planned reductions in Afghanistan, the importance of \nproviding for our deployed troops while training and transitioning \nresponsibilities to the Afghan forces has never been more important. \nThe bill provides our service men and women with the resources, \ntraining, equipment, and authorities they need to succeed in combat and \nstability operations. It also enhances the capability of U.S. forces to \nsupport the Afghan National Security Forces and Afghan local police as \nthey assume responsibility for security throughout Afghanistan by the \nyear 2014.\n  The bill contains important initiatives intended to ensure proper \nstewardship by the department of taxpayer dollars by, among other \nthings, codifying the 2014 goal for it to achieve an auditable \nstatement of budgetary resources, strictly limiting the use of cost-\ntype contracts for the production of major weapons systems, requiring \nthe Department of Defense to review its existing profit guidelines and \nrevise them as necessary to ensure an appropriate link between \ncontractor profits and contractor performance, enhancing protections \nfor contractor employee whistleblowers, and restricting the use of \nabusive ``passthrough'' contracts.\n  Another vitally important provision in the bill repeals provisions of \nlast year's National Defense Authorization Act that threaten to upset \nthe delicate balance between the public sector and\n\n[[Page S5241]]\n\nthe private sector in the maintenance and repair of military systems, \nand the bill addresses many other important national security policy \nissues.\n  With respect to cybersecurity, I am in full agreement that the threat \nwe face in the cyber domain is among the most significant and \nchallenging threats of 21st century warfare. This threat was made even \nmore evident by the recent leaks about Stuxnet coming from this \nadministration. That is why the Defense authorization bill takes great \nsteps to improve our capabilities by consolidating defense networks to \nimprove security and management and allow critical personnel to be \nreassigned in support of offensive cyber missions which are presently \nunderstaffed. It also provides policy guidance to the Department of \nDefense to address the clear need for retaliatory capabilities to serve \nboth as a deterrence to and to respond in the event of a cyber attack.\n  Based on the procedures the Senate has been following over the past \nfew years--with little or no opportunity for debate and amendments--the \nmajority leader apparently intends to rush through the Senate a flawed \npiece of legislation. The cybersecurity bill he intends to call up \nlater this week is greatly in need of improvement, both in the area of \ninformation sharing among all Federal agencies and the appropriate \napproach to ensuring critical infrastructure protection.\n  Without significant amendment, the current bill the majority leader \nintends to push through the Senate has zero chance of passing the House \nof Representatives or ever being signed into law; whereas, the Defense \nauthorization bill, if we would take it up and pass it, clearly, we \nwould have a successful conference with the House, and we would send \nit--after voting on the conferenced bill--to the President for his \nsignature. There is no chance the cybersecurity bill the majority \nleader wants to bring to the floor will have a chance of passage in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  So here is the choice: take up the Defense authorization bill, which \nhas important cybersecurity provisions in it and provides for the \noverall defense of the Nation, or take up a flawed bill that never went \nthrough the committee, was never amended, take it to the floor, use up \n1 week while we go through the motion to proceed, and then maybe pass \nit, maybe not, and not have it even considered by the other body during \nthe month of September, which is the last we will be in session before \nthe election.\n  For the life of me, I do not understand why the majority leader of \nthe Senate should have so little regard for the needs of the men and \nwomen who are serving in the military today, and I hope he will \nunderstand better the needs to defend this Nation, as we are still \ninvolved in conflict in Afghanistan, we face a major crisis with Iran \nover their continued development of nuclear weapons--we just saw the \nIranian ability to commit acts of terror all over the world, the latest \nbeing in Bulgaria--the fact that Syria is now coming apart and in \ndanger of--because of this administration's failure to lead--that there \ncan be chemical weapons not only spread around Syria but also in other \nplaces as well. There is a danger of chemical weapons that are \npresently under Bashar Assad's control flowing to Hezbollah, presenting \na grave threat to the security of Israel.\n  All these things are happening in the world without this body acting \non the most important piece of legislation as far as our national \nsecurity is concerned, and the majority leader of the Senate apparently \nhas decided not to bring it up and wants to bring up cybersecurity \ninstead. It is a grave injustice--a grave injustice--to the men and \nwomen who are serving this Nation and sacrificing so much.\n  I hope the majority leader of the Senate, who by right of his \nposition and in the majority decides the agenda for the Senate, will \nchange his mind and bring up the Defense authorization bill, which I \nassure him we can have passed by this body, as always, in a near \nunanimous vote, if not totally unanimous vote, for the benefit of the \nsecurity of this Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Class Warfare\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wanted to say a few words today about the \ncurrent debate over ``class,'' a term that has been ubiquitous in this \nelection year. Its usage in political rhetoric is, I believe, misguided \nand wrong and even dangerous. Most prominently, we have a President who \ntalks incessantly about class, particularly the middle class. Maybe you \nhave noticed that.\n  He defines class strictly by your income. In the President's \nnarrative, someone who makes $199,000 a year is a member of one class, \nand someone who makes $200,000 belongs to another class. Does that make \nsense? Indeed, each day the President is out on the campaign trial \nchampioning himself as the great protector of what he calls the middle \nclass, and pitting those Americans against their fellow citizens by \narguing that the wealthiest class is victimizing them through the Tax \nCode.\n  If wealthy people are not made to pay more, he argues, the middle \nclass will be stuck in their current stations. What one class wins, he \nimplies, the other class loses. In this, I believe he is wrong. \nMoreover, I believe such a formulation is contrary to four centuries of \nAmerican history.\n  First, I think ``class'' is a loaded term that is not appropriate for \nour debates about income, mobility, and tax policy. Implying there is a \nrigid class structure in America suggests some people were born \ninnately superior to others, and that where you were born is where you \nstay.\n  That is not what we believe in America. A true class-based society is \none in which one ruling class employs another class that labors but \ncannot own property or move out of their class.\n  This is not who we are in America. We do not have an ingrained class \nsystem. There are no noble bloodlines. We do not have an aristocracy or \ncommoners or people who are legally unable to own land, for example, \nbecause of their class. Spreading economic resentment weakens American \nvalues and ideals, and it ignores the uniquely meritocratic basis of \nour society where you can succeed if you work hard, and you can do \nwell.\n  Generations arrived here in America to get away from class societies \nin Europe. They believed in that meritocracy. They wanted the \nopportunity to make it in the land of self-government and equal rights \nand opportunity, to work and compete and to build something of their \nown, something they could perhaps one day pass on to their children.\n  In America we believe everyone can achieve the American dream \nregardless of background. And how many rags-to-riches stories are there \nout there? There are countless. How many from one generation to the \nnext, and by the third generation you had an incredibly more successful \ngeneration than the first. Think of all the people who had a big dream \nand built something or made something that changed lives; maybe a \ncompany that employs a lot of people or a product that makes life \neasier or maybe even just more fun. We have different talents to offer \nand different ideas of success and what we want to do with our lives, \nand that is all part of the American story.\n  As columnist Robert Samuelson noted recently, four modern-day \nPresidents--Obama, Clinton, Johnson, and Eisenhower--all came from very \nmodest backgrounds. So we don't need the current President touring the \ncountry and defining every American's values and status based upon a \nclass system he has made up.\n  If we want to talk about income and mobility, which is the basis of \nthe class debate, let's do that. And that leads to my second point. \nIncome in America is fluid; that is, there is ample evidence that \npeople can and do move among income groups. Our economists study this. \nThey divide our country into quintiles and they talk about how people \nmove from one quintile into another quintile, and they do this \nthroughout their life. You know, younger people start in the lower \nquintiles and as they get education and get work and then get improved \nwork and more experience, they move into higher quintiles.\n\n[[Page S5242]]\n\n  Take one statistic here. The Tax Foundation found from 1997 to 2007--\nthe 10-year period they studied--only 50 percent of the taxpayers who \nreached millionaire status did so more than one time. In other words, \nhigh income status is often the result of 1 or 2 years of financial \nsuccess, frequently based on the sale of an asset or some other \ntemporary event.\n  Here is another notable factoid: A Kauffman Foundation survey of more \nthan 500 successful entrepreneurs found that 93 percent came from \nmiddle-income or lower income backgrounds. The survey notes that \nentrepreneurship did not run in the family for these people. Quoting \nfrom the survey:\n\n       The majority were the first in their families to launch a \n     business.\n\n  A Treasury Department study on income and mobility in America found \nduring the 10-year period starting in 1996, roughly half of the \ntaxpayers who started in the bottom 20 percent had moved up to a higher \nincome group by 2005. Similarly, people in the top income group dropped \nto lower groups, thus making way for others to move up. The point is \nthere is no such thing as a permanent middle class or any other class \nin America.\n  There are other measures of income mobility. As columnist Robert \nSamuelson noted, one litmus test for mobility in America is whether \npeople rise above their parents economically, and this happens \nfrequently. Citing a new report from the Pew Mobility Project, he notes \nthat 84 percent of Americans exceed their parents' income at a similar \nstage in life. Income gains were ``sizable across the economic \nspectrum,'' he writes. Indeed, in the bottom fifth of income earners, \nmedian income grew by 74 percent over just this decade.\n  While income mobility has slowed during this economic downturn, the \noverarching point is that nobody in America is stuck where they are \nbecause of a ruling class of greedy wealthy people.\n  Here is my third point: To borrow a phrase from Congressman Paul \nRyan, the real class threat is a class of bureaucrats and crony \ncapitalists using their government connections to try to rig the rules \nand rise above everyone else.\n  One example is ObamaCare. Recently released documents show that \nindustry lobbyists and Democrats worked very closely in drafting \nObamaCare. After it became law, the Department of Health and Human \nServices granted approximately 1,700 temporary waivers from the new \nannual limit requirements of the law. When the Federal Government is \nhanding out lucrative favors, it is easy to predict what will happen. \nCompanies hire armies of lobbyists and politically connected \norganizations--in this case, primarily, labor unions--will get special \ntreatment. And that is exactly what happened here.\n  It is not just ObamaCare. Cap-and-trade would have enriched \npolitically connected energy firms. Even without cap-and-trade, many of \nObama's political supporters have reaped huge benefits from the \nadministration's green energy industrial policy. The Solyndra scandal \ndemonstrates what can happen when government tramples free markets in a \nmisguided attempt to pick economic winners and losers.\n  As University of Chicago economist Luigi Zingales reminds us in his \nnew book, ``A Capitalism for the People,'' being ``probusiness'' is not \nthe same as being ``promarket.'' All too often, the Obama \nadministration has embraced spending policies and regulations that \nfavor certain businesses but are fundamentally antimarket. If a Federal \npolicy is probusiness but antimarket, it is most likely an example of \ncrony capitalism.\n  The irony here is remarkable. Even though President Obama tours the \ncountry advertising himself as the defender of the little guy and a \nguardian of the middle class, he has consistently embraced policies \nthat promote crony capitalism.\n  That is not the type of capitalism that made this country so \nprosperous, and it is not the type of capitalism the American people \nsupport. Citizens across this country are eager for policies that \npromote free markets and equal opportunities for all businesses, all \nindustries, all entrepreneurs, all people. Those are the principles \nupon which our country was founded. Americans firmly reject the idea \nthat certain companies and industries should receive preferential \ntreatment for political or ideological reasons. Centuries of evidence \nfrom around the world demonstrates crony capitalism leads to \ncorruption, a decline of social trust, and economic stagnation. That is \ncertainly not the future Americans want.\n  Instead of policies that favor politically connected entities and \ntake even more money from successful Americans, let's clear the way for \nmore opportunity and mobility in a true free market system. Higher \ntaxes and more government are not the answers. We should not make it \nmore difficult for Americans to get ahead.\n  We should certainly not believe Americans are to be distinguished by \ntheir income in any given year or be presumed to have different values \nor value because of that. To say America has a middle class presumes we \nhave a lower class or an upper class. Think about it. You can't have a \nmiddle without something on either side. Is it true we have a lower \nclass and a middle class and an upper class? Some Americans are better \noff financially than others. That is certainly true. But that is no \nbasis for dividing us into arbitrary classes to favor one over another.\n  My guess is that all this talk about class, while it has a tendency \nto divide Americans, is more about trying to identify with the common \nman, and that is something all politicians try to do. ``I am just like \nyou. I am just like the average guy.'' Abraham Lincoln talked about \nidentifying with the common man. He said he thought God made a lot of \nthem, and I think that is true. Most people in this country like to \nthink of themselves as basic, common citizens, and they do not \nparticularly like somebody identifying them as a class in order to \nsuggest they are better or worse than somebody else.\n  That is why I think, even though this divides America, the discussion \nabout class is probably simply an effort to say ``I am for you.'' And \nsome politicians don't like to say ``I am for everybody'' because that \nwould imply they are for people who are very successful. Well, why \nshouldn't we be for people who are very successful? They are probably \npeople who have accumulated wealth because of something they have \naccomplished in life--usually by studying hard, working hard, sometimes \nby creating some special kind of product.\n  Take Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. They were smart people who created \nsomething people wanted and were willing to buy, and they got very \nwealthy because of that. Is that bad? Bill Gates has created a \nfoundation, and he and his wife have contributed more to charity than \nprobably any other thousand people you can name. That is a good thing. \nThey have created more jobs than many other people in this country \nhave. They have created products that have enabled us to lead much \nbetter lives. The same thing is true of Steve Jobs and thousands and \nthousands of other entrepreneurs. So there is nothing wrong with being \nsuccessful, being rewarded for that, because most likely it has given \nmany other people an opportunity.\n  There was a recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal that talked \nabout the Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan. The article noted they \nweren't a very impressive team before Michael Jordan came and the team \nwasn't making very much money and neither were any of the players. When \nMichael Jordan came, after he established how great he would be, he was \ngiven an enormous, almost unheard-of salary. Did the other players say: \nThat is not fair? No. Actually, all the other players got big salary \nincreases too--nothing like Michael Jordan, but they got huge salary \nincreases. Why? Because he made the team better and it began to succeed \nand, eventually--you all know the story--the world championships, the \nwhole franchise did well--the people selling popcorn in the stands, the \npeople parking the cars, and certainly every one of the members of the \nteam made much more money than they ever would have had Michael Jordan \nnot come to the team. But Michael Jordan still made many times more \nthan any of them did.\n  This is a point President John Kennedy made when he talked about \nreducing the tax rates in the country on business--on capital gains--so \nthat businesses could create more wealth so they could do what? They \ncould grow and hire more people. He said a rising\n\n[[Page S5243]]\n\ntide lifts all boats. If the economy is doing well, if we have wealthy \npeople who are doing well, we have less wealthy who will also do \nbetter.\n  That is what America has always been about. We don't take it away \nfrom the person who makes a lot of money. Maybe it is because they are \nlucky with a God-given talent they have or their good looks and their \nacting ability. Whatever it is, those people generally participate in \nactivities that create wealth for others as well. They also create \nproducts or services or even entertainment we enjoy. So Americans don't \nlook askance at these people. We celebrate them. We are happy for their \nsuccess. Frequently it helps us too, besides which they pay a lot of \ntaxes.\n  Likewise, for those people who are less fortunate, I don't know of \nany politician who wants to talk about the lower class. That almost is \na pejorative term. It is as though these are lesser people. Well, the \nreality is maybe it is somebody down on his or her luck. Maybe it is \nsomebody just starting out so they are not making as much money as \nsomebody who has been in business a lot longer. Maybe it is a student, \nfor example, or somebody who suffered misfortune, somebody who doesn't \nhave a good education, or maybe a recent immigrant to the country. \nThere is nothing lesser about those people. We are all Americans. They \nmay be in a lower income group, at least temporarily, but there is no \nreason to distinguish between the people in that income group and \nhowever the President defines the middle class.\n  Why is the middle class more deserving or special than people who \ndon't make as much money as those in the middle class? The point is, \npeople are deserving all up and down the economic ladder. It isn't just \nabout money, anyway. The person who makes an average income--who \nprovides for his family, provides them a good home, good tutelage as a \nparent, strong values, maybe sends them off to college and helps them \nto prepare for their life as a productive citizen--is just as important \nas the wealthy person in this country. A teacher may not make much \nmoney but influences the lives of thousands of young people to be \nbetter citizens in this country--more educated--and that influence goes \nfar beyond the salary the individual teacher makes. So you can't judge \nvalue by how much money someone makes, and you certainly can't identify \nwith one class and say: That is the class I am for.\n  The President, in particular, represents all Americans. He should be \nfor all Americans. And I don't think there is anything called middle \nclass values that are different from the values of other people in this \ncountry. Tell me what is different about the values of someone who the \nPresident identifies as middle class? Does that mean middle income? If \nso, what income and what year? Because a person will be in a lower \nincome group one year, in a middle income group the next year, and \nmaybe 10 years later in a higher income group. Has that individual's \nvalues changed? No. Americans are Americans, and it doesn't matter how \nmuch money we make in a given year. What matters is that as a country \nwe have found a degree of success that others can only dream of because \nwe create opportunity for everyone to succeed, and we teach that to our \nkids.\n  I think it is destructive for the leader of the country, the \nPresident, to be suggesting something else--that you should consider \nwhat class you are in in this country: If you are middle class, that is \ngreat, I am for you. Well, what about the other classes, and what about \nthe person who is middle class today under the President's definition \nbut wasn't yesterday and might not be tomorrow?\n  I just think the whole discussion of class is wrong. It is not what \nwe do here in America. You can divide people for statistical purposes \ninto income levels, into wealth levels, into levels of education. We \ndivide ourselves for statistical reasons into all kinds of categories, \nbut at the end of the day, we don't suggest that one group has \ndifferent values than the other or that one is better than the other \none. And I think that is the pernicious effect of the President's \nrhetoric--constantly talking about the middle class. I don't even know \nif I am in that group or not. Am I in the middle class? I make less \nmoney than the President suggests identifies the wealthy, that is for \nsure, but I don't think my values are any different or any better than \nthose who make less money or more money than I do. In my view, money \nisn't even the measure of what this should be all about anyway.\n  I hope that as the campaign goes on, maybe we can focus a little bit \nmore on what unites us rather than what divides us, on the values that \nI think we all subscribe to, and on the things that would make us a \nbetter country not just in economic terms but in other terms as well. \nAnd if we are focused on economic terms, then let's focus on those that \nwill make us better off economically: a better education, a better home \nenvironment, strong communities, a government that is willing to help \nwhen that is necessary, and certainly governmental policies that reward \nwhat? That reward education; that reward hard work; that reward savings \nand investment; that reward entrepreneurship, people working to create \nsomething, to create a business; that reward job creation so that you \ndon't have a law like ObamaCare that says: You are OK if you have 49 \nemployees, but as soon as you have 50 employees, then here are a whole \nbunch of expensive burdens you are going to have to take on--tax \nburdens, penalties, and regulations. That is not something that favors \nbuilding a business beyond 49 employees. It doesn't favor job creation \nbeyond 49 employees. These are the kinds of issues we should be \ndebating. What will make our country better both in economic terms and \nin all of the other terms that define us as a society?\n  I hope that as the campaign goes on, we will focus a lot more on what \nwe hold in common, that we share, and that we can do better with, \nrather than those that divide us and especially that divide us in \npolitical terms.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       AURORA, COLORADO SHOOTINGS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the horrific shooting that happened last \nweek in Aurora, CO has shocked our Nation. Our hearts and our prayers \ngo out to the victims, to their loved ones, and to all those whose \nlives have been forever marred by this tragedy. Twelve have died, and \n58 more have been injured, many seriously.\n  We certainly give thanks to the first responders and to the medical \npersonnel who responded so quickly and so capably. Most of all, we \nmourn those who we have lost.\n  Sadly, no state in our Union is immune to the horror of lives cut \nshort by violence. In my State of Illinois, there have been too many \nlives lost, too many families shattered, too many children caught in \nthe crossfire in my hometown of East St. Louis and some neighborhoods \nof Chicago.\n  The tragic mass shooting in Aurora has sent ripples of sadness and \nloss far beyond Colorado. For many people in Illinois, the scene last \nFriday was sickeningly familiar. A little over 4 years ago, a mentally \ndisturbed gunman walked into a lecture hall at Northern IL University \nin DeKalb, IL, and opened fire. He killed 5 people, and injured 21 \nmore. We in Illinois know something about the grief Coloradans are \nfeeling after last Friday's mass shooting, and we grieve with them.\n\n\n             Petty Officer John Larimer of Crystal Lake, IL\n\n   We were saddened to hear that a young man from Illinois was among \nthose killed in Aurora. U.S. Navy PO3 John Larimer of Crystal Lake, IL, \nwas a fourth-generation Navy man.\n  He joined the Navy last year and trained at the Naval Station Great \nLakes near Chicago. He was a cryptologic technician. He was stationed \nat Buckley Air Force Base in Aurora, where he was assigned to the U.S. \nFleet Cyber Command. Last week Petty Officer Larimer went to the movies \nwith his girlfriend, Julia Vojtsek, a nurse who grew up in Algonquin, \nIllinois. When the shooting started, John Larimer shielded Julia's body \nwith his own. Julia said that John ``held my\n\n[[Page S5244]]\n\nhead, and protected my whole body with his, and saved me.'' John \nLarimer was a brave man who died a hero. He was 27 years old.\n  His commanding officer, Commander Jeffrey Jakuboski, said the \nfollowing of Larimer:\n\n       He was an outstanding shipmate. A valued member of our Navy \n     team, he will be missed by all who knew him.\n\n  Over the weekend, John Larimer was remembered by friends and family \nfor his intelligence, his good nature, his compassion, and his \ndedication to his family, his community and his country.\n  Family members spoke of his ``incredible mind'' and ``quiet \ngentleness.'' John's English teacher at Crystal Lake South High School \nremembered a good student who was ``incredibly bright and firm in his \nideals.'' He said John ``was a good, strong human being . . . and I \nknow he would have done incredible things for our country.'' To his \nhigh school principal, John Larimer was ``just a great kid to be \naround.''\n  Whether it was giving a big tip to a neighborhood kid who sold him a \nlemonade, or sending letters to the local newspaper calling for \ntolerance and respect for the views of others, John Larimer inspired \nthose around him through the way he lived his life. And now he has \ninspired us with the way he died, literally sacrificing his life to \nsave another.\n  His passing is a heartbreaking loss to the community of Crystal Lake, \nto Illinois, and to our country. I offer my condolences to John's \nparents, his brother and his three sisters. All of us will keep John, \nhis family and his loved ones in our thoughts and prayers.\n  A night out at the movies is supposed to be a joyful event. That it \ncould end in such a horrific scene reminds us how precious and fragile \nlife is.\n  In the days and weeks to come, we will learn more about what happened \nin Aurora and whether there was any point at which this disturbed \ngunman could have been identified and stopped.\n  There will inevitably be discussions about whether we need to change \nany of our laws or policies. We owe it to the victims and their loved \nones to see that those debates are guided by an honest assessment of \nthe facts, what it will take to keep us safe in America, safe from the \ngunman who walks into a classroom at Northern Illinois University in \nDeKalb or the gunman who walks into a crowded theater in Aurora CO.\n  I came out of church yesterday, and a woman came up to me and said: \nThey are talking about putting metal detectors in movie theaters now. \nWhat is next?\n  I said, sadly: I am not sure. I don't know where we will turn next to \nkeep America safe from people who misuse firearms, assault rifles, a \n100-round clip of ammunition.\n  All of these things are raising questions in the minds of everyone \nabout where is it safe anymore.\n  I said to this woman outside our church: There was a big crowd \nsitting in that church today, too. Just as in that movie theater, we \nall thought we were safe until this happened.\n  For today we pause, not to enter into a debate about these important \nissues, which we must face, but to remember and honor those who died, \nto offer our condolences to those who were left behind, and to pray for \nthe recovery of all those who were wounded and those who have suffered. \nWe wish them comfort in this difficult time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, are we now on the motion to proceed to S. \n3412?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. I have a cloture motion at the desk I wish to have \nreported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to calendar No. 467, S. 3412, a bill to amend the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide tax relief to middle \n     class families.\n         Harry Reid, Max Baucus, Tom Udall, Debbie Stabenow, Mark \n           Begich, Sheldon Whitehouse, Carl Levin, Robert P. \n           Casey, Jr., Tom Harkin, Tom Carper, Christopher A. \n           Coons, Barbara A.

SHIPP TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                       THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read the nomination of Michael A. Shipp, of \nNew Jersey, to be United States District Judge for the District of New \nJersey.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nmotion be withdrawn and that the time be equally divided between now \nand the hour of 5:30 in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding \nback of time the Senate proceed to vote without intervening action or \ndebate on the nomination; that the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate; \nthat no further motions be in order; that any related statements be \nprinted in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, distinguished by his service here in the Senate but also as \nGovernor of one of the most beautiful States in the Union.\n\n\n                       Aurora, Colorado Shootings\n\n  Before we begin--and so many others have said this--it would be \nimpossible to state the amount of horror and sadness felt by my wife \nMarcelle and me at the news of what happened in Colorado, and I was \nreminded again today as I saw the flags lowered to half staff on this \nCapitol Building. We think of the Capitol as being a bastion of \ndemocracy or the light that sort of shines for the rest of the world on \nwhat democracy is. Unfortunately, so much of the world has seen the \nacts of a madman. It is safe to say this is one thing that united every \nSenator of both parties here. Our hearts go out not only to those who \nhave been injured, obviously to the families of those who have died, \nand to the people in that wonderful community, because it is impossible \nfor any one of us here to know how long or how hard that will hold in \ntheir heart, the number of people who say, as we all do: We just went \nto a movie. Any one of us has done that. Our children go to movies, our \ngrandchildren go to movies. You expect them to go, have a good time, \nand come back, and enjoy it. The thought of what they saw there is \nhorrible.\n  We have before us a Federal trial court nomination, that of Michael \nShipp. This is a nomination that was voted on by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee more than three months ago and supported nearly unanimously \nby both Republican and Democratic Senators who have reviewed it. The \nonly objection came as a protest vote from Senator Lee.\n  Judge Michael Shipp has served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge in the \nDistrict of New Jersey since 2007 and has presided over civil and \ncriminal matters and issued over 100 opinions. He is the\n\n[[Page S5245]]\n\nfirst African-American United States Magistrate Judge in that district. \nPrior to his appointment to the Federal bench, he worked for the Office \nof the Attorney General of New Jersey for five years, where he was \nAssistant Attorney General in charge of Consumer Protection from 2003 \nto 2007 and Counsel to the Attorney General in 2007. From 1995 to 2003, \nJudge Shipp was an associate in the Newark office of the law firm \nSkadden, Arps. Upon graduation from law school, Judge Shipp clerked for \nJudge James Coleman on the New Jersey Supreme Court.\n  Despite his outstanding qualifications and bipartisan support, Senate \nRepublicans have delayed his confirmation vote for more than three \nmonths. Despite the fact that the Senate has finally been allowed to \nconsider his nomination and that he will be confirmed overwhelmingly, \nSenate Republicans have again demonstrated their obstruction of \njudicial nominees. This is not a nominee on whom cloture should have \nbeen filed.\n  They refused until today to agree to a vote on this nomination. That \nmeant that the Majority Leader was required to file a cloture petition \nto put an end to their obstruction and partisan filibuster. While I am \npleased we are holding a confirmation vote today, it should not have \nrequired that the Majority Leader file for cloture.\n  This was the 29th time the Majority Leader had been forced to file \nfor cloture to end a Republican filibuster and get an up-or-down vote \nfor one of President Obama's judicial nominees. By comparison, during \nthe entire eight years that President Bush was in office, cloture was \nfiled in connection with 18 of his judicial nominees, most of whom were \nopposed on their merits as extreme ideologues.\n  Senate Republicans used to insist that filibustering of judicial \nnominations was unconstitutional. The Constitution has not changed but \nas soon as President Obama was elected they reversed course and \nfilibustered President Obama's very first judicial nomination. Judge \nDavid Hamilton of Indiana was a widely-respected 15-year veteran of the \nFederal bench nominated to the Seventh Circuit and was supported by \nSenator Dick Lugar, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate. They \ndelayed his confirmation for five months. Senate Republicans then \nproceeded to obstruct and delay just about every circuit court nominee \nof this President, filibustering nine of them. They delayed \nconfirmation of Judge Albert Diaz of North Carolina to the Fourth \nCircuit for 11 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Jane Stranch \nof Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit for 10 months. They delayed \nconfirmation of Judge Ray Lohier of New York to the Second Circuit for \nseven months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Scott Matheson of Utah \nto the Tenth Circuit and Judge James Wynn, Jr. of North Carolina to the \nFourth Circuit for six months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Andre \nDavis of Maryland to the Fourth Circuit, Judge Henry Floyd of South \nCarolina to the Fourth Circuit, Judge Stephanie Thacker of West \nVirginia to the Fourth Circuit, and Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of \nCalifornia to the Ninth Circuit for five months. They delayed \nconfirmation of Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida to the Eleventh \nCircuit, Judge Beverly Martin of Georgia to the Eleventh Circuit, Judge \nMary Murguia of Arizona to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Bernice Donald of \nTennessee to the Sixth Circuit, Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia to the \nFourth Circuit, Judge Thomas Vanaskie of Pennsylvania to the Third \nCircuit, Judge Joseph Greenaway of New Jersey to the Third Circuit, \nJudge Denny Chin of New York to the Second Circuit, and Judge Chris \nDroney of Connecticut to the Second Circuit for four months. They \ndelayed confirmation of Judge Paul Watford of California to the Ninth \nCircuit, Judge Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona to the Ninth Circuit, Judge \nMorgan Christen of Alaska to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Stephen Higginson \nof Louisiana to the Fifth Circuit, Judge Gerard Lynch of New York to \nthe Second Circuit, Judge Susan Carney of Connecticut to the Second \nCircuit, and Judge Kathleen O'Malley of Ohio to the Federal Circuit for \nthree months.\n  As a current report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research \nService confirms, the median time circuit nominees have had to wait \nbefore a Senate vote has skyrocketed from 18 days for President Bush's \nnominees to 132 days for President Obama's. This is the result of \nRepublican foot dragging and obstruction. In most cases, Senate \nRepublicans are delaying and stalling for no good reason. How else do \nyou explain the filibuster of the nomination of Judge Barbara Keenan of \nVirginia to the Fourth Circuit who was ultimately confirmed 99-0? And \nhow else do you explain the needless stalling and obstruction of Judge \nDenny Chin of New York to the Second Circuit, who was filibustered for \nfour months before he was confirmed 98-0?\n  Three of the five circuit court judges finally confirmed this year \nafter months of unnecessary delays and a filibuster should have been \nconfirmed last year. The other two circuit court nominees confirmed \nthis year were both subjected to stalling and a partisan filibuster by \nSenate Republicans. This was the case even though these circuit \nnominees had strong bipartisan support. We needed to overcome a \nfilibuster to confirm Justice Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona to the Ninth \nCircuit despite the strong support of his home state Senators, \nRepublicans Jon Kyl and John McCain. The Majority Leader had to file \ncloture to secure an up-or-down vote on Paul Watford of California to \nthe Ninth Circuit despite his sterling credentials and bipartisan \nsupport. The year started with the Majority Leader having to file \ncloture to get an up-or-down vote on Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida \nto the Eleventh Circuit even though he was strongly supported by his \nRepublican home state Senator. Every single one of these nominees for \nwhom the Majority Leader was forced to file cloture was rated \nunanimously well qualified by the nonpartisan ABA Standing Committee on \nthe Federal Judiciary, the highest possible rating. And every one of \nthem was nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy.\n  In June, Senate Republicans confirmed that they shut down the \nconfirmation process for qualified and consensus circuit court \nnominees. They are now filibustering Judge Patty Shwartz of New Jersey \nwho is nominated to the Third Circuit and Richard Taranto who is \nnominated to the Federal Circuit. In addition, they are filibustering \ntwo circuit court nominees who have the support of both their home \nstate Republican Senators: William Kayatta of Maine to the First \nCircuit and Judge Robert Bacharach of Oklahoma to the Tenth Circuit. \nThis is almost unprecedented.\n  During the past five presidential election years, Senate Democrats \nhave never denied an up-or-down vote to any circuit court nominee of a \nRepublican President who received bipartisan support in the Judiciary \nCommittee. In fact, during the last 20 years, only four circuit \nnominees reported with bipartisan support have been denied an up-or-\ndown vote by the Senate and all four were nominated by President \nClinton and blocked by Senate Republicans. While Senate Democrats have \nbeen willing to work with Republican presidents to confirm circuit \ncourt nominees with bipartisan support, Senate Republicans have \nrepeatedly obstructed the nominees of Democratic presidents. In the \nprevious five presidential election years, a total of 13 circuit court \nnominees have been confirmed after June 1. Not surprisingly, 12 of the \n13 were Republican nominees. Clearly, this is not tit-for-tat as some \ncontend but, rather, a one-way street in favor of Republican \npresidents' nominees.\n  This entire year, the Senate has yet to vote on a single circuit \ncourt nominee who was nominated by President Obama this year. Since \n1980, the only presidential election year in which there were no \ncircuit nominees confirmed who was nominated that year was in 1996, \nwhen Senate Republicans shut down the process against President \nClinton's circuit nominees.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has confirmed in its \nreports that judicial nominees continue to be confirmed in presidential \nelection years--except it seems when there is a Democratic President. \nIn five of the last eight presidential election years, the Senate has \nconfirmed at least 22 circuit and district court nominees after May 31. \nThe notable exceptions were during the last years of President \nClinton's two terms in 1996 and 2000 when Senate Republicans would not\n\n[[Page S5246]]\n\nallow confirmations to continue. The third exception was in 1988, at \nthe end of President Reagan's presidency, but that was because \nvacancies were at 28. In comparison, vacancies at the end of the \nClinton years stood at 75 at the end of 1996 and 67 at the end of 2000. \nOtherwise, it has been the rule rather than the exception. So, for \nexample, according to CRS the Senate confirmed 32 nominees in 1980; 28 \nin 1984; 31 in 1992; 28 in 2004 at the end of President George W. \nBush's first term; and 22 after May 31 in 2008 at the end of President \nBush's second term. So far this year only 7 judicial nominees have been \nallowed to be confirmed.\n  It is ironic that certain Senate Republicans are now arguing in \nsupport of a distorted version of the Thurmond Rule, as if it had the \nforce of law. After all, it is Senate Republicans who have repeatedly \nasserted that the Thurmond Rule does not exist. For example, on July \n14, 2008, the Senate Republican caucus held a hearing solely dedicated \nto arguing that the Thurmond Rule does not exist. At that hearing, the \nsenior Senator from Kentucky stated: ``I think it's clear that there is \nno Thurmond Rule. And I think the facts demonstrate that.'' Similarly, \nthe Senator from Iowa, my friend who is now serving as Ranking Member \nof the Judiciary Committee, stated that the Thurmond Rule was in his \nview ``plain bunk.'' He said: ``The reality is that the Senate has \nnever stopped confirming judicial nominees during the last few months \nof a president's term.'' We did not in 2008 when we proceeded to \nconfirm 22 nominees over the second half of that year. That Senate \nRepublicans have objected to voting on the nomination of Judge Shipp is \na distortion of the Thurmond rule and shows the depths to which they \nhave gone.\n  There is no good reason that the Senate should not vote on consensus \nnominees like Judge Shipp and more than a dozen other consensus \njudicial nominees to fill Federal trial court vacancies in Iowa, \nCalifornia, Utah, Connecticut, Maryland, Florida, Oklahoma, Michigan, \nNew York and Pennsylvania. There is no good reason the Senate should \nnot vote on the nominations of William Kayatta of Maine to the First \nCircuit, Judge Robert Bacharach of Oklahoma to the Tenth Circuit, \nRichard Taranto to the Federal Circuit and for that matter Judge Patty \nShwartz of New Jersey to the Third Circuit, who is supported by New \nJersey's Republican Governor. Each of these circuit court nominees has \nbeen rated unanimously well qualified by the nonpartisan ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary, the highest possible rating. These \nshould not be controversial nominees. They are qualified and should be \nconsidered as consensus nominees and confirmed.\n  Senate Republicans are blocking consent to vote on superbly qualified \ncircuit court nominees with strong bipartisan support. This is a new \nand damaging application of the Thurmond rule.\n  The fact that Republican stalling tactics have meant that circuit \ncourt nominees that should have been confirmed in the spring--like Bill \nKayatta, Richard Taranto and Patty Shwartz--are still awaiting a vote \nis no excuse for not moving forward this month to confirm these circuit \nnominees.\n  In an article dated July 16, 2012 entitled ``William Kayatta and the \nNeedless Destruction of the Thurmond Rule,'' Andrew Cohen of the \nAtlantic states:\n\n       In a more prudent and practical era in Senate history, \n     nominees like Kayatta would have been confirmed in days . . . \n     Now even slam-dunk candidates like Kayatta linger in the \n     wings waiting for Senate ``consent'' long after the body \n     already has definitively ``advised'' the executive branch of \n     how great it thinks the nominee would be as a judge. Can you \n     imagine the uproar if the Senate ever used its filibuster \n     power to block the deployment of troops already endorsed by \n     the Armed Services Committee? Now please tell me the material \n     difference here. Surely, the judiciary needs judges as much \n     as the army needs soldiers.\n\n  I agree. We have outstanding nominees with the support of both \nRepublican home State senators. Yet, we cannot vote on these nominees \nbecause Senate Republicans want to place politics over the needs of the \nAmerican people.\n  The Los Angeles Times recently published an editorial entitled \n``Reject the `Thurmond Rule' '' which concluded ``the administration of \njustice shouldn't be held hostage to partisan politics even in an \nelection year.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of the July 12 and 16 articles be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. As both Chairman and Ranking Member of the Judiciary \nCommittee during the last several years, I have worked with Senate \nRepublicans to consider judicial nominees well into presidential \nelection years, I have made earnest efforts to make the confirmation \nprocess more transparent and fair, I have ensured that the President \nconsults with home state Senators before submitting a nominee, and I \nhave opened up the blue slip process to prevent abuses while continuing \nto respect it.\n  In the last two presidential election years, we were able to bring \nthe number of judicial vacancies down to the lowest levels in the past \n20 years. In 2004 at end of President Bush's first term, vacancies were \nreduced to 28 not the 77 we have today. In 2008, in the last year of \nPresident Bush's second term, we again worked to fill vacancies and got \nthem down to 34, less than half of what they are today. In 2004, 25 \nnominees were confirmed between June and the presidential election, and \nin 2008, 22 nominees were confirmed between June and the presidential \nelection.\n  In 2004, a Presidential election year, the Senate confirmed five \ncircuit court nominees of a Republican President that had been reported \nby the Committee that year. This year we have confirmed only two \ncircuit court nominees that have been reported by the Committee this \nyear, and both were filibustered. By this date in 2004 the Senate had \nalready confirmed 32 of President Bush's circuit court nominees, and we \nconfirmed another three that year for a total of 35 circuit court \nnominees in his first term. So far, the Senate has only been allowed to \nconsider and confirm 30 of President Obama's circuit court nominees \nfive fewer, 17 percent fewer while higher numbers of vacancies remain, \nand yet the Senate Republican leadership wants to artificially shut \ndown nominations for no good reason.\n  As Chairman of this Committee, I have also assiduously protected the \nrights of the minority in the judicial nomination process. I have only \nproceeded with judicial nominations supported by both home state \nSenators. That has meant that we are not able to proceed on current \nnominees from Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Louisiana. I even stopped \nproceedings on a circuit court nominee from Kansas when the Kansas \nRepublican Senators reversed themselves and withdrew their support for \nthe nominee. Nor did I accede to the Majority Leader's request to push \na Nevada nominee through Committee who did not have the blue slip of \nthe state's Republican Senator. In stark contrast, it was Senate \nRepublicans and the Republican chairman who blatantly disregarded \nSenate Judiciary procedure by proceeding with nominations despite the \nobjection of both home state Senators. And I have been consistent. I \nhold hearings at the same pace and under the same procedures whether \nthe President nominating is a Democrat or a Republican. Others cannot \nsay that. So those have been my rules respect for minority rights, \ntransparency, deference to home state Senators, consistent application \nof policies and practices, and allowing for confirmations well into \npresidential election years for nominees with bipartisan support.\n  Personal attacks on me do nothing to help the American people who are \nseeking justice in our Federal courts. I am willing to defend my record \nbut that is beside the point. The harm to the American people is what \nmatters. What the American people and the overburdened Federal courts \nneed are qualified judges to administer justice in our Federal courts, \nnot the perpetuation of extended, numerous vacancies.\n  The judicial vacancy rate remains almost twice what it was at this \npoint in the first term of President Bush. I wish Senate Republicans \nwould think more about our responsibilities to the American people than \nsome warped sense of partisan score settling. Vacancies have been near \nor above 80 for three years. Nearly one out of every 11 Federal courts \nis currently vacant. Their shutting down confirmations for consensus\n\n[[Page S5247]]\n\nand qualified judicial nominees is not helping the overburdened courts \nwho cannot administer justice in an expedient fashion. It is not \nhelping owners of small businesses.\n  Last week, after his nomination was reported with near unanimous \nvoice vote by the Judiciary Committee approximately three months ago, \nthe Senate was finally able to confirm Judge Kevin McNulty to the \nDistrict of New Jersey. Despite vacancies still remaining near or above \n80, Senate Republicans continue to obstruct and stall nominees on the \nSenate floor for no good reason. We could easily have confirmed both \nJudges Shipp and McNulty together three months ago. It is this type of \nacross-the-board obstruction of judicial nominees by Senate Republicans \nthat has contributed to the judicial vacancy crisis in our Federal \ncourts.\n  Last week, I spoke about the novel excuses that some Senate \nRepublicans have concocted for refusing to allow for votes on nominees. \nOne excuse was that having confirmed two Supreme Court justices, the \nSenate cannot be expected to reach the 205 number of confirmations in \nPresident Bush's first term. Work on two Supreme Court nominations did \nnot stop the Senate from working to confirm 200 of President Clinton's \ncircuit and district nominees in his first term. Similarly, there were \ntwo Supreme Court confirmations in President George H.W. Bush's term, \nand that did not prevent Senate Democrats who were in the Senate \nmajority from confirming 192 of his circuit and district nominees, \nincluding 66 in the election year of 1992 alone.\n  Last week we heard another self-serving misconception of more recent \nhistory from the Republican side of the aisle. They claimed that \nDemocrats were responsible for growing judicial vacancies in 2008. The \ncharge was as follows: ``[A]t the beginning of 2008 there were 43 \nvacancies. So the practice for Democrats who controlled the Senate \nduring that last year of President Bush's term was to allow vacancies \nto increase by more than 37 percent.'' In fact, what we did in 2008 was \nto reduce vacancies back down to 34 in October 2008 when the Senate \nrecessed for the year. The increase in vacancies after October and \nthrough the remainder of 2008 was not because Senate Democrats were \nobstructing Senate votes on qualified judicial nominees with bipartisan \nsupport as Senate Republicans are today. In November and December 2008 \nthe Senate met on a few days only to address the financial crisis. \nThere were no nominations pending on the Calendar after the election in \n2008. Their charge is fallacious. Judicial vacancies have not been as \nlow as 34 or 43 or even the 55 that they stood at when President Obama \ntook office for years. Due to Republican obstruction, President Obama \nwill be the first President in 20 years to complete his first term with \nmore judicial vacancies than when he took office.\n  Last week Senate Republicans also contended that they have no \nresponsibility for the lack of progress in 2009. In fact, that year \nended with 10 judicial confirmations stalled by Senate Republicans. The \nobstructionist tactics they employed from the outset of the Obama \nadministration had led to the lowest number of judicial confirmations \nin more than 50 years. Only 12 of President Obama's judicial \nnominations to Federal circuit and district courts were confirmed that \nwhole year. The 12 were less than half of what we achieved during \nPresident Bush's first tumultuous year. In the second half of 2001, a \nDemocratic Senate majority proceeded to confirm 28 judges. Despite the \nfact that President Obama began nominating judicial nominees two months \nearlier than President Bush, Senate Republicans delayed and obstructed \nthem to yield an historic low in confirmations. Republicans refused to \nagree to the consideration of qualified, noncontroversial nominees for \nweeks and months. And as the Senate recessed in December, only three of \nthe available 13 judicial nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar \nwere allowed to be considered.\n  By contrast, in December 2001, the first year of President Bush's \nadministration, Senate Democrats proceeded to confirm 10 of his \njudicial nominees. At the end of the Senate's 2001 session, only four \njudicial nominations were left on the Senate Executive Calendar, all of \nwhich were confirmed soon after the Senate returned in 2002. By \ncontrast, it took until May 2011, a year and a half later, to complete \naction on the judicial nominees who should have been confirmed in \nDecember 2009 but had to be renominated. Although noncontroversial, \nseveral were further delayed by filibusters before being confirmed \nunanimously. The lack of Senate action on those 10 judicial nominees in \n2009 was attributable to Senate Republicans and no one else. Despite \nthe fact that President Obama reached across the aisle to consult with \nRepublican Senators, he was rewarded with obstruction from the outset \nof his administration. While President Obama moved beyond the judicial \nnominations battles of the past and reached out to work with \nRepublicans and make mainstream nominations, Senate Republicans \ncontinued their tactics of delay.\n  For Senate Republicans to claim that ``only 13 [sic] judges were \nconfirmed during President Obama's first year'' because of ``decisions \nmade by the Senate Democratic leadership'' and that it was ``the choice \nof Democrats'' and ``not because of anything the Republican minority \ncould do'' is ludicrous. Senate Democrats had cleared for confirmation \nthe other 10 judicial nominees stalled by Republicans in 2009. Their \nassertion ignores the facts and the truth. Just as they cannot escape \nresponsibility for their unwillingness to move forward with the 21 \njudicial nominees ready for a final up-or down vote now before the end \nof this year, they cannot escape responsibility for what they did in \n2009.\n  Senate Republicans choose to offer weak excuses and blame everyone \nbut themselves for the delays and obstruction in which they have \nexcelled. Their sense of being justified by some view of tit-for-tat is \ndistorted and should be beside the point while vacancies remain so high \nthat the American people and our courts are overburdened. The way \nSenate Democrats helped reduce vacancies was not by limiting \nconfirmations to one nominee per week, as Senate Republicans have. In \nSeptember 2008, with Democrats in the majority, the Senate confirmed 10 \nof President Bush's nominees in a single day, all by voice vote. There \nwere 10 consensus nominees pending on the Senate floor, and we \nconfirmed all of them in minutes. Likewise, in 2002, Senate Democrats \njoined in confirming 18 of President Bush's nominees in a single day, \nagain by voice vote. I wish Senate Republicans would duplicate that \nprecedent and help clear the logjam of judicial nominees dating back to \nMarch who are still awaiting up-or-down votes.\n  While I am pleased that we will confirm Judge Shipp today, I wish \nthat Senate Republicans would help us confirm the 20 additional \njudicial nominees who can be confirmed right now. Then we could make \nreal progress in giving our courts the judges they need to provide \njustice for the American people, just as we did in 1992, 2004 and 2008.\n  After today's vote, I hope Senate Republicans will reconsider their \nill-conceived partisan strategy and work with us to meet the needs of \nthe American people. With more than 75 judicial vacancies still \nburdening the American people and our Federal courts, there is no \njustification for not proceeding to confirm the judicial nominees \nreported with bipartisan support by the Judiciary Committee this year.\n  Each day that Senate Republicans refuse because of their political \nagenda to confirm these qualified judicial nominees who have been \nreviewed and voted on by the Judiciary Committee is another day that a \njudge could have been working to administer justice. Every week lost is \nanother in which injured plaintiffs are having to wait to recover the \ncosts of medical expenses, lost wages, or other damages from \nwrongdoing. Every month is another drag on the economy as small \nbusiness owners have to wait to have their contract disputes resolved. \nHardworking and hard-pressed Americans should not have to wait years to \nhave their cases decided. Just as it is with the economy and with jobs, \nthe American people do not want to hear excuses about why Republicans \nin Congress will not help them. So let us do more to help the American \npeople.\n\n[[Page S5248]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 [From theatlantic.com, July 16, 2012]\n\n   William Kayatta and the Needless Destruction of the Thurmond Rule\n\n                           (By Andrew Cohen)\n\n\nWhy do Republican leaders still play along with an informal Senate rule \n  that prevents up-or-down votes on even those judges who have strong \n                          Republican support?\n\n       Meet William Kayatta, another one of America's earnest, \n     capable judges-in-waiting. Widely respected in his home state \n     of Maine, nominated by President Obama in January to fill a \n     vacancy on the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, eagerly \n     endorsed by both of Maine's Republican senators, passed for \n     confirmation to the Senate floor by an easy voice vote in the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee, Kayatta's nomination instead has \n     become yet another victim of the Senate GOP's suicidal \n     tendencies.\n       The litigants of the 1st Circuit need Kayatta. There are no \n     serious arguments against him. Yet the Republican leadership \n     in the Senate has blocked a vote on the merits of his \n     nomination in obedience to the so-called ``Thurmond Rule,'' \n     an informal practice as self-destructive as was its namesake. \n     The Thurmond Rule is typically invoked by the opposition \n     party in a presidential election year to preclude substantive \n     votes on federal judicial appointments within six months of \n     Election Day. It is the Senate's version of a sit-down \n     strike.\n       In April, just after the Judiciary Committee favorably \n     passed along Kayatta's nomination to the Senate floor for \n     confirmation, Maine's junior senator, Susan Collins, had \n     wonderful things to say about the nominee:\n       Bill is an attorney of exceptional intelligence, extensive \n     experience, and demonstrated integrity, who is very highly \n     respected in the Maine legal community. Bill's impressive \n     background makes him eminently qualified for a seat on the \n     First Circuit. His thirty-plus years of real world litigation \n     experience would bring a much-needed perspective to the \n     court. Maine has a long proud history of supplying superb \n     jurists to the federal bench. I know that, if confirmed, Mr. \n     Kayatta will continue in that tradition. I urge the full \n     Senate to approve his nomination as soon as possible.\n       And how did her fellow Republicans respond to her request? \n     They blew her off. There has been no vote on Kayatta's \n     nomination and none is scheduled. Instead, last month, Sen. \n     Mitch McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader, invoked the \n     ``Thurmond rule'' to block floor consideration of \n     appointment--as well as up-or-down votes on the rest of \n     President Obama's federal appellate nominees (This in turn, \n     initially prompted Sen. Collins to blame the Obama \n     Administration for going too slow in nominating Kayatta in \n     the first place.)\n       In theory, the Thurmond Rule is something official \n     Washington defends as the price of divided government. In \n     reality, it's another outrageous example of how the Senate \n     has re-written the Constitution by filibuster. In practice, \n     in the Kayatta case and many more, the Thurmond rule is the \n     antithesis of good governance. Your Senate today perpetuates \n     a frivolous rule which, for the most cynical political \n     reasons, blocks qualified people from serving their nation. \n     It's not misfeasance. It's malfeasance.\n       Just because Strom Thurmond was willing to jump the Senate \n     off the bridge doesn't mean that today's Senate Republican \n     leaders had to do likewise.\n       In a more prudent and practical era in Senate history, \n     nominees like Kayatta would have been confirmed in days. \n     Fifty years ago, for example, when another bright Democratic \n     appointee with strong Republican support came to the Senate \n     seeking a judgeship, the Judiciary Committee took all of 11 \n     minutes before it endorsed him. Byron ``Whizzer'' White then \n     served the next 31 years as an associate justice of the \n     United States Supreme Court. That's wholly unthinkable \n     today--even with lower federal court nominees.\n       Now even slam-dunk candidates like Kayatta linger in the \n     wings waiting for Senate ``consent'' long after the body \n     already has definitively ``advised'' the executive branch of \n     how great it thinks the nominee would be as a judge. Can you \n     imagine the uproar if the Senate ever used its filibuster \n     power to block the deployment of troops already endorsed by \n     the Armed Services Committee? Now please tell me the material \n     difference here. Surely, the judiciary needs judges as much \n     as the army needs soldiers.\n       There are currently 76 judicial vacancies around the \n     country. There are 31 districts and circuits designated as \n     ``judicial emergencies'' because vacancies there have \n     lingered so long. In the 10th Circuit, what's happening to \n     Kayatta is happening to Robert Bacharach, who has the support \n     of Oklahoma's two Republican senators. The Senate also is \n     blocking Richard Taranto from a Federal Circuit spot even \n     though he breezed through the Judiciary Committee and has \n     been endorsed by Robert Bork and Paul Clement. The same goes \n     for Patty Shwartz in the 3rd Circuit.\n       This is unacceptable on every level. When we talk about \n     ``false equivalence'' in modern politics the business of \n     these judges should be the lede. These nominations require no \n     great policy choices on the part of Congress. They don't come \n     with thousands of pages of ambiguous legalese disguised as \n     the language of a federal statute. There is no room for spin. \n     These nominees are either qualified, or they aren't, and when \n     they sail out of the Judiciary Committee with voice votes no \n     one can plausibly say they aren't qualified.\n       And yet here we are. It would be convenient to blame Strom \n     Thurmond, one of the most divisive politicians of the 20th \n     century, for one of the Senate's most divisive rules. But \n     Thurmond is long gone. And there was never anything about his \n     rule that demanded it be followed, session after session, \n     under both Democratic and Republican control. Just because \n     Strom Thurmond was willing to jump the Senate off the bridge, \n     in other words, doesn't mean that today's Senate Republican \n     leaders had to do likewise. But they have.\n       America has trouble enough today without a senseless Senate \n     rule that blocks highly skilled, highly competent public \n     servants from joining government. The nation's litigants in \n     federal court, burdened by judicial vacancies, already are \n     waiting long enough to have their corporate disputes decided. \n     This isn't gridlock. This is destruction. ``I think it's \n     stupid'' to block good judges from confirmation, Sen. Tom \n     Coburn said earlier this year. For once, he is right. And \n     Sen. Collins? Even she's come around. ``I have urged my \n     colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give Bill the direct \n     vote by the full Senate that he deserves,'' she said late \n     last month. Amen to that.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, July 12, 2012]\n\n                      Reject the ``Thurmond Rule''\n\n\n  Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell invokes the legacy of Strom \nThurmond to hold up judicial confirmations--It's bad for judges and bad \n                              for justice\n\n       The late Strom Thurmond is best known for his 48 years in \n     the U.S. Senate representing South Carolina, his \n     segregationist candidacy for the presidency in 1948 and the \n     fact that even though he was a longtime opponent of racial \n     equality, he fathered a child with a black teenage \n     housekeeper. But Thurmond also lent his name to the so-called \n     Thurmond Rule, according to which Senate action on judicial \n     confirmations is supposed to stop several months before a \n     presidential election.\n       The rule--actually a custom that sometimes has been honored \n     in the breach--goes back to 1968, when Thurmond and other \n     Republicans held up action on President Johnson's nomination \n     of Abe Fortas to be chief justice of the United States. \n     Fortas withdrew in the face of a filibuster, and President \n     Nixon, the Republican victor in the 1968 election, was able \n     to choose a successor to the retiring Earl Warren. In \n     subsequent years, senators of both parties have cited the \n     Thurmond/Fortas episode as a precedent for not acting on \n     judicial nominations close to an election.\n       Even in the case of a Supreme Court appointment, the \n     Thurmond Rule violates the spirit of the Constitution, which \n     doesn't distinguish between nominations made earlier or later \n     in a president's term. It is less defensible still in \n     connection with nominations to lower courts. Yet Senate \n     Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told colleagues last \n     month that he was immediately invoking the rule to end \n     nominations to the U.S. Court of Appeals, and would block \n     confirmation votes on nominees to federal district courts \n     after September.\n       Such delays are a disservice to the nominees and to an \n     overburdened federal judiciary. At present there are 12 \n     vacancies on federal appeals courts, 63 on district courts \n     and two on the U.S. Court of International Trade. The Obama \n     administration, although it has been slow to fill vacancies, \n     currently is proposing seven candidates for the appeals court \n     and 28 for the district courts. The Senate should hold up-or-\n     down votes on these nominations and any others put forward in \n     the near future.\n       Apart from the Thurmond Rule, the timely confirmation of \n     judicial nominees has long been frustrated by petty \n     partisanship. Democrats and Republicans share the blame. The \n     most recent logjam was broken in March when Republicans \n     agreed to timely votes on 14 nominations.\n       Obviously Republicans hope that Barack Obama is a lame-duck \n     president, but even lame-ducks are entitled to expeditious \n     consideration of their nominations. And the administration of \n     justice shouldn't be held hostage to partisan politics even \n     in an election year.\n\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from New Jersey \non the floor. If he seeks the floor, I will yield to him; otherwise, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee who always has things of relevance to talk to us about and he \nhas done that again today and we thank the chairman.\n\n\n                         Shooting in Aurora, CO\n\n  Mr. President, I do plan on talking about a confirmation vote coming \nup\n\n[[Page S5249]]\n\non the floor, but one can't address the public at-large on this day, so \nsoon after a tragedy of enormous proportion, without taking just a few \nmoments to discuss the events that took place in Aurora, CO, last \nFriday. The question arises: What do we do besides weep with these \npeople? What do we do besides feel sad and see a gloom hanging over our \ncountry? What do we do about this? What do we want to do to prevent it \nin the future? That will be the test of the general character of this \nbody and others in government.\n  So many promising young lives were lost, changed forever. We see \npictures of those who lost a loved one in our newspapers. It is \nheartbreaking just to look at those pictures. What I sense from my \nvisits around New Jersey today and over the weekend is a certain \nkinship one feels with the people who are mourning the loss of a \nchild--an 8-year-old--or a daughter or son, husband or wife. One feels \na certain kinship. One can feel the sadness and it is depressing, and \nit is not the kind of characterization we would like to see for the \nUnited States and the young lives lost forever.\n  But our duty in this body is not simply to mourn and offer our \ncondolences. We want to do that. We want those families who lost \nsomeone to understand that we, in some strange way, join them in their \nmourning, but the best way to prove our sadness, the best way to prove \nwe care is to take action to protect young, innocent lives. On that \nscore, we don't rank very high.\n  I remember so clearly the time in 1999 the pictures of young people \nat a high school, hanging out the window, imploring for help, imploring \nto be saved, heartbroken at what they were seeing and what they were \nfeeling. So we have to do something more.\n  The gun laws on the books are outdated, and we even have let key \nprotections expire. It is tragic. In the coming days, I am sure, some \nof my colleagues and I will be discussing specific measures, \ncommonsense measures, because when it comes to our gun laws, we need to \nact before another outburst of gun violence overtakes us with the \nterrible consequences that brings.\n  Around here we have opportunities to do great things, and I have one \nof those, I believe, today--an opportunity that I take with great \npleasure--to come to the floor to strongly endorse Judge Michael Shipp \nfor a position on the U.S. District Court for the District of New \nJersey.\n  Judge Shipp brings an impressive background to the bench. To start, \nhe was born in Paterson, NJ, as was I. It is a city of significant \npoverty and difficulty, but he rose from humble beginnings in Paterson \nto graduate from Rutgers University and Seton Hall Law School, two of \nNew Jersey's fine educational institutions.\n  Judge Shipp has dedicated his career to our justice system, and he \nspent much of it in public service. I learned so much about him in my \nmeeting with him. Not only does he bring a sincerity about wanting to \ndo what is right, but he has the knowledge and the sensitivity that \nwill make him a terrific district court judge.\n  He began his career as a law clerk to a New Jersey Supreme Court \njustice, James H. Coleman, Jr. He then served in the office of New \nJersey's attorney general, where he developed not only a thorough legal \nexpertise but also real leadership acumen. As counsel to the attorney \ngeneral, he oversaw 10,000 employees, including 800 attorneys. For more \nthan a decade, Judge Shipp has taught our State's students as an \nadjunct law professor at Seton Hall University.\n  Since 2007, he has served our city and our Nation as a U.S. \nmagistrate judge in the district court. In this capacity, he has \nconducted proceedings in both civil and criminal cases and has included \nrulings on motions, issuing recommendations to district court judges, \nand performing district court judge duties in cases with magistrate \njurisdiction. With this experience, Judge Shipp is going to be well \nprepared to serve on the district court.\n  The law, our constitution, are the greatest denominators of our \ndemocracy, and the judges are the faithful stewards to protect these \nprecious guidelines of our society. That is why, as a Senator, I \nconsider it a sacred duty, given by the Constitution, to carefully \nselect judicial nominees and to provide the President with advice and \nconsent.\n  Our faith in the legal system depends on the just application of the \nlaw as it is soundly written law. Judge Shipp has served New Jersey \nextraordinarily well, he is eminently qualified, and his broad \nexperience will prepare him well for his new role. I have no doubt he \nwill continue his excellence as a judge on the U.S. district court.\n  The success of our democracy depends on all our citizens receiving \nequal and just representation before the law. As leaders in our \njudicial system, judges hold that equality and justice in their hands. \nIt means they must be fair-minded, honorable, and humble. I am \nconfident Judge Shipp is going to make a terrific judge. He is highly \nqualified to meet this challenge, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthis confirmation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for 4 minutes; that following my 4 minutes, the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, the ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, be recognized for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the \nnomination of Judge Michael Shipp for the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of New Jersey.\n  All of us in New Jersey, everyone who has dealt with him, everyone \nwho knows him is very familiar with Judge Shipp's strong qualifications \nand reputation for excellence. He is an exceptional candidate for the \nFederal bench--an accomplished jurist with impressive credentials.\n  I recommended Judge Shipp to President Obama, and I urge all my \ncolleagues in the Senate to support his nomination, as the Judiciary \nCommittee did.\n  With almost 5 years' experience as a Federal magistrate judge for the \nDistrict of New Jersey, he is well prepared to assume a seat as a \nFederal district judge. As a magistrate, he has successfully managed \nsignificant and complex cases. On occasion, he has served as the \ndistrict court judge in cases with magistrate jurisdiction.\n  The first 8 years of his distinguished legal career were spent in the \nlitigation department at the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher \n& Flom. In 2003, he turned to public service to give something back to \nthe community as an assistant attorney general for consumer protection \nin the Office of the Attorney General of New Jersey, where he honed his \nexpertise in consumer fraud, insurance fraud, and securities fraud \ncases.\n  Judge Shipp clearly excelled. He was twice promoted within the \noffice, first as a liaison to the attorney general and second as \ncounsel to the attorney general. As counsel, he was in charge, in \nessence, of day-to-day operations of the Department of Law and Public \nSafety, a department with over 10,000 employees and 800 attorneys.\n  An accomplished jurist, an experienced prosecutor, a dedicated public \nservant, and an effective administrator and manager as well, that is \nMichael Shipp. It is what all of us in New Jersey have known him to be.\n  Judge Shipp has not stayed on the sidelines. Even with a full plate, \nhe has been deeply involved in the legal community in helping address \nthe profession's needs and concerns. He held a leadership role with the \nNew Jersey State Bar Association and is actively involved with the \nGarden State Bar Association, which is the association of African-\nAmerican lawyers.\n  As a faculty member of Seton Hall University's School of Law's Summer \nInstitute for Pre-Legal Studies, he helped disadvantaged students \ndevelop their interest in the law, and he served on the faculty of the \nNew Jersey Attorney General's Advocacy Institute, which ensures that \nattorneys representing the State of New Jersey maintain the highest \npossible levels of professionalism.\n  Judge Shipp is also a very proud New Jerseyan--part of the \ncommunity--with deep roots in the State. A native of Paterson, he grew \nup and has lived in New Jersey all his life. He earned his degrees from \nRutgers, the State university, and Seton Hall University School of Law. \nAfter graduating, he\n\n[[Page S5250]]\n\nwent on to clerk for the Honorable James Coleman, a former justice on \nthe New Jersey Supreme Court.\n  To put it simply, Michael Shipp will be an extraordinary district \ncourt judge for the District of New Jersey. He is a man of honor, \nprinciple, and he possesses an excellent judicial temperament, has \nextraordinary legal experience, and a deep and abiding commitment to \nthe rule of law.\n  I have full confidence he will serve the people of New Jersey and the \ncountry with all the dignity, fairness, and honor he has shown \nthroughout his extraordinary career. We are lucky to have a nominee of \nhis caliber, and I wholeheartedly urge the full Senate to vote to \nconfirm Judge Shipp to the District of New Jersey.\n  I am thrilled we are actually going to do a confirmation vote and not \na cloture vote and I appreciate those who made that possible.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                       Recognizing Taylor Morris\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, when my colleagues come over to vote, I \nhope they will take note of a constituent of mine and wish him well.\n  Taylor Morris, a Navy wounded person from Afghanistan, who is an \nexplosives expert, lost parts of four limbs. He is at the bottom of the \nescalator as you go to the subway. He is one of our wounded heroes, and \nI would like to have my colleagues recognize him.\n\n\n                       Aurora, Colorado Shootings\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it was a very sad weekend and will be \nfor a long period of time in Aurora, CO. I heard the remarks of the \nmajority and minority leaders today expressing condolence for the \nvictims and their families. I wish to associate myself with those \nremarks and offer my condolences to all the people of Aurora but \nparticularly to those who have deceased family members and those who \nare hospitalized because of this tragic event that happened there.\n  Mr. President, I support the nomination of Michael A. Shipp to be \nU.S. district judge for the District of New Jersey, currently serving \nas a U.S. magistrate and coming out of committee on voice vote. I am \nnot aware of any controversy regarding this nominee, and I expect he \nwill be confirmed with an overwhelming vote.\n  There has been a bit of discussion regarding whether the cloture vote \nthat had been scheduled on today's nominee was some sort of escalation \nof Presidential election politics or an indication of a partisan fight \nover judicial confirmations. Those are raised as speculation or \nmisreading what is happening in the Senate. The fact is that the \ncloture vote, which is now vitiated, had nothing to do with the \njudicial confirmation process in general or this nominee in particular.\n  There is, unfortunately, an element of partisan gridlock that is \naffecting this nomination, but it is not because of a Republican desire \nto block this nominee or to shut down the Senate floor. Republicans, in \nfact, have been demanding more access to the Senate floor. That \ngridlock is the majority leader's tactics to block amendments on the \nSenate floor.\n  Time after time the majority uses parliamentary procedure to prohibit \namendments, block votes, and deny or limit debate. For example, last \nThursday the Republican leader asked the majority leader if the \nanticipated business coming before the Senate, the Stabenow-Obama \ncampaign tax bill, would be open for amendment. The majority leader \nresponded that would be ``very doubtful.'' These actions, although they \nmay be permitted by Senate rules, are contrary to the spirit of the \nSenate.\n  Certainly we are far from being the world's greatest deliberative \nbody at this time. So when a Senator who seeks a vote on his amendment \nis stymied time after time, it is not surprising that the Senator would \nuse Senator rules and procedures to bring pressure on the majority \nleader for a vote--in other words, to do exactly what the Senate was \nset up under the Constitution to do. There is a bit of sad irony that \nSenators who are facing obstructionism are the ones who are labeled \nobstructionist when they are persistent in trying to bring a matter to \na vote, which is customary in the Senate.\n  Unfortunately, we are now seeing this obstructionism strategy creep \ninto committee activity as well. Again, last Thursday the Judiciary \nCommittee marked up an important national security bill. The bill was \nopen to amendment but apparently only amendments the chairman agreed \nwith. In the Judiciary Committee, we have a longstanding practice of \nvoting up or down on difficult, controversial issues. What happened \nlast week undermined the responsibility of the committee to debate and \naddress important issues--in this case, national security. The \nJudiciary Committee is a forum for these debates.\n  The bill that was on the agenda is one of the few vehicles that will \nlikely be passed before the end of the year, so it was an important and \nappropriate vehicle for addressing such issues once the chairman opened \nthe amendment process by adopting his own substitute amendment. \nInstead, the partisan gridlock, driven by the majority leader's tactics \nto block amendments on the Senate floor, has now spread to the \ncommittee level with made-up germaneness rules and tabling motions \nforced on amendments, some of which had received bipartisan support \nfrom members of the Judiciary Committee in the past. The only \nconclusion that can be drawn is that the Senate majority leadership \nwants to protect its members at every step of the legislative process \nfrom having to make difficult votes, and the majority leadership will \nemploy any procedure it can to duck debates and to govern.\n  Even as we turn to the 154th nominee of this President to be \nconfirmed to the district or circuit courts, we continue to hear \nunsubstantiated charges of obstructionism. The fact is we have \nconfirmed over 78 percent of President Obama's district nominees. At \nthis point in his Presidency, 75 percent of President Bush's nominees \nhad been confirmed. President Obama, in other words, is running ahead \nof President Bush on district confirmations as a percentage.\n  I continue to hear some of my colleagues repeatedly ask the question: \nWhat is different about this President that he is to be treated \ndifferently than all of these other Presidents? I won't speculate as to \nany inference that might be intended by that question, but I can tell \nyou that this President is not being treated differently than previous \nPresidents. By any objective measure, this President has been treated \nfairly and consistently with past Senate practices.\n  As I stated, as a percentage of nominations, this President is \nrunning ahead of the previous President with regard to the number of \nconfirmations. Let me put that in perspective for my colleagues with an \napples-to-apples comparison. As I mentioned, we have confirmed 153 \ndistrict and circuit nominees of this President. We have also confirmed \ntwo Supreme Court nominees. Everyone understands that the Supreme Court \nnominations take a great deal of committee time. The last time the \nSenate confirmed two Supreme Court nominees was during President Bush's \nsecond term, and during that term the Senate confirmed a total of 119 \ndistrict and circuit court nominees. With Judge Shipp's confirmation \ntoday--which I support and which I think will be confirmed almost \nunanimously--we will have confirmed 35 more district and circuit court \nnominees for President Obama than we did for President Bush in similar \ncircumstances.\n  During the last Presidential election, 2008, the Senate confirmed a \ntotal of 28 judges--24 district and 4 circuit. This Presidential \nelection year we have already exceeded those numbers. We have confirmed \n5 circuit nominees, and this will be the 27th district judge confirmed.\n  Judge Shipp received his B.S. from Rutgers University in 1987 and his \nJ.D. from the Seton Hall University School of Law in 1994. Upon \ngraduation, he clerked for the Honorable James H. Colman, Jr., a \njustice on the Supreme Court of New Jersey. After his clerkship, Judge \nShipp joined Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP as a litigation \nassociate. There, he worked in general litigation matters, handling \nlabor and employment work. He also developed an expertise in mass tort \nlaw and products liability litigation.\n  In 2003, Judge Shipp became an assistant attorney general in charge \nof\n\n[[Page S5251]]\n\nconsumer protection with the Department of Law and Public Safety of New \nJersey. There, he managed five practice groups: consumer fraud \nprosecution, insurance fraud prosecution (civil), securities fraud \nprosecution, professional boards prosecution, and debt recovery. He \nsupervised approximately 80 deputy attorneys general. In 2005, he was \npromoted to the Attorney General's front office. There, he acted as an \nadvisor to the Attorney General on sensitive legal matters related to \nethics and appointments.\n  In 2007, Judge Shipp was appointed as a United States magistrate \njudge for the District of New Jersey. As a magistrate judge he presides \nover civil and criminal pre-trial proceedings. He also presides over \ncivil trials, with the consent of the parties. The ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary gave Judge Shipp a rating of \nsubstantial majority ``Qualified,'' minority ``Not Qualified.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to have 1 minute, then, too.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have no objection. In fact, I will give a courtesy to \nthe Senator from Iowa that he did not give to me, and I will be happy \nto yield 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Usually, Mr. President, it has been my experience that in \n37 years in this Senate, as the second most senior Member here, if a \nSenator wants to come and attack another Senator, they have the \ncourtesy of giving him notice before they do. I am sorry my friend from \nIowa didn't follow the normal courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for my 1 minute I will respond simply to \nthat by saying that I am talking about the institution of the Senate \nand not one single Senator personally.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield to no Member of this body in the \nfact that I uphold not only the rules but the courtesies of this \nSenate. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have never cut \noff a Member of the other party who wished to speak, unlike some of the \nprocedures they followed when they held the chair. I have never refused \nto have a Member of the other party bring up an amendment, contrary to \nthe procedures they followed when they chaired it.\n  I believe in the Senate. I believe in the rules of the Senate, but \nespecially I believe in the comity that Thomas Jefferson believed in, \nin this body; otherwise, the Senate would fall apart.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Michael A. Shipp, of New Jersey, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the District of New Jersey.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Begich), the \nSenator from California (Mrs. Boxer), the Senator from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Casey), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), and the Senator from \nColorado (Mr. Udall) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nColorado (Mr. Udall) would have voted ``yea.''\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. DeMint), the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch), \nand the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) \nwould have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

Madam President, I come before the Senate to recognize \nthe entrepreneurial spirit of Mr. Larry Corum of London, KY. After \nserving in the United States military for over 20 years, in 1990 he \nopened a printing business and now is the manager of the London-Corbin \nAirport. Both his economic leadership and steadfast service to Laurel \nCounty make him a valuable asset to the London community.\n  Born and raised in Clay County, KY, upon his graduation from high \nschool in 1958, Larry attended Sue Bennett College and Eastern Kentucky \nUniversity. After graduating from EKU in 1965, he joined the U.S. Air \nForce and became an officer. While in his first years of service, Larry \nmarried his wife, Lois. Throughout his 20-year military career, the \ncouple traveled around the country with their two children, Chris and \nGienah. Finally in 1989, he retired from the Air Force as a lieutenant \ncolonel and settled in London, KY.\n  In 1990, Larry opened an American Speedy Printing franchise in the \nLondon Shopping Center. After acquiring Durham Printing in 1998, the \nname of the company changed to Allegra Print and Imaging. In 2008, \nLarry left the business, entrusting his son, Chris, with running the \nday-to-day business operations, and became manager of the London-Corbin \nairport, which is the sixth-largest airport in the State of Kentucky.\n  Larry has served on many boards in the Laurel County area such as the \nAmerican Red Cross, the United Way, SCORE, the London-Corbin Airport, \nSaint Joseph-London, and the executive board of the Chamber of \nCommerce. His contribution to the London-Laurel County Chamber of \nCommerce stemmed from a desire to grow the community economically. \nThrough the Chamber of Commerce, Larry was able\n\n[[Page S5252]]\n\nto make an economic impact in London and improve the lives of his \nfellow Kentuckians.\n  Today, it is my honor to recognize Mr. Larry Corum for his \ncontribution to the Laurel County economy through his own small \nbusiness and his extensive service to the London-Laurel County Chamber \nof Commerce. His dedication to the community has made London, KY, an \nattractive area in which businesses can invest and grow. I ask my \ncolleagues in the U.S. Senate to join with me in celebrating Mr. Larry \nCorum's service to the greater Laurel County, KY, area.\n  A recent article published in the Chamber News, a publication of the \nLaurel County-area newspaper the Sentinel Echo, highlighted Mr. Corum's \naccomplishments. I ask unanimous consent that said article appear in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Chamber News: The Sentinel Echo, May 30, 2012]\n\n                    Board of Directors: Larry Corum\n\n       Larry Corum has served as manager of the London-Corbin \n     Airport since February 2008. The airport is the sixth-largest \n     and one of the busiest general aviation airports in the state \n     of Kentucky. It serves as one of the important gateways for \n     business and commerce to Laurel County and eastern Kentucky.\n       In 1990, Larry moved to Laurel County with his wife, Lois, \n     and children, Chris and Gienah. Seeing a business opportunity \n     and using his wife and sister for labor and as partners, he \n     opened an American Speedy Printing franchise in the London \n     Shopping Center. The business began to grow and was able to \n     move to a stand-alone building on South Main Street in 1994. \n     In 1998, a second building was acquired through the purchase \n     of Durham Printing and the business name was changed to \n     Allegra Print and Imaging. After completing college, both \n     Chris and Gienah joined Larry in the business. Larry \n     continued in the business until 2008, when he turned over the \n     operation to his son, Chris, who has added sign-making \n     capability. He now operates the business under the name of \n     Allegra Print Sign and Design.\n       Larry grew up in Clay County, graduating from Clay County \n     High School in 1958. He later attended Sue Bennett College \n     and Eastern Kentucky University, graduating from EKU in 1965. \n     Larry worked several jobs while completing his education, \n     including teaching school in Clay County, Cleveland, Ohio, \n     and Miami, Fla. In 1967, Larry joined the U.S. Air Force and \n     became an officer. He then married his wife, Lois, and they \n     began a grand adventure together traveling the world and \n     making a career. In 1969, Larry was awarded his wings, \n     assigned to an airplane in the strategic air command and \n     moved to a permanent military base. Over the next 20 years, \n     Larry served the Air Force as a flight crew member, flight \n     instructor, flight evaluator, and command evaluator in the \n     EC, KC, and RC-135 Aircraft. Larry, Lois, and their children \n     lived in or visited most all of the 50 states and many \n     foreign countries. Larry retired from the Air Force as a \n     lieutenant colonel and the commander of the 384th \n     Transportation Squadron, McConnell AFB, Wichita, Kan., in \n     1989.\n       Larry's involvement in the London-Laurel County Chamber of \n     Commerce began when he opened his business in London with a \n     ribbon cutting in 1990. He was later invited to join the \n     board of directors. In addition, he has served on the board \n     of the American Red Cross, the United Way of Laurel County, \n     SCORE, London-Corbin airport, Saint Joseph-London, and the \n     executive board of the Chamber. Larry is an active member, \n     Sunday school teacher, and deacon of the First Baptist Church \n     of London.\n       Larry believes that London and Laurel County is one of the \n     best places in America to bring up a family and grow a small \n     business. He feels that the Chamber can and will help with \n     growth and community improvement. He is proud to be a member \n     of this community and the London-Laurel County Chamber of \n     Commerce Executive Board.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/23/senate-section/article/S5252-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5252-S5253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER JEFFREY SMITH\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, today I rise in recognition of U.S. \nNavy CDR Jeffrey Smith, captain of the USS Kentucky. Commander Smith, a \nKentucky native, is the youngest commanding officer of an Ohio-class \nsubmarine. The commander has accomplished great feats in his naval \ncareer and he proudly represents the State of Kentucky with everything \nhe does. I know he is especially honored to command the ship that bears \nthe name of our beloved Commonwealth.\n  Commander Smith was born in Covington, KY, and moved to Independence, \nKY, shortly thereafter. Upon graduating from Simon Kenton High School, \nhe attended Xavier University and then transferred to the University of \nKentucky. In 1995, Commander Smith graduated with a degree in physics \nand was commissioned in the Navy, where he began nuclear power training \nin Florida.\n  His dedicated service to the U.S. Navy brought him to the post of \ncommanding officer of an Ohio-class submarine. The youngest man in his \nposition, Commander Smith leads both the Gold and Blue Teams and is \ncharged with overseeing the drills, maintenance, and day to day \noperations of the USS Kentucky.\n  Respected as a leader by his crew, Commander Smith also makes time to \nshare his love of his State, the namesake of the submarine, with his \nmen. After each announcement, it has become his trademark to lead the \nmen in a round of ``Go Big Blue'' cheers. A true Kentucky Wildcats fan, \nhe loves to talk University of Kentucky basketball and ``bracketology'' \nwith his men come NCAA Tournament time. By sharing some of these \nbeloved hallmarks of the Bluegrass State, Commander Smith not only \nshows his own pride in being a Kentuckian, but also provides his men a \nsense of attachment to the place for which their ship was named.\n  Commander Smith, besides being an avid UK Wildcats fan, enjoys \nreading, playing video games, and spending time with his four children. \nHe credits his interests and leadership capabilities to his education \nfrom the University of Kentucky. From physics and engineering courses \nwhich enable him to effectively operate the ship, to psychology courses \nwhich allow him to understand his men and their attitudes in different \nsituations, a diverse educational and experiential background allows \nCommander Smith to lead his men effectively.\n  It is my privilege today to recognize a Kentuckian who has truly \ndevoted his life to the service of this Nation. A rising star in the \nU.S. Navy, CDR Jeffrey Smith has committed himself to excellence and to \nproudly representing the State of Kentucky. I ask my colleagues in the \nU.S. Senate to join me in saluting U.S. Navy CDR Jeffrey Smith.\n  A recent publication by the University of Kentucky newspaper the \nKentucky Kernel highlighted the accomplishments of the Commander. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that said article appear in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      [From University of Kentucky, Kentucky Kernel, July 3, 2012]\n\n              USS Kentucky's Commander Is a Proud UK Alum\n\n                           (By Sarah Geegan)\n\n       There's just no telling where an education from the \n     University of Kentucky can take you.\n       For U.S. Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Smith, the journey that began \n     at UK has taken him around the world and deep below the \n     ocean's surface, as captain of the USS Kentucky, a nuclear \n     submarine.\n       ``Having been born in Kentucky and growing up there, I \n     can't imagine any pride greater than serving as commander of \n     the ship that bears my home state's name,'' says Smith, whose \n     parents and sister still live in Kentucky.\n       Born in Covington and raised in Independence, Smith \n     graduated from Simon Kenton High School and attended Xavier \n     University for a year before transferring to UK. After \n     graduating in 1995 with a bachelor's degree in physics, Smith \n     was commissioned in the Navy and went to officer candidate \n     school in Pensacola, Fla., where he began nuclear power \n     training.\n       At 39, Smith is the youngest commanding officer of an Ohio-\n     class submarine. The Kentucky--560 feet long and 42 feet in \n     diameter, and producing around 18,000 tons of displacement--\n     is about the size of the largest ships that worked during \n     World War II. It has a crew complement of 160, and it is \n     capable of sinking more than 800 feet and traveling faster \n     than 25 knots. (``That's pretty much freeway speed for a \n     submarine,'' Smith says.) The Kentucky's primary mission, as \n     a strategic nuclear deterrent, is to provide a credible, \n     survivable launch platform for ballistic missiles from sea.\n       The ship is really a world of its own, Smith says, and it's \n     a complex world with tens of thousands of moving parts. For \n     the commander of the Kentucky, a day's work involves taking \n     care of the ship and making sure its crew members are \n     prepared for any situation they could face while at sea.\n       ``Life aboard a nuclear submarine is all about mitigating \n     risk, while still making sure that you are able to perform \n     your mission,'' Smith says. ``A submarine at sea is really a \n     dangerous environment. Everywhere within reach, there are \n     cables carrying high-voltage electricity. There are pipes \n     containing rapidly moving sea water. There are\n\n[[Page S5253]]\n\n     high-pressure hydraulics lines. And we live constantly within \n     just a few feet of the most unforgiving, deadly, crushing \n     environment, right on the other side of our hull--the deep \n     sea. It's of paramount importance that we keep it on the \n     other side of that hull.''\n       A naval submarine will operate at sea for about 50 to 100 \n     days before coming back to port for a couple of months, \n     during which time it undergoes a regimen of critical \n     maintenance and a crew rotation. The Kentucky has two crews, \n     a Blue Team and a Gold Team. Smith commands both.\n       While the Kentucky is under way, the daily routine is one \n     of training, planning and maintenance. Breakfast begins at \n     05:00 (5 a.m.) and is over by 06:30, at which time the crew \n     receives briefings before commencing drills at 08:00. Drills \n     consist of simulations of various different situations that \n     could be encountered aboard the ship, such as fires, \n     floodings, and casualties.\n       On some days, the crew performs strategic exercises, in \n     which the crew practices the tasks they could be asked to \n     perform while on a mission--everything from processing \n     messages to walking through a strategic launch. This part of \n     the day is usually done by 15:00 (3 p.m.), followed by a few \n     hours of planning, training, and debriefing before dinner at \n     17:00 hours. There's usually a movie for the crew around \n     20:00, and then it's lights out.\n       Running parallel to that daily routine, the ship maintains \n     a regular watch schedule, in which at any given time, one-\n     third of the crew is manning a watch station on their part of \n     the ship. The watch shifts run for six hours in an 18-hour \n     rotation.\n       In port, the routine centers around maintenance, with \n     anywhere from 50 to 150 separate scheduled maintenance items \n     every time the ship comes in.\n       ``The scheduled maintenance on a car is a good \n     comparison,'' Smith says. ``Think of all of the things that \n     you have to check on your car every 5,000 miles. Well, a \n     submarine is a lot bigger and a lot more complex than a car. \n     And a typical car owner might keep their car for five or six \n     years, while a submarine has to last for 40. So we have to \n     ensure that the ship is in good shape for another whole \n     generation of submariners.''\n       Smith says he works conscientiously to instill a sense of \n     Kentucky pride in his crew. One of the first things he did \n     after taking command was to implement ``Go Big Blue!'' as the \n     ship's rallying cry. He ends every shipboard announcement \n     over the loudspeaker with that call, and the crew echoes it \n     back.\n       ``I think you'll find it's true, on any of the ships named \n     after a state, that the commanders will try to get the whole \n     state-pride thing going among the crew,'' Smith says. ``I \n     have just a little extra fire in my belly, being a native of \n     Kentucky and a graduate of UK. My crew definitely knows that \n     we're representing a great state.''\n       Smith says the education he received at UK has helped to \n     prepare him for his role in the Navy in ways he couldn't even \n     have imagined when he was a student some 20 years ago.\n       ``The experience that I had in college--not just in \n     physics, but the whole multidisciplinary aspect of what \n     college is--has served me very well throughout my career,'' \n     he says. ``I use the physics every day, and the engineering \n     and math. But there's also philosophy--particularly the \n     connection between philosophy and anthropology: How do we \n     live in a multinational society? There's psychology, which \n     helps me to be able to interpret the reactions of my crew in \n     an objectively harsh environment. I use business management \n     and financial accounting. Even the Russian I studied has \n     served me well. There was not a single class that I took at \n     UK that I have not gone back and leveraged in my career at \n     some point.''\n       A lifelong Wildcat fan, Smith says he was thrilled to see \n     the Cats bring home their eighth NCAA Championship this year. \n     He offers his own, admittedly biased, take on bracketology:\n       ``I tell my fellow officers that when you pick your bracket \n     for the NCAA tournament, you need to realize that there is a \n     Center of Awesomeness in the Universe, which is Rupp Arena, \n     and the farther any team is based from there, the less of a \n     chance they are going to have of making it to the Final \n     Four.''\n       Smith is also father to four children. In his spare time, \n     he enjoys reading broadly on diverse topics, including \n     philosophy, poetry, and music. He is an avid video gamer, who \n     welcomes challenges from his crew in just about any game \n     imaginable.\n       ``I try to remain as interdisciplinary as possible,'' he \n     says.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/23/senate-section/article/S5253-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5253-S5255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO GLENN ``BUDDY'' WESTBROOK\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today in recognition of Mr. \nGlenn ``Buddy'' Westbrook of London, Kentucky, and his service to both \nthis nation and the State of Kentucky, specifically Laurel County and \nthe surrounding region. Passionate about development of the London \ncommunity, Mr. Westbrook worked to build the Laurel County economy and \nstrengthen the tourism industry in southeastern Kentucky.\n  Born in 1930 to J. Hamp and Flo Pearl Westbrook, Buddy Westbrook was \nraised in London, Kentucky. His nickname, Buddy, stuck when his older \nsister, Madge, called him Buddy because she could not say Glenn. He \nbegan working at an early age when he helped his father separate type \nfor the printing shop the family owned. Buddy enjoyed working because \nit made him feel grown up. However, like all boys, he enjoyed spending \ntime outdoors, especially at Kidds Pond, and he also had a knack for \ngetting into mischief, such as climbing telephone poles.\n  Buddy graduated from high school in London but during his sophomore \nyear attended classes at Berea College to study chemistry. After high \nschool he attended Sue Bennett College and worked in his father's gas \nand LP appliance store. Throughout his life, he was taught that civic \nduty and serving others was an important part of being a member of a \ncommunity. In 1950, Buddy joined the U.S. Army and served in Germany \nduring the Korean War.\n  When he returned to London, Buddy took over his family store. As an \nactive member of the Jaycees, an organization that promotes community \ndevelopment, he was able to attend a conference in Ashland where he met \nhis wife, Jeanne. The couple had eight children. In 1970, Governor \nWendell Ford named Buddy to the Kentucky Institute for Children.\n  In 1975, Buddy was offered a position with the Cumberland Valley Area \nDevelopment District. His service through this post was especially of \nbenefit to the tourism industry in the region. Not only did Buddy and \nmembers of the commission share information about the region at travel \nshows, but he also organized the first Tourism Industry Development \nSymposium held in Lexington.\n  After the death of his wife, Jeanne, and son, Don, in 1983 and 1984, \nrespectively, Buddy understandably endured some difficult times. \nHowever, a friend, Susan Mitchell, who later became his wife, helped \nhim through this dark period. After retiring in 1993, Buddy organized \nVision 2000 for London, Kentucky, a plan to define goals for the city \nwhich ultimately came to fruition during the new millennium.\n  Buddy Westbrook is truly an outstanding citizen of the London, \nKentucky, community. Passionate about the development of Laurel County \nand the surrounding region, his lifetime commitment to economic and \ntourism development have proved to be invaluable to southeastern \nKentucky. Buddy's dedication to his community is exemplary, and I am \nprivileged today to recognize his many contributions to Kentucky. I ask \nmy colleagues in the U.S. Senate to join me in celebrating Mr. Glenn \n``Buddy'' Westbrook. A recent article published in the Sentinel-Echo, a \nLaurel County-area publication, highlighted his accomplishments. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that said article appear in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Sentinel-Echo, May 2, 2012]\n\n           Westbrook: `This Is Most Exciting Time in History'\n\n                           (By Tara Kaprowy)\n\n       Upon opening the door for his Living Treasures interview, \n     81-year-old Glenn ``Buddy'' Westbrook announces he just has a \n     couple of hours to chat; he's going four-wheeling on the Salt \n     River with a friend and, with the spring morning warm and \n     clear, time's, as they say, a-wastin'.\n       But upon stepping into his kitchen, it's clear Westbrook's \n     interest hasn't completely been kidnapped by the prospect of \n     ATVing. He's laid out his dining room table with croissants, \n     marmalade and several types of tea in anticipation of the \n     impending discussion--and, in his characteristic way, to make \n     things lovely and enjoyable.\n       Westbrook was born June 14, 1930, to J. Hamp and Flo Pearl \n     (Eversole) Westbrook. His mother was born in London and her \n     maternal grandfather, J.N. Robinson, was the first \n     photographer and jeweler in town. ``My mother's father was \n     Roscoe Eversole, and he was the cashier of the First National \n     Bank in London and was also mayor when they first started \n     putting in sidewalks and culverts. Before that, it was \n     boardwalks. And so I grew up with examples of leadership, a \n     love of London and Laurel County, and an appreciation of the \n     people.''\n       His father came from the cotton farms of Georgia and, \n     together, he and Flo Pearl made a cozy home with their young \n     family in an apartment above First National Bank. Westbrook's \n     sister Madge was two years his elder and, unable to pronounce \n     the name ``Glenn,'' he soon acquired the nickname\n\n[[Page S5254]]\n\n     ``Buddy,'' a moniker by which he is still known.\n       Hamp worked at the Corbin Times and later owned a printing \n     shop in Corbin. From a young age, Westbrook helped his \n     father, learning ``to separate cold type in a California \n     box,'' he said.\n       ``It wasn't done by a-b-c-d-e-f-g,'' he said. ``It was by \n     the most-used letters, `e' was in the center in the bigger \n     box. It made me feel grown up.''\n       After Madge and Westbrook started attending school at Sue \n     Bennett grade school, Flo Pearl went to work at First \n     National Bank, a job she kept for the next 50 years.\n       With the family settling in a home his father built on East \n     Fifth Street, Westbrook remembers a happy childhood. ``This \n     was a wonderful place to grow up,'' he said. ``If you made \n     any mistakes while you were in town, like climbing telephone \n     poles or things like that, your parents knew by the time you \n     got home. You got a lecture and often your backside got \n     warmed.''\n       London was a friendly place to live, and ``people would \n     come to town on Saturdays from farms, park their cars, park \n     their horses and wagons behind the jail on Broad Street, and \n     they'd come up on Main Street where all the businesses were \n     located,'' he said. ``It was a time when doctors cared about \n     you. They knew you, they loved you, and they wanted to heal \n     you.''\n       Westbrook also described strict but caring teachers. ``We \n     learned about patriotism and civic things,'' he said. ``We \n     started learning at an early age that we were part of a \n     whole.''\n       Evenings at the Westbrook house included the family \n     ``watching the radio'' to listen to the evening news. Flo \n     Pearl would read to her children from English and American \n     authors and classic mythology. On warm summer afternoons, \n     Westbrook said he and his friends would head to a small lake \n     south of London close to the entrance of Levi Jackson \n     Wilderness Road State Park.\n       ``It was Kidds Pond,'' he said. ``They had dressing rooms \n     and they charged you a quarter to swim all day and sometimes \n     it was 10 cents. Of course, back then you could get a Coke \n     for a nickel and hamburgers were a nickel.''\n       When he was looking for something to do, Westbrook would \n     head to his grandmother's farm next to where E.C. Porter's \n     IGA currently stands, where he learned how to ``milk a cow \n     and how to churn and make butter.''\n       On December 7, 1941, Westbrook remembers ``playing in the \n     front yard on his bicycle'' when his parents told him \n     President Roosevelt had announced the Japanese had attacked \n     Pearl Harbor. From that moment on, Westbrook's childhood \n     changed. ``We followed everything about the war,'' he said. \n     ``I saw the National Guard troops mount up over where the \n     fire department is now on Dixie Street. They had horses and \n     stables and they had a drill hall filled with sand with a \n     roof over it and they would take the horses in there and do \n     their formations in there. I remember seeing the troops mount \n     up in the armory after World War II started and march up Main \n     Street, go down to the depot and get on a train to go off to \n     war.''\n       By the time he reached high school, Westbrook had decided \n     he would become a ``brilliant chemist for Dupont'' and even \n     went to Berea College in his sophomore year to study \n     chemistry. He returned to London the following year to \n     graduate. ``That was a wonderful experience,'' he said. \n     ``London had a good basketball team, good cheerleaders and \n     good teachers who cared.''\n       Following graduation, Westbrook enrolled in Sue Bennett \n     College. Later, he worked at the appliance and LP gas store \n     with his father. Westbrook said he was lucky to learn from \n     his father ``how to build a business, care for customers, \n     find what they needed, and have it for them.''\n       But Westbrook was lucky--jobs were scarce and veterans \n     returning from WWII wanted to be able to live in Laurel \n     County. That desire was granted when in 1949, London was \n     chosen to be Kentucky's first ``Test City,'' an experiment in \n     community development sponsored by the Kentucky Chamber of \n     Commerce. Over the next 10 years, the effort attracted 2,500 \n     new jobs to the area.\n       Part of the effort involved ``a big clean-up, paint-up, \n     fix-up'' campaign in preparation for visits from industries, \n     Westbrook said. ``Gradually the ramshackle buildings and \n     sheds were torn down,'' he said. ``There was no law or \n     anything, there was just pride. They wanted it to be part of \n     helping it succeed. Weeded lots were mowed, progress reports \n     were given every week in the newspaper.''\n       The experience profoundly affected Westbrook, who was \n     greatly inspired by the community leaders who were spurring \n     the effort. ``The leadership I saw, the people I respected, \n     the veterans who came back from World War II and other \n     leaders, they got together and I saw them cooperating and \n     really dreaming, saying we could do this and let's try this \n     to create jobs. Even though there would be the potential \n     embarrassment of trying something and it not working, at \n     least you felt like you should try it.''\n       Westbrook joined the Jaycees, the young men's organization \n     active in community development.\n       In 1950, Westbrook was drafted in the U.S. Army during \n     ``the Korean Police Action,'' but rather than be sent to \n     Asia, was shipped to Germany where he taught soldiers about \n     weapon surveillance and fire direction control in his \n     artillery unit. He was also given the task of purchasing \n     German wines for the military base.\n       Westbrook took full advantage of his time in Europe and \n     sunk happily in its cultures. He learned to ski in the Alps, \n     took photography lessons from ``an old German,'' learned \n     French, German, and Italian, ate pizza and weinerschnitzel \n     for the first time, and spent his time off travelling. ``I \n     spent a week in Paris and got to go to every museum,'' he \n     said. ``It was fun to be discovering these things. I got to \n     see the Louvre. When I went in there, on the first landing, \n     there was the Winged Victory of Samothrace and I said, Wow! \n     They've got it here.' ''\n       When he was discharged in 1953, Westbrook returned to \n     London, shed his dreams of becoming a chemist, and took over \n     the family business. He quickly re-joined the Jaycees and \n     upon his first annual meeting in Ashland, met the woman who \n     was to become his first wife. ``The only single one was \n     Jeanne Watts,'' he said. ``A year and a half later, we were \n     married.''\n       They wed in Ashland and Westbrook returned to London with \n     his bride. ``She was intelligent, she had her own way of \n     doing things, she was thoughtful and caring, but she was also \n     very independent,'' he said of Jeanne.\n       Together they had eight children--Joe, Amy, Don, Robert, \n     David, Mary, Susan, and Leann. Jeanne kept the books and \n     Buddy continued working at his businesses and diving into \n     community issues. In 1970, he was appointed by Gov. Wendell \n     Ford and later Gov. Julian Carroll to the Kentucky Commission \n     for Children, which was renamed the Kentucky Institute for \n     Children, and attended the president's 1970 White House \n     Conference on Children and Youth.\n       After decades in the gas business, Westbrook decided to go \n     into the wholesale kitchen-design business, one that later \n     expanded into institutional food service for schools, \n     hospitals and resorts.\n       With the majority of his business in eastern Kentucky, \n     Westbrook soon discovered it was cheaper to get his \n     instrument pilot's license and fly his men to Pikeville than \n     it was to drive, so he bought a six-passenger Cessna and \n     began his career in the air, flying the equivalent of eight \n     times around the world.\n       ``On the weekend, I could take my family and we'd leave \n     here at noon and be on the beach in Florida in five hours,'' \n     he remembered.\n       Spending time with his family was paramount to Westbrook, \n     though he admits he was a ``strict disciplinarian.''\n       ``I believe discipline is proof that you care about values \n     that are important in life,'' he said. ``When my daughter \n     Leann was born with Down syndrome, she thrived because of the \n     help of her brothers and sisters. I stopped playing golf and \n     our family did things together and we traveled as a family. \n     We tried to teach them the need for unconditional love. They \n     went to church and learned to pray. They still go to \n     church.''\n       In 1975, still with a passion for leadership, Westbrook was \n     asked to work for the Cumberland Valley Area Development \n     District. Later, he worked to develop a stronger tourism \n     industry in the region. ``We'd take our brochures and our \n     booths and our pictures and travel to shows in Chicago and \n     Indianapolis and Cincinnati and Detroit and people would come \n     and see where to go on vacation,'' he said.\n       Eight years later, Jeanne was diagnosed with lung cancer \n     and, with little treatment available, died August 2, 1983. \n     Nine months later, Westbrook's son Don died after having an \n     allergic reaction to a flu shot. It was a devastating time \n     for Westbrook, who was still working and taking care of \n     Leann.\n       Though he continued to go to work every day, he admitted he \n     fell into a deep depression. ``When a child dies, it pulls \n     something out of you and you're never, ever the same,'' he \n     said.\n       Eventually, Westbrook was able to recover, in part with the \n     help of Susan Mitchell, who would later become his wife. \n     ``She helped me through the most difficult times of the \n     grieving,'' he said. ``I was certainly not a very pleasant \n     person to be around, and she told me years later I was the \n     saddest person she had ever seen. I was so thankful to have a \n     friend who knew what I was going through. She was my \n     cheerleader.''\n       Together, Susan and Westbrook have a son, Reuben, and \n     though no longer married, remain friends.\n       After 18 years with the development district, during which \n     he organized the first Tourism Industry Development Symposium \n     in Lexington, Westbrook retired in 1993. In advance of the \n     new millennium, he organized Vision 2000, an effort to define \n     London's goals and aspirations, many of which came to \n     fruition. In 2010, he wrote a cookbook, ``Grandma's Heirloom \n     Kentucky and Southern Recipes.'' He continues to live with \n     Leann, ``who babysits her dad,'' and enjoys seeing his other \n     children, 13 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.

It's \n     exciting. This is the most exciting time in the history of \n     mankind to be alive,'' he said and puts his pencil down.\n\n[[Page S5255]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/23/senate-section/article/S5253-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5253-S5255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO GLENN ``BUDDY'' WESTBROOK\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today in recognition of Mr. \nGlenn ``Buddy'' Westbrook of London, Kentucky, and his service to both \nthis nation and the State of Kentucky, specifically Laurel County and \nthe surrounding region. Passionate about development of the London \ncommunity, Mr. Westbrook worked to build the Laurel County economy and \nstrengthen the tourism industry in southeastern Kentucky.\n  Born in 1930 to J. Hamp and Flo Pearl Westbrook, Buddy Westbrook was \nraised in London, Kentucky. His nickname, Buddy, stuck when his older \nsister, Madge, called him Buddy because she could not say Glenn. He \nbegan working at an early age when he helped his father separate type \nfor the printing shop the family owned. Buddy enjoyed working because \nit made him feel grown up. However, like all boys, he enjoyed spending \ntime outdoors, especially at Kidds Pond, and he also had a knack for \ngetting into mischief, such as climbing telephone poles.\n  Buddy graduated from high school in London but during his sophomore \nyear attended classes at Berea College to study chemistry. After high \nschool he attended Sue Bennett College and worked in his father's gas \nand LP appliance store. Throughout his life, he was taught that civic \nduty and serving others was an important part of being a member of a \ncommunity. In 1950, Buddy joined the U.S. Army and served in Germany \nduring the Korean War.\n  When he returned to London, Buddy took over his family store. As an \nactive member of the Jaycees, an organization that promotes community \ndevelopment, he was able to attend a conference in Ashland where he met \nhis wife, Jeanne. The couple had eight children. In 1970, Governor \nWendell Ford named Buddy to the Kentucky Institute for Children.\n  In 1975, Buddy was offered a position with the Cumberland Valley Area \nDevelopment District. His service through this post was especially of \nbenefit to the tourism industry in the region. Not only did Buddy and \nmembers of the commission share information about the region at travel \nshows, but he also organized the first Tourism Industry Development \nSymposium held in Lexington.\n  After the death of his wife, Jeanne, and son, Don, in 1983 and 1984, \nrespectively, Buddy understandably endured some difficult times. \nHowever, a friend, Susan Mitchell, who later became his wife, helped \nhim through this dark period. After retiring in 1993, Buddy organized \nVision 2000 for London, Kentucky, a plan to define goals for the city \nwhich ultimately came to fruition during the new millennium.\n  Buddy Westbrook is truly an outstanding citizen of the London, \nKentucky, community. Passionate about the development of Laurel County \nand the surrounding region, his lifetime commitment to economic and \ntourism development have proved to be invaluable to southeastern \nKentucky. Buddy's dedication to his community is exemplary, and I am \nprivileged today to recognize his many contributions to Kentucky. I ask \nmy colleagues in the U.S. Senate to join me in celebrating Mr. Glenn \n``Buddy'' Westbrook. A recent article published in the Sentinel-Echo, a \nLaurel County-area publication, highlighted his accomplishments. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that said article appear in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Sentinel-Echo, May 2, 2012]\n\n           Westbrook: `This Is Most Exciting Time in History'\n\n                           (By Tara Kaprowy)\n\n       Upon opening the door for his Living Treasures interview, \n     81-year-old Glenn ``Buddy'' Westbrook announces he just has a \n     couple of hours to chat; he's going four-wheeling on the Salt \n     River with a friend and, with the spring morning warm and \n     clear, time's, as they say, a-wastin'.\n       But upon stepping into his kitchen, it's clear Westbrook's \n     interest hasn't completely been kidnapped by the prospect of \n     ATVing. He's laid out his dining room table with croissants, \n     marmalade and several types of tea in anticipation of the \n     impending discussion--and, in his characteristic way, to make \n     things lovely and enjoyable.\n       Westbrook was born June 14, 1930, to J. Hamp and Flo Pearl \n     (Eversole) Westbrook. His mother was born in London and her \n     maternal grandfather, J.N. Robinson, was the first \n     photographer and jeweler in town. ``My mother's father was \n     Roscoe Eversole, and he was the cashier of the First National \n     Bank in London and was also mayor when they first started \n     putting in sidewalks and culverts. Before that, it was \n     boardwalks. And so I grew up with examples of leadership, a \n     love of London and Laurel County, and an appreciation of the \n     people.''\n       His father came from the cotton farms of Georgia and, \n     together, he and Flo Pearl made a cozy home with their young \n     family in an apartment above First National Bank. Westbrook's \n     sister Madge was two years his elder and, unable to pronounce \n     the name ``Glenn,'' he soon acquired the nickname\n\n[[Page S5254]]\n\n     ``Buddy,'' a moniker by which he is still known.\n       Hamp worked at the Corbin Times and later owned a printing \n     shop in Corbin. From a young age, Westbrook helped his \n     father, learning ``to separate cold type in a California \n     box,'' he said.\n       ``It wasn't done by a-b-c-d-e-f-g,'' he said. ``It was by \n     the most-used letters, `e' was in the center in the bigger \n     box. It made me feel grown up.''\n       After Madge and Westbrook started attending school at Sue \n     Bennett grade school, Flo Pearl went to work at First \n     National Bank, a job she kept for the next 50 years.\n       With the family settling in a home his father built on East \n     Fifth Street, Westbrook remembers a happy childhood. ``This \n     was a wonderful place to grow up,'' he said. ``If you made \n     any mistakes while you were in town, like climbing telephone \n     poles or things like that, your parents knew by the time you \n     got home. You got a lecture and often your backside got \n     warmed.''\n       London was a friendly place to live, and ``people would \n     come to town on Saturdays from farms, park their cars, park \n     their horses and wagons behind the jail on Broad Street, and \n     they'd come up on Main Street where all the businesses were \n     located,'' he said. ``It was a time when doctors cared about \n     you. They knew you, they loved you, and they wanted to heal \n     you.''\n       Westbrook also described strict but caring teachers. ``We \n     learned about patriotism and civic things,'' he said. ``We \n     started learning at an early age that we were part of a \n     whole.''\n       Evenings at the Westbrook house included the family \n     ``watching the radio'' to listen to the evening news. Flo \n     Pearl would read to her children from English and American \n     authors and classic mythology. On warm summer afternoons, \n     Westbrook said he and his friends would head to a small lake \n     south of London close to the entrance of Levi Jackson \n     Wilderness Road State Park.\n       ``It was Kidds Pond,'' he said. ``They had dressing rooms \n     and they charged you a quarter to swim all day and sometimes \n     it was 10 cents. Of course, back then you could get a Coke \n     for a nickel and hamburgers were a nickel.''\n       When he was looking for something to do, Westbrook would \n     head to his grandmother's farm next to where E.C. Porter's \n     IGA currently stands, where he learned how to ``milk a cow \n     and how to churn and make butter.''\n       On December 7, 1941, Westbrook remembers ``playing in the \n     front yard on his bicycle'' when his parents told him \n     President Roosevelt had announced the Japanese had attacked \n     Pearl Harbor. From that moment on, Westbrook's childhood \n     changed. ``We followed everything about the war,'' he said. \n     ``I saw the National Guard troops mount up over where the \n     fire department is now on Dixie Street. They had horses and \n     stables and they had a drill hall filled with sand with a \n     roof over it and they would take the horses in there and do \n     their formations in there. I remember seeing the troops mount \n     up in the armory after World War II started and march up Main \n     Street, go down to the depot and get on a train to go off to \n     war.''\n       By the time he reached high school, Westbrook had decided \n     he would become a ``brilliant chemist for Dupont'' and even \n     went to Berea College in his sophomore year to study \n     chemistry. He returned to London the following year to \n     graduate. ``That was a wonderful experience,'' he said. \n     ``London had a good basketball team, good cheerleaders and \n     good teachers who cared.''\n       Following graduation, Westbrook enrolled in Sue Bennett \n     College. Later, he worked at the appliance and LP gas store \n     with his father. Westbrook said he was lucky to learn from \n     his father ``how to build a business, care for customers, \n     find what they needed, and have it for them.''\n       But Westbrook was lucky--jobs were scarce and veterans \n     returning from WWII wanted to be able to live in Laurel \n     County. That desire was granted when in 1949, London was \n     chosen to be Kentucky's first ``Test City,'' an experiment in \n     community development sponsored by the Kentucky Chamber of \n     Commerce. Over the next 10 years, the effort attracted 2,500 \n     new jobs to the area.\n       Part of the effort involved ``a big clean-up, paint-up, \n     fix-up'' campaign in preparation for visits from industries, \n     Westbrook said. ``Gradually the ramshackle buildings and \n     sheds were torn down,'' he said. ``There was no law or \n     anything, there was just pride. They wanted it to be part of \n     helping it succeed. Weeded lots were mowed, progress reports \n     were given every week in the newspaper.''\n       The experience profoundly affected Westbrook, who was \n     greatly inspired by the community leaders who were spurring \n     the effort. ``The leadership I saw, the people I respected, \n     the veterans who came back from World War II and other \n     leaders, they got together and I saw them cooperating and \n     really dreaming, saying we could do this and let's try this \n     to create jobs. Even though there would be the potential \n     embarrassment of trying something and it not working, at \n     least you felt like you should try it.''\n       Westbrook joined the Jaycees, the young men's organization \n     active in community development.\n       In 1950, Westbrook was drafted in the U.S. Army during \n     ``the Korean Police Action,'' but rather than be sent to \n     Asia, was shipped to Germany where he taught soldiers about \n     weapon surveillance and fire direction control in his \n     artillery unit. He was also given the task of purchasing \n     German wines for the military base.\n       Westbrook took full advantage of his time in Europe and \n     sunk happily in its cultures. He learned to ski in the Alps, \n     took photography lessons from ``an old German,'' learned \n     French, German, and Italian, ate pizza and weinerschnitzel \n     for the first time, and spent his time off travelling. ``I \n     spent a week in Paris and got to go to every museum,'' he \n     said. ``It was fun to be discovering these things. I got to \n     see the Louvre. When I went in there, on the first landing, \n     there was the Winged Victory of Samothrace and I said, Wow! \n     They've got it here.' ''\n       When he was discharged in 1953, Westbrook returned to \n     London, shed his dreams of becoming a chemist, and took over \n     the family business. He quickly re-joined the Jaycees and \n     upon his first annual meeting in Ashland, met the woman who \n     was to become his first wife. ``The only single one was \n     Jeanne Watts,'' he said. ``A year and a half later, we were \n     married.''\n       They wed in Ashland and Westbrook returned to London with \n     his bride. ``She was intelligent, she had her own way of \n     doing things, she was thoughtful and caring, but she was also \n     very independent,'' he said of Jeanne.\n       Together they had eight children--Joe, Amy, Don, Robert, \n     David, Mary, Susan, and Leann. Jeanne kept the books and \n     Buddy continued working at his businesses and diving into \n     community issues. In 1970, he was appointed by Gov. Wendell \n     Ford and later Gov. Julian Carroll to the Kentucky Commission \n     for Children, which was renamed the Kentucky Institute for \n     Children, and attended the president's 1970 White House \n     Conference on Children and Youth.\n       After decades in the gas business, Westbrook decided to go \n     into the wholesale kitchen-design business, one that later \n     expanded into institutional food service for schools, \n     hospitals and resorts.\n       With the majority of his business in eastern Kentucky, \n     Westbrook soon discovered it was cheaper to get his \n     instrument pilot's license and fly his men to Pikeville than \n     it was to drive, so he bought a six-passenger Cessna and \n     began his career in the air, flying the equivalent of eight \n     times around the world.\n       ``On the weekend, I could take my family and we'd leave \n     here at noon and be on the beach in Florida in five hours,'' \n     he remembered.\n       Spending time with his family was paramount to Westbrook, \n     though he admits he was a ``strict disciplinarian.''\n       ``I believe discipline is proof that you care about values \n     that are important in life,'' he said. ``When my daughter \n     Leann was born with Down syndrome, she thrived because of the \n     help of her brothers and sisters. I stopped playing golf and \n     our family did things together and we traveled as a family. \n     We tried to teach them the need for unconditional love. They \n     went to church and learned to pray. They still go to \n     church.''\n       In 1975, still with a passion for leadership, Westbrook was \n     asked to work for the Cumberland Valley Area Development \n     District. Later, he worked to develop a stronger tourism \n     industry in the region. ``We'd take our brochures and our \n     booths and our pictures and travel to shows in Chicago and \n     Indianapolis and Cincinnati and Detroit and people would come \n     and see where to go on vacation,'' he said.\n       Eight years later, Jeanne was diagnosed with lung cancer \n     and, with little treatment available, died August 2, 1983. \n     Nine months later, Westbrook's son Don died after having an \n     allergic reaction to a flu shot. It was a devastating time \n     for Westbrook, who was still working and taking care of \n     Leann.\n       Though he continued to go to work every day, he admitted he \n     fell into a deep depression. ``When a child dies, it pulls \n     something out of you and you're never, ever the same,'' he \n     said.\n       Eventually, Westbrook was able to recover, in part with the \n     help of Susan Mitchell, who would later become his wife. \n     ``She helped me through the most difficult times of the \n     grieving,'' he said. ``I was certainly not a very pleasant \n     person to be around, and she told me years later I was the \n     saddest person she had ever seen. I was so thankful to have a \n     friend who knew what I was going through. She was my \n     cheerleader.''\n       Together, Susan and Westbrook have a son, Reuben, and \n     though no longer married, remain friends.\n       After 18 years with the development district, during which \n     he organized the first Tourism Industry Development Symposium \n     in Lexington, Westbrook retired in 1993. In advance of the \n     new millennium, he organized Vision 2000, an effort to define \n     London's goals and aspirations, many of which came to \n     fruition. In 2010, he wrote a cookbook, ``Grandma's Heirloom \n     Kentucky and Southern Recipes.'' He continues to live with \n     Leann, ``who babysits her dad,'' and enjoys seeing his other \n     children, 13 grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren. He \n     attends St. William Catholic Church. And he remains deeply \n     committed to London and his passion for progress.\n       At the end of his interview, he outlines ways to think \n     outside the box, drawing several adjacent squares on a sheet \n     of paper and asking how many are actually there. Pointing out \n     how several small boxes form several larger ones, he talks \n     about the importance of expanding one's mind. ``You have to \n     be open minded, you can't just be closed to what was. It's \n     exciting. This is the most exciting time in the history of \n     mankind to be alive,'' he said and puts his pencil down.\n\n[[Page S5255]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/23/senate-section/article/S5255-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Sergeant Michael E.

He was \nkilled on July 13, 2012 in Qalat, Zabul Province, Afghanistan while \nserving his country as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. He leaves \nbehind his wife, Elizabeth, two sons, Hyle and Bradley, his parents, \nRandy and Suzanne, and many other family and friends. My prayers go out \nto them as they grieve his loss.\n  By all accounts, he was a brave soldier who was proud of serving his \ncountry. He had a long list of awards and decorations, including the \nBronze Star and Purple Heart, Army Achievement Medal, Army Good Conduct \nMedal, with Oak Leaf Cluster, National Defense Service Medal, \nAfghanistan Campaign Medal, with Bronze Service Star, Iraq Campaign \nMedal, with two Bronze Service Stars, Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal, Army Service Ribbon, NATO Medal, Non-Commissioned Officer \nProfessional Development Ribbon, Valorous Unit Award, Meritorious Unit \nCommendation, and Combat Infantryman Badge.\n  Our Nation is truly blessed to have patriots like Sergeant Ristau who \nvolunteer to serve their country, prepared to endure the daily \nsacrifices of a deployment and the horrors of combat, and knowing that \nthey could make the ultimate sacrifice. About his military service, his \nfamily said, ``Michael had a passion for the military and was going to \nre-enlist.'' They also said that ``Michael was always looking out for \nothers and helping them in any way possible.'' There is certainly no \nmore selfless act than to give one's life to ensure that others may \nlive in freedom. We cannot hope to ever fully repay the debt we owe \nMichael Ristau, but as he joins the illustrious ranks of our fallen \npatriots from the birth of our Nation to the present day, we have an \nobligation to honor his life and his sacrifice. We must always remember \nheroes like Michael Ristau and never take for granted the gift of \nliberty they have won for us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/23/senate-section/article/S5255-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     HONORING KENNETH SAAVEDRA, JR.\n\n Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

Madam President, today I wish to \npay tribute to the 125th anniversary of the founding of Garden City, \nSD. Located in northeastern Clark County, Garden City is a proud small \ntown, known for potato farming.\n  The townsite of Garden City was established in 1882 on 40 acres of \nland donated by Clarence Hayward, an early resident. Hayward was known \nas the father of the town because of his steadfast dedication to the \nwell-being and improvement of Garden City. It is said that were it not \nfor his aggressive advocacy, Garden City would not be a town.\n  The Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railroad was built in the town in \n1887, bringing with it great prosperity. At that time, R.S. Carpenter \ndonated a 40-acre parcel of land located just south of Garden City to \nthe town. His wife is credited with naming the town, an honor granted \nto her by the railroad workers who were impressed by her hospitality. \nShe had a love of flowers and saw parallels between the townsite and \nthe Garden of Eden.\n  The year 1887 was important in the early history of Garden City. \nBesides the establishment of the railroad, 1887 was when the first \nbuildings were constructed. There was a grocery store and hardware \nbusiness built by William Morise and Charley Edwards, as well as a post \noffice and a railroad depot. In following years, many business and \ncivic organizations popped up to serve the growing population.\n  In the 20th century, Garden City earned notoriety for being a center \nof potato farming in South Dakota. Commercial potato farming first \narrived around 1908, and by the 1940s, Garden City farms were yielding \nhalf a million bushels of potatoes each year.\n  Residents of Garden City plan to celebrate their town's 125th \nanniversary with a day full of activities for the whole family. \nFestivities will begin with a tractor parade, followed by a pork loin \ndinner, bean bag and horseshoe tournaments, and musical entertainment, \nall held in the park. At the Opera House, numerous mementos and \nantiquities will be on display to showcase the rich history of Garden \nCity.\n  Garden City was founded by a determined group of pioneers, who fought \nhard for the preservation and advancement of their town. This legacy is \nevident to this day in the can-do spirit of its residents. I \ncongratulate Garden City on reaching this historic milestone and wish \nthem the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/23/senate-section/article/S5255-4", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5255-S5256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO VINCENT J. VACCA\n\n Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to Vincent \nJ. Vacca, a veteran of the first Gulf War. Vince, on behalf of all \nMontanans and all Americans, I stand to say thank you for your service \nto this nation. It is my honor to share the story of Vince Vacca's \nservice in Operation Desert Storm, because no story of heroism should \never fall through the cracks.\n  Vince was born in New York but grew up in Libby, MT. When he was just \na junior in high school, Vince decided to join the Navy headed to boot \ncamp right after he graduated. On his first deployment, he was \nstationed on the U.S.S.

He \nseparated from the Navy in May of 1992 but re-enlisted in the Armed \nServices, this time in the U.S. Army in December of 1992.\n  In the Army, Vince graduated third in his class as a fire direction \nspecialist in field artillery.

Vince recently received his Army \nmedals but couldn't get his Navy medals.\n  Earlier this month, in the presence of his family, it was my honor to \nfinally present to Vince: the Navy Good Conduct Medal, the National \nDefense Service Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal with two bronze \nstars, and the Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon. I also had the honor of \npresenting to Vince, the Kuwait Liberation Medal, based in Kuwait, the \nSea Service Deployment Ribbon with one bronze star, and the Kuwait \nLiberation Medal, based in Saudi Arabia.\n  These seven decorations are small tokens, but they are powerful \nsymbols of true heroism, sacrifice, and dedication to service.\n  These medals are presented on behalf of a grateful Nation.\n\n[[Page S5256]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/23/senate-section/article/S5256-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       LANDSAT SATELLITE PROGRAM\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I wish to recognize \nand commemorate the Landsat satellite program on the 40th anniversary \nof the launch of the first Landsat satellite. While perhaps not as well \nknown as some of our other satellite programs, the Landsat satellites \nare nevertheless wildly successful and critically important to \nscientific research and policymaking.\n  On September 21, 1966, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall \nannounced the commencement of Project EROS--Earth Resources Observation \nSatellites. The goal of Project EROS was to create a program \nresponsible for mapping the characteristics of the surface of the \nEarth, thereby helping us better understand Earth's natural resources \nand changing climate.\n  In the years following, the Department of the Interior, through the \nU.S. Geological Survey and partnering with the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration, established the EROS Program, and on July 23, \n1972, launched the first Landsat satellite responsible for Earth \nsurface imaging. Over the last 40 years the United States launched six \nmore Landsat satellites, ensuring continuous observation and creating a \nnational archive of natural resource information. The next Landsat is \nscheduled to be launched in 2013.\n  Today Landsat is crucial, not only to environmental research and \nstudy, but to national policy and decisionmakers at all levels. Landsat \ncollects data from across the United States from the forests of \nWashington and Oregon, to the changing wetlands and waterways of \ncoastal Louisiana. It also collects data globally, mapping, for \nexample, the arid regions of Saudi Arabia and Mexico and the shrinking \nAral Sea and Lake Chad. Using the information gathered by these \nsatellites, researchers are able to catalogue and compare changes in \nthe land due to urbanization, deforestation, population growth, climate \nchange, and natural disasters. This kind of analysis is critically \nimportant to local governments, farmers and ranchers, land managers, \nand many other decisionmakers.\n  For example, my home State of Colorado has been deeply affected by \nwildfires this year. Drought, climate change, and fire suppression have \ncombined to make this one of the most destructive wildfire seasons in \nColorado history. Landsat satellites collect data measuring water \nconsumption by plants, bark beetle infestation, forest health, fuel \nloads, and even environmental recovery data from these damaging fires. \nGiven this information, we can better combat wildfires both on the \nfront lines and through our decisions here in Washington.\n  Not only does Landsat data benefit Colorado decisionmakers, but the \nsatellites themselves have a strong Colorado pedigree. Ball Aerospace, \nlocated in Boulder, CO, is a key contributor to the development and \nprogress of the Landsat program. Ball developed and constructed several \nvital components of the Landsat mission, most notably the Operational \nLand Imager, which allows for detailed imaging and a complete scan of \nthe entire globe every 16 days.\n  I want to congratulate all those who have been associated with the \nLandsat legacy over the past 40 years on fulfilling Secretary Udall's \nvision so ably. Their tireless dedication has been a true benefit to \nall Americans and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/23/senate-section/article/S5256-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5256-S5257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY ORIGINALLY \n  DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13536 ON APRIL 12, 2010 WITH RESPECT TO \nSOMALIA, RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE JULY 20, 2012--PM 58\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 \nU.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an \nExecutive Order (the ``order'') taking additional steps with respect to \nthe national emergency declared in Executive Order 13536 of April 12, \n2010 (E.O. 13536).\n  In E.O. 13536, I found that that the deterioration of the security \nsituation and the persistence of violence in Somalia, and acts of \npiracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, which have \nrepeatedly been the subject of United Nations Security Council \nresolutions, and violations of the arms embargo imposed by the United \nNations Security Council in Resolution 733 of January 23, 1992, and \nelaborated upon and amended by subsequent resolutions, constitute an \nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign \npolicy of the United States. To address that threat, E.O. 13536 blocks \nthe property and interests in property of persons listed in the Annex \nto E.O. 13536 or determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to meet criteria specified in \nE.O. 13536.\n  In view of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2036 of \nFebruary 22, 2012, and Resolution 2002 of July 29, 2011, I am issuing \nthe order to take additional steps to deal with the national emergency \ndeclared in E.O. 13536 and to address exports of charcoal from Somalia, \nwhich generate significant revenue for al-Shabaab; the misappropriation \nof Somali public assets; and certain acts of violence committed against \ncivilians in Somalia, all of which contribute to the deterioration of \nthe security situation and the persistence of violence in Somalia.\n  The order prohibits the importation into the United States, directly \nor indirectly, of charcoal from Somalia. It also amends the designation \ncriteria specified in E.O. 13536. As amended by the order, E.O. 13536 \nprovides for the designation of persons determined by the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to:\n  Have engaged in acts that directly or indirectly threaten the peace, \nsecurity, or stability of Somalia, including but not limited to: Acts \nthat threaten the Djibouti Agreement of August 18, 2008, or the \npolitical process; acts that threaten the Transitional Federal \nInstitutions or future Somali governing institutions, the African Union \nMission in Somalia (AMISOM), or other future international peacekeeping \noperations related to Somalia; or acts to misappropriate Somali public \nassets;\n  Have obstructed the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Somalia, \nor access to, or distribution of, humanitarian assistance in Somalia;\n  Have directly or indirectly supplied, sold or transferred to Somalia, \nor to have been the recipient in the territory of Somalia of, arms or \nany related materiel, or any technical advice, training, or assistance, \nincluding financing and financial assistance, related to military \nactivities;\n  Be responsible for or complicit in, or responsible for ordering, \ncontrolling, or otherwise directing, or to have participated in, the \ncommission of acts of violence targeting civilians in Somalia, \nincluding killing and maiming, sexual and gender-based violence, \nattacks on schools and hospitals, taking hostages, and forced \ndisplacement;\n  Be a political or military leader recruiting or using children in \narmed conflict in Somalia;\n  Have engaged, directly or indirectly, in the import or export of \ncharcoal from Somalia on or after February 22, 2012;\n  Have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, \nlogistical or technical support for, or goods or services in support \nof, the activities described above or any person whose property and \ninterests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13536; or\n  Be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for \nor on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and \ninterests in property are blocked pursuant to E.O. 13536.\n  The designation criteria will be applied in accordance with \napplicable Federal law including, where appropriate, the First \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. In view of United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution 2002 of July 29, 2011, persons who engage \nin non-local commerce via al-Shabaab-controlled ports that constitutes \nsupport for a person whose property and interests in property are \nblocked pursuant to E.O. 13536 may be subject to designation pursuant \nto E.O. 13536, as amended by the order.\n\n[[Page S5257]]\n\n  The order was effective at 2:00 p.m. eastern daylight time on July \n20, 2012.

A bill to enhance civil penalties under the Federal \nsecurities laws, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Today I am introducing bipartisan legislation to address a \nmatter that I explored as chairman of the Banking Subcommittee on \nSecurities, Insurance, and Investment. During a series of hearings, it \nbecame increasingly clear to me that in order to protect taxpayers and \ninvestors, we need tougher anti-fraud laws and better oversight of Wall \nStreet. Some of these institutions that are ``too big to fail'' have \nalso become ``too big to care.'' We need to end the cycle of misconduct \nwhere such institutions can look at the bottom line and see they can \nbreak the law, get caught, pay a nominal fine, and still profit.\n  At a Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, oversight hearing I \nheld in November 2011, I asked Robert Khuzami, director of the Division \nof Enforcement at the SEC, why a recently proposed settlement with \nCitigroup had been thrown out by a Federal judge in the Southern \nDistrict of New York, who believed it to be egregiously low. Mr. \nKhuzami replied that the SEC's ability to assess penalties was actually \nlimited by the statute. In follow-up questions, I directly asked if \nCongress should consider raising these limits, especially in cases \ninvolving repeated offenders. I subsequently received a letter from SEC \nChairman Schapiro, and written answers from Mr. Khuzami, supporting the \nneed to raise the limits and make other improvements to the SEC civil \nenforcement statute.\n  As a result, I am introducing today with my colleague, Senator Chuck \nGrassley, the Stronger Enforcement of Civil Penalties Act of 2012 or \nthe SEC Penalties Act. This bill will strengthen the ability of the SEC \nto crack down on violations of securities laws by updating its civil \npenalties statute. This legislation will ensure that the punishment \nbetter fits the crime by increasing the statutory limits on civil \nmonetary penalties, directly linking the size of these penalties to the \nscope of harm and associated investor losses, and substantially raising \nthe financial stakes for repeat offenders of our nation's securities \nlaws.\n  Our bill will increase the per violation cap for the most egregious \nsecurities laws violations to $1 million per offense for individuals \nand $10 million per offense for entities. This will help ensure that \nthe SEC's most severe, or ``tier three,'' penalties will help deter \npeople from engaging in the most serious offenses, rather than have \nsuch wrongdoing be viewed as just the cost of doing business. Under \nexisting law, the SEC can only penalize individual securities law \nviolators a maximum of $150,000 per offense and institutions $725,000 \nper offense.\n  Our bill will also toughen penalties by allowing penalties equal to \nthree times the economic gain of the violator. It also provides a new \ncalculation method that includes the amount of associated investor \nlosses as part of the penalty determination. This should allow the SEC \nto address situations where the actual economic gain to the violator is \nrelatively small compared to the extent of the wrongdoing or the harm \ncaused to investors.\n  In the recent case involving Citigroup, existing law did not even \nentitle the SEC to recover the amount actually lost by investors. \nEstimated investors losses were about $700 million, but the SEC \nproposed to settle the case with Citigroup for only $285 million. This \namount was what was estimated to be close to the total monetary \nrecovery that the SEC itself could have obtained if it had gone to \ntrial. Under our bill, this amount could have been much larger, and \nwould have taken into account the economic gain to Citigroup, in \naddition to investor losses.\n  Recent reports have highlighted the level of repeat offenses that \nhave occurred on Wall Street and gone unchecked. The SEC Penalties Act \nincludes two statutory changes that would substantially improve the \nability of the SEC's enforcement program to ratchet up penalties as \nrecidivism occurs.\n  One would allow the SEC to triple the applicable penalty cap for \nrecidivists who, within the preceding five years, have been criminally \nconvicted of securities fraud or been the subject of a judgment or \norder imposing monetary, equitable, or administrative relief in any \naction alleging SEC fraud.\n  The other would allow the SEC to seek a civil penalty if an \nindividual or entity has violated an existing federal court injunction \nor bar imposed by the SEC. Many believe this approach would be more \nefficient, effective, and flexible than the current civil contempt \nremedy.\n  Finally, under the SEC Penalties Act, the penalty relief available in \nadministrative proceedings will be the same as it is in district court. \nIn essence, the SEC will be able to assess these types of penalties in-\nhouse, and not just obtain them in federal court.\n  Given the JP Morgan trading scandal, issues arising from the Facebook \nIPO, and the manipulation of LIBOR, it\n\n[[Page S5260]]\n\nis clear much still needs to be done to improve transparency and \nrestore confidence in our financial system. The nearly one-half of all \nU.S. households that own securities deserve a strong cop on the beat \nthat has the tools it needs to go after fraudsters and the difficult \ncases arising from our increasingly complex financial markets. Our \neconomy's success depends in no small part on restoring confidence in \nour capital markets.\n  The SEC Penalties Act will help by giving the SEC more tools to \ndemand meaningful accountability from Wall Street. It will enhance the \nSEC's ability to protect investors and crack down on fraud and I urge \nmy colleagues to cosponsor and join us in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3416\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to require the \nSecretary of Defense to use only human-based methods for training \nmembers of the Armed Forces in the treatment of severe combat injuries; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss military medical \ntraining, and specifically, the use of live animals in trauma training.\n  Many Americans may be unaware that the Military still uses live pigs \nand goats in combat trauma training courses to train military personnel \nto treat battlefield injuries. This is an outdated and inefficient \ntraining method that does not fully prepare doctors and medics to treat \nwounded service members.\n  For many years, medical simulation has not been able to provide a \ntraining experience superior to animal-based live tissue training, but \nthe newest generation of simulators can do just that. These simulators \nare based on human anatomy and recreate the feeling, the sights, and \nthe sounds of treating a wounded service member.\n  In current military training, live pigs and goats are anesthetized \nwhile trainees perform critical procedures on them. In some cases, the \nanimals are shot in the face or have limbs amputated while the trainees \nare instructed to keep them alive as long as possible. This is \ninhumane, but more importantly, it is like comparing apples and \noranges--this does not teach service members how to treat a human \nsoldier, only how to operate on a goat or pig. And while live tissue \ntraining has some value in getting trainees accustomed to the sight of \nblood, medical simulation can now do the same, and has become the new \ngold standard.\n  In civilian medical training courses, which teach many of the same \nprocedures as the military, simulators have almost universally replaced \nthe use of live animals. The reason for this is simple; to learn how to \ntreat human injuries, you must learn on human anatomy. Medical \nsimulation can now replicate that anatomy while providing the emotional \nand psychological pressure of working on a living, wounded soldier.\n  Let me say that I applaud the investments that the Department of \nDefense has made in the area of simulation. No one has invested more in \nsimulation technology than the Military. But the problem that I see is \nthat despite millions of dollars in investments, simulator technology \nis not being fully utilized.\n  Speaking of costs, in addition to providing superior training and \nreducing animal suffering, a move away from live tissue training would \nsave taxpayer dollars. Due to the many hidden costs of animal use, such \nas housing and feeding the animals, purchasing drugs for euthanasia and \nanesthesia, and keeping a veterinarian on staff, simulation can offer a \nbetter training experience at a lower cost.\n  But at the end of the day this is about providing the best possible \ntraining for our troops, because in military medicine the difference \nbetween the best training and the next best can literally mean the \ndifference between life and death.\n  For these reasons I introduced today the Battlefield Excellence \nthrough Superior Training Practices, or BEST Practices Act. This \nlegislation lays out a timeline for the Department of Defense to \ndevelop and fully implement innovative simulator technology in medical \ntraining, and to phase out live tissue training on animals in the \nprocess.\n  I want to note that I designed this legislation with a specific \nwaiver authority for the Secretary of Defense, so that if there is a \nspecific procedure that can only be best taught with live tissue use, \nthat option is not removed. But the BEST Practices Act is primarily \ndesigned to engage the Pentagon to embrace this technology, continue \nfurther development, and incorporate this technology in military \ntraining in all cases where simulators provide the best result.\n  Just as we have seen with other technologies, the advancements in \nmedical simulation are increasing at an exponential rate. The \ncapabilities currently in place and under development are truly \namazing. The BEST Practices Act capitalizes on these present and future \ncapabilities, and uses them to save the lives of our service members.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 3423. A bill to amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate \na segment of the Beaver, Chipuxet, Queen, Wood, and Pawcatuck Rivers in \nthe States of Connecticut and Rhode Island for study for potential \naddition to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with my \ncolleagues from Rhode Island and Connecticut, Senators Whitehouse and \nLieberman, legislation to authorize the National Park Service to study \nspecific sections of the Beaver, Chipuxet, Queen, Wood, and Pawcatuck \nRivers in Rhode Island and Connecticut for potential addition to the \nNational Wild and Scenic Rivers System. Our legislation seeks to bring \ngreater attention to and resources for efforts to protect and restore \nthe health of these rivers through the evaluation of their \nrecreational, natural, and historical qualities and whether they are \nsuitable for designation as Wild and Scenic Rivers.\n  The recreational and scenic wealth of the Wood-Pawcatuck watershed is \na natural treasure. The National Park Service's Rivers and Trails \nConservation Assistance program conducted a planning and conservation \nstudy in the 1980s which concluded, in part, that the waters of the \nWood and Pawcatuck Rivers corridor in Rhode Island ``are the cleanest \nand purest and its recreational opportunities are unparalleled by any \nother river system in the state.''\n  These rivers also provide opportunities for outdoor recreation and \ntourism that contribute to the local economy. Not only do its rivers \nprovide easy access to the wilderness for family outings and school \nfield trips, but they also offer ways to explore our heritage \nthroughout the watershed, from Native American fishing grounds to \nColonial and early industrial mill ruins. The rivers also provide \nopportunities for trout fishing, canoeing, bird watching, and hiking.\n  I have long supported the protection and restoration of Southern New \nEngland's watersheds and estuaries, including the Narragansett Bay, and \nthis study is an important first step in determining future \nopportunities for protection and recreational enjoyment of the rivers \nin the Wood-Pawcatuck watershed. Our states have been excellent \nstewards of these rivers, and this study would enhance existing local \nand State efforts to preserve and manage this open space and its \nwildlife habitat.\n  Indeed, partnerships are key to broad restoration and management of \nour resources, and it is expected that this study would be conducted in \nclose cooperation with the affected communities, state agencies, local \ngovernments, and other interested organizations. The partnership-based \napproach also allows for development of a proposed river management \nplan as part of the study, which could address issues ranging from fish \npassage to the restoration of wetlands to assist with flood mitigation, \nas well as balance the\n\n[[Page S5263]]\n\nrecreational opportunities that contribute to the local economies with \npreservation of the natural resources.\n  This is a two State initiative that will encompass both Rhode Island \nand Connecticut, and will help protect these resources for future \ngenerations to enjoy.\n  I commend Representatives Langevin and Courtney for spearheading this \neffort in the other body, and I look forward to working with all of my \ncolleagues to initiate the process to study the rivers of the Wood-\nPawcatuck Watershed for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic \nRivers System.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/23/senate-section/article/S5263-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5263]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 524--REAFFIRMING THE STRONG SUPPORT OF THE UNITED \n  STATES FOR THE 2002 DECLARATION OF CONDUCT OF PARTIES IN THE SOUTH \nCHINA SEA AMONG THE MEMBER STATES OF ASEAN AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF \n                     CHINA, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Webb, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nLieberman, and Mr. McCain) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 524\n\n       Whereas the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \n     plays a key role in strengthening and contributing to peace, \n     stability, and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region;\n       Whereas the vision of the ASEAN Leaders in their goals set \n     out in the ASEAN Charter to integrate ASEAN economically, \n     politically, and culturally furthers regional peace, \n     stability, and prosperity;\n       Whereas the United States Government recognizes the \n     importance of a strong, cohesive, and integrated ASEAN as a \n     foundation for effective regional frameworks to promote peace \n     and security and economic growth and to ensure that the Asia-\n     Pacific community develops according to rules and norms \n     agreed upon by all of its members;\n       Whereas the United States is enhancing political, security \n     and economic cooperation in Southeast Asia through ASEAN, and \n     seeks to continue to enhance its role in partnership with \n     ASEAN and others in the region in addressing transnational \n     issues ranging from climate change to maritime security;\n       Whereas the United States Government welcomes the \n     development of a peaceful and prosperous China which respects \n     international norms, international laws, international \n     institutions, and international rules, and enhances security \n     and peace, and seeks to advance a ``cooperative partnership'' \n     between the United States and China;\n       Whereas ASEAN plays an important role, in partnership with \n     others in the regional and international community, in \n     addressing maritime security issues in the Asia-Pacific \n     region and into the Indian Ocean, including open access to \n     the maritime commons of Asia;\n       Whereas the South China Sea is a vital part of the maritime \n     commons of Asia, including critical sea lanes of \n     communication and commerce between the Pacific and Indian \n     oceans;\n       Whereas, in the declaration on the conduct of parties in \n     the South China Sea, the governments of the member states of \n     ASEAN and the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     have affirmed ``that the adoption of a code of conduct in the \n     South China Sea would further promote peace and stability in \n     the region'' and have agreed to work towards the attainment \n     of a code of conduct;\n       Whereas, pending the peaceful settlement of territorial and \n     jurisdictional disputes, the member states of ASEAN and the \n     People's Republic of China have committed to ``exercise self-\n     restraint in the conduct of activities that would complicate \n     or escalate disputes and stability, including, among others, \n     refraining from action of inhabiting presently uninhabited \n     islands, reefs, shoals, and other features and to handle \n     their differences in a constructive manner'';\n       Whereas, pending the peaceful settlement of territorial and \n     jurisdictional disputes, the member states of ASEAN and the \n     People's Republic of China affirmed their commitment ``to the \n     freedom of navigation in and overflight of the South China \n     Sea provided for by the universally recognized principles of \n     international law, including the 1982 UN Convention on the \n     Law of the Sea'';
