Mr. President, I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 446, \nS. 3369.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to S. 3369, a bill to amend the Federal \n     Election Campaign Act of 1971 to provide for additional \n     disclosure requirements of corporations, labor organizations, \n     super PACs, and other entities, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. REID. For the information of all Senators, the time until 12:30 \np.m. today will be divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees, with the Republicans controlling the first 30 minutes \nand the majority the second 30 minutes.\n  We will recess from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. today to allow for our \nweekly caucus meetings.\n  Additionally, the time from 2:15 p.m. until 3 p.m. will be equally \ndivided and controlled. At 3 p.m. there will be a cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed to the DISCLOSE Act, which was debated last night and \nwill be debated again this morning.\n\n\n                            The DISCLOSE Act\n\n  Mr. President, the corrosive effect of money on American politics \nisn't a product of the 21st century. More than 100 years ago, moneyed \nspecial interests had already tested the integrity of this country's \npolitical system.\n  In 1899, copper billionaire William Clark was elected to the U.S. \nSenate by the Montana State legislature. The contest was considered so \nblatantly swayed by bribery the Senate refused to seat him. Here is how \nClark famously responded:\n\n       I never bought a man who wasn't for sale.\n\n  We in Nevada have some connection with that name because Las Vegas is \nin Clark County. Clark County was formed in the early part of the 20th \ncentury. The largest county in America was Lincoln County and that was \ndivided between Lincoln and Clark Counties, and this character, William \nClark, is who that county was named after.\n  But after Clark made this remark, and people realized he had \nblatantly swayed the State legislature by bribery, the U.S. Senate \nrefused to seat him. He became a Senator anyway--not for long, but he \nbecame a Senator. As I have learned from people who know a lot about \nMontana history, Clark was very clever. The Governor of the State of \nMontana went to San Francisco, to the acting governor--the lieutenant \ngovernor--after he was denied his seat, and he reappointed him to the \nSenate. So he got to the U.S. Senate by virtue of the shenanigans that \ntook place. Incensed Montana voters went on to pass the Corrupt \nPractices Act via a referendum. They voted for it. Less than a decade \nlater, Republican President Theodore Roosevelt reined in unlimited \ncorporate giving to political candidates at the Federal level as well--\nnot only in Montana but at the Federal level.\n  This Nation has a long history of curtailing the corrupt influence of \nmoney in politics. But with the Citizens\n\n[[Page S5052]]\n\nUnited decision, the Supreme Court of our country erased a century of \neffort to protect the fairness and integrity of American elections. \nThat disastrous decision opened the door for corporations, anonymous \nbillionaires, and foreign interests to spend hundreds of millions of \ndollars influencing voters.\n  For anyone who dismisses this change as politics as usual, they \nshould think again. During this year's election, outside spending by \nGOP shell groups is expected to top $1 billion--that is billion with a \n``B.'' The names of these new front groups contain words that are warm \nand fuzzy, such as ``freedom'' and ``prosperity.'' But make no mistake, \nthere is nothing free about an election purchased by a handful of \nbillionaires for their own self-interest.\n  Just one of those outside groups--just one of them--backed by wealthy \noil interests, has promised to spend $400 million on negative ads \nfilled with half truths and distortions of President Obama's record. By \ncomparison, during the 2008 election--less than 4 years ago--Senator \nJohn McCain's Presidential campaign spent $370 million total. That was \na huge amount of money in that day, but it is being dwarfed by these \noutside groups this year. So this year one group's special interest \nmoney will dwarf the entire budget of the Republican nominee John \nMcCain in the last Presidential election.\n  Democrats and the majority of Americans believe these unlimited \ncorporate special interest contributions should be outlawed. But in the \npost-Citizens United world, the least we should do is require groups \nspending millions on political attack ads to disclose the donors. We \nowe it to the voters to let them judge for themselves the attacks and \nthe motivation behind them. But they can only do that if they know who \nis doing it. The DISCLOSE Act would require political organizations of \nall stripes, liberal and conservatives alike, to disclose donations in \nexcess of $10,000 if they will be used for campaign purposes.\n  Safeguarding fair and transparent elections used to be an arena where \nDemocrats and Republicans could find common ground. As far back as \n1997, the Republican leader, our friend Senator McConnell, said, \n``Disclosure is the best disinfectant.'' In fact, 14 Republicans now \nserving in the Senate voted to support stronger disclosure laws in the \nyear 2000. Yet last night, those same 14 Republicans did an about-face, \nand every one of my Republican colleagues voted to block the DISCLOSE \nAct.\n  It is obvious the Republican priority is to protect a handful of \nanonymous billionaires--billionaires willing to contribute hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to change the outcome of elections. But today, \nagain, they will have an opportunity to consider that backwards \npriority. We are doing that with the motion to reconsider which I \nannounced last night. They will have the opportunity to stand for the \naverage voter instead of these billionaires.\n  I hope they join Democrats as we work to ensure all Americans--not \njust the wealthy few--have an equal voice in the political process.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                             Tax Increases\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last week, in response to another \ndisappointing month of job growth, President Obama issued a truly \nbizarre ultimatum--a truly bizarre ultimatum: Let me raise taxes on a \nmillion businesses or I will raise taxes on everybody. Let me raise \ntaxes on a million businesses or I will raise taxes on everybody.\n  Yesterday, Democratic leaders in Congress took this strange new \neconomic theory--whereby politicians purport to help job creation by \nhurting job creators--to dizzying new heights. Yesterday, Senate \nDemocratic leaders said they would actually prefer--prefer--to see \nAmerica go off the so-called fiscal cliff this coming January--along \nwith the trauma that would unleash on our economy--than let businesses \nmaintain their existing tax rates. That was the position of Democratic \nleaders yesterday: They would rather see America go off the fiscal \ncliff in January than let a million businesses maintain their current \ntax rates.\n  It is an astonishing admission--an astonishing admission. Democrats \nin Congress are now saying they would rather see taxes go up on every \nAmerican at the end of the year than let about a million businesses \nkeep what they earn now. They would rather let taxes go up on everybody \nin the country rather than allow a million businesses to keep the money \nthey earn now.\n  This isn't an economic agenda--it is not an economic agenda--it is an \nideological crusade. This morning, Ernst & Young is releasing a study \nwhich shows that President Obama's plan to raise taxes on these \nbusinesses will result in 710,000 fewer jobs. What a great idea: Let's \nraise taxes on a million of our most successful small businesses and \neliminate 700,000 jobs in the middle of the most tepid recovery in \nanybody's memory. What a terrific idea. For those who manage to keep \ntheir jobs, real aftertax wages would fall by an estimated 1.8 percent, \nmeaning living standards would decline as government sucks more capital \nout of the economy.\n  The President's proposal, in other words, is a recipe for economic \nstagnation and decline--a recipe for economic stagnation and decline. \nBut the Murray proposal--the idea we should raise taxes on everybody--\nis even worse. Not only would it trigger another recession, it would \nput the global economy at risk. Here is the Democratic theory: that a \nmassive income tax increase on 140 million American taxpayers wouldn't \nbe so bad because the effects wouldn't be felt right away. It wouldn't \nbe so bad because the effects wouldn't be felt right away.\n  This bizarre conclusion can only be reached by politicians and budget \nanalysts who have never worked a day in the private sector, who don't \nunderstand what goes into cutting a paycheck for employees, and who \ndon't have a concept of the planning--the planning--that is necessary \nto operate a business on thin margins in a tough economy.\n  This shows how out of touch these people are, to rely on the analysis \nof Ivy Tower liberals instead of listening to the jobs groups that have \nbeen pleading with us to fix this problem sooner rather than later and \nend the uncertainty that is acting like a big wet blanket over our \nentire economy.\n  Today another nonpartisan group, the Business Roundtable, urged \nCongress to adopt the Republican plan to extend current tax law for a \nyear and make a bridge to tax reform. In a letter to Congress, the \ngroup's chairman, Boeing CEO Jim McNerney, warned:\n\n       Without effective action soon, this uncertainty will spawn \n     a dangerous crisis, threatening our economy, businesses and \n     workers.\n\n  What Republicans have been saying is that we should eliminate this \nuncertainty right now. We should eliminate the uncertainty that Boeing \nemployees--nearly 85,000 of whom work in Washington State--and so many \nothers are facing right now. We should tackle these problems now rather \nthan waiting until the end of the year.\n  Let me just boil it down. Faced with the slowest economic recovery in \nmodern times, chronic joblessness, and the lowest percentage of able-\nbodied Americans actually participating in the workforce in literally \ndecades, Democrats' one-point plan to revive the economy is this: You \nearn, we take. You earn, we take is apparently the only thing they \nhave.\n  Surely we can do better. I know we can, and so do the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Reservation of Leadership Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order the \nleadership time is reserved.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Under the previous order, the time until 12:30 will be equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with \nthe Republicans controlling the first 30 minutes and the majority \ncontrolling the second 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator McConnell \nfor his remarks and the fundamental truth of those remarks that this \nadministration and the majority in this Senate want to raise taxes. \nThey think that raising taxes and spending more through the government \nwill somehow lift the economy. We have been shown that is not so.\n\n[[Page S5053]]\n\n  Our Democratic colleagues stayed here last night talking about an \nissue that doesn't have the support to pass, and they should have been \ntalking about the fundamental threat to our economy: not having a \nbudget. Why aren't we moving forward with a budget? Why aren't we \nmoving forward with the appropriations bills that are necessary to fund \nthe government come October 1? The majority leader, Senator Reid, has \nannounced he has no intention to pass a single one, not even to bring \nthem up.\n  So we will end up, in late September, passing a continuing resolution \nto fund the government--there is no telling what else will be tied up \nin that--which will create instability and uncertainty because this \nDemocratic-led Senate has refused to pass a budget, refused to lay out \na plan for the future, and refused to move the appropriations bills.\n  I have been here 15 years. This is the first time I have ever seen us \nnot move a single appropriations bill. When I first came here, we would \nmove almost every 1 of the appropriations bills before September 30. It \nis hard work. We have to bring up the bill, decide how much we want for \nthe Department of Defense, or the Department of Agriculture, or the \nDepartment of Education, and members offer amendments and debate and do \ntheir work. That is what we are supposed to be doing, but we are not.\n  Today I want to talk about and call attention to another serious--\nscandalous, really--development in the way the Democratic leadership in \nthis Senate is systemically dismantling the statutorily required budget \nprocess. It is a tale of how we are going broke.\n  Let me begin with a review of the situation. Last summer, Congress \nand the President faced a serious crisis as a result of the fact that \nsurging government spending had driven our debt to the highest level \nallowed--the debt ceiling. We were hitting the debt ceiling. Do you \nremember that? A deal was struck then to raise the debt ceiling.\n  That is what the President wanted. He didn't want to cut spending 40 \npercent. We were borrowing--and we still borrow--almost 40 cents of \nevery dollar we spend. All government programs would have had to have \nbeen cut 40 percent if we didn't raise the debt ceiling. Amazing as \nthat sounds, this is undisputable.\n  Republicans prevailed in their insistence that spending should be \nreduced over 10 years by an amount equal to the increase in the debt \nceiling last August. The legislation this deal produced, the Budget \nControl Act, set certain spending limits in the absence of a budget \nresolution that we should have passed in the Senate as required by law. \nSo these spending limits came into effect when the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Conrad, filed the allocation numbers into the \nCongressional Record, telling every Senate committee how much it was \nallowed to spend. That is the power given to the Budget Committee \nchairman. I am the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, and \nSenator Conrad chairs the Budget Committee.\n  So the Budget Control Act plainly dictates that beginning on October \n1 of this year, spending limits would be derived from the Congressional \nBudget Office's baseline. This is crucial because the CBO baseline \ncontains the $2.1 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years--really, \nreductions in spending growth, and not so much cuts--that the deal was \nsupposed to implement in exchange for the immediate $2.1 trillion \nraising of the debt ceiling.\n  Herein lies the scandal. Although it was buried in the spending \nallocation that Senator Conrad sent out, my staff on the Senate Budget \nCommittee discovered that Senator Conrad did not file an outlay limit \nbased on the CBO baseline. Instead, the outlay total he filed was $14 \nbillion higher--curiously matching exactly the spending levels that \nPresident Obama had requested in the budget he submitted to Congress in \nFebruary.\n  Although this discovery was not readily apparent, Chairman Conrad, to \nhis credit--he is an honorable man--does not dispute it. He simply \nasserts that it is within his discretion to unilaterally set a higher \ntotal.\n  Again, because the CBO baseline reflects the spending reductions \npassed by Congress and signed into law, an increase above the \nbaseline--as the allocation that he submitted allows--is an abrogation \nof the bipartisan agreement we reached last August.\n  We told the American people: OK, we raised the debt ceiling. A lot of \npeople didn't want to do it. A lot of Americans were hot about it. We \nsaid: But we are going to cut spending by that amount over 10 years.\n  As reported by the publication, CQ:\n\n       Conrad did not counter Sessions' claim that the elevated \n     outlay limit would allow higher spending in fiscal year 2013.\n\n  But let me emphasize, this is not just the fault of Senator Conrad. \nThis large violation of the Budget Control Act is without doubt the \ndecision of Senator Reid, the Democratic leader, his leadership team, \nand the members of the Democratic caucus who support him.\n  Remember, outlays are the spending figures which directly register on \nthe debt. Mr. President, $14 billion in higher outlays in 2013 means \n$14 billion added to the debt. It is just that simple. In fact, the \nhigher debt that will accrue next year as a result of the higher \nspending level means the amount of interest we pay on the debt we \naccrue will be greater and will also exceed CBO baseline limits.\n  As a result, the chairman had to also boost spending authority for \nthe Finance Committee by $79 million to compensate for the higher \ninterest payments on the $14 billion added to the debt. This shows that \nthe debt deal legislation has been violated not only in spirit but in \nletter. Why? Because if we increase discretionary outlays, we increase \nthe debt, and therefore increase the interest needed to service the \ndebt.\n  It is crystal clear that the legislation provides no flexibility \nwhatsoever to inflate spending authority for this interest payment. It \nis a direct violation of the Budget Control Act, but he had to do that \nto justify and account for the $14 billion increase over the level that \nwas agreed to last August.\n  I sent two letters to Chairman Conrad urging him to correct and re-\nfile the proper numbers, but it is evident that the chairman does not \nintend to do so. So we will be looking for an alternative course. This \nis a matter that ought to be considered by the full Senate, so I plan \nto pursue a vote on the inflated spending levels. Each Senator will \ntherefore have to examine their own conscience and consider their duty \nto their constituents, to the Nation, and to the financial future of \nour country.\n  Plainly, this action violates the spirit and the terms of the 10-year \nBudget Control Act agreement that was made last August, just 11 months \nago. At that time, Congress declared that we would exercise some \nspending restraint. And $2.1 trillion in reduced spending is really a \nreduction in the growth of spending and not an elimination of all \ngrowth in spending. We would go from something like $37 trillion being \nspent over 10 years to $35 trillion. It is not going to break America. \nBut to hear the wails that come about, you would think it would.\n  So the test will be, in this first year since the passage of the debt \ndeal will we adhere to its modest restrictions or will we blink?\n  We have Members of Congress--and I have raised this issue over the \nyears--who seem to take it as a personal challenge to see how they can \nspend more money than they are allocated. It happens every year. This \nis how a country goes broke. The consequences of the annual \nmanipulations and gimmicks have great impact over time. These are not \nsmall matters. Think about it.\n  This is a chart I put together. This year we are adding $14 billion \nmore to the baseline spending in our country than agreed to, and this \ngimmick adds $14 billion to the baseline next year. One may think: It \nis only $14 billion, Jeff. Calm down.\n  Alabama's general fund budget, not including education, is less than \n$2 billion. To us $14 billion is a lot of money, and we are an average-\nsized State. This is how we need to think about these manipulations \nbecause it is very significant as time goes by.\n  If we violate the baseline next year, in 2013, by $14 billion, that \ngoes into the spending level for the next year. Then if next year we \nviolate it again, it is not just $14 billion, we are adding $14 billion \non top of the $14 billion gimmick in the spending level this year. It \nis $28 billion next year. Added to the $14 billion we ripped off the \ntaxpayers the previous year, it is $42 billion.\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\n  Do you see how that goes up? Each year is adding to it, and we have \nbeen doing this kind of thing consistently.\n  If we gimmick the budget $14 billion a year--and I remember doing a \nchart similar to this about 10 years ago, and we gimmicked the budget \n$18 billion that year and there are probably other gimmicks we are not \nincluding--this $14 billion gimmick puts us on a track to add $770 \nbillion to the debt of the United States over 10 years.\n  We have to adhere to the agreements we make. If we do not stand with \nthose agreements, then we make a mockery of law, we make a mockery of \nthe Senate, we undermine the respect and trust the American people have \nin us. If we run up $770 billion more, we pay interest on that, \nestimated at $112 billion, that $14 billion gimmicked-up spending adds \n$900 billion to the debt.\n  Remember, we are in debt today. Every $1 we spend more than what we \nagree to is borrowed. Any more spending is borrowed because we are in \ndebt now--nearly 40 percent of the money we spend is borrowed. We spend \nabout $3.7 trillion and we take in about $2.4 trillion and we borrow \nthe rest. It is unsustainable.\n  Meanwhile, the President continues his call for higher taxes, saying \nthat taxing more will reduce the deficit. But his plan for the new \ntaxes he has proposed is to fund more spending, more gimmicks and more \nfraud and waste in government. I know you think that is not so--surely, \nthat is not so. That is not what the President is proposing. But, \nunlike the Democratic Senate, the President did comply with the law and \nsubmitted a budget as every President has done since the Congressional \nBudget Act was passed. He submitted a budget. What did his budget call \nfor? It called for new taxes all right. It called for $1.8 trillion in \nnew taxes over 10 years. But it also increased spending by $1.6 \ntrillion. Do you see what is happening there? The President's proposal \ncalls for $1.6 trillion in new spending, above the Budget Control Act \nlevel we agreed to in August. He proposes to wipe out the cuts. He \nproposes to spend $1.6 trillion more than we agreed to in August, and \nhe pays for it with $1.8 trillion in new taxes.\n  He didn't use his new taxes to pay down the debt. He used the new \ntaxes to fund more government, more spending. That is not what we need \nto be doing at this point in history. We should have stayed here last \nnight talking about the debt threat to America and not some \ncontroversial issue on campaign finance.\n  For 3 consecutive years, this Senate Democratic majority has refused \nto bring forth a budget plan as required by common sense and law. They \nrefuse even to write a budget and bring it to the floor for \nconsideration. They have no financial plan for the future of America.\n  Senator Reid, what is your plan? He blocked Senator Conrad, who was \nwilling and prepared to lay out a budget plan for the Democrats. He \ncalled on him not to do so. For 3 years they have not had a budget. We \ndid not even bring one up this year.\n  They treat any effort to rein in waste and abuse as evidencing a \nhatred for those who are suffering and truly in need. We want to help \npeople in need. But anybody who knows these programs, such as some of \nthe stuff that is coming out now on food stamps, knows there is waste, \nfraud and abuse and we can clean them up and save money and not hurt \npeople truly in need. From the IRS checks sent to illegal aliens that \nthe inspector general of the U.S. Treasury Department said has to end, \nto lavish GSA parties in Las Vegas, reckless abuse in the food stamp \nprogram, and now this surreptitious 14 billion debt increase, there is \nno financial accountability in Washington.\n  I will be working to erase this $14 billion spending increase. It is \nimportant. I urge my colleagues to join me so our actions will be \nconsistent with our promises to the American people made last August; \notherwise we are breaching this agreement the first year. It is always \na gimmick and a danger to spend today and promise to pay for it in the \nfuture--spend more today than the agreement called for, but we are \ngoing to pay for it in the future. It is the first year in our \nagreement and it has already been breached.\n  The best avenue may be to raise a point of order, and we will look at \nthat to see how to bring this matter before the Senate. I will be \nlooking for that opportunity. But I truly believe it is a defining \nmoment for us if we cannot adhere 1 full year to the agreement we \nreached last August and that we told the American people we would abide \nby. I think the distrust and lack of confidence by the American people, \nalready felt in Congress, will continue to further erode.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                            End Pakistan Aid\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the question remains should taxpayers be \nforced to send money overseas to countries that disrespect us or, more \nprecisely, should we borrow money from China to send it to countries \nthat disrespect us. Should we borrow money from China to send to \nPakistan? Should we borrow money from China to send to the Muslim \nBrotherhood in Egypt? Should we send good money after bad?\n  For a decade we searched for bin Laden. We spent hundreds of billions \nof dollars searching for him. Where did we find him? Not in the remote \nmountains; we found him living comfortably in a city in Pakistan. We \nfound him living in the middle of the city not far from a military \nacademy. We were helped in this search by a doctor, a brave doctor in \nPakistan by the name of Dr. Shakil Afridi, who helped us find bin \nLaden, helped us with ultimately getting bin Laden. How was he rewarded \nfor this heroism? Where is Dr. Shakil Afridi now? He has been \nimprisoned by the Pakistani Government for 33 years.\n  For 10 years we searched for bin Laden high and low throughout \nAfghanistan, throughout the world, throughout the mountains. We found \nhim living comfortably in a city only miles from a military academy, \nand then the doctor who helped us Pakistan has now imprisoned for 33 \nyears.\n  How did the President respond to this? How did President Obama's \nadministration respond to the imprisoning of this doctor, the doctor \nwho helped us get bin Laden? President Obama sent them another $1 \nbillion last week. We already sent Pakistan $2 billion, and they \ndisrespect us, so what did we do? We sent them another $1 billion. \nPeople around this town are bemoaning there is not enough money for our \nmilitary. Yet we took $1 billion out of the Defense Department, an \nextra $1 billion, and sent it to Pakistan last week. Where is Dr. \nAfridi? In jail for 33 years.\n  I have obtained the signatures necessary to have a vote on this. The \nleadership does not want to allow a vote on this, but I will, one way \nor another, get a vote on ending aid to Pakistan if they continue to \nimprison this doctor. He has an appeal that will be heard this \nThursday. If he is not successful in his appeal, if he is still \nimprisoned for life, we will have a vote in the Senate on ending all \naid to Pakistan--not a small portion of their aid, every penny of their \naid, including the $1 billion they got last week. We will attempt to \nstop all aid to Pakistan.\n  I ask any of the Senators to step forward if they think it is a good \nidea and tell the American people why they are sending their money to \nPakistan. We have bridges crumbling, we have roads crumbling, we have \nschools crumbling, and we are sending money to Pakistan, which \ndisrespected us. We spent billions, if not maybe trillions of dollars, \non the wars in Pakistan and Afghanistan trying to get bin Laden and \nthen the doctor who helps us is now in jail for 33 years.\n  Everywhere I go across our country--in my State in Kentucky we have \ntwo bridges that need to be replaced. We have one in the middle of one \nof our major cities that was closed down for 6 months last year for \nrepairs. We don't have the money to repair our infrastructure. We are \n$1 trillion short of money, period. We are borrowing over $1 trillion a \nyear. We now have a $16 trillion debt that equals our entire economy. \nYet they are still sending taxpayer money to dictators overseas who \ndisrespect us. Eighty percent of the public thinks this should come to \nan end. If we ask this question: Should we be sending this money \noverseas when we have difficulty and needs and wants at home, 80 \npercent of the public would say it should end. Yet when we force this \nbody to vote, 80 percent of\n\n[[Page S5055]]\n\nyour Representatives are for sending more aid overseas. They were all \nclamoring and clapping their hands last week when President Obama said \nhe sent another $1 billion overseas--they all stand and clap.\n  I don't think the American taxpayer is clapping. I don't think the \nAmerican taxpayer is happy we are $1 trillion in the hole and still \nsending this money overseas to countries that disrespect us.\n  What I say to Pakistan is if they want to be our ally, act like it. \nIf they want to be our ally, respect us. If they want to be our ally, \nwork with us on the war on terrorism. But if they want to be our ally, \ndon't hold Dr. Afridi, don't hold political prisoners, don't hold \npeople who are actually working with us to get bin Laden.\n  I will do everything in my power to get this vote. They don't want to \nhave this vote. They like foreign aid over here. They all love sending \ntaxpayer money overseas, but they don't want to vote on it so they have \nbeen blocking this vote and they will attempt to block my vote. I have \nthe signatures necessary and you will see me on the floor next week.\n  If Dr. Afridi is still in jail next week, I will make them vote on \nthis. It is the least taxpayers deserve. The taxpayers deserve to know \nwhy their Senators are voting to send their money overseas when we are \n$1 trillion in the hole. Why are their Senators voting to send \ntrillions of dollars to Pakistan when they imprison the guy who helped \nus get bin Laden. It is unconscionable. It has to stop. The debt is a \nthreat to taxpayers, our country, a threat to the Republic, and I will \ndo everything I can to force a vote on this and then the American \npeople can decide. They can decide whether they want to keep sending \nthese people back to Washington who are sending their money overseas to \npeople who have no respect for us.\n  I will do everything in my power to have this vote and we will record \nthe Senate. Your representatives will be recorded on whether they want \nto continue sending your money to Pakistan while Pakistan imprisons \nthis doctor who helped us get bin Laden.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                       Wind Production Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, for several weeks now I have \nspoken on the Senate floor, urging my colleagues of both parties to \nextend the wind production tax credit or, as it is known, the PTC. The \nPresiding Officer has had an opportunity to listen to me on a number of \noccasions. I thank him for his interest and support. I am here again \nthis morning to continue my work because I do not want to lose one more \nAmerican job because of our failure, Congress's failure, to act. I also \nwant to assure, as I know the Presiding Officer does, that we, the \nUnited States, remain competitive in the global clean energy economy.\n  Today, I wish to talk specifically about the PTC's impact on the \nState of Utah, one of America's fastest growing wind energy producers. \nSimilar to other Western States, including my home State of Colorado, \nUtah's geography and climate make it an ideal location for wind \nproduction. It is estimated that if fully utilized, Utah's wind \nresources could provide up to 132 percent of the current electricity \nneeds. Think about that, the entire State's electricity needs could be \nmet by wind power alone. If we look at the map of Utah that is \ndisplayed here, we will see that the largest wind projects are located \nin Beaver and Millard Counties, which are in western Utah. In those two \ncounties, the first wind corporation has constructed the Milford Wind \nProject. That project produces enough electricity to power over 64,000 \nhomes, avoids 300,000 tons of CO2 emissions and provides \ngood-paying jobs to hundreds of hard-working Utahns.\n  Beyond the obvious and enormously positive effect the Milford Wind \nProject has had on the Utah environment, it has also been an economic \nboon to the surrounding rural communities. Beaver County's tax base \nincreased so much that it allowed for a new elementary school to be \nbuilt without any tax increases to local residents. In effect, those \ntax receipts replaced a school that had fallen into disrepair.\n  This project has brought more than $50 million in economic benefits \nto Utah as a whole. It has created over 300 onsite jobs during \nconstruction and engaged more than 60 local Utah businesses throughout \nconstruction and development. That is a win-win-win situation no matter \nhow we calculate it.\n  Only if we extend the wind PTC will we continue to see the \ninvestment, job creation, and economic growth Utah has seen in recent \nyears. Now is the time for us to act to preserve and create thousands \nof jobs and to usher in a clean energy future for the American people. \nWithout our support, the growth of the wind energy industry will slow, \nand, in fact, wind energy producers likely will shed jobs and halt \nprojects.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article that was \npublished in the Wall Street Journal this week be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, July 8, 2012]\n\n                    Wind Power Faces Taxing Headwind\n\n                   (By Mark Peters and Keith Johnson)\n\n       West Branch, Iowa.--Acciona Windpower's generator-assembly \n     plant here in the heart of the corn belt is down to its last \n     domestic order as the U.S. wind energy industry faces a sharp \n     slowdown.\n       Demand for the school bus-size pods it assembles to house \n     the guts of a wind turbine is drying up as a key federal tax \n     credit nears expiration. Acciona is now banking on foreign \n     orders to keep the plant going next year, while hoping the \n     credit will be extended.\n       The debate over renewing the credit is dividing \n     Republicans, with conservative lawmakers from wind states \n     joining Democrats to push for an extension even as the \n     presumptive GOP presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, has made \n     attacks on government support for clean energy, including \n     wind, a centerpiece of his fight against President Barack \n     Obama.\n       After several years of domestic growth, the U.S. wind \n     industry faces possible layoffs and shutdowns as a key \n     federal tax credit is set to expire. Mark Peters reports from \n     West Branch, Iowa.\n       The tax policy, initiated two decades ago, currently gives \n     operators of wind farms a credit of about two cents per \n     kilowatt-hour of electricity they generate. Without the \n     credits, wind power generally can't compete on price with \n     electricity produced by coal- or natural gas-fired plants. \n     Analysts predict that if the tax credit expires on Dec. 31, \n     as it is scheduled to, installations of new equipment could \n     fall by as much as 90% next year, after what is expected to \n     be a record increase in capacity in 2012.\n       Democrats generally support federal backing for wind power \n     and other clean energy, arguing that it needs help to compete \n     with entrenched fuel sources whose environmental and health \n     impacts often aren't included in their costs. Mr. Obama has \n     made several campaign trips to Iowa, where he argued for wind \n     energy's tax credits to be extended. Most Republicans are \n     less bullish on clean energy's prospects, and say the \n     government shouldn't support technologies that aren't \n     commercially viable on their own.\n       Still wind power has vigorous support from some of the \n     reddest districts in the country, with Republican congressmen \n     in wind-power heavy states like Texas, Iowa, and Colorado \n     backing the industry tax credit.\n       Mr. Romney has criticized the Obama administration's \n     support for clean-energy subsidies. ``Solar and wind is fine \n     except it's very expensive and you can't drive a car with a \n     windmill on it,'' Mr. Romney said at a campaign event in \n     March in Youngstown, Ohio. His economic plan says wind and \n     solar power are ``sharply uncompetitive'' forms of energy, \n     whose jobs amount to a ``minuscule fraction'' of the U.S. \n     labor force. A campaign spokeswoman said Mr. Romney supports \n     ``the development of affordable and reliable energy from all \n     sources, including wind.'' He hasn't publicly called for the \n     renewal of the tax credit for wind.\n       ``That's a conversation I need to have with Gov. Romney,'' \n     said Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican and a member of the \n     House Tea Party Caucus who says 5,000 wind-industry jobs \n     statewide and locally-produced clean energy are proof of the \n     benefits of federal policies that support wind power. Iowa \n     has gained several wind-power manufacturing facilities in \n     recent years and ranks second among U.S. states in number of \n     wind farms, after Texas. Terry Branstad, the state's \n     Republican governor, also backs a renewal of the credit.\n       The production tax credit has spurred huge growth since it \n     was signed into law by President George H.W. Bush in 1992, \n     but it has kept the industry's future tied to the vagaries of \n     Congress. The credit now is caught in the congressional \n     gridlock of an election year, and a vote on renewal isn't \n     likely until after November. Even if renewed then, the \n     pipeline of projects next year is already crimped.\n       ``In some way, it's too late to save 2013 build,'' said \n     Matthew Kaplan of consultancy IHS Emerging Energy Research.\n       The credits for wind have expired three times before, most \n     recently in 2004, with new construction slowing sharply each \n     time before the credit was later renewed.\n\n[[Page S5056]]\n\n       Now the stakes are higher, because the wind industry has \n     established a manufacturing base in the U.S. to build many of \n     the 8,000 parts that go in a typical turbine. Industry data \n     show manufacturing facilities in the U.S. have more than \n     doubled since 2009 to around 470 in 2011. Meanwhile, wind's \n     share of U.S. electricity output has grown to 2.9% last year, \n     from about 1.3% in 2008, according to the Energy Information \n     Administration.\n       ``There is a lot more skin in the game,'' said Joe Baker, \n     chief executive of the North American wind power subsidiary \n     of Acciona SA, a Spanish company. Its Iowa plant gets 80% of \n     its components from North America, mostly made in the U.S. \n     Almost no components came from the U.S. when the plant opened \n     in 2008.\n       Many Republicans argue that any benefits from wind power \n     don't justify government investment. ``What do we get in \n     return for these billions of dollars of subsidies?'' Sen. \n     Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican who has long \n     criticized the tax credit for the wind industry, said in a \n     speech earlier this year. ``We get a puny amount of \n     unreliable electricity.''\n       Local communities are now fearing layoffs in the industry, \n     which employs an estimated 75,000 people nationwide. A \n     Siemens AG turbine-blade factory is the largest employer in \n     Fort Madison, Iowa, which has struggled with one of the \n     state's highest unemployment rates. Mayor Brad Randolph said \n     getting the plant ``really was a corner turner,'' but with \n     industry's current outlook ``you could see a large number of \n     employees getting laid off. That could be a game changer the \n     other way.''\n       Vestas, a Danish company that is the biggest manufacturer \n     of wind turbines in the world, employs about 1,700 people at \n     four factories in Colorado, a relatively energy-rich state \n     that has also benefited from wind's growth. Uncertainty over \n     the tax credit ``requires us to have a flexible plan for the \n     future that allows us to add, adjust or eliminate positions \n     in 2012,'' a Vestas spokesman said.\n       That uncertainty trickles down the supply chain. Walker \n     Components, a privately held company in Denver, expanded \n     operations more than two years ago to supply gear for Vestas \n     turbines. Now, like others that supply the wind industry, the \n     company is contemplating layoffs in its wind division if the \n     credit expires.\n       Acciona's Mr. Baker said a few employees recently left for \n     other jobs, telling him they wanted to be in industries with \n     more stable outlooks. ``It became an employment issue for \n     them. They're not sure. They don't like the seesaw effect,'' \n     he said.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, that article says if Congress \ndoes not promote PTC, my State could lose hundreds, if not thousands, \nof jobs. Naturally the numbers are higher with suggestions and \nestimates that we could lose 30,000 jobs.\n  The PTC is a perfect example of how Congress can play a positive, \nproductive role in encouraging economic growth and supporting American \nmanufacturing. The American people expect us to do everything we can to \ncreate jobs and economic growth. They expect us to work across the \npolitical aisle and produce results. They deserve results, and we \nshould not disappoint them by succumbing to election-year gridlock. We \nhave a solid base of bipartisan support for wind energy and for the \npassage of the wind PTC. That is why I have been urging my colleagues \nto work with me to pass it as soon as possible.\n  From Colorado and Utah to Rhode Island and beyond, the PTC has helped \nAmerican families and businesses prosper in a time when other \nindustries have faltered. The wind industry has been one of the few \nindustries of real growth in recent years, and it has so much more \npotential. Americans have said again and again that they want Congress \nto extend the wind PTC. Let's not let them down. Our economy and our \nfuture depend on it. Let's pass the PTC as soon as possible. It equals \njobs.\n  I will be back on the floor tomorrow to keep fighting for this \ncommonsense policy. Coloradans expect no less. Let's pass the \nproduction tax credit as soon as possible and protect American jobs.\n  Mr. President, if I might, I wish to turn to another topic that is on \neverybody's minds, and that is the efforts here in the U.S. Senate to \nreform the way in which our campaigns are financed and the way in which \nthat information is shared with the public.\n  Many of my colleagues took to the Senate floor last night to discuss \nthe importance of the DISCLOSE Act and to draw attention to the \nenormous volume of undisclosed money that is now flowing into this \ncampaign season and into those campaigns. Democracy is Strengthened by \nCasting Light on Spending in Elections Act or, as it is known in its \nshorter form, the DISCLOSE Act, is an important step forward.\n  It was conceived as a response to the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 \nCitizens United decision. Many of us have watched with deep concern as \nthe consequences of that decision played out this election season. \nUnlimited and often secret contributions to organizations known as \nsuper PACs are pouring into our election system and literally drowning \nout the voices of ordinary Americans who don't happen to be \nmillionaires or billionaires.\n  Instead of a system where candidates exchange ideas and share their \nvision for a more prosperous country, the Citizens United decision has \nreleased a relentless display of attack ads, and the American people \nhave no idea where they are coming from or who is footing the bill. \nThis sort of unlimited and secret influx of cash is raising the specter \nof corruption in our elections. Frankly, I am worried we are entering \nan era of politics that we haven't seen since the Watergate scandal of \nsome 40 years ago.\n  However, there is hope. Despite what I thought was a misguided \ndecision tied to Citizens United, the Supreme Court did uphold \nCongress's power to require transparency when it comes to those \nunlimited campaign dollars, and so the DISCLOSE Act was born.\n  Let me share with the viewers what the DISCLOSE Act would do. It \nwould require that super PACs, corporations, labor unions, and other \nindependent groups file a public disclosure with the Federal Election \nCommission for any campaign-related disbursement of over $10,000 or \nmore within 24 hours of the expenditure.\n  This basic requirement is designed to bring the exchange of these \nsecret campaign dollars out of the shadows so Coloradans and all the \nAmerican people know who is trying to influence our elections. That is \nit. It is simple and it makes sense. We are only asking that political \nspending and funding be disclosed and held to the same standard as \npolitical action committees and candidate expenditures. This sensible \nrequirement will not create burdensome regulations or be in conflict \nwith any of the holdings of the Supreme Court. It is the kind of \ncommonsense transparency that Coloradans are calling for.\n  It might sound cliched, but sunlight is truly the best disinfectant. \nIn fact, I heard the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, use that \nsame concept: Sunlight is truly the best disinfectant. We literally \nstep on the basic principles of democracy when we allow tens of \nmillions of dollars to be secretly spent on our elections.\n  I want to emphasize that this should not be a partisan issue. Despite \nlast night's vote, you would think we could all truly agree on \ntransparency. For example, our colleague Senator McCain has lamented \nthat without the reform of transparency, the Citizens United decision \ncould lead to a major campaign finance scandal. And, of course, that is \nnot healthy for our democracy.\n  The Supreme Court affirmed Congress's authority to require \ndisclosure, so let's do our job to protect democracy and bring sunlight \nto our elections. Let's bring the DISCLOSE Act forward and pass it \nright away.\n  I also know many Americans would like to see us overturn the effects \nof Citizens United altogether, and there are efforts to do exactly \nthat. For example, Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico has introduced a \nconstitutional amendment that would give Congress the power to regulate \npolitical spending. I support that effort. I also support an effort to \nchange the way in which we fund the Presidential elections.\n  I have introduced legislation in the Presidential Funding Act that \nwill reform the currently outdated Presidential public finance system. \nIt is a bill that is aimed at preserving the voices of average \nAmericans.\n  In 1974 the Presidential public campaign finance system was developed \nin an effort to restore public faith in elected officials after the \nWatergate scandal, and it has been used in nearly every Presidential \nelection since. By establishing public financing, we allow candidates \nto compete based on their ideas instead of competing on who has the \nmost support from special interests and deep-pocket donors.\n  In fact, my father, Congressman Morris Udall, who served in the House \nrepresenting the second district in Arizona for some 30 years, was \nactually\n\n[[Page S5057]]\n\none of the first to use the public financing system, which he had \nhelped craft 2 years prior when he ran for the Democratic nomination in \n1976. My father was a big believer in running for office on behalf of \nhis constituents instead of on behalf of big money. I believe strongly \nthat ethos ought to apply to today's elected officials more than ever.\n  The public financing system funded candidates for 30 years and has \nenriched the political discourse for the country by ensuring that the \nAmerican people have more say than connected insiders, special \ninterests, or wealthy donors. Unfortunately, the current system's \nability to keep up with the enormous spending required in Presidential \ncampaigns has rendered it less effective. Thanks to Citizens United, \npublic financing is no longer a viable option to compete against \nunlimited special interest dollars.\n  My legislation would strengthen the public financing system and \nincentivize candidates to obtain support from actual citizens, not \nspecial interest super PACs or secret financiers. It would ensure that \nour proven public financing system will be available for future \nelections, and that corporate and special-interest money doesn't drown \nout genuine ideas and debates in our Presidential elections.\n  For those of us who are committed to fixing our campaign finance \nsystem in the wake of Citizens United, there is a lot of challenging \nwork ahead. I know Coloradans agree with me that reform could be the \nsingle most important issue to fix the way our democracy functions. As \nI have suggested, and as we know, unfortunately Federal elections are \nincreasingly about who can secretly appeal more to wealthy and special \ninterests instead of working to improve the lives of average and hard-\nworking Americans. This sows corruption, dysfunction, and a government \nthat is less responsive to the needs of the people.\n  Today we have an opportunity to start with a sensible requirement \nthat we should all be able to agree on. Disclosure is nothing to be \nafraid of. I urge my colleagues to reconsider their vote and to allow \nthe Senate to at least debate the DISCLOSE Act. We cannot afford to let \nanother filibuster stand in the way of fair and open campaigns. Let's \npass the DISCLOSE Act and take a big step toward turning the power of \nour government back over to the American people.\n  I note that the leader of this important effort, the DISCLOSE Act, \nSenator Whitehouse of Rhode Island, is on the floor. I thank the \nSenator for his leadership and his commitment to ensuring that it is \nthe American people who determine our future, not special interests, \nsuper PACs, millionaires, billionaires, and financiers who leave no \ntrack and no trace of where their money is going and where it is coming \nfrom.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nColorado for his impassioned and eloquent support.

When we take that experiment of liberty and turn it \nover to the special interests, it is a grave occasion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe Chairman Leahy will shortly \nbe joining us to discuss the DISCLOSE Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an op-ed piece authored by former \nSenator Warren Rudman and former Senator Chuck Hagel--two former \nRepublican Senators who distinguished themselves in this body and have \ngotten together to write an article about the DISCLOSE Act--be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 16, 2012]\n\n               For Political Closure, We Need Disclosure\n\n                   (By Warren Rudman and Chuck Hagel)\n\n       Since the beginning of the current election cycle, \n     extremely wealthy individuals, corporations and trade \n     unions--all of them determined to influence who is in the \n     White House next year--have spent more than $160 million \n     (excluding party expenditures). That's an incredible amount \n     of money.\n       To put it in perspective, at this point in 2008, about $36 \n     million had been spent on independent expenditures \n     (independent meaning independent of a candidate's campaign). \n     In all of 2008, in fact, only $156 million was spent this \n     way. In other words, we've already surpassed 2008, and it's \n     July.\n       In the near term, there's nothing we can do to reverse this \n     dramatic increase in independent expenditures.\n       Yet what really alarms us about this situation is that we \n     can't find out who is behind these blatant attempts to \n     control the outcome of our elections. We are inundated with \n     extraordinarily negative advertising on television every \n     evening and have no way to know who is paying for it and what \n     their agenda might be. In fact, it's conceivable that we have \n     created such a glaring loophole in our election process that \n     foreign interests could directly influence the outcome of our \n     elections. And we might not even know it had happened until \n     after the election, if at all.\n       This is because unions, corporations, ``super PACs'' and \n     other organizations are able to make unlimited independent \n     expenditures on our elections without readily and openly \n     disclosing where the money they are spending is coming from. \n     As a result, we are unable to get the information we need to \n     decide who should represent us and take on our country's \n     challenges.\n       Unlike the unlimited amount of campaign spending, the lack \n     of transparency in campaign spending is something we can fix \n     and fix right now--without opening the door to more scrutiny \n     by the Supreme Court.\n       A bill being debated this week in the Senate, called the \n     Disclose Act of 2012, is a well-researched, well-conceived \n     solution to this insufferable situation. Unfortunately, on \n     Monday, the Senate voted, mostly along party lines, to block \n     the bill from going forward. But the Disclose Act is not \n     dead. As of now, it is 9 short of the 60 votes it needs.\n       The bill was introduced by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, \n     Democrat of Rhode Island, who deserves tremendous credit for \n     crafting such comprehensive legislation, listening to his \n     critics and amending his bill to address their concerns in a \n     bold display of compromise. At its core, Whitehouse's bill \n     would require any ``covered organization'' which spends \n     $10,000 or more on a ``campaign-related disbursement'' to \n     file a disclosure report with the Federal Election Commission \n     within 24 hours of the expenditure, and to file a new report \n     for each additional $10,000 or more that is spent. The F.E.C. \n     must post the report on its Web site within 24 hours of \n     receiving it.\n       A ``covered organization'' includes any corporation, labor \n     organization, section 501(c) organization, super PAC or \n     section 527 organization.\n       This is a huge improvement over the status quo, where super \n     PACS currently have months to disclose their donors (often \n     withholding this information until after an election) and \n     501(c) organizations have no requirement to disclose their \n     donors at all.\n       The report must include the name of the covered \n     organization, the name of the candidate, the election to \n     which the spending pertains, the amount of each disbursement \n     of\n\n[[Page S5058]]\n\n     more than $1,000, and a certification by the head of the \n     organization that the disbursement was not coordinated. The \n     report must also reveal the identity of all donors who have \n     given more than $10,000 to the organization.\n       We have no doubt that the Disclose Act will be spared any \n     credible constitutional challenges if it were to pass the \n     Senate and the House. In its Citizens United decision, the \n     Supreme Court, by an 8-1 majority, upheld the provisions of \n     federal law that require outside spending groups to disclose \n     their expenditures on electioneering communications, \n     including the donors financing those expenditures. Justice \n     Anthony Kennedy, writing for the Court, noted that these \n     provisions ``impose no ceiling on campaign-related \n     activities'' and ``do not prevent anyone from speaking.''\n       We believe that every senator should embrace the Disclose \n     Act of 2012. This legislation treats trade unions and \n     corporations equally and gives neither party an advantage. It \n     is good for Republicans and it is good for Democrats. Most \n     important, it is good for the American people.\n       What's more, every senator considering re-election faces \n     the possibility of being blindsided by a well-funded, \n     anonymous campaign challenging his or her record, integrity \n     or both. The act under consideration would prevent this from \n     happening to anyone running for Congress.\n       Without the transparency offered by the Disclose Act of \n     2012, we fear long-term consequences that will hurt our \n     democracy profoundly. We're already seeing too many of our \n     former colleagues leaving public office because the \n     partisanship has become stifling and toxic. If campaigning \n     for office continues to be so heavily affected by anonymous \n     out-of-district influences running negative advertising, we \n     fear even more incumbents will decline to run and many of our \n     most capable potential leaders will shy away from elective \n     office.\n       No thinking person can deny that the current situation is \n     unacceptable and intolerable. We urge all senators to engage \n     in a bipartisan effort to enact this critically needed \n     legislation. The Disclose Act of 2012 is a prudent and \n     important first step in restoring some sanity to our \n     democratic process.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I think what I would like to do is actually share \nsome of the thoughts from it.\n  Here is what Senator Rudman and Senator Hagel, two former Republican \nSenators, say:\n\n       Since the beginning of the current election cycle, \n     extremely wealthy individuals, corporations and trade \n     unions--all of them determined to influence who is in the \n     White House next year--have spent more than $160 million.\n       Excluding party expenditures.\n       That's an incredible amount of money.\n       To put it in perspective, at this point in 2008, about $36 \n     million had been spent on independent expenditures.\n       Independent meaning independent of a candidate's campaign.\n       In all of 2008, in fact, only $156 million was spent this \n     way.

Unfortunately, on Monday the Senate voted, \nmostly along party lines, to block the bill from going forward. But the \nDISCLOSE Act is not dead. As of now, it is 9 short of the 60 votes it \nneeds.\n  They then describe the bill and continue:\n\n       We believe that every senator should embrace the DISCLOSE \n     Act of 2012. This legislation treats trade unions and \n     corporations equally and gives neither party an advantage. It \n     is good for Republicans and it is good for Democrats. Most \n     important, it is good for the American people.\n       What's more, every Senator considering re-election faces \n     the possibility of being blindsided by a well-funded, \n     anonymous campaign, challenging his or her record, integrity, \n     or both. The act under consideration would prevent this from \n     happening to anyone running for Congress.\n       Without the transparency offered by the DISCLOSE Act of \n     2012, we fear long-term consequences that will hurt our \n     democracy profoundly. We are already seeing too many of our \n     former colleagues leaving public office because the \n     partisanship has become stifling and toxic.

We urge all senators to engage \n     in a bipartisan effort to enact this critically needed \n     legislation. The DISCLOSE Act of 2012 is a prudent and \n     important first step in restoring some sanity to our \n     Democratic process.\n\n  Then the article closes by identifying the authors: Former Senator \nWarren Rudman, Republican of New Hampshire, is a chairman of Americans \nfor Campaign Reform, and former Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of \nNebraska, introduced disclosure legislation in 2001.\n  While we await my colleagues who are scheduled to come to the floor, \nlet me add that it is not unique or unusual that Senators Rudman and \nHagel, former Republican Senators, should be supportive of the DISCLOSE \nAct and of disclosure of who is making these massive, now secret, \ncontributions to buy influence in our elections. First of all, it is \nnot surprising because it is so darned obvious. It should be obvious to \nany thinking person, as Senators Rudman and Hagel said, that when \nsomebody is spending the kind of money that is being spent--a single \ndonor making, for instance, a $4 million anonymous contribution--they \nare not doing that out of the goodness of their heart. They are not \ndoing that just for the sheer fun of it. They are doing that because \nthey have a motive. One doesn't spend $4 million in politics if one \ndoesn't have a motive. If one thinks otherwise, one really needs to \nwake up and have a cup of coffee.\n  If we add to that the insistence on the funding being secret, there \nis only one reasonable conclusion that a thinking person can draw about \nwhy somebody who is spending that kind of money with a motive would \nwant their spending and their identity to be secret, and that is \nbecause the motive is a crummy motive. It is a lousy motive for the \nAmerican people. If the American people were excited about the motive, \nthey wouldn't want to keep it secret. It is only because they want to \ndo bad deeds in the dark.\n  When time permits again, I will go through some of the Republican \nSenators who have spoken out in favor of disclosure and transparency in \nthe past. We all know from the debate last night that the minority \nleader has--and I will yield to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nas soon as he is prepared--Senator Alexander has been on record, as \nwell as Senator Chambliss, Senator Sessions, Senator Cornyn, Senator \nMurkowski, Senator Collins, Senator Brown of Massachusetts, Senator \nCoburn, and, of course, most prominently and most courageously over a \nlong period of time and with great distinction, Senator John McCain.\n  So at this moment, I will yield to my distinguished chairman and \nfriend, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I appreciate him \ngiving his voice to this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from Rhode \nIsland has done. He has been a champion on this not only in the public \nforum on this floor of the Senate, but he has been a champion in the \ncloakrooms, in the committee rooms; everywhere we have been speaking \nabout it, he has been most consistent. The people of Rhode Island are \nvery fortunate to have somebody with such a strong voice.\n  For the last two and a half years, the American people have seen the \ndevastating effects of the Citizens United decision. That decision by \nfive Supreme Court Justices overturned a century of laws--a century of \nlaws that have been supported by Republicans and Democrats alike--\ndesigned to protect our elections from corporate\n\n[[Page S5059]]\n\nspending. And what these five men did is they unleashed a massive flood \nof corporate money into our elections.\n  Now, many of us in the Congress and around the country were worried \nat the time of the Citizens United decision that it turned on its head \nthe idea of government of, by, and for the people. We worried that the \ndecision created new rights for Wall Street at the expense of people on \nMain Street. We worried that powerful corporate megaphones could drown \nout the voices and interests of individual Americans. I wish I didn't \nhave to say this, but two and a half years later, it is clear these \nworries were supremely valid, and the damage is devastatingly real.\n  Since the Citizens United decision struck down longstanding \nprohibitions on corporations from direct spending in political \ncampaigns, hundreds of millions of dollars from undisclosed and \nunaccountable sources have flooded the airwaves with a barrage of \nnegative advertisements. Nobody who has watched our elections or even \ntried to watch television since the Citizens United decision can deny \nthe enormous impact that decision has had on our political process. \nEverywhere I go in Vermont, people say: Who is behind these ads? Many \nof them find them offensive in Vermont.\n  They say: Who is behind these ads?\n  I say: I don't know.\n  They say: Well, you are a U.S. Senator. What do you mean you don't \nknow?\n  I say: Because the Supreme Court has allowed people to hide who is \npaying for them, even though they are doing it to advance their \neconomic interests, often to the exclusion of everybody else's; even \nthough they are wanting to give themselves an advantage that all the \nrest of the people won't have.\n  Nobody who has strained to hear the voices of the voters lost among \nthe flood of noise from super PACs can deny that by extending first \namendment rights in the political process to corporations, the Supreme \nCourt put at risk the rights of individual Americans to speak to each \nother and, crucially, to be heard. Yet, just last month, without a \nhearing--without even allowing Americans' voices to be heard--the same \nfive Justices who in Citizens United ran roughshod over longstanding \nprecedent to strike down key provisions of our bipartisan campaign \nfinance laws doubled down on Citizens United when they summarily struck \ndown a 100-year-old Montana State law barring corporate contributions \nto political campaigns--a State law that had been enacted by the people \nof Montana because they had seen the pervasive and sometimes evil \neffects of these corporate contributions. In doing so, they broke down \nthe last public safeguards preventing corporate megaphones from \ndrowning out the voices of hard-working Americans.\n  There is no doubt about it. In our State of Vermont, we have a town \nmeeting day. People come in. They can express any view they want, but \nyou know who is expressing it. You know whether it is John Jones or \nMary Smith. You know if it is the head of a local company or somebody \nspeaking for a workers union. You know who is speaking, and you know \nthat you have just as much right and ability to answer as they did in \nspeaking. Now we are saying: No, no; unless you are a wealthy \ncorporation willing to hide who is speaking, you are not going to be \nheard.\n  The Supreme Court decisions not only go against longstanding laws and \nlegal precedence but also common sense. Contrary to at least what one \ncandidate has said, corporations are not people. Corporations are not \nthe same as individual Americans. Corporations do not have the same \nrights, the same morals, or the same interests. Corporations cannot \nvote in our democracy. We could elect General Eisenhower as President, \nbut General Electric and General Motors cannot serve as the President. \nBut if you go to the logic of these Supreme Court decisions, it \nvirtually says: Let's elect General Electric or General Motors as \nPresident. The fact is, these are artificial legal constructs meant to \nfacilitate business. The Founders understood this. The Founders knew we \nwere not going to allow corporations either to vote or to take over our \nelectoral process. Vermonters and Americans across this great country \nhave long understood this. Apparently five members of the Supreme Court \ndid not understand this.\n  Like most Vermonters, Republicans and Democrats alike, I strongly \nbelieve something must be done to address the divisive and corrosive \ndecision of the Supreme Court in Citizens United. That decision was \nwrong, the damage must be repaired, and the harmful ways it is skewing \nthe democratic process must be fixed. That is why I held the first \ncongressional hearing on that terrible decision in the weeks after it \nwas issued. That is why we have scheduled a hearing next week in the \nSenate Judiciary Committee's constitution subcommittee, led by the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, to look at proposals \nfor constitutional amendments to address Citizens United.\n  But today, without waiting the years and years and years that a \nconstitutional amendment might take, the Senate can take action. By \npassing the DISCLOSE Act, we can restore transparency and \naccountability to campaign finance laws by ensuring that all Americans \nknow who is paying for campaign ads. It is a crucial step toward \nrestoring the ability of Vermonters and all American voters to be able \nto speak, be heard and to hear competing voices, and not be drowned out \nby powerful corporate interests. For any of us who are in an election, \nwe expect our opponent to be able to speak out, and the public expects \nit. They want to hear from both of us. And they should. That is why we \nhave debates. That is why we have candidate forums. But it all becomes \nirrelevant if you have a huge megaphone, paid for by anonymous donors, \nanonymous corporations.\n  When I cosponsored the first DISCLOSE Act after the Supreme Court's \ndecision in 2010, I hoped Republicans would join with Democrats to \nmitigate the impact of the Citizens United decision. From the depths of \nthe Watergate scandal forward, until only recently, the principle of \ndisclosure was a bipartisan value. A clear-cut reform such as the \nDISCLOSE Act would have easily drawn bipartisan support in those days \nafter Watergate. I hoped that Senate Republicans, like my friend from \nArizona, Senator John McCain, who once championed the bipartisan \nMcCain-Feingold campaign finance law, which I supported, would join \nwith us to help ensure that corporations could not abuse their newfound \nconstitutional rights. Regrettably, every single Republican joined to \nsuccessfully filibuster the DISCLOSE Act in 2010, and despite a \nmajority in the House and a majority in the Senate and the American \npeople voting and being in favor of passing this disclosure law, it \nfell one vote short from breaking a Republican filibuster in the \nSenate--one vote, but not a single Republican would stand and help us \nrestore some of the core disclosure aspects of McCain-Feingold.\n  Senate Republicans are continuing their filibuster of this \ncommonsense legislation. By filibustering it, they deny the American \npeople an open, public, and meaningful debate on the importance of \ntransparency and accountability in our elections. Last night they again \nfilibustered this bill even though a majority in this Senate voted in \nfavor of it. In fact, they refused to even proceed to debate on the \nbill in the Senate.\n  Despite the clear impact of waves of unaccountable corporate campaign \nspending that has led Senator McCain to now concede that super PACs are \n``disgraceful,'' a minority in the Senate, consisting exclusively of \nRepublicans, continue to prevent passage of this important law. Why are \nthey against this bill? Why, when so many Senators of both parties used \nto champion disclosure laws and Senators of both parties used to \nsupport knowing who is paying for campaign ads, do they continue to \nprevent us from having a debate? Why, when the Supreme Court made clear \neven in the Citizens United decision that disclosure laws are \nconstitutional, does the Senate Republican leadership insist on \nstalling the reform?\n  What happened to those Americans who said that our elections should \nbe open? What happened to those Americans who said we ought to know who \nis involved in these elections? There should be only one thing secret \nin our elections: your secret vote, your right to vote in secret--one \nperson, one vote. But nothing should say that there\n\n[[Page S5060]]\n\nshould be a powerful, hidden, secret hand overwhelming the voters of \nAmerica in telling them how they should vote.\n  We know disclosure laws can work because they do work for individual \nAmericans donating directly to political campaigns. Mr. President, when \nyou or I give money directly to a political candidate, our donation is \nnot hidden. It is publicly disclosed. And that candidate--people can \nlook at who has supported him or her, and that goes into their thoughts \nas to whether they will vote for them. Yet those who oppose the \nDISCLOSE Act are standing up for special rights for corporations and \nwealthy donors--rights, Mr. President, you and I do not have.\n  We have seen since Citizens United that the line the Supreme Court \nimagined existed between individual campaigns and the super PACs is an \nall but meaningless one, as super PACs have poured more and more money \ninto influencing election campaigns. In reality, super PACs have simply \nbecome a way to funnel secret, massive, nondisclosed donations to \npolitical campaigns. The Citizens United decision has allowed \ncorporations and large donors to evade the disclosure laws that apply \nto you and me by giving money to groups that then fund super PACs, as a \nway of laundering the money and keeping secret the real funders of \nthese campaign ads.\n  If the average Vermonter wants to contribute to my campaign or my \nopponent's campaign, that is going to be public. People are going to \nknow, and they will make their decisions. Part of their decision will \nbe based on who supports us. But when you have a secret--a secret--\nwealthy entity supporting you, nobody knows who it is. And none of \nthese entities use their real names. They are always for good \ngovernment, for clean air, for motherhood and apple pie, for the sun \nrising in the east and setting in the west. There is no reason those \nfunding these super PACs should not be bound by the same disclosure \nrules for giving directly to campaigns. Public disclosure of donations \nto candidates has never chilled campaign funding, and it has never \nprevented millions of Americans from participating openly. I follow a \nrule of releasing every single donor to my campaign, and I think we had \none for 85 cents once that got disclosed.\n  We have seen some on the other side of this debate disgracefully \ncompare the attempt we are making--to ensure that the same disclosure \nlaws that apply to you and me also apply to corporations--to the \nshameful effort in the 1950s and 1960s to keep African Americans from \nexercising their right to vote. There the chilling effect often took \nthe form of violence. We all remember the bridge at Selma and the blood \nthat was spilled in the long effort for voting rights that led to the \nVoting Rights Act. At a time when we are seeing a renewed effort to \ndeny millions of Americans their right to vote through voter purges and \nvoter ID laws that serve as modern-day poll taxes, the comparison some \nhave made between our effort to bring sunlight and those evil days is \nas shameful as it is wrong.\n  When the race is on for secret money and election campaigns are won \nor lost by who can collect the largest amount of secret donations, it \nputs at risk government of, by, and for the people. Now, our ballots \nshould be secret but not massive corporate campaign contributions.\n  I can tell you what I am fighting for. While too many Vermonters and \nother Americans are still looking for work, we need to continue looking \nfor ways to spur job growth and economic investment in this country. We \nhave to continue our efforts to increase jobs, reduce unemployment, and \nsupport hard-working American families struggling to keep food on the \ntable and a roof over their heads. We have to protect Americans' access \nto clean air and clean water. We have to fight for their economic \nsecurity by protecting Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. We need \nto work together to move forward with reasonable policies to bolster \neconomic growth and development and by ending the Bush tax cuts for the \nwealthiest Americans--the tax cuts we cannot afford that contributed to \nthe financial crisis facing us today.\n  That is what I am fighting for and I will keep on fighting for those \nthings. What are the secret sources of funding for the super PACs \nfighting for? What do they expect to gain from hundreds of millions in \ncampaign ads? And why are they hiding?\n  Vermont is a small State. It would not take more than a tiny fraction \nof the corporate money flooding the airwaves in other States to \noutspend all of our local candidates combined. I know that the people \nof Vermont, like all Americans, take seriously their civic duty to \nchoose wisely on election day. That is why more than 60 Vermont towns \npassed resolutions on Town Meeting Day calling for action to address \nCitizens United. Like all Vermonters, I cherish the voters' role in the \ndemocratic process and am a staunch believer in the first amendment. \nThe rights of Vermonters and all Americans to speak to each other and \nto be heard should not be undercut by corporate spending.\n  I hope that Republicans who have seen the impact of waves of \nunaccountable corporate campaign spending reconsider their filibuster \nof a debate on this important legislation. I hope Republican Senators \nwill let us vote on the DISCLOSE Act and help us take an important step \nto ensure the ability of every American to be heard and to be able to \nmeaningfully participate in free and fair elections.\n  Mr. President, I yield to Senator Whitehouse.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Leahy.\n  I ask unanimous consent, in terms of scheduling floor time, that \nSenator Manchin of West Virginia be recognized now for up to 5 minutes; \nthat Senator McCain, if he is on the floor, be recognized at the \nconclusion of Senator Manchin's 5-minute period; and if Senator McCain \nis not present on the floor, that I be recognized in his stead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the disturbing \nrole that money is playing in our politics, especially when it comes to \nanonymous groups with deep pockets that are trying to tear people down. \nThere is no question this is a corrosive situation and it is hurting \nour democracy.\n  When you have unaccountable outside groups with virtually unlimited \npockets, more and more lawmakers--all of us included--have to spend \nmore time dialing for dollars that takes us away from legislating. That \nis simply backwards, sir. Elected officials should be working on fixing \nour problems, not having to worry every minute of every day about \nraising money so you can be protective or fend off people who are \nattacking you. And the effects are very clear: This Congress has \nstalled when it comes to tackling our biggest problems as a nation, but \nwe are raising more money in politics than ever before.\n  Those priorities in my State of West Virginia are totally out of \norder, and we need to do something to change the system. I am not alone \nwith this concern. In private, I have talked to my fellow Senators on \nboth sides, Democrats and Republicans, who basically say they are \nspending more time raising money for reelection and that constant \nfundraising events interfere with the everyday business of governing \nthis great Nation in the time they are spending to do that.\n  I try to spend time in my great State of West Virginia every weekend. \nI can tell you the people of West Virginia are also deeply troubled by \nthe increasing role money is playing in our politics. Ever since the \nSupreme Court decision on the Citizens United campaign finance case, we \nhave seen outside groups unleash an unprecedented flood of money to \nsway elections, and we have seen it time and again in West Virginia \nover the past several years.\n  I was deeply troubled by some statistics about how few Americans are \ninvolved in financing elections. This is cited by Professor Lawrence \nLessig, a campaign finance expert, in The Atlantic.\n  Let me put this issue in perspective for our viewers and my \ncolleagues. The population of this country is approximately 311 million \npeople. We live in this great United States of America. A tiny number \nof those Americans--only 806,000 people out of the 311 million--give \nmore than $200 to a congressional campaign. To break that down even \nfurther, only 155,000 out of the 311 million contribute the maximum \namount to any congressional candidate.\n\n[[Page S5061]]\n\n  Then look at the people who participate in a number of elections who \ngive more than $10,000 in an election cycle--the maximum they can give \nto a candidate and to other candidates--and of those people in the \nUnited States of America out of the 311 million, only 31,000 Americans \ndo that.\n  Let me break it down to even the super PACs--the money that comes \nfrom the super PACs. Just in this Presidential election so far, there \nare only 196 Americans out of 311 million--only 196 people--who have \ngiven hundreds of millions of dollars. They account for 80 percent of \nthe funding so far. That is unheard of.\n  First of all, let me thank Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island. He has \nbeen truly a champion of common sense, bringing this together and \nbringing all sides together. Some of my friends would say spending \nmoney to influence an election is their first amendment right of \nfreedom of speech. To my friends, I understand and respect their \nconcerns. But I truly believe the DISCLOSE Act will not limit their \nfreedom of speech. Instead, it will prevent the anonymous political \ncampaigning that is undermining our democracy.\n  The people of West Virginia believe we need openness and transparency \nto stay informed and keep our democracy strong, and the DISCLOSE Act \nwould do that. The people of this country have a right to know who is \nspending large amounts of money to influence elections. This bill would \nmake the information available.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. In fact, the measure is quite simple. Anytime an \norganization or individual spends $10,000 or more on a campaign-related \nexpense--that is the issue that is very important, campaign-related \nexpense--they have to file a disclosure report with the Federal \nElections Commission within 24 hours. Every one of us who runs for \noffice has to disclose every penny we get. It should be that way. Some \nStates, such as our sister State of Virginia, already have a \ntransparency and disclosure law, and it has not stifled free speech \nthere, nor does this provision affect organizations' regular \noperations. The disclosure is only required when organizations and \nindividuals spend money on campaigns or try to influence elections.\n  Instead, this bill makes sure every person and organization plays \nfairly and by the same rules. Whether those organizations or \nindividuals are in the middle, the left, the right, forward, backward \nor upside down, they have to play by the same rules.\n  In fact, I truly believe this provision will take an important step \nforward to increase transparency and accountability. That seems only \nright and fair to me. I am proud to cast my vote in favor of the \nDISCLOSE Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, here we are with 41 months of over 8 \npercent unemployment in America, and the national defense authorization \nbill is languishing in the shadows while we continue to have this \ndebate and, obviously, there is no doubt in most people's minds that--\nwith the full knowledge of the sponsors of this legislation that it \nwill not pass--it is obviously for certain political purposes.\n  I oppose cloture on the motion. My reasons for opposing this motion \nare simple, even though the subject of campaign finance reform is not. \nIn its current form, the DISCLOSE Act is closer to a clever attempt at \npolitical gamesmanship than actual reform.\n  By conveniently setting high thresholds for reporting requirements, \nthe DISCLOSE Act forces some entities to inform the public about the \norigins of their financial support, while allowing others--most notably \nthose affiliated with organized labor--to fly below the Federal \nElection Commission's regulatory radar.\n  My colleagues are aware that I have a long history of fighting for \ncampaign finance reform and to break the influence of money in American \npolitics. Regardless of what the U.S. Supreme Court may do or say, I \ncontinue to be proud of my record because I believe the cause to \nimprove our democracy and further empower the citizens of our country \nwas and continues to be worth fighting for.\n  But let's be clear. Reforms that we have successfully enacted over \nthe years have not cured all the public cynicism about the state of \npolitics in our country. No legislative measure or Supreme Court \ndecision will completely free politics from influence peddling or the \nappearance of it. But I do believe that fair and just reforms will move \nmany Americans, who have grown more and more disaffected from the \npractices and institutions of our democracy, to begin to get a clearer \nunderstanding of whether their elected representatives value their \ncommitment to our Constitution more than their own incumbency.\n  For far too long, money and politics have been deeply intertwined. \nAnyone who has ever run for a Federal office will assure us of the fact \nthat candidates come to Washington not seeking wisdom or ideas but \nbecause they need help raising money. The same candidates will most \nlikely tell us they are asked one question when they announce they are \ngoing to seek office. Unfortunately, it is not how they feel about \ntaxes or what is their opinion of the role of government. No, the \nquestion they are asked is: How are you going to raise the money? \nCouple that sad reality with the dawn of the super PAC spending from \ncorporate treasuries and record spending by big labor and one can \neasily see a major scandal is not far off, and there will be a scandal, \nmark my words. The American people know it and I know it.\n  Reform is necessary, but it must be fair and just and this \nlegislation is not. I say that from many years of experience on this \nissue.\n  A recent Wall Street Journal article by Tom McGinty and Brody \nMullins, titled ``Political Spending by Unions Far Exceeds Direct \nDonations,'' noted that organized labor spent about four times as much \non politics and lobbying as originally thought--$4.4 billion from 2005 \nto 2011. According to the Wall Street Journal's analysis, unions are \nspending far more money on a wider range of political activities than \nwhat is reported to the Federal Election Commission. The report plainly \nstates:\n\n       This kind of spending, which is on the rise, has enabled \n     the largest unions to maintain and in some cases increase \n     their clout in Washington and state capitals, even though \n     unionized workers make up a declining share of the workforce. \n     The result is that labor could be a stronger counterweight \n     than commonly realized to ``super PACs'' that today raise \n     millions from wealthy donors, in many cases to support \n     Republican candidates and causes.\n       The hours spent by union employees working on political \n     matters were equivalent in 2010 to a shadow army much larger \n     than President Obama's current re-election staff, data \n     analyzed by the Journal show.\n\n  The report goes on to note:\n\n       Another difference is that companies use their political \n     money differently than unions do, spending a far larger share \n     of it on lobbying, while not undertaking anything equivalent \n     to unions' drives to persuade members to vote as the \n     leadership dictates. Corporations and their employees also \n     tend to spread their donations fairly evenly between the two \n     major parties, unlike unions, which overwhelmingly assist \n     Democrats. In 2008, Democrats received 55 percent of the $2 \n     billion contributed by corporate PACs and company employees, \n     while labor unions were responsible for $75 million in \n     political donations, with 92 percent of it going to \n     Democrats.\n       The traditional measure of unions' political spending--\n     reports filed by the FEC--undercounts the effort unions pour \n     into politics because the FEC reports are mostly based on \n     donations unions make to individual candidates from their \n     PACs, as well as spending on campaign advertisements.\n       Unions spend millions of dollars yearly paying teams of \n     political hands to contact members, educating them about \n     election issues and trying to make sure they vote for union-\n     endorsed candidates.\n       Such activities are central to unions' political power: The \n     proportion of members who vote as the leadership prefers has \n     ranged from 68 percent to 74 percent over the past decades at \n     AFL-CIO-affiliated unions, according to statistics from the \n     labor federation.\n\n  Additionally, a February 22, 2012, Washington Post article, titled \n``Union Spending for Obama, Democrats Could Top $400 million in 2012 \nElection.'' AFSCME reportedly expects to spend $100 million ``on \npolitical action, including television advertising, phone banks and \nmember canvassing, while the SEIU plans to spend at least $85 million \nin 2012.\n  With that analysis, combined with the $1.1 billion the unions \nreported to\n\n[[Page S5062]]\n\nthe FEC from 2005 to 2011, and the additional $3.3 billion unions \nreported to the Labor Department over the same period on political \nactivity, the need for equal treatment of political advocacy under the \nlaw becomes readily apparent. I repeat, the need for equal treatment of \npolitical advocacy under the law becomes readily apparent.\n  Given the strength and political muscle behind all these figures, it \nis easy to understand why disclosure may sound nice, but unless the \ntreatment is completely fair, taking into account the diverse nature \nand purpose of different types of organizations, disclosure \nrequirements will likely be used to give one side a political advantage \nover another. That is just one of the flaws of the bill before us \ntoday.\n  The DISCLOSE Act would have little impact on unions because of the \nconvenient thresholds for reporting. But it would have a huge effect on \nassociations and other advocacy groups. From my own experience, I can \nstate without question that real reform--and, in particular, campaign \nfinance reform--will never be attained without equal treatment of both \nsides. A half dose of campaign finance reform will be quickly--and \nrightly--labeled as political favoritism and will undermine future \nopportunities for true progress. Furthermore, these sorts of games and \nmeasures will only make the American people more cynical and have less \nfaith in what we do.\n  The authors of this bill insist it is fair and not designed to \nbenefit one party over the other. Sadly, the stated intent doesn't \ncomport with the facts. The DISCLOSE Act is written to burden labor \nunions significantly less than the other groups. In the United States, \nthere are roughly 14 million to 16 million union members, each of whom \nis required to pay dues to its local union chapter. Historically, these \nlocal union chapters send a portion of their revenues up to their \naffiliated larger ``international'' labor unions. And while each union \nmember's dues may be modest, the amounts that ultimately flow up to the \ncentral political arms are vast. The DISCLOSE Act protects this flow of \nmoney in two distinct ways: No. 1, organizations that engage in \npolitical conduct are only required to disclose payments to it that \nexceed $10,000 in a 2-year election cycle, meaning the local union \nchapter will not be required to disclose the payments of individual \nunion members to the union even if those funds will be used for \npolitical purposes.\n  What is the final difference between one $10,000 check and 1,000 $10 \nchecks? Other than the impact on trees, very little. So why should one \nbe free from having to disclose its origin?\n  No. 2, the bill exempts from the disclosure requirements transfers \nfrom affiliates that do not exceed $50,000 for a 2-year election cycle. \nAs a result, unions would not have to disclose the transfers made to it \nby many of its smaller local chapters. Given the contrast between union \nand corporate structures, this would allow unions to fall beneath the \nbill's threshold limits. For local union chapters, this anonymity is \nprobably pretty important because, among other effects, it prevents \nunion chapter members from learning how much of their dues payments are \nbeing used on political activities.\n  While the exemptions outlined in the DISCLOSE Act may be facially \napplied to business organizations and associations, it is apparent to \nme the unions' unique pyramid-style, ground-up, money-funneling \nstructure would allow unions to not be treated equally by the DISCLOSE \nAct. Unlike unions, most organizations do not have thousands of local \naffiliates where they can pull up to $50,000 in ``affiliate \ntransfers.''\n  I have been involved in the issue of campaign finance reform for most \nof my career. I am proud of my record. I am supportive of measures \nwhich call for full and complete disclosure of all spending in Federal \ncampaigns. I reaffirmed this commitment by submitting an amicus brief \nto the U.S. Supreme Court regarding campaign finance reform along with \nthe author of the DISCLOSE Act. This bill falls short. The American \npeople see it for what it is: Political opportunism at its best, \npolitical demagoguery at its worst.\n  My former colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, and I set out \nto eliminate the corrupting influence of soft money and to reform how \nour campaigns are paid for. We vowed to be truly bipartisan and to do \nnothing which would give one party a political advantage over the \nother. The fact is this gives one party an advantage over the other.\n  I say with great respect to the Senator from Rhode Island, the way I \nbegan campaign finance reform is I found a person on the other side of \nthe aisle who was willing to work with me, and we worked together on \ncampaign finance reform. The Senator from Rhode Island and the sponsors \nof this bill have no one on this side of the aisle. By not having \nanyone on this side of the aisle, the Senator from Rhode Island has now \nembarked on a partisan enterprise.\n  I suggest strongly to the sponsors of the bill--if they are serious \nabout campaign finance reform and about curing the evils going on now--\nthey approach Members on this side of the aisle and make sure our \nconcerns about the role of labor unions in this financing of political \ncampaigns are addressed as well.\n  It is too bad--it is too bad--that Members on that side of the aisle \nare now orchestrating a vote which is strictly partisan in nature when \nthey know full well the only way true campaign finance reform will ever \nbe enacted by the Congress is in a bipartisan fashion. This is a \npartisan bill, and I am disappointed we are wasting the time of the \nSenate on a bill--and on a cause that is of utmost importance, in my \nview--in a partisan fashion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, before I yield the floor to Senator \nSanders, I wanted to take 1 minute and thank Senator McCain for his \nmany years of principled advocacy in this area. People have written \nentire books about the work he has done. I think it was Elizabeth Drew \nwho wrote one of the best books about the courage Senator McCain has \nshown over the years. So I come to this debate with enormous respect \nfor him.\n  I will say the bill is not bipartisan, but that is not for lack of \ntrying. We have reached out over and over again. In the face of an \nabsolute stonewall on this subject, we have changed the bill ourselves \nin order to accommodate concerns. The stand-by-your-ad provision was \ncriticized by the Republican witness in the Rules Committee, so we \nremoved it. The National Rifle Association was livid about the $600 \nthreshold because it would require them to disclose their members, so \nwe raised it to $10,000. Over and over, where there have been \nsubstantive objections to the bill, we have met them.\n  At this point, not one Republican--for all of our contacts across the \naisle--has expressed anyplace in this bill where an amendment could be \nmade. We have never been given any language, we have never been shown \nthe area that, in theory, is better for the unions. It is, as Senator \nMcCain himself admitted, facially applied to corporations and unions \nand other organizations alike.\n  I would refer back to the op-ed in today's New York Times by \nRepublican former Senators Rudman and Hagel agreeing this is, in fact, \na fair bill. It is balanced among all parties, and all Senators should \nsupport it.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator Sanders, with \nappreciation for allowing me that moment of his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Whitehouse, Senator \nSchumer, and all those who have been working so hard on this enormously \nimportant issue which has everything to do with whether our country \nremains the kind of democracy most of us want it to be.\n  I come to the Senate floor today to express my profound disgust with \nthe current state of our campaign finance system and to call for my \nfellow Senators, as a short-term effort, to pass the DISCLOSE Act. \nPassing the DISCLOSE Act would be an important step forward, but \nclearly we have much more to do on this issue.\n  Long term, of course, we need a constitutional amendment to overturn \nthis disastrous Supreme Court decision--the Citizens United 5-to-4 \ndecision of 2 years ago. Long term, in my view, we also need to move \nthis country toward public funding of elections\n\n[[Page S5063]]\n\nso that once and for all big money will not dominate our political \nprocess.\n  Long term, there is no question in my mind that Citizens United will \ngo down in history as one of the worst decisions ever rendered by a \nU.S. Supreme Court. Five members of the Court came to the bizarre \nconclusion that corporations should be treated as if they were people; \nthat they have a first amendment right to spend as much money as they \nwant to buy candidates, to buy elections. Somehow, in the midst of all \nof this unbelievable amount of spending millions and millions of \ndollars, the Supreme Court came to the conclusion this would not even \ngive the appearance of corruption. I think that is, frankly, an absurd \nconclusion.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you--and my take on this may be a little \ndifferent than some of my colleagues--what concerns me most about the \nCitizens United decision. If we look at Citizens United in tandem with \nother trends in our economy today, what we see is this Nation is \nrapidly moving from an economic and political society to an oligarchic \nform of society.\n  Economically, what we see are fewer and fewer people who control our \neconomy. We see a nation which has the most unequal distribution of \nwealth and income of any major country on Earth, in which the top 1 \npercent of our Nation owns 40 percent of the wealth and the bottom 60 \npercent owns 2 percent of the wealth. That gap between the very wealthy \nand everybody else is growing wider and wider. That is wealth in terms \nof income distribution.\n  The situation is even worse. The last study we have seen suggests \nthat 93 percent of all new income between 2009 and 2010 went to the top \n1 percent. So, economically, we are moving toward a nation in which a \nfew people have a significant amount of the wealth of America--\nsignificant amount of the income of America in terms of concentration \nof ownership. We see a situation in which six financial institutions on \nWall Street have assets equivalent to two-thirds of the GDP of the \nUnited States of America--over $9 trillion controlled by six financial \ninstitutions. And the recklessness, greed, and illegal behavior of \nthose financial institutions are what drove us into the recession we \nare struggling with right now.\n  So now, as a nation, the trends are that fewer and fewer people own \nthe wealth of America and fewer and fewer large corporations control \nthe economy of America. But, apparently, that is not good enough for \nthe 1 percent, for our millionaire and billionaire friends, because now \nthey want to take that wealth and exercise it even more than has been \nthe case in the past in the political realm. That takes us now to \nCitizens United.\n  In the real world, we all know what is going on with Citizens United. \nWe know billionaires are saying: Look, yeah, it is great I own an oil \ncompany. It is great that I own a coal company. It is great that I own \ngambling casinos. But, gee, I could have even more fun by owning the \nUnited States Government.\n  So we have entities out there who are worth some $50 billion--and the \nKoch brothers come to mind. If you are worth $50 billion and you have \nall kinds of interactions with the Federal Government and you have \nstrong political views, why wouldn't you spend $400 million--which is \nwhat the media says that family is going to spend, and maybe even \nmore--if you can purchase the United States Government. That is not a \nbad investment.\n  That is what Citizens United is about. It is billionaires spending \nhuge amounts of money without disclosure--without disclosure.\n  I would have gone further than this bill, but this bill is certainly \nan important step forward. What does it require? It says if someone is \ngoing to spend more than $10,000 in a campaign they have to make public \nwho they are. I don't think that is a terribly onerous provision. The \nAmerican people are not stupid. They understand if somebody is going to \nspend hundreds of millions of dollars on political activities they want \nsomething. That is what it is about.\n  Why do people make campaign contributions? Many of us get a whole lot \nof campaign contributions from folks who give us $25, $30, $40. Most of \nmy campaign contributions come from people who give us less than $200. \nBut if somebody is going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a \ncampaign, I think the American people have a right to know who that is \nand what they want; who is taking that money and what those \ncontributors are going to get in return.\n  If you are a billionaire and you want lower taxes, have the courage \nto say: Hey, I am a billionaire. I am putting money into a party, and \nwhat I am going to get out of it is lower taxes for the rich. If I am \nsomebody in a corporation that is polluting the air and the land and \nthe water, and I want to get rid of those regulations, have the guts to \ncome forward and say: Yeah, that is what I want. I want to eviscerate \nthe EPA. I don't care that children in Vermont or Rhode Island get \nsick, that is what I want.\n  So what this is about is fairly elementary. What this is about is \nsimply having those people, those institutions, those corporations and \nunions that are putting more than $10,000 into the political process \nreveal who they are.\n  What concerns me very much about this whole process--and I think \nconcerns the American people--is while our middle class disappears and \npoverty increases, while the gap between the very wealthy and everybody \nis growing wider, it appears very clear right now these folks are not \ncontent, the top 1 percent is not content with simply owning the \neconomy, with controlling the economy. They now want to control, to an \neven greater degree than is currently the case, the political process \nas well. That is what these campaign contributions of hundreds of \nmillions of dollars are about.\n  When I think back on the history of this country and the enormous \nsacrifices men and women made defending the American ideal--the ideal \nthat was the vision to the entire world. The entire world looked to the \nUnited States for what a strong democracy was about--one person, one \nvote. In my State of Vermont, we have meetings and people come out--one \nperson, one vote--to discuss the municipal town budget, to discuss the \nschool budget. And now we have evolved to a situation where one family \ncan spend $400 million buying politicians, buying elections. That is a \nlong way away from what democracy is supposed to mean in this country. \nThe DISCLOSE Act is a very important first step forward, and I hope we \ncan get strong support for that important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I want to follow up a bit on what I \nsaid I would do earlier, because this has been in some respects half a \ndebate. Other than my friend Senator McCain who has courageously fought \non this issue for some years, we have not heard much from the other \nside of the aisle here, so in some respects it is only half of a \ndebate. In another respect, of course, it is no debate at all, because \nwe are in a filibuster situation with the Republicans blocking us \nactually going to the Senate debate on this bill. So while it is debate \nin the lay sense of the word--it is a discussion--it is not Senate \ndebate on the floor, because we stand here being filibustered with a \nmajority of Senators who demonstrably support going to this bill.\n  I said I would describe some of the things my Republican colleagues \nhave said in the past about disclosure, so let me begin doing that.\n  Senator McConnell, of course, has very publicly been in favor of it. \nThat may relate to the fact that a report by the Corporate Reform \nCoalition went State by State, and the Republican leader's home State \nof Kentucky has a ban on independent expenditures by corporations in \nits State constitution. Its State constitution bans the conduct that is \nat issue here. Kentucky has disclosure provisions that require \ndisclosure when independent expenditures of over $500 are made in any \none election. He is here objecting to a $10,000 limit, and Kentucky \ndisclosure provisions ``require disclosure when independent \nexpenditures of over $500 are made in any one election.'' It further \nrequires under Kentucky statute 121.190, subpart 1, that the name of \nthe advertising sponsor must be put on any communication. So consistent \nwith the laws of his home State, our Republican leader has for many \nyears stood out in favor of disclosure. Around 2000 he said, \n``Republicans are in favor of disclosure.'' And he said:\n\n\n[[Page S5064]]\n\n\n       Public disclosure of campaign contributions and spending \n     should be expedited so voters can judge for themselves what \n     is appropriate.\n\n  Other leaders on the Republican side, such as Senator Alexander, have \nsaid:\n\n       I support campaign finance reform, but to me that means \n     individual contributions, free speech and full disclosure. In \n     other words, any individual can give whatever they want as \n     long as it is disclosed every day on the Internet.\n\n  That is exactly what this bill does, but only for donations $10,000 \nand more. I don't believe there was a floor in Senator Alexander's \nremarks.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Iowa has arrived. In the spirit \nof going back and forth, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last September, President Obama \nresponded to amnesty proponents, denying that he had authority to \nunilaterally grant special status to individuals who may be eligible \nunder the DREAM Act.\n  The DREAM Act has been around the Senate for discussion for about a \ndecade, and in different forms. It has been voted down several times by \nthis body--mostly because the leader won't allow for an amendment \nprocess to improve the bill; otherwise, it probably could have been \nworked upon.\n  A few months ago when asked by amnesty advocates to push the bill \nthrough Executive order, President Obama said this:\n\n       This notion that somehow I can just change the laws \n     unilaterally is just not true. The fact of the matter is \n     there are laws on the books that I have to enforce. And I \n     think there's been a great disservice done to the cause of \n     getting the DREAM Act passed and getting comprehensive \n     immigration passed by perpetrating the notion that somehow, \n     by myself, I can go and do these things. It's just not true. \n     We live in a democracy. You have to pass bills through the \n     legislature, and then I can sign it.\n\n  But 1 month ago, President Obama continued his ``we can't wait'' \ncampaign and circumvented Congress, again, to significantly change the \nlaw all by himself. On June 15, he announced that the Department of \nHomeland Security would lay out a process by which immigrants who have \ncome here illegally could apply for relief and remain in the United \nStates without the fear of deportation. So what has changed in the last \n9 months, when the President of the United States said last September \nthat he could not unilaterally grant amnesty?\n  Before I dive into the details of how poorly planned and implemented \nthe directive of June 15 will be, I have to question the legal \nauthority of the President to institute a plan of this magnitude.\n  I, along with 19 other Senators, sent the President a letter and \nasked if he consulted with attorneys prior to the June 15 announcement \nabout his legal authority to grant deferred action and work \nauthorizations to a specific class of immigrants who have come here \nillegally. It is important that we get that question answered, because \nlast September the President said he didn't have the legal authority to \ndo it. We asked the President if he obtained a legal opinion from the \nOffice of Legal Counsel or anyone else within his administration. To \ndate, we have not received any documentation that discusses any \nauthority whatsoever that he has to undertake this massive immigration \ndirective.\n  I know the Secretary of Homeland Security has discretion to determine \nwho is put in removal proceedings. Prosecutorial discretion has been \naround for a long time, but it hasn't been abused to this extent. The \nPresident is claiming the Secretary will implement this directive using \nprosecutorial discretion. However, millions of immigrants coming here \nillegally will be instructed to report to the U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Service and proactively apply. This is not being done on a \ncase-by-case basis as they want to make it appear.\n  The President's directive is an affront to our system of \nrepresentative government and the legislative process, and it is an \ninappropriate use of executive power based upon what he said last \nSeptember, that he didn't have the authority to do this. The President \nbypassed Congress because he couldn't lead on immigration reform, and \nhe couldn't work in a bipartisan manner on an issue that involves \nundocumented young people.\n  The President's directive runs contrary to the principle that \nAmerican workers must come before foreign nationals. His policies only \nincrease competition for American students and workers who struggle to \nfind employment in today's economy. And that unemployment is 8.2 \npercent official, 11 or 12 percent unofficial.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate \namong the age group 16 to 24 has been nearly 17 percent for the last \nyear. According to a Gallup poll conducted in April of this year, 32 \npercent of the 18-to-29-year-olds in the U.S. workforce, if not \nunemployed, are underemployed.\n  The President's plan to get people back to work is to grant \nimmigrants who come here illegally a work authorization. He must be \nseriously out of touch if he doesn't think there is competition already \nfor American workers.\n  Now I wish to talk about how poorly this directive has been thought \nout. This is the implementation of a directive the President said he \ndidn't have the authority to do in the first place. But if you are \ngoing to have an illegal directive, you ought to at least know it will \nwork. It is my understanding the White House informed Homeland Security \nofficials of this plan just days before it was announced on June 15. \nThey were unprepared, and have since been scrambling to figure out how \nit will be carried out.\n  U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service--the agency in charge of all \nimmigration benefits, including work authorizations, visa applications, \nasylum petitions, and employment verifications for employers--will be \nthe agency tasked with handling millions of new applications for \ndeferred status and work permits. Agents in the field are confused as \nto how to do their jobs and fear retaliation if they don't do the right \nthing. So in essence, this White House is telling agents in the field \nto begin a practice called catch and release.\n  Last Friday, Homeland Security officials briefed the Judiciary \nCommittee on the directive. Staff of the Judiciary Committee were told \nthat agents of the agency would be required to release immigrants who \ncome here illegally if they fell into the criteria laid out. But what \nare the ramifications if an agent does not release them but instead \nuses his discretion to say the person was not eligible and puts them in \nremoval proceedings?\n  You will be astounded by the answer we got, because the Department of \nHomeland Security explained that such an agent would be subject to \ndisciplinary action--disciplinary action if you are doing what your job \nis required to do. The agent's actions would be considered during their \nannual personnel review.\n  So there will be no discretion for agents, and they will be forced to \ngive deferred action to anyone who comes close to the criteria laid \nout, even despite their hesitation to do so, or face retaliation from \nbureaucratic higher-ups.\n  It is as though Homeland Security forgot their mission which is:\n\n       To ensure a homeland that is safe, secure, and resilient \n     against terrorism and other hazards where American interests, \n     aspirations, and way of life can thrive.\n\n  Once we overcome the question of legal authority and the reality that \nthere was little thinking put into this plan before it was announced on \nJune 15, we are left to oversee the details of the implementation plan. \nHomeland Security officials say they will have a process laid out by \nAugust 15. We have very little details, but Homeland Security officials \ndid give some insight on Friday in this briefing to members of the \nJudiciary Committee staff. Here is what we learned.\n  We know people under the age of 30, who entered before their 16th \nbirthday, have been here for at least 5 years, and are currently in \nschool may qualify for deferred action. We know there are caveats to \nthe criteria. Some criminal offenses will be OK, and young people can \nfinish their education after they are granted deferred action.\n  We know individuals with final orders of removal will be eligible for \ndeferred action. We know these people will not have to appear for an \nin-person interview to benefit from this directive of the President of \nJune 15. We know they will be granted this special status for 2 years, \nand those who are denied will not be put into removal proceedings. We \nknow this is not aimed at\n\n[[Page S5065]]\n\nhelping just youth since the age limit is 30. So who are we going to \nhelp over age 30, because we thought from the President's announcement, \nif people are over 30 years of age nobody is going to benefit. We know \npeople under the age of 30 are not the only people going to be \nconsidered for relief.\n  Secretary Napolitano said so herself. She told CNN's Wolf Blitzer the \nfollowing:\n\n       We have internally set it up so that the parents are not \n     referred for immigration enforcement if the young person \n     comes in for deferred action.\n\n  I was not born yesterday. This administration is not going to give a \nbenefit to immigrants here illegally and then force his or her parents \nto leave the country, which begs the question, What will they do if the \nyoung people are eligible and receive deferred action, but the parent \nis a criminal, a gang member, or a sex offender?\n  Because this program has not been well thought out and because it is \nbeing rushed to benefit people by the end of the year, there is no \ndoubt that fraud will be a problem. How will Federal officials who \nprocess the applications ensure that information provided by the \nindividual is accurate? How will they verify that one truly entered the \ncountry before the age of 16 or is currently under the age of 30?\n  Homeland Security officials act as though they are prepared to handle \nthe influx of counterfeit documents that will be presented. The \ndepartment officials are going to rely on their small fraud detection \nunit--who already happen to be very busy working every day on other \ntypes of immigration benefits--to determine if people are truly \neligible. What will be the consequences for individuals who \nintentionally defraud the government? They need a fraud and abuse \nprevention plan. Without one they will likely legalize every single \nimmigrant who came here illegally, who is already on U.S. soil.\n  The administration will announce more details about this plan in the \nnext few weeks. I am anxious to see if they plan to only provide \ndeferred action to this population. Department officials refuse to \nelaborate on whether some of these individuals will be able to get \nadvanced parole. That is a special status that allows an immigrant \ncoming here illegally to adjust to permanent residence and then gain \ncitizenship. This administration wants people to believe this is not \namnesty and that these people will not have lawful status, but I am \nwatching to see if they try to pull the wool over our eyes and provide \na status that allows these people to adjust and remain here \npermanently.\n  Finally, a major flaw in the President's plan is how this is going to \nbe paid for. A massive amnesty program is going to cost a lot of money. \nSo what are the taxpayers going to have to cough up out of their hard-\nearned dollars to pay for it? Department officials said on Friday that \nillegal immigrants may not be charged for their special status. The \nindividual would be charged $380 if they choose to apply for a work \nauthorization. They could not assure us that funding would not be \nredirected from other programs to this initiative.\n  To reprogram funds within the Department, the Secretary must notify \nand gain consent of the majority and minority leaders on the \nAppropriations Committee. However, when pressed, Department officials \ncould not assure us that they would not bypass the longstanding process \nand reprogram dollars on their own. The U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Service will be forced to concentrate on this program, \nleaving employers, foreign workers, and legal immigrants without the \nservice they need to work, visit, or remain in the United States.\n  If the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service adjudication staff \nwill be diverted from their normal duties to handle the millions of \npotential deferred action applications, this can only have a \ndevastating impact on other programs within the Department. I fear this \nplan will bankrupt the agency that oversees immigration benefits and \naffect all legal immigration for years to come.\n  I fear the President has overstepped his authority again. The \nPresident, time and again, has shown no leadership or refused to work \nwith Congress on issues that directly impact the American people. And \nwhen it comes to the immigration issue he promised the people in the \n2008 election, that in his first year in office he would have an \nimmigration bill before Congress, he has not even presented an \nimmigration bill yet. He insisted he was coming here to change \nWashington, but he changed it for the worse. He insisted he was going \nto make this the most transparent administration ever, but Congress and \nthe American people are left in the dark.\n  No matter where one stands on immigration, we should all be appalled \nat how this plan has been carried out. Whether it is legal or illegal \nis one thing. But when it is not thoroughly thought out, how it is \ngoing to be implemented, that is not how the chief executive of a major \noperation such as the U.S. Government ought to be acting.\n  We should all be concerned that our votes are rendered meaningless as \na result of the assumption of power on June 15 that the President said \nlast September he did not have. Until we can end this plan, I encourage \nmy colleagues to watch over its implementation for the future of our \ncountry. The integrity of our whole immigration system is hanging in \nthe balance.\n  This immigration system is very important because the United States \nhas opened doors for more people than any other country in the world to \ncome here legally. About 1 million people come here legally. So we are \na welcoming nation. We are a nation built upon immigrants bringing new \nideas to this country, making this a very not only colorful country but \na dynamic society. We ought to leave it that way. But this change to \nour immigration system for people to come here legally jeopardizes a \nlot of people who want to abide by our laws and come here and make our \ncountry even richer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak in \nstrong support of the DISCLOSE Act, which will help put an end to \nsecretive campaign spending and close the glaring campaign finance \nloopholes that have been opened up by the Citizens United ruling. I \nthank the Senator from Rhode Island for his tremendous leadership on \nthis critical issue and all his work which has gotten us to this point \ntoday on this very important bill.\n  This Supreme Court ruling was truly a step backwards for our \ndemocracy. It overturned decades of campaign finance law and policy, \nand it allowed corporations and special interest groups to spend \nunlimited amounts of their money influencing our democracy. The \nCitizens United ruling has given special interest groups a megaphone \nthat they can use to drown out the voices of citizens in my home State \nof Washington and across the country. The DISCLOSE Act would return \ntransparency to this process. It would return accountability to this \nprocess. It would be a major step to returning citizens' voices to the \nimportant election decisions we make in our country.\n  This is a very personal issue for me. When I first ran for the Senate \nback in 1992, I was a long-shot candidate without a lot of money or \nwealthy corporate backers. But what I did have was amazing and \npassionate volunteers who were at my side. They cared deeply about \nmaking sure the voices of Washington State's families were represented. \nThey made phone calls, they went door to door with us, they talked to \nfamilies across our State who wanted more from their government.\n  We ended up winning that grassroots campaign because the people's \nvoices were heard loudly and clearly. To be honest, I don't think it \nwould have been possible if corporations and special interests had been \nable to drown out their voices with this unlimited barrage of negative \nads against candidates who did not support their interests. That is why \nI support this DISCLOSE Act. I want to make sure no force is greater in \nour elections than the power of voters across our cities and towns, and \nno voice is louder than citizens who care about making their State and \ncountry a better place to live.\n  The DISCLOSE Act of 2012 should not be contentious. It simply does \nwhat a majority of American people view as a no-brainer. It requires \noutside groups to divulge their campaign-related fundraising and \nspending, plain and simple.\n\n[[Page S5066]]\n\nIt does this by shining a very bright spotlight on the entire process \nand by strengthening the overall disclosure requirements on groups who \nare attempting to sway our elections.\n  Too often corporations and special interest groups are able to hide \ntheir spending behind a mask of front organizations because they know \nvoters would be less likely to believe ads if they knew the motives \nbehind their sponsors. For instance, an indication of who is funding \nmany of these shell organizations can be seen in the delayed \ndisclosures of the so-called super PACs. In fact, a Forbes article \nrecently reported that 30 billionaires now are backing Romney's super \nPAC. It is unknown how much these same billionaires or their corporate \ninterests are already providing to other organizations with even less \nscrutiny.\n  The DISCLOSE Act ends all that. Specifically, the act requires any of \nthese front organizations who spend $10,000 or more on a campaign to \nfile a disclosure report with the Federal Election Commission within 24 \nhours and file a new report for each additional $10,000 or more that is \nspent. This is a major step in pulling back the curtain on the \noutlandish and unfair spending practices that are corrupting our \nNation's political process. It is a major step toward the kind of open \nand honest government the American people demand and deserve.\n  The DISCLOSE Act brings transparency to these shady spending \npractices and makes sure voters have the information they need so they \nknow who they can trust. It is a commonsense bill. It should not be \ncontroversial, and anyone who thinks voters should have a louder voice \nthan special interest groups should be supporting our bill.\n  This bill aims to protect the very core of our Federal election \nprocess. It protects the process by which our citizens fairly assess \nthe people they believe will best come here and be their voice and \nrepresent their communities. It exposes the hidden hand of special \ninterests, and it creates an open process for who gets to stand before \nthem as representatives.\n  I am proud to support this bill and proud of the efforts by Senator \nWhitehouse and so many others in the Senate. I urge all our colleagues \nto vote for this bill. Let's move it forward. Let's do what is right \nfor America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/17/senate-section/article/S5066-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 3 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I believe we have a number of speakers \nwho are coming over from the caucus lunch to discuss the upcoming vote \non the DISCLOSE Act. I wanted to take the time that is available until \na speaker shows up to continue to report the previous support for \ndisclosure from our colleagues and from other Republican officeholders \nand officials.\n  I think where I left off in my previous listing was Senator Lisa \nMurkowski, who wants Citizens United reversed and has said:\n\n       Super PACs have expanded their role in financing the 2012 \n     campaigns, in large part due to the Citizens United decision \n     that allowed unlimited contributions to the political \n     advocacy organizations.\n\n  She said:\n\n       However, it is only appropriate that Alaskans and Americans \n     know where the money comes from.\n\n  My friend Senator Jeff Sessions, a ranking member on the Judiciary \nCommittee, at one point said:\n\n       I don't like it when a large source of money is out there \n     funding ads and is unaccountable. . . . To the extent we can, \n     I tend to favor disclosure.\n\n  Senator Cornyn said:\n\n       I think the system needs more transparency, so people can \n     more easily reach their own conclusions.\n\n  Senator Collins has been quoted:\n\n       Sen. Collins . . . believes that it is important that any \n     future campaign finance laws include strong transparency \n     provisions so the American public knows who is contributing \n     to a candidate's campaign, as well as who is funding \n     communications in support of or in opposition to a political \n     candidate or issue.\n\n  That is from the Hill.\n  Senator Scott Brown has said:\n\n       A genuine campaign finance reform effort would include \n     increased transparency, accountability and would provide a \n     level playing field to everyone.\n\n  Senator Tom Coburn has said:\n\n       So I would not disagree there ought to be transparency in \n     who contributes to the super PACs and it ought to be public \n     knowledge. . . . We ought to have transparency. . . . If \n     legislators were required to disclose all contributions to \n     their campaigns, the public knowledge would naturally \n     restrain legislators from acting out of the current quid pro \n     quo mindset. If you have transparency, you will have \n     accountability.\n\n  As I reported earlier today, the Republican Senate support goes to \npeople who have left the Senate as well. I would remark again on the \nextraordinary editorial written in the New York Times by Senators Hagel \nand Rudman.\n  House Speaker Representative Boehner has said:\n\n       I think what we ought to do is we ought to have full \n     disclosure, full disclosure of all the money we raised and \n     how it is spent. And I think sunlight is the best \n     disinfectant.\n\n  Representative Eric Cantor, the majority whip, I believe, has said:\n\n       Anything that moves us back towards that notion of \n     transparency and real-time reporting of donations and \n     contributions I think would be a helpful move towards \n     restoring the confidence of voters.\n\n  Newt Gingrich has called for reporting every single night on the \nInternet when people make political donations.\n  Mitt Romney has said that it is ``an enormous, gaping loophole . . . \nif you form a 527 or 501(c)(4) you don't have to disclose who the \ndonors are.''\n  Well, this is a chance for our colleagues to close that enormous, \ngaping loophole their Presidential nominee has pointed out.\n  One of my favorite comments is by Mike Huckabee. Mike Huckabee said:\n\n       I wish that every person who gives any money [to fund an \n     ad] that mentions any candidate by name would have to put \n     their name on it and be held responsible and accountable for \n     it. And it's killing any sense of civility in politics \n     because of the cheap shots that can be made from the trees by \n     snipers that you never can identify.\n\n  The cheap shots that can be made from the trees by snipers that you \nnever can identify. Let me give an example of that.\n  I am going to read parts of an article from this morning's New York \nTimes.\n\n       In early 2010, a new organization called the Commission on \n     Hope, Growth and Opportunity--\n\n  With a name like that, you know it has to be bad in this \nenvironment--\n\n       filed for nonprofit, tax-exempt status, telling the \n     Internal Revenue Service it was not going to spend any money \n     on campaigns.\n       Weeks later, tax-exempt status in hand as well as a single \n     $4 million donation from an anonymous benefactor, the group \n     kicked off a multimillion-dollar campaign against 11 \n     Democratic candidates, declining to report any of its \n     political spending to the Federal Election Commission, \n     maintaining to the I.R.S. that it did not do any political \n     spending at all, and failing to register as a political \n     committee required to disclose the names of its donors. Then, \n     faced with multiple election commission and I.R.S. \n     complaints, the group went out of business.\n\n  The editorial continues:\n\n       ``C.H.G.O.'s story is a tutorial on how to break campaign \n     finance law, impact elections, and disappear--the political \n     equivalent of a hit and run,'' Citizens for Responsibility \n     and Ethics . . . wrote in a new report.\n\n  A cheap shot from the trees by a sniper you can never identify, and \nto this day no one has ever identified the $4 million donor.\n  I see the Senator from New Jersey. I am delighted to yield to him so \nhe can make his remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, yesterday we witnessed quite a sight. \nNot a single Republican was willing to stand up to oppose secret money \nand elections. Today they will have another chance to announce their \nsupport and tell their constituents whether they would prefer that \nsecret money buys the politicians or does it take their constituents' \nvotes to get people in place who care about where this country is \ngoing.\n\n[[Page S5067]]\n\n  Republicans will have a chance to show Americans where they stand: \nwith millions of individual voters or the few billionaires who seek to \ndrown out the voices of our citizens by using secret money.\n  Yesterday, I came to the floor to present the identities of two of \nthe biggest supporters of secret money in politics, David and Charles \nKoch. They are joined by somebody we read about yesterday in the papers \nand heard on the news by the name of Sheldon Adelson, whose brain money \nwas earned from Chinese gamblers in Macau to buy American politicians. \nThat is some deal.\n  The Koch brothers are putting together a secret group of wealthy \nfriends who will spend $400 million to manipulate the upcoming \nelection. This effort is one of the egregious examples of the flood of \nbig, secret money into our politics, and this unaccountable money is \nspent with a clear goal of determining our laws and deciding our \nelections and the policies this country will follow in the future. The \nKoch brothers are set on picking their preferred politicians. Too bad \nthat with a country of over 300 million people these two fellows want \nto decide who should run this country of ours.\n  Koch Industries controls oil and chemical companies that do business \naround the globe. So what do the Koch brothers and their anonymous \nfriends want from politicians who benefit from their secret money? They \nwant laws that benefit the companies like the ones they own even when \nthose laws come at the expense of millions of other Americans. I think \nthe reason is clear. They want people in office who will put their \nspecial interests above the public interest.\n  These brothers run Koch Industries, which is a giant international \nconglomerate and one of the largest privately held companies in the \nworld.\n  The Kochs' secret money organization, Americans for Prosperity, has \nopposed EPA's new mercury pollution standards. These historic standards \nwill prevent 130,000 asthma attacks, 4,700 heart attacks, and up to \n11,000 premature deaths. Americans for Prosperity, funded by secret \nmoney, opposed the rule that will save these lives. They would rather \nhave the money. We know what millions of people who live near \npowerplants want. They want the plants to clean up their acts and stop \npoisoning them and their neighbors.\n  The Kochs and industry lobbyists argue that these standards just cost \ntoo much. What is the value of a life to these guys? Let them answer \nthe question publicly. Turn in the secret money and let the people \nacross our country decide who they want in the Senate, the House, and \nthe White House.\n  How much poorer is our society when children are born with \ndevelopmental problems? A child born with pollution in their body is \nset back from day one. That child's potential is stunted before they \nhave even taken their first breath.\n  Polluters just ignore the costs to American families. They think \ntheir right to pollute is more important than the average person. The \nchildren in our country have the right to breathe. It is foul play if \nwe have ever seen it. Put your money up, take fresh air away from young \npeople, and create problems that mercury in our environment does.\n  Secret money in politics makes it possible for polluting companies to \nspend millions of dollars influencing elections, and the American \npublic is kept in the dark. So I say to my Republican colleagues: Let \nyour conscience rule your decision. Let's tell the truth.\n  I wish the vote could say: Yes, I want secret money to continue being \nsent. They dare us to use that language. Come on. There are good people \nover there. Let's shine some light on who is pulling the strings in \nthis country. Is it the people or is it the money that makes the \ndifference in the way this society functions?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to be notified when I have \nused 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand we will have a set vote on \nthe DISCLOSE Act. It got 51 votes previously. We need 60 votes to move \nforward to pass this bill. It is not likely to happen. Our Democratic \ncolleagues were down here last night into the midnight hour talking \nabout the DISCLOSE Act, which is something that is political and \ncampaign-related that we have a significant difference of opinion \nabout, and it is not going to pass.\n  I would like to ask my friends and colleagues what is it we ought to \nbe disclosing? Is it the amount of money some individual American made \nhonestly and spent or maybe there are some other issues we ought to \ndisclose. I would say this Senate ought to disclose to the American \npeople what its budget plan is for the future of this country. We \nhaven't had a budget in 3 years. Senator Reid said it would be foolish \nto bring up a budget--foolish because we don't have time. We had time \nto spend all night last night debating this bill--or half the night--\nand we are having a second vote on the same bill again today. Why don't \nwe spend some of that time on something important such as dealing with \nour $16 billion debt. Why don't our Democratic leaders disclose to us \nwhat their plan is to deal with this surging debt, a debt that is \nincreasing at $1.3 trillion a year. It is unsustainable, as every \nestimate we have ever been told and every witness has testified to \nbefore the Budget Committee and other committees--unsustainable. Yet \nthey refuse to even lay out a plan for how we are going to confront \nthat.\n  The House has. They laid out a historic plan. Congressman Ryan and \nhis team and the House has passed a long-term budget plan that will \nalter the debt course of America and put us on a responsible path--not \nso in the Senate, even though they talked about it in secret amongst \nthemselves that they had a plan. Let's disclose it. Why don't we have a \ndisclosure of it.\n  October 1 is coming up pretty fast, particularly since we are going \nto be in recess virtually the entire month of August and it looks like \nthe entire month of October. By October 1, the Congress has a duty and \na responsibility to pass legislation that funds the government because \nthe new government fiscal year begins October 1. Senator Reid just \nannounced he is not going to produce a single appropriations bill. When \nI first came here, we tried to pass all 13 every year, before October \n1, when the year starts. We are not even going to attempt it.\n  I think the American people ought to ask: What do you plan to spend \nyour money on next year? The country is suffering substantially. Why \ndon't you disclose, Senator Reid, what the appropriations bills are \ngoing to be, how much money you are going to spend on each one of the \nitems, and subitems and subitems and subitems, so we can examine it, \nbring it up on the floor, and offer amendments, as the Senate is \nsupposed to operate. Why don't you disclose that? Isn't that important \nfor America?\n  I have to say, since I have been here, this will be the least \nperforming, most disappointing year of the Senate in our history. No \nbudget, no attempt to bring up a budget, no appropriations. Those are \nthe bread-and-butter requirements of any Senator.\n  Food stamps, the SNAP program. In 2000, we were spending about $17 \nbillion on the food stamp program. Last year, we spent $79 billion. It \nhas gone up repeatedly. It is out of control. It needs to be managed. \nIt needs to be focusing more on helping people in need, not just \nsubsidizing people in need--helping them move forward to independence \nand responsibility. Why don't my colleagues disclose a plan for that? \nIsn't that important to America? I think it is.\n  There are a lot of other things that ought to be on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  There are a lot of other things on the table we need to be dealing \nwith and talking about and being honest about. It is time to disclose \nwhat our financial plans for the future are. It is time to disclose \nwhat we are going to do about this debt, what we are going to do about \nwasteful spending. It is not being done. It is a disappointing year.\n  I thank the Chair and yield is floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, lest we get totally off track \nand before the Senator from Alabama leaves the Chamber, I wish to thank\n\n[[Page S5068]]\n\nhim and congratulate him. The system works when Democrats and \nRepublicans come together. The Senator from Alabama and I have worked \non many issues together, including the Nation's national security. Just \nrecently, the Senate showed how it can work together on the RESTORE Act \nin the Gulf of Mexico when we added a provision directing the fine \nmoney to be imposed by a judge in New Orleans and redirected that fine \nmoney to come back to the people and the environment and the critters \nof the gulf. That passed in this Chamber 76 to 22--a huge bipartisan \nvote.\n  I have had the privilege of working with the Senator from Alabama on \nmany other issues, including the times the two of us led the Strategic \nSubcommittee of the Armed Services Committee on some of the Nation's \nmost significant things, such as our overall strategic umbrella \nprotecting this country. There again, it was Democrats and Republicans \nworking together.\n  So to hear a lot of the rhetoric, someone outside the Senate would \nthink we are totally in gridlock. That has not been the case. However, \nwe come to a point of gridlock again because of the Senate rules \nrequiring 60 votes to shut off debate so we can go to this bill called \nthe DISCLOSE Act.\n  What the DISCLOSE Act does is common sense. It is common sense to \nsay, if someone is going to affect the political system by giving money \nto influence the votes at the end of the day in an election year, all \nthe campaign laws say they have to disclose that money, and but for a \n5-to-4 Supreme Court decision--which is contorted at best and is way \nover the edge at the very least--its ruling says that because of \nfreedom of speech, outside the political system, one can make \nadvertisements, one can speak freely; in other words, by spending \nmoney, buying ads, and one does not have to disclose that. Oh, by the \nway, that whereas the campaign finance law prohibits in Federal \nelections corporations from donating, this contorted Supreme Court \ndecision says that can be corporate money and it doesn't have to be \ndisclosed.\n  That is what we are seeing in abundance in that kind of political \nspeech right now in all these attack ads, and these attack ads are \ngoing rapid fire. We look at who it is sponsored by. It is not \nsponsored by the candidate; it is sponsored by some organization that \nhas a high-sounding name, but we don't know where the money is coming \nfrom.\n  This piece of legislation in front of us yesterday got 53 votes, and \nwe need 7 more votes to cut off the debate just to go to the bill. This \nvote is coming at 3 o'clock. We are not going to get it. It is going to \nbe the same result--53 to 47. Why? Because these outside, unlimited \nsources of funds that are not disclosed are affecting elections and \nthey are achieving the result and we know it. If we put enough money \ninto TV advertising, one can sell a box of soap, whatever the brand is. \nThat is the whole theory behind this. The undisclosed donors giving \nunlimited sums elect whom they want, and that is going to completely \ndistort the political system.\n  We start from a basis of old Socratic ideas, going back to Socrates; \nthat in the free marketplace of ideas, the crosscurrents of those ideas \nbeing discussed, that out of it truth will emerge and the best course \nof action will emerge. It is upon those ideals that this country was \nfounded; this country, wanting a representative body such as this to \ncome forth and freely and openly discuss the ideas and hammer out \npolicy. Yet what we are seeing is that in bringing those elected \nofficials here, by electing them by overwhelming advertising from \nunlimited sources, those elected representatives will be beholden to \nthose particular sources and will not have an independence of judgment, \nwill not have the Socratic ability in the free marketplace of ideas to \nhammer out the differences of ideas and achieve consensus in order to \ndetermine the direction of the country. So the very underpinnings of \nthe country are at stake.\n  Why is this being fought--something that ought to be like a \nmotherhood bill. One is for disclosure of those giving money to \ninfluence the political system, just like all the Federal candidates \nhave to disclose; and, oh, by the way, are limited in the amounts of \ncontributions to each candidate. What is such common sense is being \nthwarted. If this legislation were to pass and they had to disclose who \nis giving the money, do we know what: Most of them would stop giving \nit, and they would have to operate under the normal campaign finance \nlaws which say to report every dime of a contribution and they are \nlimited as to the amount they can give and the candidate is limited as \nto the amount they can receive. That is fair, but it is more than fair. \nIt is absolutely essential to the functioning of the electoral system \nin order to elect a representative democracy.\n  That is what is at stake, and that is what we are going to vote on \nagain. Unfortunately, we know what the outcome of the vote is going to \nbe: 53 in favor of disclosing and 47 against, and we are not going to \nknow who is giving all this money.\n  I can't say it any better. It is old country boy wisdom that says \nthis ought to be as easy as night and day, understanding the \ndifference. Yet that is what we are facing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have not taken an opportunity to \nspeak to the DISCLOSE Act, which is currently before us, or the holding \nof Citizens United. I haven't come to the floor to address that, but \nthat does not mean this has not been a discussion of great importance \nin the State of Alaska.\n  Alaskans are a pretty independent lot. I think they like to know what \nis behind certain initiatives, certainly when it comes to the financing \nof campaigns. They want to know where and when and how and why and that \nit is appropriate. Our State legislature has enacted some campaign \nfinance reforms that I think have been good. Alaskans have looked very \ncritically at the Citizens United decision and its impact on the \ncampaigns in this country.\n  I have made no secret of the fact that I disagree with the holdings \nof the Citizens United decision which makes it possible for individuals \nand business entities to make contributions in any amount, at any time \nto independent efforts to elect candidates at the Federal, State, and \nlocal levels.\n  I think this decision not only overturned longstanding Federal law, \nit also, to a certain extent, displaced State laws, including the laws \nin my own State of Alaska which barred corporate participation in State \nelections. It gave birth to a new form of political entity. We all know \nit; we are all talking about it now, particularly with the Presidential \nelection--the super PAC, a vehicle for large donors. When we are \ntalking about large donors, we are not just talking about donors who \ncan put forth thousands of dollars. We are talking about donors who put \nforth multimillions of dollars, and it is done to influence the \nAmerican political process in secret by contributing to organizations \nwith very patriotic names, but they lurk behind post office boxes. \nThere is an anonymity, there is a covering that I do not think the \nAmerican public expects or respects.\n  I believe strongly--I believe very strongly--that the Citizens United \ndecision is corrosive to democracy. At a very minimum the American \npeople deserve to know who is behind the organizations, who is funding \nthem, and what their real agendas are.\n  I think if we were to ask the average American out on the street: Do \nyou think it is reasonable that there be disclosure, full disclosure of \nwhere the campaign dollars are coming from, I think the average \nAmerican would say: Yes. I know the average Alaskan is saying yes.\n  So when they see what this Supreme Court case has allowed--courts \nhave determined this is constitutional--I do not think anybody assumed \nwhat it would lead to is an ability for an individual to give millions \nof dollars to influence an election, and yet not be subject to a level \nof disclosure that is fair and balanced.\n  I came to the floor very late last night after flying in from Alaska. \nI left at 7 o'clock in the morning, and my plane touched down at about \n10:15 last night. As I landed, I saw the lights of the Capitol on. I \nknew somebody was still home. The flag that flies on the Senate side of \nthe Capitol was still up, meaning the Senate was still in session, so I \ndecided to come to the floor and see what was going on and to perhaps \nlisten to a little bit of the debate.\n  I was tired. I was tired from flying. But I was truly tired that as a \nbody,\n\n[[Page S5069]]\n\nwhen we have an issue that is important, is significant--whether it is \ncampaign finance or the tax issues we face, whether it is the \nsequestration issue we will shortly be facing--we are once again in a \nposition where we are doing nothing but messaging. I am so tired of \nmessaging, and I think the folks whom we represent are tired of us \nmessaging.\n  I want us to have some reforms when it comes to campaign finance and \nthe disclosure that the American public thinks makes sense, where they \nsay: Good. This is not something where you are hiding behind an \norganization, whether it is a 501(c)(4) or a 501(c)(3) or a super PAC, \nor however we define it. We want to know that you are open and you are \ntransparent.\n  I did not stay too late last night to listen to the debates. But I \nwill tell you that the comments I heard from my colleagues were pretty \nsound. For the life of me, I cannot fathom why it is appropriate that \nthe name, the address, the occupation of an individual who makes a \ncontribution of between $200 and $5,000 to Lisa Murkowski's committee \nmust be disclosed--that is what is required under the law. But somehow \nor other there is a constitutional right for someone who gives $1 \nmillion, $15 million to an independent effort that either supports or \nopposes an election can do so in secrecy. They can do so in a way that \nis not subject to disclosure. I do not think that makes sense, and I do \nnot think it would make sense to anybody else out there on the street. \nWhat is the difference?\n  But I would also suggest to you the converse is true as well. I do \nnot believe the membership lists--whether it is the Sierra Club or the \nNational Rifle Association or the NAACP--I do not think those lists \nneed to be public because an organization has made a relatively small \ndonation from its treasury funds to independent efforts. Those who \nchose to affiliate with broad-based membership organizations deserve to \nhave their privacy interests maintained. So you have things going on \nboth sides here.\n  Again, what we should be doing in this case is trying to figure out \nwhere there is a balance. Where is that fairness? Given that a $2,500 \ncontribution to me as a candidate--the maximum that can be given to any \ncandidate for any election--has to be disclosed, I do not understand \nwhy the bill that is before us, the DISCLOSE Act 3.0, sets the bar for \ndisclosure of a contribution to an independent effort at $10,000. That \ndoes not make sense to me either.\n  So I guess where I am at this point in time--recognizing that in a \nmatter of minutes we are going to have yet another vote on DISCLOSE \nunder reconsideration--I do think that all these issues need to be \naddressed in a DISCLOSE 4.0. Maybe we will move to that in the next \niteration, but that is not going to be happening here. Yesterday's vote \nwas decisive. As I mentioned, I was flying all day. I was not here at 6 \no'clock when that vote was taken. But that vote was pretty clear. There \nis no way we can reconfigure things, even with the support of Lisa \nMurkowski, so that we could actually get to this bill and start making \nthose changes.\n  So we are sitting here at a point where we have precious little time \nbefore us before we break for August and then come back. We have the \ncampaigns. We have a lot on our plate. I think we recognize that. \nSaying that, I have already said I think this is a critically important \nissue. But it is an issue we will not resolve today. It is not possible \nto resolve today. So we should accept that fact and move forward. We \nhave a lot to do.\n  What I intend to do is to continue the work I began months ago with \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to work to resolve some of \nthese issues, to work on a bipartisan basis on a bill that I hope we \ncan take up as a body. There are Senators who want to work on this. I \nhave met with them and we continue to try to figure out that path \nforward. But that path forward has to be a bipartisan path. It has to \nbe a bipartisan path.\n  I hope we can put some kind of a vehicle to hearings and consider it \non the floor with an open amendment process, the way we can and should \ndo things around here. That is what I strive to do. That is my \ncommitment. I want to work with my colleague from Rhode Island. I want \nto work with my colleagues from Colorado and Oregon and New York and my \ncolleagues on the Republican side of the aisle. I think we all \nrecognize this is in the best interests of not only those of us in the \nSenate but for those we represent--that there is a level of \ntransparency, openness, fairness, and balance when it comes to campaign \nfinance. That is my commitment.\n  With that, I know I have probably consumed more than my time. But I \nappreciate the opportunity to work seriously and genuinely with my \ncolleagues on this issue.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to S. 3369, the so-called DISCLOSE Act. Because \nthe bill is designed to protect entrenched Washington special interests \nfrom ordinary Americans who want to exercise their first amendment \nrights, I will oppose cloture.\n  Regulation of speech always raises significant constitutional \nquestions. The first amendment is a cornerstone of our democracy, and \nthe DISCLOSE Act would fundamentally remake the rules governing free \nspeech in American elections. It is intended not to promote \ntransparent, accountable, and fair campaigns, but rather to tilt the \nplaying field in favor of the Democratic Party and its constituencies.\n  Indeed, one of the chief sponsors of this legislation, Senator \nCharles Schumer, has admitted that his goal is to deter certain \nAmericans from participating in the electoral process. The DISCLOSE Act \nwill make many businesses and organizations ``think twice'' before \nengaging in political speech, Senator Schumer said in 2010. ``The \ndeterrent effect should not be underestimated.''\n  In essence, the Democrats have concocted a bill that would silence \ntheir critics while letting their special interest allies speak. Nearly \nevery major provision of the DISCLOSE Act was designed to encourage \nspeech that helps the Democratic Party and discourage speech that hurts \nit. For example, the legislation favors unions over businesses, which \nbelies the notion that it was crafted to prevent conflicts of interest.\n  If the true purpose of this bill were to promote transparency and \nminimize the influence of political money on government, then unions \nwould face the same restrictions as businesses. But the true purpose of \nthe bill is to help Democrats win elections, and unions overwhelmingly \nsupport Democrats, so they are given preferential treatment.\n  It is not the government's job to apportion first amendment rights \namong Americans. Those rights belong to every citizen, period. I reject \nany further erosion of a constitutional liberty that has preserved and \nstrengthened our democracy for 223 years.\n  I oppose the DISCLOSE Act and urge my colleagues to oppose this \nafternoon's cloture motion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the DISCLOSE \nAct.\n  It is important for Americans to know where the money is coming from \nthat supports the political ads appearing on their television screens \nduring election season.\n  This bill is a much needed response to the Supreme Court's decision \nin Citizens United--a decision that is resulting in corporate money \ndrowning out the voices of ordinary citizens.\n  In Citizens United, the Supreme Court overruled decades of legal \nprecedent when it decided that corporations cannot be restricted from \nspending unlimited amounts in Federal elections.\n  The decision was astounding, not just because it was a display of \njudicial activism but also because it defies common sense for the \nSupreme Court to conclude that corporations or even labor organizations \nare citizens, as you or I am, in the eyes of the law.\n  As Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in his dissent, ``corporations \nhave no consciences, no beliefs, no feelings, no thoughts, no desires . \n. . they are not themselves members of `We the People' by whom and for \nwhom our Constitution was established.''\n  In the aftermath of the Citizens United decision, special interest \ngroups known as super PACs with innocuous names like ``American \nCrossroads'' and ``Restore our Future'' are primed to spend hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in the 2012 election.\n  According to OpenSecrets.org, Super PACs have raised $246 million in \nsecret\n\n[[Page S5070]]\n\nmoney so far in the 2012 election cycle--and we still have 113 days \nuntil the election during which that total may double or even triple.\n  The New York Times recently reported that secret groups have \naccounted for two-thirds of all political advertising spending this \nyear.\n  Unlike funds given directly to candidates and political parties, \nwhich get reported to the Federal Election Commission and are available \nfor the public to review, funds given to super PACs are secret, leaving \nvoters with no knowledge of who is behind attack ads against political \ncandidates.\n  Right now the rules require that individuals who give $200 or more to \na candidate must submit detailed information about their identity, \ntheir address, and their occupation. But Citizens United says that if \nyou give $2,000, $2 million, or $20 million to a super PAC, you don't \nhave to disclose a thing.\n  Former member of the Federal Election Commission Trevor Potter said \nindividuals ``can still give the maximum $2,500 directly to the \ncampaign--and then turn around and give $25 million to the Super PAC.''\n  At a minimum, voters in a democracy deserve to know who is \nfinancially supporting candidates for public office.\n  Editorial boards in California and across the country recognize that \ndisclosure and transparency are essential for the integrity of our \ndemocratic system.\n  The Sacramento Bee writes that ``reasonable people can disagree on \nwhether corporations should be able to donate to campaigns, or whether \nthe size of donations should be capped. But there should be no debate \nabout whether donations should be open and readily accessible to the \npublic.''\n  The Los Angeles Times writes that ``there is no cogent argument \nagainst maximum disclosure. Nor is there any First Amendment argument \nfor secrecy . . . If those who seek to influence elections don't have \nthe courage of their convictions, Congress must act to identify them.''\n  The San Jose Mercury News writes that ``since the Supreme Court made \nit all but impossible to regulate corporate influence on campaigns, the \nonly thing left is requiring swift and thorough disclosure.''\n  And that is exactly what the DISCLOSE Act does.\n  It requires super PACs, corporations, and labor organizations that \nspend $10,000 or more for campaign purposes to file a disclosure report \nwith the Federal Election Commission within 24 hours of the \nexpenditure. The organization must also disclose the sources of all \ndonations it receives in excess of $10,000. The disclosure must also \ninclude a certification that organization's spending is in no way \ncoordinated with a candidate's campaign. These are carefully targeted \nreforms to ensure that the American people are informed during the \nelectoral process.\n  Outside spending on our elections has gotten out of control in the \npost-Citizens United world created by the Supreme Court.\n  Sheldon Adelson, a casino magnate, who gave $20 million to a super \nPAC to prop up the Presidential campaign of Newt Gingrich, told Forbes \nMagazine: ``I'm against very wealthy people attempting to or \ninfluencing elections, but as long as it's doable, I'm going to do \nit.''\n  A super PAC affiliated with House Republican majority leader Eric \nCantor raised $5.3 million in the third quarter this year. Adelson is \nresponsible for providing $5 million of the total.\n  The super PAC affiliated with Mitt Romney, ``Restore our Future,'' \nhas raised $61 million so far. Most of this money came from just a \nhandful of individuals.\n  During the 2012 Florida GOP Presidential primary, Romney super PACs \nran 12,000 ads in that state alone.\n  A New York Times analysis of donations to Romney super PACs found \nsizeable amounts from companies with just a post office box as a \nheadquarters, and no known employees.\n  A USA Today analysis of GOP super PACs through February 2012 found \nthat $1 out of every $4 donated to these Super PACs was given by five \nindividuals.\n  A US PIRG/Demos study found that 96 percent of super PAC \ncontributions were at least $10,000 in size, quadruple the $2,500 \ndonation limit individuals are allowed to give specific candidates.\n  The Center for Responsive Politics found that the top 100 individual \nsuper PAC donors make up only 4 percent of the total contributors to \nsuper PACs, but they account for more than 80 percent of the total \nmoney raised.\n  According to Politico, the Koch Brothers and their companies plan to \nspend $400 million on the 2012 election, which would be more than \nSenator John McCain raised during his entire 2008 run for President.\n  A super PAC called ``Spirit of Democracy America'' spent $160,000 in \nsupport of a primary candidate in California's 8th Congressional \nDistrict. The super PAC has no Web site and provided no details prior \nto the primary election to voters in the district about who was behind \ntheir expenditures. The super PAC accounted for 64 percent of all the \noutside money spent on the race.\n  A 21-year-old Texas college student used a multimillion dollar \ninheritance from his grandfather to spend more than $500,000 on \ntelevision ads and direct mail in a Kentucky congressional election, \nhelping his handpicked candidate win the primary in an upset.\n  The American people are tired of these stories, and they are tired of \nbig money in politics.\n  Overwhelmingly, and on a bipartisan basis, they support disclosure \nlaws and contribution limits.\n  Because of the massive influence super PACs are having on elections, \nearlier this month the USA Today issued a frightening prediction about \nthis fall's election.\n  They write that ``the inevitable result is that come November, voters \nin many closely contested races will make their decisions based on a \nlate flood of ads of dubious credibility paid for by people whose names \nand motives are unknown.''\n  The American people deserve to have a government that is always of \nthe people, by the people, and for the people.\n  The DISCLOSE Act will help restore the voice of the people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of \nS. 3369, the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending in \nElections, DISCLOSE, Act. I am proud to join 39 of my colleagues in \nsponsoring this measure and urge the Senate to act now to pass this \ntransparent, commonsense piece of legislation.\n  Free, fair, and open elections, as well as an informed electorate, \nare fundamental to ensuring that our government reflects the highest \nprinciples of democracy, which is the foundation of this country.\n  What is at stake today is nothing short of our electoral system. We \nmust reinforce the right of Americans to make fully informed decisions \nabout the political candidates and parties that seek to represent them \nin government.\n  More than 2 years ago, the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision in \nCitizens United set the stage for the emergence of super political \naction committees, PACs, primarily underwritten by wealthy individuals \nto finance unregulated and often anonymous attack political campaign \nadvertising. This decision effectively puts our elected positions up \nfor sale to moneyed interests.\n  The DISCLOSE Act would address problems caused by the Citizens United \ndecision by restoring accountability and transparency to our electoral \nsystem. It would simply require labor unions, traditional PACs, super \nPACs, and other covered organizations that spend $10,000 or more on \npolitical campaigns to identify themselves by filing a timely report \nwith the Federal Elections Commission.\n  Opponents of the DISCLOSE Act claim that this bill would impede free \nspeech and discourage political involvement. I cannot disagree more. To \nthe contrary, the DISCLOSE Act preserves the right to express one's \nopinions and ideas through contributions to political campaigns; it \nonly forces large contributors to identify themselves when making \ninfluential contributions. Furthermore, it promotes civic involvement \nby empowering voters to effectively participate in the electoral \nprocess and make informed choices about their leaders.\n  We are all here to represent the voters in our States and districts \nwho have entrusted us to represent them. In\n\n[[Page S5071]]\n\nour system of checks and balances, elected officials remain beholden to \ntheir constituents through elections; however, to allow this system to \nwork, voters need to have all of the essential information that could \ninfluence their decision: who we are, who our supporters are, and how \nmuch support we have received from various sources.\n  No democracy, including this one, can remain fair, successful, and \nviable if wealthy individuals are allowed to spend unchecked sums of \nmoney to anonymously influence the outcomes of its elections.\n  I urge my colleagues to do what is right for all Americans today and \npass this important bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \ngiven 4 minutes, the Senator from Rhode Island be given 6 minutes to \nconclude, and we vote immediately thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, I would just like to make one preliminary \ncomment, and then I would like to address what my colleague from Alaska \nhas said and this bill.\n\n\n                             Fiscal Policy\n\n  On another issue, I just heard that Vice President Cheney came to \naddress the Republican caucus on our fiscal cliff. I would suggest that \nthe man who said deficits do not matter is not a very good teacher for \nthe Republican caucus when it comes to deficit reduction and the fiscal \ncliff. They could get better teachers than that.\n  As for this issue, first, I wish to thank my colleague from Alaska \nfor her heartfelt comments. She is what we need, somebody who cares \nabout this issue, somebody who has great reach across the aisle, and \nsomebody who is willing to work with us.\n  It is true, it is obvious we will not have the votes to win the \nDISCLOSE Act. It is simple disclosure. We tried to make it--under the \nleadership of Senator Whitehouse; I will address that in 1 minute--we \ntried to make it as narrow as possible. We tried to deal with all the \nobjections we heard about labor unions and others. That is why there is \na $10,000 amount--far beyond the labor union dues of any union I am \naware of. We tried to make it as down the middle as possible for simple \ndisclosure.\n  But I understand where my colleague from Alaska is coming from. I \nrespect it, and I look forward to working with her. She might be the \nbridge we need because, mark my words, if we do not do something about \nthis, we will not have the Republic we know in 5 years. It is that \nsimple. This great country we all love has been dramatically changed by \nCitizens United. The failure to correct its huge deficiencies, to have \nsuch a small number of people have such a huge influence on our body \npolitic--we have never seen it before. Oh, yes, we have read about our \nhistory, and we know there were small groups that were powerful in the \npast, the robber barons, et cetera. But never, never, never have a \nhandful of people had such awesome tools to influence our political \nsystem in a way they choose without any accountability--never.\n  The robber barons were more accountable and more diffuse. The small \ngroup that led America, supposedly, in the 1920s was more accountable \nand more diffuse. The military industrial complex that President \nEisenhower warned about was far broader and more diffuse. To have a \nsmall number of people--most of them angry people, most of them people \nwho do not even give any attention to someone who does not agree with \nthem--to give them such awesome power, which is the power to run \nnegative political ads over and over and have no accountability as to \nwho is running them, that is a true danger to the Republic.\n  It befuddles me that our U.S. Supreme Court does not see it. We want \nour courts to be insulated from the vicissitudes of politics. But to \nhave a Court that is so insulated that it does not see, smell, hear, \ntouch what is going on in this Republic does not speak well of that \nCourt. I think it is the main reason its popularity has declined. I \nhope our Justices will wake and realize what they are doing.\n  I would say again--first, I wish to thank Senator Whitehouse. He has \nbeen a great leader on this issue. I wish to thank all my colleagues. \nWe have been debating this bill for 10 hours--more than 10 hours, I \nbelieve--and there has not been one quorum call, which means there has \nbeen speaking time from about 6 last night until 1 in the morning----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, at least--at least--10 Republican \nSenators are on record supporting transparency and disclosure in \nelection spending. Some of them are very significant leaders on the \nRepublican side.\n  Senator Mitch McConnell said this:\n\n       I think disclosure is the best disinfectant.\n\n  Senator John Cornyn, head of the Republican campaign operation, said \nthis:\n\n       I think the system needs more transparency so people can \n     more easily reach their own conclusions.\n\n  Other Senators, colleagues, and friends come from States that require \ndisclosure in election spending. The States they represent know this is \nwrong. The arguments against this bill are few. Some of those arguments \nare false. Others don't hold water. Huge majorities of Americans--\nRepublicans, Democrats, and Independents--support cleaning up this \nmess.\n  More than 700,000 Americans signed up as citizen cosponsors of this \nbill in the last few days. The actual number, I believe, is 721,000. \nBut then that ran up against this: outside political spending that went \nfrom 1 percent to 44 percent, not disclosed in the last election. And \nthese secret groups, such as Crossroads, with $76.8 million, and the \nmajority of the money that they spend is secret money--that has changed \nthe debate. But those who are out of the need for that secret money, \nsuch as former Republican Senators Rudman and Hagel, are clear:\n\n       A bill is being debated this week in the Senate, called the \n     DISCLOSE Act of 2012. This bill is a well-researched, well-\n     conceived solution to this insufferable situation. We believe \n     every Senator should embrace the DISCLOSE Act of 2012. This \n     legislation treats trade unions and corporations equally and \n     gives neither party an advantage. It is good for Republicans \n     and it is good for Democrats.\n\n  Most important, it is good for the American people. I urge my \ncolleagues on the Republican side to follow the example of their former \ncolleagues Senator Rudman and Senator Hagel; and I pledge to Senator \nMurkowski that we take her comments very seriously. She has cast a \nsliver of daylight. I intend to pursue that sliver ardently to work \nthrough this problem.\n  I will conclude by also complimenting Senator McCain. He believes \nthere is a benefit for unions in here that I do not see, which I \ndisagree exists. But certainly he has a record of courage and \ndetermination on campaign finance that entitles his judgment to our \nrespect. I look forward to working with both of them.\n  I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum required \nunder rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, once again I am disappointed, as I think \nmost people in this country are, on an issue as timely as this, \noutsourcing jobs, that we once again are being stymied on moving to \nthat legislation. We are going to have a vote. The rules are we cannot \nhave a vote on this until 2 days go by, so that is a vote on Thursday. \nIf cloture is invoked on that, then we are only on the bill, and then \nto get off of it would take another series of days. I think to get \nfinal action on this is going to take a week.\n  It is so unfortunate that we have to go through this. We have gone \nthrough this so many times. There is, I repeat, not an issue more \ntimely than this--outsourcing jobs. Whether it is the Olympic uniforms \nor the many other jobs that have been lost around the country, the \nAmerican people are tired of it, but I think it is unfortunate the \nRepublicans are stopping us from being able to start legislating on \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the motion we have before us to begin consideration of my bill, \nthe Bring Jobs Home Act. I thank my leader for making this a priority \nand thank the President of the United States for also making this a \npriority as we move forward.\n  Let me start on process, to say it is true, of course, as the leader \nindicated, we could be simply on this bill and working to complete it \nand pass it. But unfortunately, as happens on everything now, when the \nleader attempts to move to a bill, there is an objection to that. When \nthere is, it puts us into a situation where we have to spend several \ndays trying to overcome a potential filibuster to be able to move to \nthe bill. So, process-wise, that is where we are.\n  From a substance standpoint it is absolutely critical that we move to \nthis bill and that we pass it. The great recession and the financial \ncollapse of 2008 were absolutely devastating to our economy. We know \nthat during that time, 8 million Americans lost their jobs and many are \nstill struggling to get out of their own deficit hole because of what \nhappened. These are people who worked all their lives and played by the \nrules, only to have the rug pulled out from under them.\n  Many of these people were folks who worked in manufacturing, many in \nmy great State of Michigan. We are so proud that we make things in \nMichigan. We do not have a middle class, we do not have an economy \nunless we make things. That is what we do in Michigan. For decades, \nthis has been the foundation of our economy. Frankly, it created the \nmiddle class of our country and we are proud it started in Michigan \nwith the beginning of the automobile industry.\n  It is no coincidence that as those jobs have disappeared over the \ndecades, the middle class has begun to disappear as well and families \nare in more and more difficult situations personally as a result of \nthat. Those jobs have been the driving force of our economy for \ndecades, as I indicated. Those jobs are the jobs that allowed the \n``greatest generation'' to build the greatest economy in the world, the \ngreatest economy we have ever seen. Those jobs led to tree-lined \nstreets with at least one car in every driveway, and the freedom to \nraise a family and send them to college and maybe have the cottage up \nnorth and be able to take the family on vacation and have the American \ndream.\n  Today in fact that dream is in jeopardy and every American family \nknows that. But it does not have to be that way. In the last decade, \ncompanies shipped 2.4 million jobs overseas. To add insult to injury, \nAmerican taxpayers were asked to help foot the bill.\n  It is amazing. When I explain that to folks in Michigan, they say you \nhave to be kidding--or they say other things I cannot repeat on the \nfloor of the Senate. Just imagine if you are one of those workers in \nMichigan or in Virginia or in Ohio or in Wisconsin or anywhere in this \ncountry who maybe was forced to train your overseas replacement before \nyou were laid off. Imagine what your reaction would be--more colorful \nthan I have been able to state here. When an American worker is asked \nto subsidize the moving expenses, as they do today under current\n\n[[Page S5073]]\n\ntax policy--the moving expenses and costs so their own job can be \nshipped overseas--there is something seriously wrong with our Tax Code \nand with our priorities.\n  It does not have to be that way. In fact, we can change that. We can \nchange that this week on the floor of the Senate by passing the Bring \nJobs Home Act and sending it to the House and then sending it to the \nPresident where I know he will enthusiastically and immediately sign \nit.\n  Instead of rewarding companies for shipping jobs overseas, we want to \nreward companies for bringing jobs home. That is the whole point of \nthis bill. We stop the tax deduction for moving expenses related to \nmoving jobs overseas. That is what this bill does. Right now you can \ndeduct those expenses as part of your business expenses. We say: No \nmore. Second, we say: However, if you want to come home, we will \nhappily give you that deduction for the costs of moving back to the \nUnited States and we will add an additional 20 percent tax credit for \nthose costs of bringing jobs back to the United States. That is what we \nare doing in the Bring Jobs Home Act.\n  This is common sense. Unfortunately it is not that common these days, \nbut it is common sense and it is good economic sense as well. It is so \nimportant that we pass this bill. We talk about tax reform. We talk \nabout having a lot of tax loopholes. This is one we can eliminate right \nnow, together, on a bipartisan basis. Let's start here, the No. 1 \nloophole, we will close it; No. 1 priority, jobs in America.\n  I know some of my colleagues do not believe these jobs are ever \ncoming back. I hear that all the time. We in Michigan have been seeing \nthat same defeatist argument for 20 years. But in fact that is not \ntrue. One of the things I am proudest of in the last 3\\1/2\\ years is \nthat we have refocused on advanced manufacturing, making things in \nAmerica, in this country. We have a lot more to do but we have in fact \nrefocused on jobs here at home and we are seeing, because of that, a \nwhole range of policies--whether it is the advanced manufacturing tax \ncut I offered in the Recovery Act, that allows a 30-percent writeoff \nfor clean energy manufacturing jobs, or whether it is the retooling \nloans we put in place to be able to help retool plants to be able to \nmodernize in the name of advanced manufacturing. It is bringing jobs \nback.\n  We put in place some initial actions that are making a difference and \nwe are now seeing every month that manufacturing is having an uptick. \nIt has been one of the only areas where pretty much every month we have \nbegun to see a slow return. We are beginning to see some of these jobs \ncome back as a result. Our companies are doing the calculations, \nfinding out that bringing jobs home makes good business sense. It is \ntime our Tax Code stops standing in the way and actually has caught up \nwith what many businesses are doing.\n  Ford Motor Company brought jobs back from Mexico to support advanced \nvehicle manufacturing at their newly retooled Wayne Assembly Plant in \nWayne, MI. Chrysler is growing and expanding their operations here in \nthe United States, investing--95 percent I believe is the last number \nwhich I heard of their investments are being done in America. We are \nproud to have them investing in Detroit and in Michigan. Last week we \nsaw a report that GM is about to go on a ``hiring binge.'' I love this, \nI love anything called a hiring binge, as they bring almost all of \ntheir information technology needs back in-house, and to America.\n  We have a great company in Detroit--actually from New Jersey, now in \nDetroit--Galaxy Solutions, that has an ``outsource to Detroit'' effort \ngoing on to bring IT back from places such as India and Brazil and \nChina. We have on the side of one of our largest buildings this great \nsign that says ``outsource to Detroit.'' If we are going to outsource \nsomewhere, let's outsource to our American cities. We love the fact \nthat they are part of the effort to rebuild and refocus on Detroit.\n  We have companies that want to invest in America. We have stories \nabout GE coming back. We have stories in every State of companies that \nare bringing jobs back to America. We have men and women who want to \nwork. We have companies that are looking at bringing jobs back. CNBC \ncalled it ``the stuff that dreams are made of.''\n  I think going forward the great economic resurgence for us is \ninvolved in advanced manufacturing, making things in America and \nbringing our jobs back to America. It is more than time. It is what our \nworkers are dreaming of. We are proud in Michigan of our workforce, \nthese folks who know how to work, they want to work, they work hard \nevery day. I have to say that efforts such as ``outsource to Detroit'' \nare giving them a new chance to do that, as well as the other efforts \nthat are going on around Michigan.\n  There are so many opportunities right here in America. We have the \ngreat new ideas. We have the ingenuity and the innovation. We have to \nmake sure we have the right policies to make it happen, that we are not \ndoing anything in our Tax Code that encourages jobs to go overseas; \nthat we do everything possible to support efforts to bring them back \nand then to reinvest and to expand upon research, development, \ninnovation, retooling the plants we have, reinvesting in communities, \nreinvesting in our cities, and focusing on a strategy of American jobs. \nThat is what everyone wants us to be doing.\n  There is a great place to start and that is with our Tax Code so that \nit catches up with what leading-edge business leaders already know. \nAmerican businesses, American workers can compete with anybody in the \nworld if we have a level playing field and we give them a chance to do \nit.\n  This is a moment, I believe, for us to indicate very strongly to \neverybody in the country that we get it and that we are not going to \nallow the Tax Code to continue to create a situation where if someone \nwants to close up shop and move overseas they can get a tax writeoff as \na result. That makes absolutely no sense. I cannot imagine any other \ncountry in the world allowing that to happen.\n  When I think about places such as China, where at this point they \nsay: Come on over, we will build the plant for you. Forget about a \nretooling loan; we will build the plant for you. Of course, then we \nwill steal their patents, and there are a lot other challenges, but: \nCome on over and we will build the plant for you. The last numbers I \nsaw showed that China was spending $288 million a day--probably more \nnow--on clean energy policies and manufacturing, and new cutting-edge \nefforts to try to compete and beat us in an area we should own.\n  Between our universities and our businesses and our great workforce \nwe ought to completely own these technologies. I am very proud to say \nthat Michigan is now No. 1 in new clean energy patents. We were proud \nto open, last Friday, the first U.S. Patent Office outside of \nWashington, DC, in Detroit, MI, as a result of that. There are great \nideas happening all over this country right now, innovators--frankly, \npeople who have lost their jobs and they are now back in their garage \nor basement or the extra bedroom, with new ideas. We want to create \nbusinesses to support their creation of businesses by incentivizing \nthem, not having a Tax Code that incentivizes somebody to move \noverseas.\n  This legislation I think is pretty simple. It is about bringing jobs \nhome to America. We are going to stop writing off the costs, allowing \nthat business to be subsidized by all of us, including the people they \nlay off, in order to move overseas. Instead, we are going to say no, if \nyou move overseas you are on your own. But if you want to come back we \nare happy to allow you a business deduction for those moving expenses \nand we will add another 20 percent toward the costs of your expenses on \ntop of it. That is what we should be doing. That is smart tax policy. \nIt is common sense. It is one step in a series of things we need to do \nin order to be able to bring jobs home and make things in America \nagain. I hope we will see an overwhelmingly positive, bipartisan vote \non this bill. It would send a wonderful message that we can work \ntogether.\n  We worked together not long ago to pass a farm bill with a strong \nbipartisan vote because we need to make and grow products in America. \nThat is how we make an economy; that is how we have a middle class. We \ncame together, and I am very appreciative of everyone coming together \nand working with me and Senator Roberts to get that done. This is \nanother opportunity.\n\n[[Page S5074]]\n\nIt is another way for us to come together and say: We get it. We \nunderstand what is going on in the country.\n  Let's work together and get the job done. I strongly urge colleagues \nto come together and pass the Bring Jobs Home Act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Tax Reform\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I rise to speak about progrowth tax \nreform. One week ago Monday, President Obama proposed to raise taxes on \nover 1 million small businesses in this country. Even though he said in \nthe past that we cannot raise taxes in a recession and that higher \ntaxes will hurt our economy and hurt job creation, he proposed raising \ntaxes on more than 1 million small businesses across this country.\n  Last week I came to the floor to talk about why that is not the right \napproach and to discuss the approach we should take, the right \napproach. I pointed out that his approach--the administration's \napproach--has made our economy worse since he took office.\n  Here are the facts, and they speak for themselves. Today we have 8.2 \npercent unemployment. We have had over 8 percent unemployment for 41 \nstraight weeks. We have more than 13 million people who are out of work \nand another 10 million people who are underemployed. That is 23 million \npeople who are either unemployed or underemployed. Middle-class income \nhas declined from an average of $55,000 down to $50,000 since the \nPresident took office. Food stamp usage is up. There were 32 million \nfood stamp recipients at the beginning of the Obama administration; \ntoday there are 46 million recipients. We have gone from 32 million \npeople on food stamps to 46 million people on food stamps. Home values \nhave dropped from an average of $169,000 to an average of about \n$148,000.\n  Let's talk about economic growth. GDP growth is the weakest for any \nrecovery since World War II. In the last quarter, the rate of growth \nwas 1.9 percent over the prior quarter. There were 82,000 jobs created \nin the month of June. We need 150,000 jobs gained each month just to \nkeep up with population growth and to reduce the unemployment rolls.\n  Those are some of the statistics.\n  When I spoke on the Senate floor last week, I also read a letter from \none of my constituents back home who is a small business owner. He owns \nan Ace Hardware store. In his letter, he stated very clearly and very \neloquently that the President's approach with small business is hurting \nour economy. I am not going to read the full letter, but I do want to \nread a couple of lines from his letter.\n  His letter states:\n\n       The president's programs not only limit my company's \n     potential to grow, but they destroy any incentive to work and \n     hire more people. I just don't know if he doesn't understand \n     what he's doing, or just doesn't care.\n\n  I am taking that right out of a small businessperson's letter. Keep \nthat last line in mind for just a minute.\n\n       I just don't know if he--\n\n  President Obama--\n\n     doesn't understand what he's doing, or just doesn't care.\n\n  I referenced that because the President gave a speech last Friday in \nRoanoke, VA. In his speech, he followed up on his plan to raise taxes \non small businesses. I am going to read right from the President's \nspeech. I think it gives insight as to his view of small business and \nhow our economy works.\n  He said:\n\n       There are a lot of wealthy, successful Americans who agree \n     with me--because they want to give something back. They know \n     they didn't--look, if you've been successful, you didn't get \n     there on your own. You didn't get there on your own. I'm \n     always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I \n     was just so smart. There are a lot of smart people out there. \n     It must be because I worked harder than everybody else. Let \n     me tell you something--there are a whole bunch of hardworking \n     people out there.\n       If you were successful, somebody along the line gave you \n     some help. There was a great teacher somewhere in your life. \n     Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system \n     that we have that allowed you to thrive. Somebody invested in \n     roads and bridges. If you've got a business--you didn't build \n     that. Somebody else made that happen. The Internet didn't get \n     invented on its own. Government research created the Internet \n     so that all the companies could make money off the Internet.\n\n  So that is right out of the President's speech in Roanoke, VA, last \nFriday. I think these comments provide real insight into President \nObama's view of our economy and the role of small business in our \neconomy. He says we have all had help in our lives, and that is \ncertainly true. There is no question about that, and I don't think \nanyone disputes that.\n  He makes it clear that he believes government, not small business, is \nthe driver of our economy. He says it is government that paves our \nroads and invented the Internet. In essence, it is government that made \nsuccessful people successful and government that makes our economy go.\n  That is just not right. It is small business that makes our economy \ngo. It is small business that made our economy the envy of the world. \nIt is small business that serves as the backbone of our economy, that \nemploys our people, that generates tax revenue to build our roads, \ncreates innovation like the Internet, and that provides Americans with \nthe highest standard of living in the world. Small business is the \nengine that drives our economy, and we need to get it going. We don't \ndo that by raising taxes and growing government. Clearly, that is not \nthe way to go.\n  The President says everyone needs to pay their fair share. Well, of \ncourse everyone needs to pay their fair share, but the way to ensure \nthat gets accomplished is with comprehensive progrowth tax reform and \nclosing loopholes. Let's extend the current tax rates for 1 year, and \nlet's set up a process to pass comprehensive progrowth tax reform that \nlowers rates, closes loopholes, that is fair, that is simpler, and that \nwill generate revenue to reduce our deficit and our debt through \neconomic growth rather than through higher taxes. The reality is that \nis the only way to go--along with reducing government spending--that \nwill get our debt and deficit under control and get our people back to \nwork. To be successful, this effort needs to be bipartisan, and the \nclock is ticking.\n  So let's get started. Let's give small business in this country the \nlegal, tax, and regulatory certainty to encourage private investment \nand innovation. That is the American way. That is the real American \nsuccess story. We can do it, and we need to make it happen now.\n  Thank you, Madam President, and I yield the floor. I would also \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           FDA Investigation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I come to the floor to address my \ncolleagues about a Federal agency that has forgotten that this Federal \nagency is supposed to be working for the American people. This is an \nagency that has gotten too big for its britches. Some of the officials \nhave forgotten who pays their salary.\n  The Food and Drug Administration is supposed to protect the American \npeople, except lately the only thing the FDA bureaucrats seem to have \nany interest in is protecting themselves. According to whistleblowers \nand published reports in the Washington Post and in the New York Times, \nthe agency in charge of safeguarding the American public and providing \nfor the public safety has trampled on the privacy of its very own \nemployees. The FDA mounted an aggressive campaign against employees who \nwould dare to question its actions and created what the New York Times \ntermed an ``enemies list'' of people it considered dangerous. It kind \nof reminds us of President Nixon and the IRS going after enemies.\n  The Food and Drug Administration has been spying on this enemies \nlist. The FDA has been spying on the personal e-mails of these \nemployees and\n\n[[Page S5075]]\n\neverybody these employees contacted. That includes their protected \ncommunications even with those of us in Congress.\n  We would not have known the extent of the spying if internal FDA \ndocuments about it had not been released on the Internet, apparently \njust by accident. We would not have known how the FDA intentionally \ntargeted and captured confidential, personal e-mails between the \nwhistleblowers, their lawyers, and those of us in Congress.\n  In these internal documents, the FDA never wanted the public to see \nthat it referred to whistleblowers as ``collaborators.'' FDA refers to \ncongressional staff as ``ancillary actors.'' FDA refers to newspaper \nreporters as ``media outlet actors.'' These memos make the FDA sound \nmore like the East German Stasi than a consumer protection agency in a \nfree country.\n  At the beginning of Commissioner Hamburg's term, she said \nwhistleblowers exposed critical issues within the FDA. That seems to be \na very approving comment. She vowed to create a culture that values \nwhistleblowers. That appears to be a very approving statement. In fact, \nin 2009 she said: ``I think whistleblowers serve an important role.''\n  I wanted to believe Commissioner Hamburg when she testified before \nthe Senate committee during her confirmation. I wanted to believe her \nwhen she said she would protect whistleblowers at the Food and Drug \nAdministration. However, the facts now appear very different.\n  In this case, the FDA invaded the privacy of multiple whistleblowers. \nIt hacked into the private e-mail accounts and used sophisticated \nkeystroke logging software to monitor their every move online.\n  When an FDA supervisor was placed under oath in the course of an \nequal employment opportunity complaint, that employee--that \nsupervisor--testified that the FDA was conducting ``routine security \nmonitoring.'' That is entirely false. This monitoring was anything but \nroutine. It specifically targeted five whistleblowers. It intentionally \ncaptured their private e-mails to attorneys, to Members of Congress, \nand to the Office of Special Counsel. The internal documents showed \nthat this was a unique, highly sophisticated, and highly specialized \noperation.\n  According to the Office of the Inspector General, the Food and Drug \nAdministration had no evidence of any criminal wrongdoing by these \nwhistleblowers. This massive campaign of spying was not just an \ninvasion of privacy; it was specifically designed to intercept \ncommunications that are protected by law. The Office of Special Counsel \nis an agency created by Congress to receive whistleblower complaints \nand to protect whistleblowers from retaliation. The law protects \ncommunications with the special counsel as a way to encourage \nwhistleblowers to report waste, fraud, abuse, mismanagement, and \nthreats to the public safety, and to do that reporting without fear of \nretaliation. The FDA knew that contacts between whistleblowers and the \nOffice of Special Counsel are privileged and confidential, but the \nJames Bond wannabes at the FDA just didn't seem to care what the law \nsaid.\n  In the end, the self-appointed spies turned out to be more like the \nbumbling Maxwell Smart. Along with their own internal memos about \nspying, the fruits of their labor were also accidentally posted on the \nInternet. It is tens of thousands of pages of e-mails and pictures of \nthe whistleblower computer screens containing some of the very same \ninformation the FDA bureaucrats were so keen to keep secret.\n  When I started asking questions about this, FDA officials seemed to \nsuffer from a sudden bout of collective amnesia. It took them more than \n6 months to answer a letter from last January starting my investigation \nof this issue. When I pushed for a reply during those 6 months, FDA \ntold my staff that the response would take time to make sure it was \naccurate and complete.\n  When I finally got the response on Friday, it doesn't even answer the \nsimplest of questions, such as who authorized this targeted spy ring, \nand isn't it a coincidence that just Friday, before the New York Times \narticle was going to come out, they finally answered a letter going way \nback to my questions of January. Worse than that, though, it is \nmisleading in its denials about intentionally intercepting \ncommunications with Congress.\n  When I asked them why they couldn't just answer some simple \nquestions, they told my staff that the response was under review by the \n``appropriate officials in the Administration.'' The nonanswers and the \ndoublespeak would have fit right into some George Orwell novel.\n  Of course, when my staff dug deeper and asked if the response was \nbeing reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget, the Food and \nDrug Administration responded: No, it wasn't being reviewed by OMB.\n  FDA refused to identify who within the administration was holding up \nthe FDA's response to my letter. Now, that is in an administration that \nsaid on January 20, 2009, they are going to be the most transparent in \nthe history of this country. FDA refused to say how long it had been \nsitting on that person's desk or why it had been approved by the \npolitical officials outside the FDA. Who is this shadowy figure \nconducting some secret review of the FDA's responses to this Senator's \nquestions? Why was there all of a sudden interest in exerting political \ncontrol over the correspondence of this supposedly independent Federal \nagency? And when we use the words ``independent Federal agency'' around \nhere, we mean not subject to political control.\n  We need answers, and we need answers now. I have been demanding \nanswers for 6 months. For the past 6 months, FDA has been telling me to \njust be patient. The FDA has been telling me they have a good story to \ntell--and those are their words, ``a good story to tell.''\n  Apparently, though, there is someone in this administration--\nPresident Obama's administration--who didn't want them to say anything \nfor as long as they could possibly get away with not saying anything. I \nfinally got Commissioner Hamburg on the phone in June of this year. \nCommissioner Hamburg personally assured me the FDA was going to fully \ncooperate with my investigation. Yet the FDA has provided me with \nnothing but misleading and incomplete responses.\n  The FDA has failed to measure up to Commissioner Hamburg's pledge of \ncooperation. The FDA buried its head in the sand in hopes I would lose \ninterest and go away. They don't know me very well. That is not going \nto happen.\n  I don't care who is in charge of the executive branch--Republican or \nDemocrat--I am going to continue demanding answers. When government \nbureaucrats obstruct and intercept my communications with protected \nwhistleblowers, I am not going to stop. When government bureaucrats \nstonewall for months on end, I will not stop. When government \nbureaucrats try and muddy the waters and mislead, I will not stop. I \nintend to get to the bottom of it.\n  I will continue to press the FDA until we know who authorized spying. \nCan my colleagues imagine spying in American government, a transparent \ngovernment--supposed to be transparent--spying on whistleblowers who \nare protected by law and who have a special office set up to protect \nthem, and spying on communications between a lawyer and their client?\n  Someone within the FDA specifically authorized spying on private \ncommunications with my own office and with several other Members of \nCongress. Someone at FDA specifically authorized spying on private \ncommunications with Congressman Van Hollen's office. Someone at FDA \nspecifically authorized spying on private communications with the staff \nof the Senate Special Committee on Aging. Someone at FDA specifically \nauthorized spying on private communications with the lawyers for \nwhistleblowers, and those lawyers are called the Office of Special \nCounsel.\n  These whistleblowers thought the FDA was approving drugs and \ntreatment it shouldn't. These whistleblowers thought the FDA was caving \nto pressure from the companies who were applying for FDA approval. They \nhave a right to express those concerns without any fear of retaliation \nwhatsoever, if the law is going to be followed--the law protecting \nwhistleblowers. But after doing so, two of these whistleblowers were \nfired, two more were forced to leave FDA, and five of them\n\n[[Page S5076]]\n\nwere subjected to an intense spying campaign.\n  Senior FDA officials may have broken the law. They authorized the \ncapturing of personal e-mail passwords through keystroke logging \nsoftware. That potentially allowed them to log in to the \nwhistleblower's personal e-mail accounts and access e-mails that were \nnever even accessed from a work computer. Without a subpoena or \nwarrant, that would be a criminal violation.\n  After 6 months, FDA finally denied that occurred. However, that \ndenial was based on the word of one unnamed information technology \nemployee involved in the monitoring. We need a more thorough \ninvestigation than that.\n  I have asked the FDA to make that person and several other witnesses \navailable for interviews with my staff. We will see how cooperative FDA \nplans to be now. I will continue to press the FDA to open every window \nand every door. Eventually enough sunlight on this agency will cleanse \nit.\n  FDA gets paid to protect the public, not to keep us in the dark. \nSecret monitoring programs, spying on Congress, and retaliating against \nwhistleblowers--this is a sad commentary on the state of affairs at the \nFDA.\n  I know there are hard-working and principled rank-and-file employees \nat the FDA who care very much about their mission to protect the \nAmerican public from harm. Unfortunately, all too often those rank-and-\nfile employees are unfairly tarnished by others, such as those involved \nin this spy ring.\n  This is a sad commentary on President Obama's promise to the American \npeople that this would be the most transparent administration in \nhistory. The American people cannot lose faith in the FDA. \nUnfortunately, after this debacle, some of that faith may deteriorate. \nThe FDA has a lot of work to do to restore the public's trust.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, the American people are struggling. Our \neconomy is barely keeping its head above water. Millions of citizens \nremain out of work. President Obama has spent trillions in taxpayer \ndollars, and there is nothing to show for it. He talks about \ninvestments--investments in infrastructure, in roads, and in bridges--\nwhile he has spent trillions. Where are the roads? Where are the \nbridges? Where is the new electrical grid?\n  This reckless spending is a sin of commission. But the \nadministration's sins of omission are perhaps worse.\n  With businesses and families lacking any certainty at all about their \ntax rates next year, the President and his liberal allies have, \nnonetheless, steadfastly refused an extension of the 2001 and 2003 tax \nrelief.\n  Even worse, they are so committed to raising taxes on small \nbusinesses--the same small businesses that must be cultivated to get \nour economy and job growth moving again--that he and his Democratic \nallies in the Senate have put their feet down and are denying tax \nrelief to anyone unless they get their way on tax increases.\n  And make no mistake about it, increasing taxes is what they intend to \ndo. They intend to do it so they can spend more. They live to raise \ntaxes. It is almost as though their only source of pleasure is hiking \ntaxes. Taking money out of the private sector and controlling it for \ntheir liberal agenda is like some power trip for the left.\n  And do not fall for that red herring fiscal responsibility argument \nadvanced by my friends on the other side. If you look at comparable \npolicy between the Hatch-McConnell amendment and the Democratic \nleadership's position, they differ by about $41 billion for the policy \nfor 2013. That $41 billion represents 1.1 percent of the spending \nproposed in the President's budget for 2013. The House budget, rejected \nby our friends on the other side, would reduce the deficit by \nrestraining spending by $180 billion--more than four times the deficit \nreduction that would be achieved through the tax hikes insisted upon by \nthe Democrats.\n  But what does that tax increase mean in terms of harm to the economy?\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle should consider this: \nToday, a study commissioned by the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, the S Corporation Association, and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce confirmed again that the President's attempt to stick it to \nthe rich is going to end up skewering small businesses and the families \nwho work for them, or would like to work for them.\n  This report, published by Ernst & Young--one of the great accounting \nfirms in this country--and authored by Dr. Robert Carroll and Gerald \nPrante, found that if the President gets his way, the economy will be \n1.3 percent smaller than it would be and there would be 710,000 fewer \njobs.\n  Study after study confirms that the President's policies prioritize \nspreading the wealth around over growing the economy and creating jobs.\n  The Vice President spoke yesterday about the values of Republicans \nand the values of Democrats. Naturally, he spoke pejoratively about \nRepublican values. I disagree with him, naturally, on his negative \nassessment, but I do agree that there is a clear distinction--a clear \nchoice--between the values embraced by Republicans and Democrats.\n  Republicans want to grow the economy and create jobs so that American \nfamilies can thrive. However, to judge by their single-minded pursuit \nof tax increases, President Obama and his liberal allies appear to \nvalue a politics of class envy and wealth redistribution. Having \nWashington bureaucrats manage the economy in the name of wealth \nequalization is their first priority, regardless of any evidence that \nthis tax policy undercuts economic growth and job creation.\n  Unfortunately, the President's economic ethic is significantly \nhampering our economic recovery with disastrous consequences for \nAmerica's families.\n  Today, Ben Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified \nbefore the Senate Banking Committee. As the Senate's Democratic \nleadership and the President ignore the fiscal cliff, Chairman \nBernanke's words are a somber reminder of what we face if we do not \naddress the fiscal cliff.\n  He testified that the recovery ``could be endangered by the \nconfluence of tax increases and spending reductions that will take \neffect early next year if no legislative action is taken.'' He stated \nthat the public uncertainty about the resolution of these issues is a \nnegative drag on the economy, and he concluded that addressing this \ncliff ``earlier rather than later would help reduce uncertainty and \nboost household and business confidence.''\n  But instead of addressing these critical economic issues, the Senate \nspent another day voting on the same doomed piece of partisan \nlegislation. Rather than take on the hard work of addressing the fiscal \ncliff that our economy is approaching, we spent precious time yesterday \ndebating the DISCLOSE Act. For those who are not aware, this is a bill \nthat had one purpose: to discourage political engagement by President \nObama's opponents.\n  It takes a pretty bad bill to unify the ACLU; that is, the American \nCivil Liberties Union, and the NRA against it. But the DISCLOSE Act has \nbrought the lion and the lamb together against it.\n  It is bad enough that we spent all of yesterday debating a bill that \nhas no shot of becoming law. It is even worse that we devoted nearly an \nentire day today to debating the same bill again. In the meantime, the \nAmerican people continue to suffer under this weak economy. And to \ndefend their lack of action, the President and his allies have engaged \nin some revisionist fiscal history.\n  I want to begin by correcting the record on this revisionist fiscal \nhistory. I will follow that with a discussion of the other side's \ninsatiable appetite for taxes and spending.\n  We have recently been debating whether we should adopt the \nPresident's policy to raise taxes on small business. We have also \ndiscussed the tax monster that is stalking the American people under \nthe guise of ObamaCare. In both of these debates, we have heard a good \ndeal of fictional accounting.\n\n[[Page S5077]]\n\n  These accounts share much with other stories we have heard from the \nother side over the past decade. You hear it from our friends in the \nmajority whenever the Senate discusses spending or tax policy. I have \nnoticed that the arguments boil down to two points.\n  My friend and colleague, the former chairman and ranking member of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, came up with this \nthumbnail description of this creative historical account:\n  First, all of the so-called good fiscal history of the 1990s was \nderived from the partisan tax increases of 1993. That is their \nargument. And second, all of the supposedly bad fiscal history taking \nplace within the past 10 years is to be blamed on the bipartisan tax \nrelief plans originally enacted during the last administration and \ncontinued under the present administration.\n  You could go one step further and, as a policy premise, refine that \nthumbnail description to two short sentences. First sentence: Lower \ntaxes are bad. Second sentence: Higher taxes are good.\n  Not surprisingly, these revisionist historians support higher taxes \nand higher government spending. Not surprisingly, the revisionists \noppose cutting taxes and cutting government spending.\n  I direct folks to the Senate floor remarks I made on Valentine's Day \nlast year. It is important to reiterate the main point of those \nremarks. Our friends on the other side assert that raising taxes was \nthe key to a growing economy in the 1990s, and raising taxes could work \nthis magic again.\n  A quick look at the data from the 1990s shows this assertion can be \nsummarily dismissed.\n  I have a chart. According to the Clinton administration's Office of \nManagement and Budget or OMB, the impact of the much bragged about tax \nhike bill of 1993 was minimal. The Clinton administration OMB concluded \nthat the 1993 tax increase accounted for only 13 percent--as you can \nsee, the green bar on the circular chart--the 1993 tax increase \naccounted for only 13 percent of deficit reduction between 1990 and \n2000. Thirteen percent puts the 1993 tax increase behind other factors, \nsuch as defense cuts, other revenue, and interest savings. The data \nclearly shows that tax increases did not drive the deficit reduction.\n  As a matter of fact, only 13 percent of the positive fiscal history \nof the 1990s is due to the 1993 tax increase. That is it--13 percent. \nIt is right here on the green part of the chart.\n  Well, what about the last decade? The period of 2001 to 2010 saw a \nlot of deficits. From what you hear from our friends on the other side, \nthose deficits are a direct result of the tax relief that benefited \nvirtually every American taxpayer. Yet CBO data tells us a different \nstory.\n  On May 12, 2011, CBO released a recap of the changes over the last \ndecade. At the start of 2001, as everyone agrees, CBO projected a \nsurplus of $5.6 trillion. Over the decade, deficits of $6.2 trillion \nmaterialized. That is a swing of $11.8 trillion. What did CBO say were \nthe causes?\n  My friends on the other side might be surprised to learn that the \nanswer is not primarily tax relief. Higher spending accounts for 44 \npercent of the change. Higher spending, no question about it.\n  Let me repeat that. Higher spending was the biggest driver of the \ndeficits of the last decade.\n  Economic and technical changes in the estimates accounted for 28 \npercent of the change. So all tax relief, including the tax relief \npassed by Democratic Congresses and tax relief signed into law by \nPresident Obama, accounts for 28 percent. The tax relief legislation, \nmuch maligned by our friends on the other side, accounts for less than \nhalf of the fiscal change attributable to tax relief. Specifically, the \nbipartisan tax relief bills of 2001 and 2003, including the AMT patches \nin those bills, accounted for 13.7 percent of the fiscal change of the \nlast decade.\n  That is not Orrin Hatch speaking, it is the nonpartisan congressional \nscorekeeper, CBO.\n  So how much of the bad fiscal history of the last decade is \nattributable to tax relief? Twenty-eight percent. That is it. That \nincludes the tax cuts in partisan bills such as the stimulus. If you \nisolate the bipartisan bills that are the object of sharp criticism \nfrom our friends on the other side--the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts--you \nwill find that those bills account for only 13.7 percent of the fiscal \nchange in the last decade.\n  Abnormally low levels of spending contributed significantly to the \nsurpluses of the 1990s. Abnormally high spending drove the deficits of \nthe past decade. Abnormally high spending is driving our current \ndeficits, and it will drive our future deficits as well.\n  To my friends on the other side, if we focus instead on hiking taxes \nway above their historic averages, we are misleading and mistreating \nthe problem. The reason for our previous surpluses was low spending, \nand the reason for our current deficits is high spending. We cannot tax \nour way to fiscal health.\n  I now turn to a second issue that demands a response. It has a \ncorollary of the theme underlying the revisionist fiscal history I have \ndiscussed. It is the insatiable appetite for taxes and spending that we \nsee from the President and my friends on the other side.\n  Last week, President Obama once again called for tax increases in \norder to fund his so-called progressive vision of government. I am \nspecifically speaking of the President's latest proclamation that the \ntax relief of 2001 and 2003--tax relief supported by the President and \n40 Senate Democrats in 2010--should not be extended for people earning \n$250,000 or more a year. This was breathlessly reported in some \nquarters of the fourth estate as if it constituted news. In my opinion, \nthe more proper and accurate response would be to borrow from President \nRonald Reagan when he said ``there you go again'' to Jimmy Carter in a \n1980 debate.\n  Perhaps ironically President Reagan was responding to President \nCarter's comments on a national health insurance proposal. President \nReagan was more right than even he knew.\n  Getting back to taxes and the role of government, President Reagan \nwas essentially making the same point this chart shows, which is \nliberal logic. No matter what problems face the left, the answer is \nalways the same solution. Health care is too expensive; raise taxes. \nSpending is out of control; raise taxes. Gas prices are too high; raise \ntaxes. Too many people are unemployed; raise taxes. It is a broken \nrecord.\n  Again, no matter what problem faces the left, the answer is always \nthe same. More taxes are always needed in order to increase the size \nand scope of the government in people's lives.\n  The Supreme Court recently affirmed the point of this chart--the \nliberal solution to rising health care costs and lack of coverage were \ntax increases.\n  The propensity of President Obama and his ideological allies to raise \ntaxes is nothing new, and it is widely acknowledged as well. Back in \nAugust of 2008, David Leonhardt wrote a piece in the New York Times \nthat quoted then-candidate Obama. It is titled ``Obamanomics,'' and \nhere is what he said:\n\n       If you talk to Warren, he'll tell you his preference is not \n     to meddle in the economy at all--let the market work, however \n     way it's going to work, and just tax the heck out of people \n     at the end and just redistribute it. That way you're not \n     impeding efficiency, and you're achieving equity on the back \n     end.\n\n  In order that people may peruse the whole story, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Internet Web address to Mr. Leonhardt's piece be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Aug. 24, 2008]\n\n                              Obamanomics\n\n                          (By David Leonhardt)\n\n       http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/24/magazine/24Obamanomics-\nt.html\n\n  Mr. HATCH. For those of us not invited to the local Dairy Queen for a \nBlizzard with the oracle of Omaha, the Warren cited in this quote is \nnone other than Warren Buffet. He is a friend of mine--you know, the \nsame Buffett from which the Buffett rule or Buffett tax is named.\n  Setting aside the ridiculous notion that Americans are as oblivious \nto taxes as cattle are to the purposes of the slaughterhouse they are \nbeing led into, this quote very accurately illustrates the liberal \nattitude toward taxes, which is that they always need to go up.\n  This chart illustrates government revenue as a percentage of GDP. \nLook\n\n[[Page S5078]]\n\nat that. The purple line is total government. The red line is Federal \nGovernment. The green line is State and local government. When we \ncombine them, we get the purple line, which is well over 25 percent for \nmost of the time, from 1970 up to 2010.\n  There are some fluctuations, but over the last 40 years, revenues \nhave been roughly stable. We can see in the past 10 years a dip around \nthe time the so-called Bush tax relief was enacted, followed by a \nrebound as the tax cuts promoted growth, followed by a dip in revenues \nas the recession set in. We can see that it came down around 2000, went \nup a little more, and then came down again.\n  According to the CBO, as of June 5, 2012, Federal revenues averaged \n17.9 percent of GDP over the past 40 years. The same CBO report--the \n2012 long-term budget outlook--forecasts that under current law, \nFederal revenues will be 18.7 percent of GDP next year in 2013 and will \nbe 23.7 percent of GDP in 2037.\n  Somebody could say that current law is not realistic and some tax \nprovisions that are scheduled to expire will likely be extended. To \naccount for this, CBO has an alternative fiscal scenario which assumes \nthe extension of certain tax policies through 2022.\n  CBO assumes this would lead to the Federal revenues increasing to \n18.5 percent of GDP in 2022, with that level being preserved going \nforward. We definitely know that President Obama doesn't support the \nassumptions that are part of CBO's alternative fiscal scenario because \nearlier this week he called for taxes to increase on hundreds of \nthousands of small businesses--almost 1 million small businesses and \nbusiness owners.\n  The question remains, Why do my friends on the other side think taxes \nalways need to go up? The answer to this question is more complex than \nI am going to discuss right now, but part of the answer is that taxes \nneed to go up in order to increase the size and scope of government in \nthe lives of all Americans.\n  Here is another chart that compares State and Federal Government \nrevenues, which we have just examined, with total government spending. \nWe will notice Federal Government spending is the purple line on the \ntop most of the way through except where it intersects with the red \nline, which is total government revenue. All of a sudden total \ngovernment revenue goes down, but total spending seems to go up between \n2005 and 2010.\n  We can see that over the past 40 years it looks like spending has \nbeen inclined to move up, but only in the past few years does it jump \nto unprecedented heights. Virtually every action taken by the Obama \nadministration and Democratic Senate leadership has amounted to an \nincrease in the size and scope of government.\n  The continuing government takeover of health care is just the single \nmost prominent example right now. On all fronts, President Obama's \nexpansion of government is on the march, trampling whatever gets in its \nway.\n  The chart behind me is a combination of Federal and State spending. \nIf we are just talking about the Federal Government, in the CBO \ndocument I cited earlier, it is projected that debt will eventually \nreach 200 percent of our economy--that means of the GDP--that health \ncare spending will rise to record levels, and that Medicare and Social \nSecurity are on a path to disaster.\n  Getting back to the chart, the combined State and Federal spending \nand revenues--the purple line--what I find particularly striking is the \nlarge gap between the spending and revenue lines. Once again, as CBO \nhas indicated, that gap is likely to increase to more than twice the \nsize of our whole economy. We are already at 103 percent of GDP.\n  If I recall correctly, Spain is a little more than half of that--\naround 70 percent. Yet Spain is considered in real trouble in Europe. \nOnce again, as CBO indicated, that gap is likely to increase to more \nthan twice the size of our whole economy.\n  Finally, here is a chart of Federal and State government spending as \na percentage of GDP. Look at this.\n  I apologize for being repetitive, but if there is one message that \nshould be taken from my remarks today, it is one that I and others have \nbeen making a long time. That message is that the United States doesn't \nhave a tax problem; it has a spending problem.\n  We keep hearing that Republicans are too beholden to an antitax \nideology, and that any resolution of our debt crisis will require that \nRepublicans get with the program and acknowledge the need for increased \ntaxes.\n  As I have shown, this characterization of our fiscal and political \nproblems is not close to half right. By far, the greatest cause of our \nfiscal shortcomings is increased spending.\n  Our increasingly precarious fiscal situation did not arise from a \ndramatic decrease in taxes but, rather, is being caused by a dramatic \nincrease in Federal spending. There is a continual effort underway to \ndeny this reality but reality it remains.\n  I have a chart that summarizes the latest tactic being used to \nconvince people that exploding government spending is not the disaster \nit appears to be, and this is called the rich guy chart. As John \nStossel has pointed out, people like free stuff. The problem with free \nstuff from the government is that nothing is free. To quote John \nStossel, ``It's an Uncle Sam scam.'' Stossel was specifically \ndiscussing the ability of people to exploit a tax credit for electric \nvehicles in order to acquire golf carts, but the principle applies to \nany instance where the government supposedly provides something for \nnothing. This is where the cartoon of the rich guy behind me comes in. \nGoodies from the government are a lot less appealing when there is a \npricetag involved, and many people would like to decide how they are \ngoing to spend their own money. The left's preferred solution to this \nlittle quandary is to have someone else foot the bill.\n  For President Obama, that someone else is, in his words, ``the \nrich,'' which includes all these small businesses that are formed in \nsubchapter S corporations and other passthrough entities, including \npartnerships, LLCs, and so forth--small businesses that are vital to \nour economic recovery.\n  Unfortunately, that approach is just as realistic as the cartoon I am \nusing to illustrate my point. While many of us may not while away our \nleisure time down at the club playing whist with monocled robber \nbarons, a lot of us probably know of small businesses in our \ncommunities that employ us or our neighbors and provide goods and \nservices that consumers want and our economy demands.\n  When liberals are talking about this guy in the top hat with the \nmonocle, they are talking about the hard-working small business owner. \nSo when President Obama talks about increasing taxes on the rich, he is \ntalking about increasing taxes on around 940,000 small business owners \nwho are already in the top two tax brackets. A lot of people who would \nnot pay the Obama tax increase work for someone who would be hit by it. \nWhat we have seen is that President Obama and his allies want to \nincrease the size of government and, in part, they want to fund this \nexpansion with higher taxes on so-called rich people.\n  I want to conclude my remarks with a question. If we are getting more \ngovernment, what are we getting less of? I am going to go back to the \nchart I displayed earlier of government spending as a percentage of \nGDP.\n  This one right here. We can see government spending is going up, but \nwhat is going down as a result? What does the area on the top of that \nchart, which is diminishing, represent? This is a subject that lends \nitself to prolonged discussion, but for one answer we can get back to \nMr. Leonhardt's piece in the New York Times. This is the same piece \nfrom August 24, 2008, and contains a quote from then-candidate Obama \ncritiquing his friend Warren's argument.\n  President Obama said:\n\n       I do think that what the argument may miss is the sense of \n     control that we want individuals to have in determining their \n     own career paths, making their own life choices and so forth. \n     And I also think you want to instill that sense of self-\n     reliance and that what you do will help determine outcomes.\n\n  Let me refer to the Obamanomics II chart. If candidate Obama was in \nthe midst of an internal struggle over the appropriate role of \ngovernment back in 2008, that struggle is over--self-reliance lost and \ntaxing the heck out of people and redistribution won. It runs through \nthe theme of his revisionist fiscal history, and it is the ethic \nunderlying the\n\n[[Page S5079]]\n\ninsatiable appetite my friends on the other side have for taxes and \nspending.\n  This, in and of itself, is not anything new for liberals and \nprogressives. Once again, I will quote my friend Ronald Reagan in my \nresponse to the President's plan to tax the heck out of people in the \nname of redistribution: ``There you go again.''\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, one of the foremost threats to our economy \nis the fiscal cliff. This is an issue my Republican colleagues and I \nhave been talking about for several months now, calling for more \ntransparency in the sequestration that will occur at the end of the \nyear, a replacement of the defense sequester, and actions to prevent a \nmassive tax increase on the American people.\n  Senate Democrats--who have only recently acknowledged the looming \nfiscal cliff--are now threatening to go over the cliff unless \nRepublicans agree to increasing taxes on America's small businesses \nduring this difficult economic period.\n  Think about that. Senate Democrats are willing to put our economy at \nserious risk and our national security in jeopardy unless Republicans \nagree to a massive tax increase on America's small businesses.\n  The headline from a news story in the Washington Post from over the \nweekend says, ``Democrats Threaten To Go Over Fiscal Cliff If GOP Fails \nTo Raise Taxes.'' They quote, ``Senior Democrats say they are prepared \nto weather a fiscal event that could plunge the nation back into \nrecession,'' if the New Year arrives without an acceptable compromise--\nwhich they have defined to be a major tax increase on small businesses \nin this country.\n  Think about the impact of that and what that means to people across \nthis country. We have had now, for the last 3 years, a complete failure \nin the Senate to produce a budget. We are now faced with this fiscal \ncliff which consists of the sequestration, the across-the-board cuts \nthat would occur early next year if nothing is done to prevent them, \nthe tax hikes, and we are going to reach the debt limit, all \nthreatening our economy in an already anemic recovery.\n  It is hard to overstate the magnitude of the tax increases that are \ngoing to hit our economy starting next year if we don't act. Over the \nnext 10 years, this tax increase would result in nearly $4.5 trillion \nin new taxes on American families and entrepreneurs. What does that \nmean to the average family in this country? The Heritage Foundation \nrecently published a study that estimated the tax increase per tax \nreturn in every State. For example, for my State of South Dakota the \nHeritage Foundation estimates that the average tax increase per tax \nreturn would be $3,187 in the year 2013.\n  I would say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, many of \nwhom I think generally believe in Keynesian economics, that the average \nfamily in South Dakota could do more to stimulate our economy and \ncreate new employment by keeping their $3,187 and spending it as they \nsee fit, not as Washington sees fit to spend it on their behalf.\n  Taxmageddon is a very apt description that has been applied to this \nfiscal cliff when you consider the impact of these tax increases not \njust on individual families but on our entire economy. Until recently \nwe could just speculate about the impact of these tax increases on our \nfragile economy, but the magnitude of the damage was in dispute. Not \nanymore. Last month, the Congressional Budget Office gave us the most \ndefinitive estimate yet of the impact of the nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion of \ntax increases that would hit in 2013 when combined with the more than \n$100 billion of spending cuts that would occur under the sequester I \nmentioned earlier.\n  The Congressional Budget Office projects the combination of the \nmassive tax increases and the sequester will result in real GDP growth \nin calendar year 2013 of only one-half of 1 percent. Think about that, \none-half of 1 percent. We are right now growing somewhere--they think--\nin the range of 1.9 percent or 2 percent this year. But next year, the \nreal GDP growth would amount to only \\1/2\\ percent. And the picture is \neven bleaker if you consider that CBO projects that the economy will \nactually have a decrease in GDP of 1.3 percent in the first half of \n2013.\n  So you have the Congressional Budget Office saying that over the \nentire year of 2013, the likelihood is we will grow at one-half a \npercentage point if we don't address the fiscal cliff. But in the first \nhalf of next year, we actually see a decrease of 1.3 percent of \neconomic growth. According to CBO, a reduction of 1.3 percent of \neconomic growth in the first half of next year would ``probably be \njudged to be a recession.'' That is according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, which is the nonpartisan authoritative referee we use to \nevaluate the impact of the spending and debt tax issues.\n  This morning, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, \nBen Bernanke, testified before the Senate Banking Committee, and he \nsaid:\n\n       Fiscal decisions should take into account the fragility of \n     the recovery. That recovery could be endangered by the \n     confluence of tax increases and spending reductions that will \n     take effect early next year if no legislative action is \n     taken. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that if \n     the full range of tax increases and spending cuts were \n     allowed to take effect--a scenario widely referred to as the \n     fiscal cliff--a shallow recession would occur early next \n     year. . . .\n\n  That is according to the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of \nGovernors Ben Bernanke in his testimony as recently as this morning. He \ntalked about a shallow recession occurring next year and the \nendangerment of the recovery that is under way if we have this \nconfluence of events happen at the end of the year.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       These estimates do not incorporate the additional negative \n     effects likely to result from public uncertainty about how \n     these matters will be resolved.\n\n  In other words, the economic uncertainty that is associated with all \nthese things happening at the end of the year are impacting the economy \ntoday as people are looking at how they are going to make investment \ndecisions, and that our economy is likely to experience negative \neffects from that public uncertainty above and beyond the direct \nimpacts that CBO has incorporated into its analysis.\n  So let's be very clear about what the fiscal cliff means. We are not \ntalking about a slight slowdown of a few tenths of a percent. What we \nare facing is the difference between positive growth on the one hand--\nwhich will mean more jobs and higher incomes--and a potential recession \non the other hand. We can, and must, provide Americans some certainty \nas to what their taxes are going to be next year.\n  The House of Representatives has already agreed to hold a vote to \nextend all of the existing tax rates before the August recess in order \nto avert the fiscal cliff. They are going to act on this sometime \nbefore we go out in August to extend all of the rates before the end of \nthe year so there is certainty for those who are making economic \ndecisions.\n  Unfortunately, thus far the Senate and the Senate Democratic \nleadership has only agreed to hold a vote on a plan to raise taxes on \nnearly 1 million small businesses. This tax increase on individuals \nearning more than $200,000 a year and families making more than \n$250,000 a year will raise taxes on more than half of all income in \nAmerica earned by S corporations, sole proprietorships, LLCs, \npartnerships, and other passthrough businesses that pay their taxes at \nthe individual rates.\n  A point of clarification: That applies to a lot of mom-and-pop \nbusinesses in this country. We are talking about that restaurant owner, \nthat electrician, many of whom are organized in the fashion in which \ntheir income flows through their individual tax return and they pay at \nthe individual tax rate. The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated \nthat the number of businesses that would be impacted by that is \n940,000. So almost 1 million small businesses would see their taxes go \nup as a result of the fiscal cliff and tax rates expiring at the end of \nthe year for those individuals who are making more\n\n[[Page S5080]]\n\nthan $200,000 and families making more than $250,000 a year.\n  According to the National Federation of Independent Business, the \nsmall businesses most likely to be hit by the Democratic tax increase \nemploy 25 percent of the total workforce. So we are talking not just \nabout the small businesses that are going to be faced with higher \ntaxes, but we are also talking about a huge portion of the American \nworkforce in this country. Twenty-five percent of the employees in this \ncountry work for those small businesses that, according to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, will see their taxes go up as a result of the \nPresident's proposal.\n  We essentially have in front of us three choices:\n  We can let all the tax rates expire, which we know is going to plunge \nour economy back into a recession; we can do what our Democratic \ncolleagues want to do, which is to raise taxes on successful small \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs, slowing our economy even further and \nrisking--according to the Congressional Budget Office and the Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve Board--a recession; or, we could do what the \nHouse of Representatives will soon pass and what I would suggest, and \nthat is we can prevent a tax increase from hitting anyone and give the \nlackluster economic recovery at least a chance to gain some steam.\n  That is what we ought to do. We ought to do what the House of \nRepresentatives is going to do, and that is to extend the rates for a \nyear so that people in this country have some certainty as to what \ntheir tax rate is going to be at the end of the year.\n  I hope my colleagues here in the Senate--and the Senate Democrats in \nparticular--will realize the severity of the fiscal cliff, and come to \nthe table to prevent this massive tax increase and the unbalanced and \ntroubling cuts that will occur to our national security if we don't \ntake steps to avert this fiscal cliff.\n  We have to prevent the dangerous cuts to our national defense that \nare scheduled to go into effect under sequestration by finding savings \nelsewhere in the budget. In order to do that, we need a detailed plan \nfrom the administration as to how they plan to implement the sequester.\n  Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have called for more \ntransparency on the sequester from this administration, but they have \nso far failed to produce a plan. That is simply unacceptable. I will \ncontinue to work to see that a requirement be enacted so the \nadministration will finally be transparent with the American people and \ngive all Members of Congress a clear idea as to where the cuts are \ngoing to be applied.\n  Our economy is weak. We know that growth in the first quarter was a \nmere 1.9 percent. Expectations for the second quarter have been \ndowngraded. We have witnessed now for 41 straight months unemployment \nabove 8 percent. We have 23 million Americans who are either unemployed \nor underemployed and 5.4 million Americans who have been unemployed for \na long period of time.\n  We have a weak economy. The amazing thing about this debate is that 2 \nyears ago the President of the United States said that raising taxes \nwould strike a blow to the economy. That was at a time when we had 3.1 \npercent economic growth. We now have, as I said, according to the \nestimates, 1.9 percent economic growth for the first quarter of this \nyear, and expectations for the second quarter have already been \ndowngraded. So with 41 straight months of unemployment above 8 percent, \n23 million Americans underemployed or unemployed, and the weakest \nrecovery literally since the end of World War II, now is not the time \nto raise taxes.\n  Who in their right mind would think it would make any sense at all to \nraise taxes when you have an economy that is growing at such an anemic \nrate, particularly given the fact that 2 years ago, when we had more \nrobust economic growth, the President said at that time that it would \nstrike a blow to our economy if we raised taxes. Here we are with \neconomic conditions that are much worse, circumstances that have \ndeteriorated since then, and he is proposing a tax increase on 1 \nmillion small businesses that will have a ripple effect all across our \neconomy and hurt job creation at a time we cannot afford that.\n  There was another study, an analysis that came out today done by \nErnst & Young in which they analyzed the tax hikes that would occur on \nsmall business next year and came to the conclusion that it would cost \n700,000 jobs in our economy, that it would cost us 1.3 percent of \neconomic growth--which is again consistent with what the Congressional \nBudget Office has said--and that it would reduce wages to people in \nthis country by 2 percent.\n  So you now have the Ernst & Young study out there which suggests that \nnot only does this impact the small businesses out there that are going \nto see their taxes go up, but it puts at risk and in jeopardy jobs for \nhard-working Americans and a wage base that would actually shrink if, \nin fact, we drive the car over this fiscal cliff.\n  We cannot afford to do that. It is irresponsible to have people out \nthere saying that they are so anxious to prove some point or to win \nsome argument on raising taxes that they are willing to see this \ncountry run the risk of plunging into a recession and raising the \nnumber of people who are unemployed in this country. It really is.\n  I have to say that when I saw some of the remarks and some of these \nstories and some of the reporting about statements that are being made \nby our colleagues on the other side and Members of their staff with \nregard to the fiscal cliff and the willingness on the part of many of \nour colleagues to suggest that this country could go through and endure \neven more difficult economic times than what we are already \nexperiencing, even higher unemployment than what we are already seeing, \nit was really pretty remarkable and truly unfortunate.\n  I hope folks will walk back from that position, walk back from those \nremarks, and enter into a discussion about how we might be able to \nprovide the necessary economic certainty for our job creators and our \nsmall businesses, how we can get people back to work, how we can grow \nand expand this economy.\n  Frankly, extending the tax rate should only be the first part, the \nshort-term solution. The long-term solution is to get tax reform, \ncomprehensive tax reform. People on both sides of the aisle agree with \nthat. If we could enter into a discussion about how we could reform our \nTax Code in such a way that it broadens the tax base, lowers the rates, \ndoes away with loopholes and deductions, coupled with entitlement \nreform--that we all agree has to be dealt with or we are going to \ncontinue to see the country on a fiscal trajectory that is completely \nunsustainable over time, is going to lead to the situation we see many \nEuropean countries dealing with today--that is what we ought to be \nfocused on.\n  We ought to be providing certainty to our businesses, extending rates \nat least for now until such time hopefully next year when we all agree \nwe need to sit down and solve this tax mess we have in this country, \nthis Tax Code that has become way too complicated, and come up with \nsomething that is more simple, more clear, more fair, and something \nthat makes us more competitive in the global marketplace. Right now, we \nare losing to a lot of countries around the world simply because we \nhave a tax code that makes American businesses noncompetitive in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  Tax reform, entitlement reform, a comprehensive energy policy, \nregulatory reform--it is not that hard to fix this if we have the will, \nthe political will to do it. But we cannot start by saying to small \nbusinesses in this country that we are going to raise your taxes next \nyear, run the risk of plunging the country into a recession and \nincreasing the number of people in this country who are unemployed.\n  That is the exact wrong prescription. We ought to be providing \ncertainty, extending the rates, and getting into a discussion and \nhopefully action on legislation that would reform the American Tax Code \nto make us more competitive in the world, do away with the costly, \noverreaching, excessive, and burdensome regulations that are making it \nmore difficult and more expensive to do business in this country; an \nenergy plan that makes sense, that relies upon American sources of \nenergy; and a spending plan, a budget--something the Senate has not \ndone now for 3 years, an actual budget. Lo and behold, go figure that \nwe could actually\n\n[[Page S5081]]\n\ndo a budget in this country that puts us on a more sustainable fiscal \npath by reforming entitlement programs, that will actually save Social \nSecurity and Medicare for future generations of Americans. That is the \nlong-term prescription for what ails America. But certainly in the \nshort term it makes matters much, much worse when we talk about piling \na tax increase on the very people we are looking to, to create jobs and \nget this economy back on track.\n  I hope this Congress will come to its senses about this and that we \nwill vote down any proposal that would raise taxes on hard-working \nsmall businesses and entrepreneurs in this country and instead give \nthem the certainty they need for the months ahead, until such time as \nwe can deal with the issue of tax reform.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The DREAM Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 11 years ago I introduced the DREAM Act to \nallow a select group of immigrant students with great potential to \ncontribute more fully to America. The DREAM Act said that in order to \nqualify, they had to earn their way to a legal status and they had to \nhave come to the United States as children, be long-term U.S. \nresidents, have good moral character, graduate from high school, and \nagree to serve in our military or at least complete 2 years of college.\n  These young people literally came to the United States as infants and \nchildren. They grew up in this country. They went to school with our \nkids. They are the valedictorians, the athletes, and even the ROTC \nleaders in schools across America. They did not make the decision to \ncome here; they were just kids. Their parents made the decision. As \nHomeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said, immigrants who were \nbrought here illegally as children ``lacked the intent to violate the \nlaw.'' It is not the American way anyway to punish children for the \nwrongdoing of their parents.\n  I am going to continue to work on this DREAM Act. It has been 11 \nyears. I will work on it as long as I have to to get it done; it is \nthat important. But the young people who are eligible, who would be \neligible for it, cannot wait any longer. Many have already been \ndeported to countries they never remembered and with languages they do \nnot speak. There are still some at the risk of deportation.\n  That is why the Obama administration decision a few weeks ago to stop \nthe deportation of young people who would be eligible for the DREAM Act \nwas the right thing to do. The administration says we will allow these \nimmigrant students to apply for a form of relief known as deferred \naction that puts their deportations on hold and allows them, on a \ntemporary renewable basis to live and work legally in America. I \nstrongly, strongly support this decision. I think it was a humane \ndecision by the President of the United States on behalf of these young \npeople.\n  When the history of the civil rights era we have lived through since \nthe 1960s is written, this will be an important chapter. The \nadministration's deportation policy has strong bipartisan support. It \nwas 2 years ago that Republican Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana joined \nme in a letter to the President asking me to do this. Last year, \nSenator Lugar joined me, along with 22 other Senators, to sign a letter \nto the President asking the same thing, and what do the American people \nthink about President Obama's decision on the DREAM Act students? It \nturns out that 64 percent of likely voters--including 66 percent of \nIndependents--support the policy, compared to 30 percent who oppose it.\n  Earlier, my colleague and friend from Iowa Senator Grassley gave a \nspeech on the Senate floor about this decision by the President. At one \npoint in time, Senator Grassley was a cosponsor of the DREAM Act. We \nwouldn't know it from his speech today. He has changed his position on \nthis bill just like so many other Republicans. Let me take a few \nminutes to respond to his specific points.\n  He claimed the President's policy to not deport the DREAM Act \nstudents is going to hurt the American economy. I couldn't disagree \nmore. Granting deferred action of DREAM Act students will make us a \nstronger country giving these talented immigrants a chance to be part \nof America and its future.\n  Studies have found DREAM Act students can contribute literally \ntrillions of dollars to the U.S. economy given a chance to be a part of \nit. We are not talking about importing new foreign workers into the \nUnited States to compete with Americans, we are talking about taking \nyoung people who are educated in our schools at our expense, trained \nand ready to give something to America and giving them a chance. They \nare going to be tomorrow's doctors, engineers, teachers, and nurses. We \nshouldn't squander their talents and all the years we invested in \neducating them by deporting them at this important point in their \nlives.\n  Senator Grassley said President Obama ``circumvented Congress to \nsignificantly change the law all by himself.'' With all due respect, I \ndon't think that is how it happened. The Obama administration's new \ndeportation policy is lawful and appropriate. Throughout history, all \ngovernments--and our Federal Government--have had to decide whom to \nprosecute and not to prosecute. It is called prosecutorial discretion. \nIt is based on law enforcement priorities and resources. Every \nadministration, Democratic and Republican, has stopped deportations of \nlow-priority cases, as they should.\n  Just last month, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that the Federal \nGovernment has broad authority to decide whom to deport. Justice \nAnthony Kennedy, appointed by George H.W. Bush, wrote the opinion for \nthe Court. This is what he said:\n\n       A principal feature of the removal system is the broad \n     discretion exercised by immigration officials . . . \n     Discretion in the enforcement of immigration law embraces \n     immediate human concerns. Unauthorized workers trying to \n     support their families, for example, likely pose less danger \n     than alien smugglers or aliens who commit a serious crime.\n\n  The administration's policy is not just legal, it is realistic and \nsmart. Today there are millions of undocumented immigrants in the \nUnited States. It is physically and literally impossible to deport \nthem. So the Department of Homeland Security has to decide priorities. \nShouldn't the highest priority be to deport those who are most \ndangerous to the United States? I think even the Senator from Iowa \nwould have to concede that point. The Obama administration has made \nthat its priority.\n  Senator Grassley calls the administration's deportation policy an \namnesty. That is not right. The DREAM Act students will not receive \npermanent legal status or citizenship under the President's policy. \nThey have temporary renewable legal status. It is temporary renewable \nlegal status.\n  During his speech, Senator Grassley read a quote from an interview \nthe President gave last year to support his claim that the President \nhad changed his position on the DREAM Act, but he only read part of the \nquote. Here is what Senator Grassley read:\n\n       This notion that somehow I can just change the law \n     unilaterally is just not true . . . the fact of the matter is \n     there are laws on the books that I have to enforce. And I \n     think there's been a great disservice done to the cause of \n     getting the DREAM Act passed and getting comprehensive \n     immigration passed by perpetuating the notion that somehow, \n     by myself, I can go and do these things. It's just not true.\n\n  That is what Senator Grassley read. Here is the rest of the quote.\n\n       What we can do is prioritize enforcement--since there are \n     limited enforcement resources--and say, we're not going to go \n     chasing after this young man or anybody else who has been \n     acting responsibly, and would otherwise qualify for legal \n     status if the DREAM Act passed.\n\n  That is what the President said. I wish Senator Grassley had read \nthat in the Record. The President has done what he has the authority to \ndo as our Chief Executive Officer to exercise prosecutorial discretion.\n\n[[Page S5082]]\n\n  I personally discussed this with Secretary Napolitano. She has \nassured me that the Department of Homeland Security is going to follow \nthe President's lead but is going to have strict enforcement of fraud. \nIf any young person commits fraud in this process, there will be a \nprice to be paid. Senator Grassley should know that, and he shouldn't \nquestion it absent evidence to the contrary.\n  I might say it is sad we have reached this point that so few \nRepublicans would stand for these young people. There was a time when \nSenator Hatch was the lead sponsor in this bill, and I was begging him \nto cosponsor it. Then it reached a point where he only voted for it, \nand then it reached a point where he voted against it.\n  Senator Grassley has voted for this bill in the past too. In 2006, \nwhen the Republicans lost control of Congress, the DREAM Act passed the \nSenate out of an amendment to the comprehensive immigration bill 62 to \n36. There were 23 Republicans who voted for it. Unfortunately, the \nRepublican leaders in the House refused to take up that bill in 2006. \nRepublican support for the DREAM Act has diminished over the years. I \nhave to say I noted the lack of volume and firepower in criticizing the \nPresident on this DREAM Act decision. I think many of our Republican \ncolleagues realized the American people do support this two to one, and \nit is the right thing to do.\n  I am going to do what I have done on 48 other occasions and try to \nmake this DREAM Act discussion more than an abstract conversation. I \nwish to make sure people understand who is involved in these decision \nprocesses.\n  This is a photograph of Maria Gomez. Her parents brought her from \nMexico to Los Angeles when she was 8 years old. She started school in \nthe third grade with English as a second language. By the time she was \nin sixth grade, 3 years later, she was an honor student.\n  In middle school, Maria discovered art and architecture. She began \nher dream of becoming an architect. In high school, Maria was active in \ncommunity service and extracurricular activities, captain of the school \nspirit squad, president of the garden club, and a member of the \nCalifornia Scholarship Federation. She graduated 10th in her class with \na 3.9-grade point average.\n  Maria was accepted by every college she applied to. Her dream was to \nattend UC Berkeley, the only State college in California that offers \narchitecture to undergraduate students, but she couldn't afford it. \nMaria, and the other DREAM Act students, are not eligible for any \nFederal assistance to go to school. Instead, she decided to live at \nhome and to attend UCLA. She was a commuter student. She rode the bus \nto and from UCLA, 2\\1/2\\ hours each way each day.\n  While she was a full-time student, she worked to clean houses and did \nbabysitting to help pay for tuition. She graduated from UCLA with a \nmajor in sociology and a minor in public policy. She was the first \nmember of her family to graduate from college. She was determined to \nachieve her dream of becoming an architect. She enrolled in the Master \nof Architecture Program at UCLA. She was the only Latino student in the \nprogram. She struggled financially. At the time, she had to eat at the \nUCLA food bank. Because she couldn't afford housing near the campus, \nshe spent many nights in a sleeping bag on the floor of the school's \nprinting room.\n  Last year, Maria received her master's degree in architecture and \nurban design. She said:\n\n       I grew up believing in the American dream and I worked hard \n     to earn my place in the country that nurtured and educated \n     me. . . . Like the thousands of other undocumented students \n     and graduates across America, I am looking for one thing, and \n     one thing only: the opportunity to give back to my community, \n     my state, and the country that is my home, the United States.\n\n  I ask my colleagues who are critical of the DREAM Act and President \nObama's new policy: Would you prefer that we deport Maria Gomez back to \nMexico at this point in her life, a country that she has not lived in \nsince she was a small child? She grew up here. She has overcome amazing \nodds to become successful. This determined young woman can make America \na better nation.\n  Thanks to President Obama's new policy, Maria is going to be able to \nwork. I hope she will be able to get a license as an architect in her \nState. A future President could change this policy so Maria's future is \nstill in doubt because we haven't enacted the DREAM Act. Maria is not \nthe only one. There are tens of thousands similar to her.\n  The DREAM Act would give Maria, and others similar to her, the \nopportunity to be our future architects, engineers, teachers, doctors, \nand soldiers.\n  Today, I again ask my colleagues to support the DREAM Act. The \nPresident's new deportation policy is a step in the right direction, \nbut ultimately it is our responsibility. He has done his part. We need \nto pass this humane and thoughtful bill and give people such as Maria \nGomez a chance to make America a better place to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/17/senate-section/article/S5082-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I am pleased to honor the 125th \nAnniversary of Thompson-Markward Hall, which was formerly known as the \nYoung Women's Christian Home. Many young women working as interns or \nbeginning staffers, including many from my office throughout the years, \nhave found a safe place to live and meet friends as they establish \ntheir professional careers. The Thompson-Markward Hall, located across \nfrom the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill, provides a \nvaluable service to young women working in Washington and our \nCongressional community. Its remarkable story is one very much worth \nsharing.\n  In 1833, Mrs. Mary G. Wilkinson recognized the need in the District \nof Columbia for suitable lodging for young ladies of good character and \nmeager means. She vowed that there should someday be a home for young \nwomen coming alone to Washington seeking employment, where they could \nbe protected and cared for until they became established in the \ncommunity. She began what developed into the Young Woman's Christian \nHome by housing two such young women in her home.\n  In 1887, the Young Woman's Christian Home was chartered by Congress \nand incorporated ``to provide a temporary home for young women coming \nto and being in the District of Columbia, who shall, from any cause, be \nin want of and willing to accept temporary home, care and assistance . \n. .'' By 1890, the Home was receiving an annual appropriation of $1,000 \nfrom Congress.\n  Over the years, the Young Woman's Christian Home underwent \nrenovations and changed locations. In 1931, Mrs. Flora Markward \nThompson, a devoted Life Member of the Board of Trustees, passed away, \nleaving instructions for the executors of her estate to establish a \nsuitable memorial to her mother and her husband. The executors decided \nthat the most suitable memorial could be entrusted to the Young Woman's \nChristian Home. The Home then became known as Thompson-Markward Hall \nnow most commonly known as TMH--to perpetually remember Mrs. Thompson's \ngenerous gift.\n  Despite the many changes throughout the years, the original spirit \nand mission of the founders and early benefactors remain. Today, TMH \ncontinues to be a ``home away from home'' for 120 young women in \nWashington for work or school.\n  As TMH celebrates the 125th anniversary of its Congressional charter, \nits roots are strong and the devotion to its founder's mission remains \nfirm and constant. I ask the United States Senate to join me in \ncongratulating Thompson-Markward Hall on this important \nmilestone.\n\n[[Page S5083]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/17/senate-section/article/S5083-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n             CONGRATULATING MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I can finally congratulate \neveryone at Massachusetts General Hospital, MGH, on a special and well-\ndeserved distinction long in the making: MGH has been named America's \nBest Hospital by U.S. News & World Report.\n  I say ``finally'' because I have been patiently keeping my promise \nnot to publicly share the news now these last 6 days since Dr. Slavin \ncalled me to pass along the great news in advance. Now he has \nconfirmation that in a Washington, DC, full of leaks, there is at least \none U.S. Senator who still knows how to keep a secret.\n  Today's public announcement confirms what all of us in Massachusetts \nhave always known--that if you need to find first-rate care for a loved \none with a serious and complicated condition, then you go to the \nMassachusetts General Hospital. It comes as no surprise to us that this \nrevered Massachusetts institution would hold the honor of best hospital \nin the Nation.\n  Today's announcement is one two centuries in the making. It started \nwith the dream of Rev. John Bartlett, who in 1810 wanted to establish a \nstate-of-the-art medical facility for the physically and mentally ill \nwhich would train the Nation's finest doctors. That dream was carried \nby Drs. James Jackson and John Collins Warren, who advocated in the \nMassachusetts Legislature for a charter and collected donations as \nsmall as 25 cents and as large as $20,000 to make the dream a reality. \nFinally, in 1821, the institution currently known as Mass General \nopened its doors to patients and became the first teaching hospital of \nHarvard Medical School.\n  Since then, MGH has been providing cutting-edge care to patients from \nall over the world. It was the home to many firsts: the first public \ndemonstration of surgical anesthesia, the identification of \nappendicitis, the establishment of the first medical social service, \nand the first replantation of a severed arm by a surgical team.\n  But more than firsts, Mass General has provided a place of hope for \nall those who needed help. It is the employees of MGH who have made \nthis possible from generation to generation. I have seen on my visits \nto the hospital that it is the people--the nurses, doctors, orderlies, \nadministrators, security guards, and medical students--who make MGH the \nNation's best.\n  I know firsthand of MGH's exceptional work particularly well from two \npeople whose insights mean the world to me: my wife Teresa, who has \nbeen a patient at MGH as she was treated for breast cancer, and through \nmy daughter Vanessa, who has made MGH her home as a doctor. Both have \nshared story after story not just about first-rate care but about \ndeeply caring doctors and nurses and skilled professionals who always \nput patients first. That is the heart of MGH, and it is no secret that \nwithout team members who are constantly looking for the next \nbreakthrough in medicine and a better way to care for patients, \ntomorrow's innovations would not be possible.\n  It is even more of a testament to the power of MGH's work that they \nhave become the Nation's best hospital in a State with near universal \nhealth coverage. We now have the best health care coverage rate in the \nNation with 98.1 percent of residents having health insurance, \nincluding 99.8 percent of all children.\n  We must continue to raise the bar as we implement the Affordable Care \nAct and provide this guarantee of coverage nationwide. MGH should serve \nas a model to all hospitals across the country that you can provide \nuniversal coverage while still providing the highest quality care to \nyour patients. I know MGH will remain at the top of this list for years \nto come because they have proven that covering more patients and \nproviding quality outcomes are not mutually exclusive goals.\n  There is much celebrating to be done in Boston, but there is still \nmuch more work to be done to improve the health of all Americans. I am \nconvinced that MGH and our other great institutions in Massachusetts \nwill continue to meet the challenge by setting the standard for \ndelivering the highest quality health care. I congratulate Dr. Peter \nSlavin, Dr. David Torchiana, and everyone who works at MGH for their \nefforts in making this hospital the best in the Nation and, I believe, \nthe best in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/17/senate-section/article/S5083-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5083-S5084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            REMEMBERING THE LIVES OF HAN BROTHER AND SISTER\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I \ncome before you today to share the news of a profound tragedy and loss \nof two Alaska Native siblings. Isaac Juneby, a military veteran and \nformer Chief of Eagle, a Han Gwich'in Village in Alaska close to the \nCanadian border, and his sister Ellen Juneby Rada, who died as a result \nof domestic violence, were both laid to rest and their lives honored \nand celebrated with a potlatch in Eagle Village, July 11, 2012.\n  Ellen Florence Juneby Rada, 58 years old, was the mother of two grown \nsons. She was found beaten, seriously injured and unconscious in a \nhomeless camp in Fairbanks and was transported to the Alaska Native \nMedical Center for treatment. Ellen was taken off life support on July \n2 and passed away on Sunday, July 8.\n  Isaac Juneby was born on July 9, 1941, in Eagle Village. He had \ntraveled to Anchorage from Eagle to hold vigil at the bedside of his \ncomatose sister and died in an automobile accident on July 1, 2012. \nFollowing Isaac's sudden accidental death another Juneby sibling, \nAdeline Juneby Potts, flew to Anchorage from Minnesota to join her \nfamily and due to emotional stress suffered a heart attack and was \nhospitalized. Fortunately, Adeline is recovering rapidly.\n  There are no words to describe the grief this family has suffered due \nto the heartbreaking events that unfolded over such a short period of \ntime. The loss is felt not just by the Juneby family, but by the entire \nAlaska Native community. Our State may be small in population, but it \nis large in community spirit. I think I can safely say the entire State \nof Alaska is touched by this tragedy.\n  I would like to say a few words about Isaac Juneby, whose loss will \nhave a lasting impact not only to the village of Eagle, but across the \nentire Native community. Isaac was one of the few remaining speakers of \nHan, an endangered northern Athabascan language with only about a \nhandful of remaining speakers left in Alaska and the Yukon, a territory \nof Canada. He was a man that everyone seemed to know and love. Isaac \nhad an almost tangible joy about him that drew people in and endeared \nhim to many. His nickname ``the Senator'' was well earned. Isaac was \nalways quick with a joke and had an infectious smile that made everyone \naround him happy. But most of all he loved life and his people.\n  Isaac was incredibly proud of his family and his heritage. He \nexemplified a man who could easily navigate both worlds: the \ntraditional and the modern. He had an easygoing and friendly manner \nthat won him many lifelong friends, but he also had a disciplined and \nserious side. Isaac was an accomplished man who earned a bachelor's \ndegree in rural development from the University of Alaska in 1987. He \nwrote poetry, published books and recorded language lessons in Han \nGwich'in Athabascan to preserve the dialect for future generations. \nIsaac and Sandi, his best friend and wife of 35 years, were planning to \nmove to Fairbanks so Isaac could complete a master's degree in \nethnology. He wanted to learn more about the Han.\n  Over the years Isaac held a number of important positions for Native \norganizations, the State, and the Federal Government and remained a \nresident of Eagle Village even through the very challenging times, like \nduring the disaster of 2008, when a major flood devastated the \ncommunity. Isaac was also instrumental in completing the essential \npaperwork that helped Eagle Village become the first IRA village in \nAlaska, one with a federally recognized tribal government.\n  People will remember Isaac not only for his good humor but for his \ngreat strength and determination. Isaac was proud to celebrate over 25 \nyears of sobriety and was known to say that it was God who freed him \nfrom alcohol. The Rev. Scott Fisher, pastor at St. Matthew's Episcopal \nChurch got it right when he said ``Isaac was the last of the good guys. \nThere was a strength and a gentleness running through him. He knew what \nwas right and what was wrong. He was not a cardboard saint.\n\n[[Page S5084]]\n\nHe was real. He had a rock solid core of wisdom in him.''\n  Isaac's humor and his positive outlook on life served as an \ninspiration to so many who had the honor and privilege to know him. \nWith the passing of Isaac Juneby, Alaska has lost a beloved Native \nelder and chief, a father, a culture bearer, a brother, an honored Army \nveteran, a husband, an inspirational man, an uncle, and a good friend. \nOn this day I ask that we honor the lives of an extraordinary family \nand remember them during this time of such profound loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/17/senate-section/article/S5084-1", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMISSIONING OF THE USS ``MISSISSIPPI''\n\n Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, on Saturday, June 2, 2012, I was \npresent at the commissioning of the USS Mississippi in Pascagoula, MS. \nThe USS Mississippi is a Virginia class submarine, part of the ``next \ngeneration'' of attack subs. The submarine was constructed by General \nDynamics Electric Boat in Groton, CT, as well as Newport News \nShipbuilding, a division of Huntington Ingalls in Newport News, VA\n  This is a mighty submarine that bears a mighty proud name. The \ncitizens of the state of Mississippi enthusiastically embrace the fifth \nNavy vessel in our Republic's history that bears the name USS \nMississippi. The naming of the submarine as USS Mississippi recognizes \nour State's long-standing tradition of shipbuilding in support of our \nNation's defense. It also honors the spirit of the people of \nMississippi who have made great strides in recovering from the \ndevastation of Hurricane Katrina.\n  It is appropriate that this ship was completed a full year ahead of \nschedule. Mississippians have always been early to step forward in the \nservice of their country. It is a fact that volunteers from our State \nhave always been known to step forward quickly and eagerly to serve \ntheir country. So for many the words USS Mississippi will stand for \npatriotism and readiness.\n  For those who remember Katrina and Deep Water Horizon, the words USS \nMississippi may mean ``resilience'' or ``quiet resolve.'' Within the \nranks of the U.S. Navy, USS Mississippi will be associated with the \nwords ``state-of-the-art,'' the best in the world. For them, that is \nwhat USS Mississippi will mean. And for the Ship's Sponsor Allison \nStiller, she will think of the word ``tenacity.'' And no doubt our \nadversaries, wherever they may be, will hear the words USS Mississippi \nand think ``strength'' and perhaps they will think the word \n``freedom.''\n  Within the borders of this traditional ``Bible Belt'' state, we will \nthink about our Founding Father's reliance on Almighty God. I can \nassure CPT John McGrath, his Commissioning Crew, and those who will \nserve on this submarine that you will be prayed for each and every day. \nThese prayers may be a quiet whispered prayer at night or early in the \nmorning or they may be the majestic words of William Whiting, who wrote \nthis hymn:\n\n     Eternal Father, strong to save,\n     Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,\n     Who bidd'st the mighty ocean deep\n     Its own appointed limits keep;\n     Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee,\n     For those in peril on the sea\n     Most Holy Spirit! Who didst brood\n     Upon the chaos dark and rude,\n     And bid its angry tumult cease,\n     And give, for wild confusion, peace;\n     Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee,\n     For those in peril on the sea!\n\n  With apologies to the author and perhaps to those who know this hymn \nwell, I have attempted to pen an extra verse:\n\n     From Pascagoula's shores we send\n     The finest sailors known to men,\n     Proud Mississippi's name they bear;\n     Lord, bless and keep them free from care,\n     Protect them when they call to Thee,\n     Our sons and daughters now at sea.\n\n  Congratulations to Captain McGrath and his Commissioning Crew, God \nbless the United States, and God bless those who will serve on the USS \nMississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/17/senate-section/article/S5084-2", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/17/senate-section/article/S5084-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/17/senate-section/article/S5084-4", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \n   RESPECT TO THE FORMER LIBERIAN REGIME OF CHARLES TAYLOR THAT WAS \n      ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13348 ON JULY 22, 2004--PM 56\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent the enclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication \nstating that the national emergency and related measures dealing with \nthe former Liberian regime of Charles Taylor are to continue in effect \nbeyond July 22, 2012.\n  Although Liberia has made advances to promote democracy, and the \nSpecial Court for Sierra Leone recently convicted Charles Taylor for \nwar crimes and crimes against humanity, the actions and policies of \nformer Liberian President Charles Taylor and other persons, in \nparticular their unlawful depletion of Liberian resources and their \nremoval from Liberia and secreting of Liberian funds and property, \ncould still challenge Liberia's efforts to strengthen its democracy and \nthe orderly development of its political, administrative, and economic \ninstitutions and resources. These actions and policies continue to pose \nan unusual and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United \nStates. For this reason, I have determined that it is necessary to \ncontinue the national emergency with respect to the former Liberian \nregime of Charles Taylor.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, July 17, 2012.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/17/senate-section/article/S5084-5", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 3393.

A bill to modify chapter 90 of title 18, United States Code, \nto provide Federal jurisdiction for theft of trade secrets; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Protecting \nAmerican Trade Secrets and Innovation Act of 2012. This legislation \nwill help American companies protect their valuable trade secrets by \ngiving them the additional option of seeking redress in Federal courts \nwhen they are victims of economic espionage or trade secret theft. \nStolen trade secrets cost American companies billions of dollars each \nyear and threaten their ability to innovate and compete globally. Our \nbill ensures that companies have the most effective and efficient ways \nto combat trade secret theft and recoup their losses, helping them to \nmaintain their global competitive edge.\n  Today, as much as 80 percent of companies' assets are intangible, the \nmajority of them in the form of trade secrets. This includes everything \nfrom financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or \nengineering information, to formulas, designs, prototypes, processes, \nprocedures, and codes. Trade secrets are often the lifeblood of a \nbusiness. If they are stolen and wind up in the hands of competitors, \nit can wipe out years of research and development and cost millions of \ndollars in losses. The chief executive of GM recently said that he \nworries about trade secret theft ``every day.'' This comes as no \nsurprise considering the loss to Ford Motor Company in 2006 when an \nemployee stole 4,000 documents which he took to China and used for the \nbenefit of his new employer Beijing Automotive Company, a competitor to \nFord. The damage to Ford was estimated to be between $50 million and \n$100 million.\n  In 1996, Congress enacted the Economic Espionage Act, which made \neconomic espionage and trade secret theft a Federal crime. Nearly 15 \nyears later, trade secret theft and economic espionage continue to pose \na threat to U.S. companies, yet there is no Federal civil remedy for \nvictims. To complement the criminal enforcement of economic espionage \nand State trade secret laws, the Protecting American Trade Secrets and \nInnovation Act would provide another avenue for companies to protect \ntheir trade secrets. The bill enables victims of trade secret theft to \nseek injunctive relief, putting an immediate halt to trade secret \nmisappropriation, and compensation for their losses in Federal court. \nIt will help fill a gap in Federal intellectual property law by \nproviding legal protections for non-patentable, non-copyrightable \ninnovations, on the condition that the owner of the innovation has \ntaken reasonable measures to keep the innovation a secret.\n  Today, companies that fall victim to economic espionage and trade \nsecret theft often can only bring civil actions in State court, under a \npatchwork of State laws, to stop the harm or seek compensation for \nlosses. While State courts may be a suitable venue in some cases, major \ntrade secret cases will often require tools available more readily in \nFederal court, such as nationwide service of process for subpoenas, \ndiscovery and witness depositions. In addition, for trade secret \nholders operating nationwide, a single Federal statute can be more \nefficient than navigating 50 different State laws. Finally, our bill \npermits judges to issue seizure orders to prevent defendants from \ndestroying evidence. In sum, our bill demonstrates a Federal commitment \nto trade secret protection by expanding the legal options for victims \nof economic espionage and trade secret theft.\n  This legislation will not inundate Federal courts with minor trade \nsecret cases because it includes limits so that only the most serious \ncases requiring Federal courts will be permitted. These limitations \nrequire the victim of trade secret theft to certify that the dispute \nrequires either a substantial need for nationwide service of process or \nthe misappropriation of trade secrets from the U.S. to another country. \nFinally, it is important to emphasize that our legislation is not \nintended to replace State trade secret laws, but to complement them to \nensure that victims of economic espionage and trade secret \nmisappropriation can get the most prompt, effective and efficient \njustice.\n  We cannot take lightly the threat of trade secrets theft to American \nbusinesses, American jobs, and American innovation. This legislation is \nanother simple and straightforward step we can take to help companies \ndefend themselves against trade secret theft. It demonstrates our \ncommitment at the Federal level to protect all forms of a business's \nintellectual property and their innovative spirit.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3389\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 483\n\n       Whereas yellow corrugated stainless steel tubing (referred \n     to in this preamble as ``CSST'') is flexible gas piping used \n     to convey natural gas or propane to household appliances in \n     homes and businesses;\n       Whereas since 1990, yellow CSST has been installed in more \n     than 6,000,000 homes and businesses in the United States;\n       Whereas field reports and research suggest that if direct \n     or indirect lightning strikes a structure, the risk for \n     electrical arcing between the metal components in a structure \n     with yellow CSST may be reduced by means of equipotential \n     bonding and grounding;\n       Whereas proper bonding of CSST is defined in section 7.13.2 \n     of the 2009 edition of the NFPA 54: National Fuel Gas Code, \n     and is referenced in info note 2 in section 250.104 of the \n     2011 edition of the NFPA 70: National Electric Code;\n       Whereas the National Association of State Fire Marshals \n     supports the proper bonding of yellow CSST to current \n     National Fire Protection Association Code to reduce the \n     possibility of gas leaks and fires from lightning strikes;\n       Whereas the National Association of State Fire Marshals is \n     working to educate relevant stakeholders, including fire, \n     building, and housing officials, consumers, homeowners, and \n     construction professionals about the need to properly bond \n     yellow CSST in legacy installations and in all new \n     installations in accordance with the most recent building \n     codes and manufacturer installation instructions;\n       Whereas the bonding of yellow CSST in legacy installations \n     is an important public safety matter that merits alerting \n     homeowners, relevant State and local fire, building, and \n     housing officials, and construction professionals such as \n     electricians, contractors, plumbers, inspectors, and home-\n     improvement specialists: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends efforts to promote and enhance public safety \n     and consumer awareness on proper bonding of yellow corrugated \n     stainless steel tubing (referred to in this resolution as \n     ``CSST'') as defined in the National Fire Protection \n     Association Code; and\n       (2) encourages further educational efforts for the public, \n     relevant building and housing officials, consumers, \n     homeowners, and construction professionals on the need to \n     properly bond yellow CSST retroactively and moving forward in \n     houses that contain the product.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/07/17/senate-section/article/S5090-3", "month": "07", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 3393\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
