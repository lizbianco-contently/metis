Madam President, for months I believed Mitt Romney wanted \nto be President of all of the United States. This week we learned Mitt \nRomney only wants to be President of half the United States.\n  If Mitt Romney were President, he wouldn't waste time worrying about \nthe 47 percent of Americans whom he believes are ``victims''--whom \nRomney believes are unwilling to take ``personal responsibility,'' and \nthose are his words, not mine. He can only worry about how the other \nhalf lives, I guess. That is what Mitt Romney told donors at a closed-\ndoor fundraiser in Florida a month or so ago.\n  But it turns out it wasn't closed. Someone videotaped every word he \nsaid to his wealthy donors. This is, among other things, what he said:\n\n       There are 47 percent who . . . are dependent upon \n     government, who believe that they are victims, who believe \n     that government has a responsibility to care for them, who \n     believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to \n     housing, to you name it.\n\n\n[[Page S6394]]\n\n\n  Mitt Romney said his job as President would not be ``to worry about \nthose people.'' But half of Americans are ``those people.''\n  He went on to say: ``I'll never convince them''--this is a direct \nquote--``they should take personal responsibility and care for their \nlives.''\n  So who are those Americans Mitt Romney disdains as ``victims'' and \n``those people''? They are not avoiding their tax bills, using Cayman \nIslands tax shelters or Swiss bank accounts like Mitt Romney. Millions \nof the 47 percent are seniors on Social Security who don't have Bain \nCapital retirement funds or inherited stock to fall back on. Many of \nthe 47 percent are students reaching to afford university tuition so \nthey can become nurses or teachers or attend a community college to \nbecome an electrician or welder or a lab technician. Some of the 47 \npercent have disabilities whose challenges are already a full-time job, \nbut still are actively seeking opportunities in their lives. Millions \nmore of this 47 percent have been unemployed since the great \nrecession--not because they are freeloaders or can't be bothered to get \na job but because some private equity funds closed their factory and \nshipped their jobs off to China. Large numbers of the 47 percent are \nactive-duty members of the military fighting for their country \noverseas. More of the 47 percent are veterans getting an education \nearned through dedicated service. Many of the 47 percent are mothers \nand fathers working minimum wage jobs but still struggling--and \nstruggling every day. Others of the 47 percent are middle-class \nfamilies raising children with a little help from the earned income tax \ncredit and the child tax credit--a hand-up Republicans once bragged \nabout helping to enact and, by the way, signed into law by that \n``liberal'' Ronald Reagan. The 47 percent are ordinary hard-working \nAmericans who deserve respect, especially from the man who wants to be \ntheir President. And these Americans pay a slew of other taxes, \nincluding State income taxes, payroll taxes, property taxes, and sales \ntaxes. But, in Mitt Romney's view, they still don't pay enough.\n  So let's ask a question: Whose taxes would Mitt Romney raise? Would \nMitt Romney raise taxes on retirees who have paid into Social Security \nall their lives and are counting on it to get them through their golden \nyears? That is a question.\n  Another question: Would Mitt Romney raise taxes on mothers and \nfathers who work hard but still struggle to put food in their \nchildren's mouths? Ronald Reagan thought there were certain people who \nmaybe need a little help and so we shouldn't do that. I agree with \nRonald Reagan.\n  Would Romney raise taxes on middle-class families stretching to \nafford diapers and day care at the same time? Would Romney raise taxes \non Americans with disabilities striving to live full and productive \nlives? Would Romney raise taxes on students stretching every dollar to \nafford tuition? Would Romney raise taxes on men and women serving \noverseas in the military who make untold sacrifices to preserve \nAmerica's freedom and democracy not because they are getting rich doing \nit but out of a deep sense of duty?\n  So whose taxes would Mitt Romney raise? We know he wouldn't raise \ntaxes on millionaires and billionaires or companies that ship jobs \noverseas. He has made that very clear. If a person is a math teacher or \na maid or a single mother, it won't be Mitt Romney's job to worry about \nthose people. If a person is a multimillionaire, Mitt Romney won't rest \nuntil they get a quarter of a million dollar tax cut. That is what the \nRyan budget does and Romney likes that.\n  For all we know, Mitt Romney could be one of those who has paid no \nFederal income tax. Thousands of families making more than $1 million \npay nothing in Federal income taxes each year. I will repeat that. \nThousands of families making more than $1 million a year pay nothing in \nFederal income taxes. Is Mitt Romney among those? We will never know \nsince he refuses to release his tax returns for the years before he was \nrunning for President. But from that one return--the only one we have \nseen--we know Mitt Romney pays a lower tax rate than middle-class \nfamilies, thanks to a number of things he has done, including Swiss \nbank accounts and Cayman Islands tax shelters. And we can only imagine \nwhat new secrets would be revealed if he showed the American people a \ndozen years of tax returns as his dad did.\n  Mitt Romney believes in two sets of rules--one for millionaires and \nanother for the middle class and the poor. If a person has money to \nhide in Bermuda and Switzerland, can that person not afford to pay a \nfew pennies more to balance the budget or to reduce the deficit? Mitt \nRomney says no. But if a person is retired or poor, disabled, a \nstudent, or even a returning hero who fought for our country, Romney \nbelieves that person can afford to pay more taxes.\n  This rare look at the real Mitt Romney--this rare look we got from a \nman who was at a fundraiser for him--proves one thing: He is completely \nout of touch with average Americans. If he won't stand up and fight for \nevery American--every American--as President, then he does not deserve \nto serve any American as President.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Suu Kyi Gold Medal Ceremony\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, later today Congress will award the \nCongressional Gold Medal to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a remarkably \ncourageous woman whose cause I have taken a particular interest in over \nthe years.\n  Suu Kyi's story is so powerful it is almost hard to believe it is all \ntrue.\n  Her father Aung San, the architect of Burmese independence, was \nassassinated when she was a toddler. She lived in India for a time, \nworked at the U.N. here in the United States, and eventually married \nand settled into a happy and comfortable life with her professor \nhusband and two boys in Oxford, England.\n  That quiet, suburban life changed forever one night in the spring of \n1988. She got a phone call that her mother had fallen ill back in \nBurma. She left to take care of her the following day and arrived to \nfind a revolution already underway.\n  As her father's daughter, Suu Kyi was regarded as a natural fit to \nfill the role.\n  Years earlier, Suu Kyi had a premonition that her people might need \nher one day, so much so that when her husband proposed marriage, she \nagreed, but on the one condition that if her people ever needed her, \nshe could go. He agreed without hesitation. More than two decades \nlater, he made good on his pledge.\n  With Suu Kyi under house arrest in Burma, her husband fell ill with \ncancer back in England. She knew she would be allowed to leave, but she \nalso knew she wouldn't be allowed to return to Burma once she did. So \nwith her husband's support, Suu Kyi made the difficult decision to \nstay. For nearly two decades--two decades--she remained under house \narrest in her mother's old home on University Avenue on the shores of \nInya Lake.\n  Over the years, I have followed Suu Kyi closely and I have done what \nI could to advance her cause. Along with Senator Feinstein, I have \nworked to get the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act enacted every year \nsince 2003 as a way of pressuring the regime to reform itself. My \ncolleague Senator McCain has been active on this issue and has had the \nopportunity to visit with her several times.\n\n  If not for the quiet determination and simple confidence of this \nremarkable women, democratic reforms might have seemed a lost cause \nunder the Burmese junta. But in November 2010, we were all encouraged \nwhen Suu Kyi was finally released from house arrest. And since then we \nhave seen other hopeful signs.\n  I was allowed the privilege of actually traveling to Burma earlier \nthis year to meet with Suu Kyi and discuss some of the reforms we have \nseen. On April 1, Suu Kyi won a seat in the Burmese Parliament. We \ncannot be sure that the progress we have seen in Burma will last, but \nwe are cautiously optimistic.\n  It is a great privilege to be able to honor this woman who has done \nso much for the Burmese people and for the cause of democratic reform \nand human rights around the world. I am also honored that Suu Kyi has \ngraciously agreed to speak about her incredible journey and the cause \nof democratic reform and human rights at\n\n[[Page S6395]]\n\nthe University of Louisville next Monday. I know the students and the \nlarger community there are all looking forward to her visit.\n  But for now, this is a truly special day here at the Capitol. It has \nbeen a long time coming. We are honored to have this hero with us today \nand delighted to award her our Nation's highest civilian honor.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation Of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, Bill Daley is a businessman in Chicago \nand a friend of mine. A few years back he was the chairman of the Al \nGore Presidential campaign. We all know how the campaign ended in the \nFlorida recount. Bill was contacted several years later by those who \nwanted to run for President. They made their trip to Chicago and asked \nBill if he could give them some insight into what it was all about, how \nyou would win. Bill said to them, one and all, the same thing: I am not \nsure I have any special strategy to tell you, but there is one thing I \nhave discovered over the years. By the end of the Presidential \ncampaign, the American people will know who you really are.\n  I thought that was very simply and directly stated by Bill Daley and \nreflected the fact that although every candidate at every level tries \nto surround himself or herself with the wisest people in Christendom, \nto give them advice on polling and media and analyzing the electorate \nand the right words to be said, that more so in a Presidential campaign \nthan almost any others, by the end of the campaign, the American people \nknow who you really are.\n  The revelations into a person's values and character are not those \nwell-scripted ads or even those flowery speeches. The revelations come \nby observing that person in good times and bad and perhaps hearing the \nunguarded comments which give you an insight into what they think when \nthe camera is not on.\n  That is why this release of a video of Mitt Romney has had such an \nimpact on America. What he said at a fundraiser in Boca Raton, FL, to \nsome very wealthy supporters on May 17, 2012, bears repeating in \nspecific detail. Here is what he said:\n\n       There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the \n     president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who \n     are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe \n     that they are victims, who believe the government has a \n     responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are \n     entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. \n     That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it \n     to them. And they will vote for this president no matter \n     what. . . . These are people who pay no income tax. . . . \n     [M]y job--\n\n  This is Mitt Romney speaking--\n\n       is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince \n     them they should take personal responsibility and care for \n     their lives.\n\n  It was a moment of candor by Romney in a room full of friends about \nhis view of America, and it has become the centerpiece of this week's \ndebate in the Presidential campaign, not just because he was caught in \nan off moment or with an embarrassing statement, but the fact that \nsince then he has not retracted, he has not backed off of those \nstatements.\n  In his first press conference, when confronted, he said he was \n``inelegant'' in the way he spoke. Well, assuming that he meant \nineloquent and not lacking eloquence, I would say he has had enough \ntime to develop an elegant reply, and we have not heard it.\n\n  I think there is more truth than not in what he says when it comes to \nhis point of view of this country, and it is no surprise when you look \nback to those other unguarded moments and things he has said during the \ncourse of the campaign.\n  We remember the highlights. ``Corporations are people, my friend,'' \nhe said. ``I like being able to fire people,'' he said. ``I'm not \nconcerned about the very poor,'' Romney said. ``I'm also unemployed,'' \nRomney said. ``Ann drives a couple of Cadillacs,'' Romney said. ``Ten \nthousand bucks? $10,000 bet?'' he said. ``I have some great friends \nthat are NASCAR team owners,'' he said.\n  It was Bill Kristol who wrote recently--I believe it was yesterday--\nin the Weekly Standard a response in which he was critical of President \nObama but also of Governor Romney. Here is what Bill Kristol, one of \nthe prominent conservative spokesmen in America, in response to \nRomney's revelation at the Boca Raton fundraiser, wrote:\n\n       It's worth recalling that a good chunk of the 47 percent \n     who don't pay income taxes are Romney supporters--especially \n     of course seniors (who might well ``believe they are entitled \n     to health care,'' a position Romney agrees with), as well as \n     many lower-income Americans (including men and women serving \n     in the military) who think conservative policies are better \n     for the country even if they're not getting a tax cut under \n     the Romney plan. So Romney seems to have contempt not just \n     for the Democrats who oppose him, but for tens of millions \n     who intend to vote for him.\n\n  End of quote from Bill Kristol.\n  This was a revelation into his values and his view of America. But it \nalso tells us that he does not understand this country and the people \nwho live in it. Because when we take a close look at those in the 47 \npercent, here is who we find: the elderly, working families with \nchildren, and low-wage earners. That is the 47 percent.\n  The elderly. One in five of the elderly is in the 47 percent. These \nAmericans do not owe any Federal income tax because of a longstanding \npolicy choice that Social Security benefits--modest Social Security \nbenefits--should not be taxed. Does Romney oppose that? Does he want to \ntax Social Security benefits so these will be responsible nonvictims in \nhis view of America?\n  Now let's turn to low-income working families with children. They \nmake up approximately one out of six people in the 47 percent. They \nbenefit from the earned income tax credit. It was an incentive for them \nto go to work. Realizing they do not make much money working, we are \ngoing to give them a break in the Tax Code to help them get by.\n  As the majority leader mentioned earlier, this notion came out under \nPresident Ronald Reagan. It was Ronald Reagan who said, when he signed \nthis into law in 1986, this will remove ``six million [poor] people \nfrom the income tax rolls,'' making it one of the most effective \nantipoverty programs in our history.''\n  So these people are not paying taxes--so-called victims, so-called \nirresponsible, under Romney's analysis. Is he suggesting the earned \nincome tax credit has to go?\n  When you take a look at these people who make up the 47 percent in \nAmerica, you understand that many of them have paid their dues. \nVeterans on disability may not be paying income taxes. They are part of \nthe 47 percent. People who are middle-income working families, whose \nkids borrow money for college are turning to the government for help \nwhen they want to put their kids through school to make sure they have \na better life.\n  I close because I know I have my colleagues coming to the floor. \nThere is\n\n[[Page S6396]]\n\none thing that leapt off the page when I read this quote from Boca \nRaton. It appears that Mitt Romney makes his value judgments on \nAmericans based on their income tax returns.\n  Historically, American voters have made a judgment on Presidential \ncandidates based on their income tax returns. The man who set the gold \nstandard that was followed for decades in America in Presidential races \nwas Mitt Romney's father George Romney, former Governor of Michigan. He \ndisclosed 12 years of income tax returns, and he said: Do not just give \nme 1 year. That does not tell me anything. One year might look good. \nGive me 12 years, and I can then decide whether this person is paying \ntaxes as they should and make a value judgment accordingly.\n  Well, the son did not learn from the father. Over the past 36 years, \nWillard Mitt Romney holds the distinction of all Presidential \ncandidates of either political party of having made the least \ndisclosure of income tax returns of any Presidential candidate--1 year. \nHe promises another, but 1 year.\n  What did this 1 year reveal? It revealed he is the first Presidential \ncandidate in the history of the United States of America with a Swiss \nbank account. I have asked business leaders across America, Why would \nyou have a Swiss bank account?\n  I asked Warren Buffett--he is one of the wealthiest men in our \ncountry--have you ever had a Swiss bank account. He said: No, there are \nperfectly good banks in the United States.\n  Then I asked business leaders--and seriously--Why would you have a \nSwiss bank account? Two reasons. You want to conceal what you have and \nthe transactions that lead up to you acquiring it or, secondly, you \nbelieve the Swiss franc is a stronger currency than the U.S. dollar. I \nmight add that Mitt Romney created a Swiss bank account under President \nGeorge W. Bush's administration.\n  Secondly, the offshore tax shelters in the Cayman Islands and \nBermuda--why do you have those? To avoid tax liability in the United \nStates.\n  I do not know what is in Mitt Romney's income tax returns. There must \nbe something in there he does not want America to see, because he is \ndefying all the calls to go public with the income tax returns.\n  Are income tax returns important? In Boca Raton he judged 47 percent \nof the American people based on their income tax returns. We should \njudge Mitt Romney based on his income tax returns or his refusal to \ndisclose them.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I know my colleague, the Democratic \nassistant leader, is here, and I will make a budget point of order now \nbecause I understand he would be objecting.\n  Madam President, the pending amendment, No. 2789, offered by the \nSenator from Washington, would cause the underlying legislation to \nexceed the authorizing committee's section 302(a) allocation of new \nbudget authority and outlays. Therefore, it violates the budget and I \nraise a point of order against this measure pursuant to section 302(f) \nof the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I will say to my colleague, I \nappreciate his eloquence and his advocacy. He gave us a real partisan \nspeech this morning. I will just ask a few things of one of our leaders \nin the Senate, Mr. Durbin.\n  What about the responsibility of this body to pass a budget? We have \nnot had one in over 1,200 days. What about the responsibility of this \nbody to move appropriations bills? Not one single appropriations bill \nhas been advanced. And while we are working on legislation that could \nhelp veterans find jobs--it will cost about $200 million a year--why \nhas this body not brought up the defense appropriations bill that funds \nthe Defense Department at over $500 billion? We have not even brought \nit up for a vote, even though the House has passed one.\n  Why have we not brought up the defense authorization bill that passed \nthe Armed Services Committee unanimously? I am a member of it. It has \nbeen sitting here for months and not been brought up. Why? Because we \nwould have a debate, actually have some votes around here?\n  So that is a problem I think we have in this Senate, and I believe it \nis a serious matter.\n  I was going to make some comments about the bill before us.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be brief. I thank the Senator from Alabama, my \nfriend, for yielding the floor. He asks an important question: Why has \nCongress not passed a budget resolution in a number of years? But he \nknows the answer. The answer is because we did better than that. We \nenacted a statute, a law. A resolution is a message from one house of \nCongress, back and forth, and kind of binds us internally. A law signed \nby the President has the force of law. It was called the Budget Control \nAct.\n  The interesting thing about the Budget Control Act is it was written \nby Democrats and Republicans. It charts the course of spending for 2 \nyears, including the one we are appropriating into now. It was voted on \nin favor by Democratic and Republican leaders alike. It was a \nbipartisan effort signed by President Obama with the force of law. That \nhas more power than any budget resolution.\n  So, clearly, saying that we did not pass a budget resolution on its \nface is true, but to say that we are not bound by rules when it is \ncomes to spending is to ignore the obvious--a budget control act voted \non by the leaders on both sides of the aisle.\n  The second question he asked is, are we ignoring that spending \nrestriction when it comes to those veterans programs, and why should \nwe?\n  Well, first, the bill that is before us, this Veterans Jobs Corps \nAct, is paid for. It does not add a penny to the deficit.\n  The second question is, Well, why do you need it anyway?\n  Have you noticed the veterans coming home? Have you noticed the high \nunemployment rate? Have you noticed the problems they are facing when \nthey bring home visible and invisible scars from this war? Is it \ngreater than we thought we would face at this time? Yes. Do we have an \nobligation to spend this money regardless? Of course. Did we not \npromise these men and women: If you raise your hand and swear your \nallegiance to the United States and your willingness to risk your life, \nwe will stand with you when you come home. We will help you find a job. \nWe will give you the medical care you need.\n  We promised it. We are going to keep the promise.\n  Now comes the Budget Act, and now a technicality is being argued that \nmaybe we cannot keep the promise. I am going to vote to waive the \nBudget Act because I stood on this floor with Democrats and Republicans \nalike, joined in the speeches, joined in the parades, joined in the \nflag waving saying how much we respect these veterans. But when it \ncomes to spending the money we promised them we would spend so they \ncould become a vital part of America's future, I am not going to step \nback and hide behind the Budget Act. I am going to stand and make sure \nthat money is there, paid for, not adding to the deficit, so that they \nhave the help they need for the lives we promised them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank my eloquent colleague. But we \ndo not have a budget. The law requires us to have a budget--passed \ndecades ago. The Senate Democratic leadership, of which he is a part, \nsaid it was foolish to have a budget. They were not going to have one. \nWe have not had one for 3 years. So it resulted last year in a debate \nover raising the debt ceiling because we had run up more debt than any \ntime in the history of this Republic. And there was an agreement to \nlimit spending. It is not a budget. It\n\n[[Page S6397]]\n\nsets a limit on spending--only on discretionary spending, not on the 60 \npercent of the government otherwise on which we spend money. It is \ninadequate and insufficient, and before the ink is dry on it, we are \nback in here with a Democratic majority advocating legislation that \nviolates that cap. There is no dispute about it. This is the eighth \ntime we have raised budget points of order for violation of the \nagreement setting a cap on spending limits. So here we go again.\n  Public opinion of Congress is lower today than at almost any time in \nhistory. According to the most recent Gallup Poll, only 13 percent of \nthe public approves of Congress's actions. Americans do not trust us. \nWhy should Americans trust us when we keep using gimmicks and budget \nslights of hand to hide more spending and drive this country further \ninto debt when we make a promise by passing a law that limits spending \nand then promptly violate that law within months of passage? And, now, \nthe Democrats will attempt again today to violate that law? Why should \nthe American people respect an institution, such as this one, that \ncannot adhere to a sound financial course for America?\n  On August 28, our country's gross debt reached $16 trillion--$16 \ntrillion--over 100 percent of the entire gross domestic product of this \nNation. It is a danger zone, according to every expert who has \ntestified.\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget's latest mid-session \nreview of our fiscal condition, our Nation's debt will increase $4.4 \ntrillion over the next 4 years, rising to over $20 trillion. And in \nthat period of time, we will virtually have doubled the entire debt of \nthe United States since the Democrats took the majority in the Senate \nand President Obama was elected--double the entire debt. And the course \nwe remain on does not get better. These are their budget numbers. This \nis a course America is on, and we are not getting off of it. It is $1 \ntrillion a year in deficits. The U.S. debt per household is now \n$137,000 per household--up $80,000 since just 2002. While Americans \nhave tightened their budgets to make ends meet, Congress has not passed \na budget in 1,239 days.\n  Erskine Bowles, whom President Obama asked to chair the debt \ncommission, noted recently--I saw him in a CNBC interview at a \nconference on July 12. He said:\n\n       If you take last year, 100 percent of our revenue came into \n     the country . . . was spent on our--what's called mandatory \n     spending and interest on the debt. Mandatary spending is \n     principally the entitlement programs, Medicare, Medicaid, and \n     Social Security.\n\n  That is what the tax revenue pays for. Everything above that is \nfunded by borrowed money. That is what he said. Is he correct? \nAbsolutely. We are now borrowing 40 cents of every dollar we spend. \nThat is not sustainable. At that conference, Mr. Bowles repeated what \nhe said before the Budget Committee, on which I am ranking member. Mr. \nBowles said this Nation has never been on a more predictable financial \ncrisis path. That is what he said. If we continue at this rate, we are \ngoing to have a financial crisis like 2007. Hopefully not if we can \navoid it, but if we do not change what we are doing, we are going to \nhave one. He is absolutely confident about it. He has repeated it. So \nhas the Federal Reserve Chairman, Mr. Bernanke. He said: These numbers \nare not going to continue. If you do not change, we will have a crisis \nbefore we get there.\n\n  At the debt debate last summer--most Americans remember that; \nCongress should certainly remember it--we finally reached an agreement \nthat is now being violated. We passed the Budget Control Act last \nAugust at the last minute, if you remember, to set strict spending \nlimits over the next 10 years. It created a super committee to solve \nall of our problems, we hoped, or if the committee failed, which it \ndid, to enact $1.2 trillion, at least, in cuts through sequestration. \nThat would raise the debt ceiling $2.1 trillion. We would have a net \ncut in spending of $2.1 trillion. The debt ceiling money gets spent \nnow. We have almost added another $2.1 trillion to the debt since last \nAugust. We are getting close to the debt limit again. But the cuts were \npromised to be over 10 years. We will spend now, but we promise you we \nhave got a plan. We have a law that will keep us on the right path over \nthe next 10 years. So the questions are: Are we spending at that limit? \nWill we stay there?\n  Secondly, let me note parenthetically that the $2.1 trillion is not \nenough in reduced spending projections. We are talking about reducing \nprojected spending rates--the increase--not cutting spending $2.1 \ntrillion. We are talking about cutting the projected increase in \nspending. So at the current rate of spending--$3.7, $3.8 trillion this \nyear--if you carry that out for 10 years, that would be $38 trillion. \nUnder the projections, we are to spend $47 trillion over the next 10 \nyears--almost $10 trillion more. All the Budget Control act says is: We \nare going to spend $45 trillion rather than $47 trillion, that our \nspending would increase from $37 trillion to $45 trillion. Can the \nRepublic sustain that? Is that going to throw us into the ocean? Will \nwe collapse as a nation? Will children starve and people not get their \nSocial Security? Of course not. We will still be spending more money. \nThat is all the budget agreement called for, and we are already \nwaffling on that commitment that occurred last summer.\n  So here we are. While our colleagues have offered well-meaning \nlegislation and something that we should work on to try to deal with \nthe unfortunate increase in unemployment for our veterans--and we can \nhelp them, I truly believe--they have refused to go by the promises \nmade under the Budget Control Act last summer--flatly refused.\n  So I am worried about unemployment. I am worried about it especially \namong veterans. And there are things we can do. In an effort to find \ncommon ground, Senator Burr from North Carolina, representing Fort \nBragg, where I spent a summer, offered an alternative bill, the Careers \nfor Veterans Act, which would help our veterans find jobs while keeping \nthe Federal budget under control and honoring the commitment we made \nlast summer. It can be done. This is not hard to do if you want to do \nit.\n  Since the Senate majority will not even allow a vote on any bill that \nabides by the budget--Senator Reid is obstructing the right of Members \nto offer amendments to the bill--I have raised a budget point of order \nagainst Senator Murray's substitute amendment. Sustaining this point of \norder will allow us to keep the promises made in the Budget Control Act \nthat Senator Durbin talked about so proudly--just stay within those \npromises. It will allow us to continue to work on this bill in a way \nthat helps our veterans without adding more to our children's debt. It \ndoes not kill the legislation; it simply tells the sponsors: We are not \ngoing to do this until you get it within the budget limits to which we \nagreed. And it can be done. Senator Burr's bill does it. It certainly \ncan be done.\n  The Senate majority had the opportunity to write legislation \ncomplying with the spending limits set in the Budget Control Act. \nInstead, they bypassed the committee process. We have not had any \ncommittee hearings on this legislation. And they have offered a \nsubstitute amendment that violates the Congressional Budget Act by \nincreasing mandatory spending $700 million over the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee's 302(a) allocation.\n  Under the Budget Act, the committee is given a certain amount of \nmoney to spend for veterans, and this amendment would violate that \nagreement. Specifically, the Murray amendment violates Section 302(f) \nof the Congressional Budget Act by spending $61 million above the \ncommittee's allocation for 2013 and $480 million above the committee's \nallocation for 2013 through 2017. It would also spend $666 million \nabove the committee's allocation for 2013 through 2022.\n  Surely, out of a budget that spends $47 trillion over 10 years, we \ncan find $700 million in savings to pay for this bill. That is all that \nneeds to be done to ensure that the bill complies with the Budget Act. \nAs a result of exceeding the Veterans' Affairs Committee's allocation, \nthe Murray substitute amendment violates Section 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act. That has been discussed with Chairman Conrad, \nthe Democratic chairman of the Budget Committee. He acknowledges that \nit does, and so does his staff. I am very confident that the \nParliamentarian agrees and will rule that it violates the Budget Act.\n\n[[Page S6398]]\n\n  Now the Senate majority plans to have a vote to waive--to waive the \npromise they made to the American people to control spending just over \na year ago. So that is the issue before us today. Do we take the bill \nand fix it so it complies with the budget--which can easily be done \nbecause the substitute Senator Burr has drafted does it--or will we \nonce again waive the promises we made last August and so proudly touted \nthat we were going to cut $2.1 trillion in spending.\n\n  In effect, there is a tax increase, argued with some validity, to pay \nfor this bill. The bill uses a tax enforcement measure to stop abuses \nby people who don't fully pay their taxes. This will raise revenue, \nand, therefore, the bill is offset, and so we shouldn't worry about it. \nSo here we have a new idea for helping veterans: We will raise taxes \nand revenue and we pay for it.\n  But this is what is called tax and spend. Tax and spend. We agreed to \na limit on what we would spend. If we have discovered a method to \ncollect more taxes or raise taxes to get more revenue, that money, \nunder our budget agreement last summer, is to be used to pay down the \ndebt, not to take more money to spend on a new program today because we \nhave more revenue to spend. So that is a fundamental issue. Just \nbecause it is paid for does not mean we are not spending more than we \nagreed to spend. We very precisely are.\n  Not only does the Murray amendment violate the Budget Act by spending \nabove agreed-to levels, but it also uses budget gimmicks--\nextraordinarily really--to make the bill appear to be offset. This \nbudget sleight of hand is called a timing shift. What about this offset \nor pay-for idea? Let me discuss that a moment.\n  This is one of the issues that, if the American people fully \nunderstood it, would outrage them. As a matter of fact, it is probably \npart of why they are not happy with us now because they have seen so \nmuch of this. This is a recurring gimmick. If a CEO offered stock based \non this kind of promise of financial solvency they would go to jail. It \nis as bogus as a three-dollar bill. This is what it is. It shifts the \npayment of corporate income taxes 2 to 3 months sooner so we can count \nit in this fiscal year. Specifically, this gimmick would collect \nadditional revenue over the 2013 through 2017 budget window, which is \nthe budget window they were trying to deal with since it violates the \nBudget Act over that 5 year period. So this was designed to cover up \nmore spending.\n  But think about it. It is exactly the same amount of less revenue \nthat will occur in the 2014 through 2018 budget window. If we ask \nsomeone to pay their taxes earlier, they do not owe it the next year \nwhen we would otherwise expect to receive it.\n  The height of this gimmick was demonstrated years ago when I first \ncame to the Senate. I was shocked. This is what they did: They moved a \nSocial Security check from this fiscal year to the next fiscal year. \nWhat was the result? It resulted in having a lot of money to spend this \nfiscal year; right? The CBO said we have more money because we didn't \npay a Social Security payment. They moved--delayed--it by 1 day. That \nis what they wanted to do, to move it 1 day. But what happens to the \nnext fiscal year? Is this really a gain or a gimmick? It is a gimmick \nbecause the next fiscal year we would need to make an additional Social \nSecurity payment in that budget year.\n  It is just a way to spend more today and push off the cost until \ntomorrow. That is what they did then, and that is exactly what this is \ntoday. It is a smoke-and-mirror scheme used to avoid the rules in the \nBudget Act and the scorekeepers at the Congressional Budget Office. It \nbeing used to manipulate the scoring for short-term gain. It simply \nspeeds up the payments in the first 5 years so it appears we have more \nmoney to spend. In reality, the gimmick merely creates a hole in the \nbudget next year because the money that was expected to come in next \nyear--now coming in this year--is not coming in next year.\n  So this point of order is not a technical issue, it is an issue of \nwhether this body will uphold its commitment to the American people on \nhow much money we are going to spend. Congress agreed to certain \nspending levels in the Budget Control Act. We voted on those spending \nlevels, and we should stick with those spending levels today. There is \nno reason for us to violate that agreement. The point of order exists \nso that Congress cannot raise taxes and spend money over the agreed-to \namount. The point of order requires 60 votes to waive, and it exists so \nthe Senate does not succumb to political pressure to spend beyond our \nmeans. Really, it is meant to try to stop spending beyond our means.\n  The Senate majority was aware of the budget rules when they wrote \nthis bill. They were aware of it. Instead of writing a bill that \ncomplied with the Budget Act, they decided to go above the agreed-upon \nspending levels. Senator Burr--a fine Senator--was also aware of the \nrules under the Budget Act and the spending levels set under the Budget \nControl Act. He drafted alternative legislation that complied with the \nbudget rules and that would fund a veterans jobs program through \ndiscretionary spending.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate majority took most of Senator Burr's policy \nsuggestions but did not keep the fiscal discipline found in his bill. \nThey will not allow us to have a vote to aid veterans within the \nspending agreement.\n  Contrary to what my friends on the other side of the aisle claim, \nthis point of order will not kill the bill. It only returns the bill to \nthe legislative calendar. It will remain right there on the calendar, \nbut it will allow the people who support it, if they want it passed--\nand they do--to propose changes so that the bill complies with the \nBudget Act.\n  We can still fix and pass this bill before we leave this week. It \nwouldn't take much time at all to fix this matter. A vote in support of \nthe point of order will protect the integrity of the budget process. \nSupporting this point of order will allow us to change the underlying \nbill so that it is fiscally sound and complies with the spending levels \nwe have agreed to.\n  Unfortunately, while the Senate majority refuses to allow a vote on a \nreasonable veterans bill that complies with the Budget Act, they are \nneglecting the looming cuts that face our military men and women on \nJanuary 2, 2013--the sequester. Given the events happening around the \nworld today, we need to be very careful not to allow these kinds of \ncuts to take place in the first part of next year. There are various \nways we could easily fix that, in my opinion, but we will not even \nconfront the issue. The Senate majority has refused to address \nsequestration, which the Secretary of Defense--President Obama's \nSecretary of Defense--said would be catastrophic. Defense people have \nsaid it would hollow out the military. It is too rapid a bite, \naccording to the experts in the Obama administration and others, but no \neffort has been brought forward to confront that problem--to bring it \nup on the Senate floor and have a full debate about it.\n  We can do a $200 million a year bill that we spent a week or more on, \nbut we have no time on the Senate floor dedicated to dealing with the \nsequester, which would take $500 billion out of the defense budget. \nThis bill on the floor today would spend nearly $1 billion over 5 years \nabove the budget.\n  What about the $500 billion in cuts that are looming right now in \nJanuary? We need to wrestle with that and decide how we are going to \nconfront that. It is not going to be easy. Maybe defense can sustain \nsome more cuts, but I don't think this much. They have already taken \n$500 billion in cuts, and this would be an additional $500 billion in \ncuts.\n  The Defense Department, under the plan today, which represents one-\nsixth of Federal Government spending, would get half the cuts, and the \nremaining five-sixths of the Federal Government would get the other \nhalf of the cuts. This is disproportionate. It should not have been \npart of the Budget Act. But they slipped it in the dead of night, and \nit came to the floor and people went along with it so we would not hit \nthe debt ceiling. But it is not good, and we need to fix that, in my \nopinion.\n  House Republicans have confronted this matter. They realized this was \na problem, and they proposed a budget and a plan to replace and undo \nthe sequester and to do it in a way that made sense without violating \nspending levels we agreed to last August. How many proposals to fix \nthis problem have we\n\n[[Page S6399]]\n\nreceived from Senator Durbin and Senator Reid? Zero. Nothing. They are \nnot doing anything but blocking any attempt to bring up legislation \nthat would fix it.\n  That is why we don't have a Defense authorization bill, which came \nout of my committee unanimously, the Armed Services Committee. It has \nbeen sitting here and not being brought up. Why? Because if we do, we \nwill have a discussion about the sequester and the Defense Department \nand the future of America, and they do not want that. The House passed \nthe Defense authorization bill in May, and they passed the Defense \nappropriations bill in June. We have passed none of them, not even \nbrought them to the floor.\n  They want to attack Republicans as not caring about our men and women \nwho serve our country. Yet we are trying to fix the sequester, trying \nto bring up a Defense bill that will actually do some good and give a \npay raise to our men and women in uniform--a small one, but a pay \nraise. So I am really disappointed we haven't brought up the Defense \nauthorization bill, which came out of my committee.\n  A few days ago--last week--Senator McCain spoke about this. He said: \nShame, shame, shame. Imagine that for 51 years, every year, this Senate \nhas passed the Defense authorization bill. This will be the first time \nin 51 years we haven't passed the Defense authorization bill, and we \nhave so many important issues related to our Defense Department today. \nNothing is more important than that. Yet we spent a whole week, or the \nlast few days, discussing a bill that could have been agreed to just \nlike that, with the suggestions of Senator Burr, because we can't wait \nto get out of this place. This could have already passed, and we could \nhave been dealing with these important issues. I find it breathtaking, \nfrankly.\n  Let me just point out the bill is not going to go through the House \nsince it violates the Constitution. There are revenue proposals in this \nbill. It will not see the light of day in the House because the \nConstitution says revenue bills must be generated in the House. So we \nhave wasted all this time producing a bill that cannot and will not be \nreceived by the House.\n  Article 1, Section 7 of the United States Constitution says:\n\n       All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House \n     of Representatives. . . .\n\n  This is a revenue bill.\n  So what has happened? Is it just an idea? Let's see, we don't want to \ntalk about the Defense appropriations bill. We don't want to talk about \nthe Defense authorization bill; it involves hundreds of billions of \ndollars. We don't want to talk about those, so let's bring up this \nveterans bill. We will bring it up even though it violates the Budget \nAct. And do you know what those stupid Republicans will do? They will \nobject and say it violates the Budget Act. And do you know what we can \nsay? We can say: You don't like veterans. You don't believe in honoring \nthose who served our country. Do you want to know the truth? That is \nwhat has happened right here today, and it is irresponsible.\n  So let's vote for Senator Burr's bill. Let's pass legislation that \nwill help veterans right now, or we are going to send this bill back--I \nam confident--to see if they come up with some other plan that would be \nhelpful to our veterans and their employment prospects without \nviolating the Budget Act.\n  I want to mention one more thing because I think it is important. The \ntwo largest veterans groups, the VFW and the American Legion, have said \nthese things. Steve Gonzalez, assistant director of the American \nLegion, said both bills, the Burr and Murray bills ``have ideas on how \nto get veterans quality jobs,'' and added that Burr's version stands a \nbetter chance of passing.\n  What about the VFW? In the Washington Post today:\n\n       ``VFW supports concepts behind the Veterans Job Corps bill, \n     but we have some concerns about the budgetary implications,'' \n     said Ryan Gallucci, deputy director of national legislative \n     affairs for the VFW.\n\n  We don't have to do it the way this bill has come up. Senator Burr \nhas offered a very fine proposal that the VFW and the American Legion \nseem to support. Let's do that. Let's do it that way and not violate \nour commitment to the American people to live within our means.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                         Production Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise again this morning, as \nI have for a number of months, to talk about the most important issue \nfacing the American people and this Congress, and that is jobs.\n  A good news story on the jobs front has been our wind energy \nindustry. The wind energy industry has created thousands of good-paying \njobs, and it could create thousands more. But the troubling news that \ngoes along with the good news is that the potentially bright future of \nthis industry is uncertain. Why? Because we in the Congress are holding \nthe wind energy industry hostage because we have failed to extend the \nproduction tax credit.\n  As I have said every day I have been on the Senate floor since June \nto discuss this topic, every day that we fail to extend the PTC for \nwind energy more jobs are put at risk. We have seen this unfortunate \nreality unfold across the country as predicted, including in my home \nState of Colorado, where over 100 people have lost their jobs. I don't \nhave to tell my colleagues that when people lose jobs, those job losses \nnegatively affect families and the communities where they live.\n  Just yesterday--it breaks my heart--Siemens Energy announced they are \ngoing to lay off more than 600 people in Iowa, Kansas, and Florida. \nEnough is enough. These layoffs that continue to be announced almost \nweekly should spur us to extend the wind production tax credit without \nany further delay.\n  Jobs are at stake. It is that simple. With many Americans already \nlosing their jobs, more jobs are at risk--thousands, literally--if we \ndon't act.\n  Here is my question: Why would we forfeit leadership in an industry \nthat is poised to grow even further? There is no reason we should cede \nleadership of this important industry to China or anywhere else by \nletting the production tax credit expire. If we commit to extending the \nPTC, we will then lead the world in wind power, and here is a part of \nwhy I come to the floor every day and talk about particular States.\n  There are few places that is more apparent than in Wyoming. Wyoming \nhas phenomenal wind reserves. If you have driven through Wyoming, you \nknow what I am talking about. If you talk to anybody from Wyoming, they \nwill always ironically say: One of the things we have in excess in \nWyoming is wind.\n  The National Global Energy Lab based in Colorado estimates that \nWyoming has enough wind power potential to meet 116 times the State's \nenergy needs. To put it another way, that is 25 million homes that \nwould be powered by harnessing wind.\n  Wyoming is well on its way to harnessing its wind potential. Why? \nAlthough it ranks 11th in the Nation for installed wind power--which is \nnot a shabby number, frankly--there are plans to nearly quadruple the \namount of wind power in the State of Wyoming. Not only would that \ncreate thousands of jobs--that goes without saying--it would produce \nenough electricity to power 1.5 million homes. The construction of \nthose projects will create hundreds of nicely paying renewable energy \njobs right in the State of Wyoming.\n  It is no wonder then that the massive wind potential in Wyoming has \nalso attracted investment for manufacturers. To make that point, I want \nto share a development with you.\n  Last year a plan to build the first wind energy manufacturing \nfacility in Wyoming was announced. It was a joint venture between the \nSpanish wind manufacturer Gestamp and an Ohio-based company called \nWorthington Industries. They formed a conglomerate called Gestamp \nWorthington Wind Steel. The companies announced they would build a \nfacility in Cheyenne, WY, and there would be 150 good-paying jobs \nattached to that facility. They planned to invest $40 million in the \nplant. But here is the twist: That project has now been put on hold. \nThose jobs and the millions in investment that were planned to be \ndirected into Wyoming have been shelved.\n  This isn't an isolated incident. There are wind manufacturing \nfacilities and wind projects across the country where we are seeing \nexactly the same thing happening, and the reason is clear: uncertainty \nover the future of the production tax credit. So our inaction in the\n\n[[Page S6400]]\n\nCongress is putting good-paying American jobs at risk and reducing \nopportunities for further investments in this growing industry. There \nis just no reason for it. The PTC has strong support from both sides of \nthe aisle and from both Houses of the Congress. Of course, a broad \narray of groups in the private sector support the wind energy industry.\n  Yesterday, a group of businesses from across the country wrote to \nleaders in the House and the Senate urging us to bring up and pass an \nextension of the PTC as soon as possible. Businesses such as Starbucks \nand Levi's joined a diverse group of companies, including Colorado's \nown Aspen Skiing Company and New Belgium Brewery, in urging us in the \nCongress to work across the divide, work across the aisle, and extend \nthe PTC. These companies understand how positive the production tax \ncredit and our wind industry has been for jobs, national security, and \nour clean energy economy. They made that case yesterday in their \nletter.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of this \nletter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Business for Innovative\n\n\n                                    Climate and Energy Policy,\n\n                                   Boston, MA, September 18, 2012.\n     Re: Production Tax Credit for Wind Energy.\n\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker of the House, U.S. House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     House Minority Leader, U.S. House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader \n     Pelosi, and Minority Leader McConnell: As major U.S. \n     employers and some of the largest non-utility purchasers of \n     renewable energy, we urge you to extend the Production Tax \n     Credit (PTC) for wind energy before the end of the 112th \n     Congress. A failure to pass an extension will amount to \n     levying a tax on companies committed to buying American \n     energy and growing the U.S. economy. In today's economic \n     climate, a tax hike on American businesses buying American \n     renewable energy is unwarranted.\n       In the past decade American businesses have significantly \n     ramped up their purchase of American wind energy. For \n     consumers of wind electricity, the economic benefits of the \n     PTC are tremendous. Electricity rates, which reflect marginal \n     costs for power plant operations and fuel prices, \n     consistently decrease when wind enters the market. Because \n     wind prices can be locked in up front, businesses \n     incorporating wind into their energy portfolios are better \n     equipped to hedge market volatility in traditional fuels \n     markets caused by supply shocks. We are concerned that \n     allowing the PTC to expire will immediately raise prices for \n     the renewable electricity we buy today.\n       The PTC has enabled the industry to slash wind energy \n     costs--90% since 1980--a big reason why companies like ours \n     are buying increasing amounts of renewable energy. Wind now \n     supplies over 3% of U.S. demand and accounts for 35% of new \n     power capacity installed in the last four years. In the seven \n     years that the PTC has been continuously in place, installed \n     wind capacity has grown sevenfold to nearly 47 Gigawatts \n     representing more than $79 billion in private investment.\n       As Congress investigates ways to spur business growth, we \n     urge you to ensure an extension of the PTC. Failure to extend \n     the PTC for wind would tax our companies and thousands of \n     others like us that purchase significant amounts of renewable \n     energy and hurt our bottom lines at a time when the economy \n     is struggling to recover. Extending the PTC lowers prices for \n     all consumers, keeps America competitive in a global \n     marketplace and creates homegrown American jobs.\n           Sincerely,\n         Akamai Technologies, Annie's, Inc., Aspen Skiing Company, \n           Ben & Jerry's, Clif Bar, Johnson & Johnson, Jones Lang \n           LaSalle, Levi Strauss & Co, New Belgium Brewing, The \n           North Face, Piney Bowes, Portland Trail Blazers, \n           Seventh Generation, Sprint, Starbucks, Stonyfield Farm, \n           Symantec, Timberland, Yahoo!\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, as I conclude I want to \nremind us that in August, before we adjourned for our month's State \nwork period, our Senate Finance Committee passed legislation that would \ninclude an extension of the production tax credit. I was encouraged to \nsee that the committee bridged the partisan divide to advance what is \nreally and truly a commonsense policy that will help our American \neconomy and our middle class.\n  We should build on what the Finance Committee did and take up and \npass this legislation as soon as possible. The longer we delay, the \nmore jobs we put at risk and the more our economic recovery is at risk.\n  It is very simple: The production tax credit equals jobs. We should \npass it as soon as possible. So, my colleagues, let's work together. \nLet's find a path forward, and let's pass this critical tax credit as \nsoon as possible.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I want to spend a few moments this \nmorning talking about the budget point of order. But a bigger topic is \nwe are going to have a vote at noon, and the question, in my mind, is: \nWill we at some point in the future recognize the hole we are in?\n  When I talk to individual Members they all agree we are in a hole, we \nhave a problem, and it is getting ready to bite this country in ways \nthat are unimaginable in terms of its impact on the everyday citizens \nof this country. Yet in the Senate we have done nothing to address the \nbigger problems facing the country.\n  Now we have a bill that has a budget point of order that is lying \nagainst it, and the question is: Will we continue the behavior that put \nour country in the problems we are in today or will we take a new \ntrack?\n  The desire to help veterans is a noble desire, but there are a lot of \npoints about this bill that the average American and the average \nveteran ought to be asking. There are also other questions, such as: \nWhat are the other things we are doing for jobs for veterans, and how \nwell are they working.\n  We have six veterans job training programs. We already have a \npreference across the Federal Government for hiring veterans. We have \nSBA programs like crazy. We have contracting programs 8a and 8b. We \nhave all these programs, but not one hearing has been held by the \ncommittee of jurisdiction oversight of the job training programs or the \nother programs we have to enhance the economic well-being of our \nveterans.\n  So what we have is a bill that is brought to the Senate floor that \nhas good intentions behind it but shows the absolute laziness of \nCongress in terms of digging things out.\n  When the GAO issued its duplication report on the job training \nprograms for veterans, four of them do exactly the same thing. None of \nthem has a metric. So we don't know if they are working, and we haven't \nheld a hearing to find out if they are working. But what are we doing? \nWe are proposing another jobs program for veterans without having done \nthe serious work of how we invest $1 billion.\n  Now, the other point that we should know is, we are spending $1 \nbillion a year right now on veterans job training programs. This bill \nhas $1 billion over 5. The second point I would like to make--and I \nthink it was made by the ranking member of the Budget Committee--is \nthere is no honest accounting in this bill regardless of the budget \npoint of order or the blue slip, the nonconstitutionality of \noriginating revenue bills in the Senate. There is absolutely no \ntransparency nor correctness nor character nor integrity in the \nfinancing of this bill. When we find ourselves $16 trillion in debt and \nwe are going to pay for another bill over 5 years by 10 years of \nchange, we never get out of the problem. We make the problem worse.\n\n  What are we doing and whom are we doing it for? Are we truly thinking \nabout veterans when we do not solve the bigger problems? We have the \nmanifest presence in this bill of the very problems we say we need to \nbe addressing. Yet we are making them worse with this bill. We are \nmaking the financial problems worse with this bill.\n  I am befuddled and disappointed that we cannot, as a group of \nindividuals who all love this country very much,\n\n[[Page S6401]]\n\ncome together on some certain baseline principles that we ought to be \noperating under in the Senate. The first of those ought to be we ought \nto do nothing now that makes the problem worse for our kids and \ngrandkids. We are now over $200,000 per family of debt in this country. \nWe are over $200,000--it is actually about $225,000. Think about the \nmedian family income over the last 4 years that has gone down 9 percent \nin this country, and we are going to make sure it goes down even \nfurther if we continue to do what we are doing in this bill. We have \ngone from $54,900 median family to $50,200 in the last 4 years, median \nfamily income, and we have gas prices as high as they have ever been \nand we are going to perpetuate a system that says we are going to \ncontinue to make the problem worse, not better.\n  There is also another little gimmick in this bill that if we were to \ndo it in private, we would go to jail for it; that is, we are going to \ncharge corporations more income tax than what they actually owe to get \npast 1 year, and then after the year is over, we are going to flip it \nback so we can say we paid for something when we did not. That violates \nall aspects of integrity and honesty. Do you know what the answer I \nhear as to why we are doing it? ``Oh, we have done that in the past.'' \nIt was not right in the past, and it is certainly not right now to lie, \nto cheat, to be dishonest about the accounting principles surrounding \nthis bill in terms of how we pay for it because, in essence, it \nviolates pay-go--the very rule we said was going to help us get out of \nour problems that 67 times has been waived in the last 3 years. As a \nmatter of fact, I don't know the last time a pay-go challenge was not \nwaived.\n  The second principle we ought to be dealing with is we ought to \nfollow the rules we set up for ourselves that are supposed to \ndiscipline us in terms of getting our country out of the problems which \nwe are, regrettably, continually ignoring. If, in fact, we want to help \nveterans get jobs, there are a lot of ways for us to do it. One is make \nsure the job programs we have are working--and they are not. If they \nare not working, why are we continuing to spend $1 billion a year on \nthem? No. 2, create a level of confidence in this country, by our own \nbehavior, that we are actually addressing the real problems in front of \nthe country rather than the political dynamics of an election that says \nwe want to do something and everybody in this Chamber knows, even if we \npass this bill, it is not going to accomplish anything because, in \nfact, it has a blue slip against it because of the Constitution.\n  On Monday mornings when I get up--I get up about 4:30 to catch a \nflight to come back here--I have noticed I have an attitude problem. I \ndon't want to come anymore. The reason I don't want to come anymore is \nbecause we are not doing anything to address the real problems that are \nin front of our country. We are ignoring the real problems so we can \ncreate political contrasts for an election, all the while the country \nis sinking and sinking and sinking.\n  What it is is a lack of leadership. We can lead in the wrong \ndirection, knowing what the problems are and making mistakes, and we \ncan be forgiven for that. But when we know what the real problems are \nand we are ignoring them, that is an unforgivable failure of \nleadership. That is where we find ourselves.\n  I heard my colleague mention the Defense authorization bill. There is \nabsolutely no excuse for us not to have passed a Defense authorization \nbill that gives the planning, the direction, and the commitment for \nthis country's future in terms of our defenses--the No. 1 priority for \nus as a Congress, according to the Constitution. Yet we have not done \nthat. We have made the immediate political situation trump everything. \nThat is the opposite of leadership. It is actually cowardice, because \nwhen someone is a leader and they duck the real problems in front of \nthem, they take everybody down with them--the well intentioned and the \nnot well intentioned. That is where we are--as a country, as a Senate--\nby not addressing the real issues of this country.\n  I don't know what is going to happen on the votes on this bill, but I \nknow what needs to happen in the Senate. There needs to be a renewed \nsense of awareness of the real problems facing this country and a \nredoubling of our commitment to shed partisan roles and get down to \nfixing the real problems in front of us. Parochialism has no place in \nthat discussion. The political careers of Members have no place in that \ndiscussion. The real future of our country is at risk and we are, \nsimilar to the proverbial person with their head in the sand, ignoring \nthat risk. The greatest country in the world is on the precipice of \nfalling, predicted long ago by such people as John Adams and Thomas \nJefferson--that the day would come that we, in fact, would put the \npolitical ahead of the best interests of our country. That is what we \nare seeing played out in Washington. That is exactly what we are seeing \nplayed out with this bill. The American people deserve much better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, before the Senator leaves, I would ask \nhim a question. And the reason I am asking Senator Coburn about this is \nbecause there is no one of these 100 Senators here today who has spent \nmore hours, effort and time in dealing with the duplicative programs of \nthe Federal Government than Senator Coburn. He has brought up these \nissues time and again.\n  I just ask, according to the GAO, in 2009, Senator Coburn, I \nunderstand that 9 Federal agencies spent $18 billion to administer 47 \njob training programs. The Senator has looked into that. I know I have \nheard him speak on that specifically. I was surprised the Senator \nbrought out that there are already six programs for veterans now, and \nthis would be a new one added to it.\n  What is the Senator's view of what a responsible Congress should do \nwhen we learn we are spending this much money on these programs with \ntheir own bureaucrats and so forth? Can we do better?\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely. Let me give people some hope. Virginia Foxx, \na Representative in the House, who is the chairman of the Subcommittee \non Workforce and Labor, has passed a bill out of her committee that \nconsolidates 33 of those job training programs into 1, puts metrics on \nevery one of them so we will know if they are working and requires \nmandatory oversight of them. The reason she did not do all 47 is 14 of \nthem are not in her jurisdiction.\n  But add to it another $4 billion, and another 20-plus programs for \nthe disabled, so we actually have almost 70 programs and $23 billion a \nyear we are spending on job training, of which nobody knows--as a \nmatter of fact I know they are not working.\n  We actually released a report on job training in Oklahoma. We looked \nat every Federal job training and State job training program going on \nin Oklahoma. Do you know what works? Oklahoma programs. Do you know \nwhat does not work? Federal job training programs in Oklahoma.\n  We have 1 city in Oklahoma that is 16,000 people, 17 Federal job \ntraining centers, and an unemployment rate of 4.7 percent; 17 different \nFederal agencies in 1 city of 16,000 people with an unemployment rate \nof 4.7 percent. What we are doing is employing people in the job \ntraining industry--which may be good if they are having results. But we \nhave results that are untenable.\n  Job training is just one area of our Federal Government. The GAO has \nreleased reports on duplication. Their final report will come in \nFebruary of next year, where they will have looked at the entire \nFederal Government. What we know right now is if we did our work, the \n100 Senators who care about our country did our work, over the next 10 \nyears we could save $200 billion by eliminating duplication in Federal \nprograms--$200 billion. I said over 10 years; that is, $200 billion per \nyear. It is $2 trillion over 10 years. We could save over $200 billion \nper year.\n  We wouldn't be having sequestration if we did our job, if we did our \noversight, if we consolidated programs, made them transparent and made \nthem accountable and then put metrics on them to see if they were \nworking and then did oversight to see that they are working. We would \nnot be in sequestration. We would not have near the problems we have \ntoday. But the failure is us. The Congress has failed to do its job.\n  The consequences will not be borne by us. The consequences will be \nborne by the son of my health LA who was just born, by my new grandson \nwho is\n\n[[Page S6402]]\n\nnow almost 7 weeks old. That is who is going to pay the consequences--\nthe children of this country--when we fail to do our jobs.\n  I appreciate the Senator's leadership. I am going to support his \npoint of order. It is the right thing to do. I did not even talk about \nthe areas he talked about in terms of--we set up this budget agreement \nfor 2 years. I will tell you what, the CR coming--this is the irony of \nall ironies. Had we not had that budget agreement and we did a CR, we \nwould spend $2.6 billion less next year if we had a clean CR than under \nthe Budget Control Act we passed. By doing the Budget Control Act, we \nare actually going to spend more money than we did last year.\n\n  So everything is upside down in Washington because everything is \npolitical or parochial and nobody is thinking long term about the big \nproblems facing our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. He \nserved on the debt commission. He is steeped in the challenges facing \nour country and he is working hard to fix our problems.\n  I salute Senator Burr for coming forward with a proposal that helps \nveterans while abiding by the rules set forth in the Budget Act. \nRegretfully, I think we will end this matter today, the legislation \nthat is coming forward, through the budget point of order.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, the Senator from Alabama \nknows the personal friendship we have and my high regard for him and \nthe privilege I have had working with him over the years. It has been a \nworking relationship.\n  Regardless of what one feels about a budget and a budget point of \norder, we are talking about a technicality to kill a bill to help \nunemployed veterans at a time they desperately need help because they \nare coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan and they can't find work. \nUntil we come out of the recession--and the recovery is under way, but \nveterans have a higher percentage of unemployment and especially \nveterans under age 24 have an even higher percentage of unemployment. \nSo what we have is a piece of legislation to give an employment cushion \nfor veterans for at least a year, until they can find employment in the \nprivate sector.\n  This is employment to do things we need, since so many of our \nnational resources, such as parks and emergency responders and \nfirefighters and police, need help. Look at all of the deterioration in \nthe national parks. This would be an opportunity to employ those \nveterans and to employ them up to a year. Everybody knows this makes \ncommon sense and it is the right thing to do.\n  What is happening is the folks on that side of the aisle, because we \nare in an election year and because this happened to be a proposal \ncoming out of the White House and is brought to the floor by this \nSenator from Florida, are not going to support it, and they are going \nto kill it on a technicality by denying us 60 votes in order to waive \nthe budgetary point of order. That is the bottom line. That is what is \ngoing on here, and it is sad. Yet that is what is happening.\n  Look at the votes in the last week. We passed the motion for cloture \non the motion to proceed by 95 to 1. Doesn't that tell us something? \nThen we had the second procedural vote which was 84 to 8. All we need \nis 60 votes to get over this hurdle and to get to the bill and then \nprobably pass it by unanimous consent because everybody agrees with the \nsubstance of the bill. It is clear that commonsense legislation that \nhas bipartisan support is getting thwarted in this Chamber. We all know \nhow important it is to help our veterans find work as they return home.\n  Does the Senator from Oklahoma want to ask a question? The Senator \nfrom Oklahoma knows my respect for him and my personal friendship for \nhim. I admire the Senator for the courageous stance he takes. But I \nhope the Senator from Oklahoma understands--and I respectfully say \nthat--for a need so great as unemployed veterans, this is not the time \nto draw a technical line on a budget. I would earnestly and \nrespectfully request of my friend that this be one of the \nconsiderations he would make.\n  Does the Senator wish to engage in any conversation? If not, I will \ncomplete my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I would ask to have a back-and-forth \nreal debate on this, recognizing us both, with the Senator from Florida \ncontrolling the time, if he has no difficulty agreeing with that.\n  One of the reasons I came out is I don't agree with the substance of \nthis bill and I don't want the Senator from Florida to make a statement \non the floor that everybody agrees with it. We have six veterans job \ntraining programs that nobody is overseeing. Nobody knows if they work.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. OK. Then what I would suggest to my friend--\nand he knows he is my friend--if we have a difference of opinion, I \nrespect that, and I would like him to share that. I wish to complete my \nvery brief statement and then the Senator from Oklahoma may make \nwhatever statement he wishes to make.\n  The unemployment rate among veterans returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan is hovering around 11 percent, and for those unemployed \nveterans age 24 and less it is even higher. We have taken steps to \ncombat this problem. This past summer we passed legislation that will \nhelp veterans get Federal occupational licenses when their military \ntraining matches civilian requirements. That made sense. That made \ncommon sense. As a matter of fact, we got that through the Senate \nunanimously and it was signed into law. The bill recognized that a \nveteran gets all of this specialized training and they ought to be able \nto utilize that training without having to go through all the \nretraining and the relicensing. We could do that--and what we passed is \nnow law--we could do that in Federal employment where there is a \nsimilar kind of requirement.\n  What is in this bill is to do that for the State occupational \nrequirements; to take a veteran who has a military discipline--a \nspecialty--as that veteran is applying for a private sector job that \nhappens to be covered by State law on the occupational requirements and \nrequirements of licensing, that it is a consideration, instead of the \nveteran having to go through all of that again. That makes common \nsense.\n\n  That particular idea was offered by the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. \nPryor, and it is a part of the bill. Also, Senator Murray, who is here \non the floor and who is the chairman of the committee, reached out and \nincorporated a number--and she can address that--of the different \nbipartisan ideas and not just my idea, which is the one I was talking \nabout wherein veterans can have employment up to a year--but so many \nothers that are incorporated into the bill that came out of committee.\n  So we already did something about matching civilian requirements, \nalbeit what was signed into law was just with regard to Federal \nemployment.\n  Also, last year we passed a bill that granted tax benefits to \ncompanies that hire wounded warriors. Of course, we know what \ninspiration all the rest of us take from the wounded warriors. The \nSenator from Oklahoma and I from time to time go to Bethesda to what \nused to be called Bethesda Naval and now is the combined, all-military \nservices Walter Reed. For every one of us who goes out there and \nsuddenly sees these veterans coming in who are on these new kinds of \ncomputer-controlled prostheses where they can actually walk and run, \neven when their leg has been blown off above the knee, it pulls at our \nhearts and yet we are so glad that technology has moved forward. But \nthose same ladies and gentlemen need jobs. Until the recovery is \ncomplete, they are having difficulty. That is why I filed this bill. \nThe chairman of the committee and the ranking member have done their \nbest to work across the aisle.\n  Veterans don't care to hear about why we can't help them. They don't \ncare to hear about technicalities of a budget point of order. They want \nour country to support them in the way they have supported us, and that \nis an obligation. A lot of us in this Chamber have served in the \nmilitary. I think it is engrained in every Senator here that we have an \nobligation to those who have served this country.\n  This effort here today that we are going to vote on in 20 minutes has\n\n[[Page S6403]]\n\nbroad support from veterans and police organizations. The Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, the Military Officers Association of America, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, and the American Legion \nall support it. The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America have \ncalled and pleaded for its immediate passage. They know why: Because of \ntheir veterans' need to know that Congress has their back.\n  So I would make a plea to the Senate. We just need a few votes from \nthat side of the aisle to get to the threshold of 60 to waive the \ntechnicality of the budget point of order.\n  I look forward to the comments of my friend, the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Madam President, since the time is controlled over here, I reserve \nthe final 7 minutes for the chairman of the committee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, my colleague from Florida raises some \ngood points about us wanting to help our veterans. I don't think there \nis anybody who does not recognize their significant sacrifice. As a \nmatter of fact, it was not long ago that the 45th from Oklahoma lost 17 \npeople in Afghanistan and hundreds were wounded.\n  The real question is: how do we help them the best? How do we really \nhelp veterans? We are going to have plenty of opportunities to say \nthere is a reason to not do the right thing for the long-term best \ninterests of our country.\n  We have never found ourselves in the predicament we find ourselves in \ntoday in terms of our financial exposure and the real risk to the \nveterans who have jobs today--which nobody is talking about but the \nreal risk for them. Because when this thing goes down--and I am talking \nabout the financial collapse of this country--when it happens, those \nwho have jobs who are veterans today are going to lose them. So there \ncould be no more noble cause than to make an exception for veterans, \nexcept that is not what the Senate does. We make an exception every \ntime--every time.\n  Here is the question for my friend: Under what system of values, \nhonor, and integrity did these veterans serve? The highest and noblest \nof honor and integrity, without a doubt.\n\n  They put their life on the line so I do not have to, so my adult, \nmature children in their thirties and forties do not have to. The \ndifference is, what they put their life on the line for was to ensure \nthat the freedom and liberty and vibrancy of this country goes forward. \nWe are taking a little pocketknife to one of the legs of the three-\nlegged stool with our actions and slowly nibbling the support of that \nleg. We are taking it away by our very actions.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I would like to respond to my \nfriend.\n  Mr. COBURN. If I could finish. Since the other side has the last 7 \nminutes, I will be finished well before then.\n  We are going to say the financial condition of the country does not \nmatter. We are going to say it does not matter the $1 billion a year we \nare spending already on veterans job training programs. It does not \nmatter. We are going to say here is a year's program for jobs for \n20,000 veterans and that is going to trump everything else.\n  You would not have any objection from this Senator if you actually \nreally paid for this, No. 1, if you did not violate pay-go and you \ntruly did it in a way that oversighted the present job training \nprograms we have and you truly did it in a way that matches the \nintegrity and honor of our veterans. But we did not do that. No. We \nplayed games. We played games with budget rules. We played games with \npay-go. We did not do any oversight. We did not even have a hearing. \nThere was no hearing on this bill.\n  You took Senator Burr's suggestions, which were common sense, and \napplied it broadly across the government. But we did not match the \nhonor and integrity and valor and purpose. When I meet with veterans in \ntownhall meetings, I ask them why they serve. Do you know what they \ntell me? Because this is the greatest country the world has ever known \nand they want to keep it that way.\n  What we are doing today does not keep it that way. It perpetuates the \nsame problems that created the very dangerous situation this country is \nin.\n  So when we make a claim about that everybody agrees with this bill, I \njust wish to say I do not agree with the bill. There are a whole lot of \nways to help veterans that are better than this, that give them a \npermanent job. We passed the post-9/11 GI bill; right? They can get \npaid a stipend while they go to college to learn a new skill, the same \nas a noncom officer. They get paid for the books and tuition and \neverything else so they can become whole as they learn a skill. We have \nthe capability for studies while we are in the military. We have six \nseparate job training programs that we are spending $1 billion a year \non.\n  The best way to help veterans is to fix this country's economic \nsituation to create opportunity, and they will fly because they have \nalready proven they have the initiative, the strength, the moral \ncourage, the integrity, and the valor to accomplish anything they want \nto accomplish.\n  So I am in disagreement with my friend. I think we have a political \ndevice in front of us, and I am going to be very interested to see the \ncharacter of the Senate on whether it succumbs to the parochial and \npolitical over the best long-term interests of the country. If it does, \nit just proves that the Senate needs to be changed to truly address the \nreal problems in front of our country. That is what it is going to \nprove, regardless of the outcome: Do we have the character? Do we match \nthe valor, honor, and integrity of the people who serve this Nation in \nthe Armed Forces with our willingness to sacrifice our political \ncareers to do what is in the best long-term interest of the country?\n  They set the example for us. The question is whether we will follow \ntheir example.\n  I yield to my friend from Florida.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, before the chairman of the \ncommittee uses the time reserved for her, I wish to respond to my \nfriend from Oklahoma--and he is my friend--by telling him why I think \nhe is wrong on this issue and telling him by way of a compliment to him \nbecause the Senator from Oklahoma and I, the Senator from Florida, had \nworked together, he being much more prominent in the efforts, to bring \nthe budget under control 1 year ago.\n  In having discussions across the aisle--often private discussions--\nwhat started as a rump group known as the Gang of 6 that grew and \nblossomed into what, in effect, became a group of 45--and I think that \nwas the number of us who stood in the Senate Press Gallery in the \nsummer 1 year ago; it was the summer of 2011--and we said we wanted a \nbig $4 trillion-plus budget deficit, and we pointed out ways we could \nget there.\n  Indeed, what this Senator has said--and I have heard other Republican \nSenators who feel and have said very close to identical things \npublicly; and I will name one and that is Senator Lindsey Graham and he \nstated it on ``Meet the Press'' a couple months ago--that the way we \nget there is producing revenue through reform of the Tax Code by going \nafter all the tax preferences which have ballooned out of control since \nthe last tax reform bill in 1986, that this Senator, then a young \nCongressman, voted for, to the point that tax expenditures, tax \npreferences are now $14 trillion over 10 years. A lot of them have \noutlived their usefulness. For a lot of them, their special interests \nor sponsors would tell us: We would not want that if we could have a \ncertainty of a lower rate.\n  Therefore, we have said many times on this floor and in public \nstatements, we can take tax preferences, restrain them, and use that \nrevenue to do two things: lower everybody's tax rates, including \ncorporate, streamline the Tax Code by getting all this underbrush of \npreferences out of the way, and then use the rest of the revenue to \nlower the deficit.\n  I suspect the Senator and I feel very similar about that issue. So \nwhen he talks about reforming the spending process, the fiscal process \nwhich includes the revenue process of this country, then I think we \nhave grounds for significant agreement, and I would hope we are going \nto address that in the lameduck session that starts.\n\n[[Page S6404]]\n\n  My plea is that we do not take it out, in this particular case, on \nsomething that can be done immediately for veterans in need returning \nhome from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Of course.\n  Mr. COBURN. Through the Chair, I would ask the Senator, how did he \nvote on the tax extender package coming out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee? Because that is the real test of whether the Senator wants \nto reform the Tax Code. As I recall, the Senator voted for it and I \nvoted against it. There is a very big difference.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would remind all the Senators, we are \nhere on the floor on a very important bill on the Veterans Jobs Corps, \nand I wish to thank my colleague from Florida, Senator Bill Nelson, for \nhis tremendous leadership and passion on the issue of making sure our \nveterans get back to work, at a time when they have a 20-percent-plus \nunemployment rate, and for his work on this bill as we move to this \npoint.\n  I have been listening to the debate on this bill, and what I have \nheard are some pretty weak arguments against the merits of this \nlegislation. I have heard we have not held hearings on the employment \nor on the provisions of this legislation.\n  The Senators who spoke may not have known--they are not on our \ncommittee--but, indeed, we have had hearings on employment both last \nyear and this year and on this bill. Veterans groups and the VA at \nmultiple hearings, in fact, have had multiple opportunities to give \ntheir views. The COPS and SAFER Grant Programs in this bill have been \naround for years, and we know they work.\n  On the point I heard reiterated here, that the bill was not paid for, \nviolated pay-go, as all bills that come before the Senate, this bill is \nfully paid for. It does not violate pay-go rules.\n  We are going to have a vote shortly on a point of order on this bill. \nA vote to support the point of order, plain and simple, says we spend \nenough now on our veterans.\n  That is what it says: We spend enough on our veterans. A vote to \nsupport this point of order says that despite the fact that we have \npaid for this bill, despite the fact that one in four of our young \nveterans is out of work, despite the fact that veteran suicides are \noutpacing combat deaths, and despite the fact that more and more \nveterans are coming home today, we are not going to invest in those \nchallenges. It says we have done enough.\n  This point of order puts a price on what we as a country are willing \nto provide our veterans and says we are not going to do a penny more. \nIt is a point of order that not only will kill our ability, I will tell \nmy colleagues, to pass this bill, but it will also affect every effort \nwe make to improve the lives of our veterans going forward.\n  In fact, just last week we held a markup in the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee. We passed a slew of bills in a bipartisan fashion. Those \nwere very important bills to improve mental health access, to give \nstudents new tools so they can maximize their GI benefit, and, \nimportantly, it would give veterans who have lost their ability to \nstart a family access to fertility services. All those bills, under \nthis, would be subject to a point of order, as would, of course, \ncountless other bills introduced by Senators on both sides of the \naisle. There is no end in sight, I would tell everyone, for how long \nthis point of order could be raised.\n  We have to consider, as we vote, the lasting effect of this vote that \nwe are about to take. We should all consider the fact that veterans are \nwatching this vote very closely.\n  (Mr. FRANKEN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. President, this is a bill that has been endorsed by the American \nLegion and by the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. They know, \nas I do, neither party has a magic bullet for this problem of \nemployment, and we should be taking good ideas from both sides of the \naisle, which is exactly what we have done with this bill that is before \nus. This bill includes 12 different provisions to help create veterans \njobs. Eight of them are ideas that have come from Republicans. In fact, \nto make this bill even more inclusive and more bipartisan, we took \nSenator Burr's entire alternative bill and added it to our bill.\n  At every turn we have sought compromise. But instead of meeting us \nhalfway, we have been met with resistance. Instead of saying yes to \nnearly 1 million unemployed veterans, it seems that some on the other \nside of the aisle have spent the last week and a half seeking any way \nto say no.\n  It does not have to end this way for our unemployed veterans. We can \njoin together and pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, as you have heard me say, our veterans don't ask for a \nlot. My own father never talked about his service. The veterans whom I \nmeet across the country do not want to be seen as dependent on \ngovernment. But we owe them more than a pat on the back, sending them \nout to the world when they come home. We owe them more than bumper \nstickers and platitudes. We owe them more than procedural roadblocks, \nwhich is what we will vote on shortly, that will impede our ability to \nprovide them not only help now but into the future.\n  We owe them action. We owe them real investments that will help them \nget back to work, and that is what this legislation does. It does so \nbecause putting our servicemembers back to work is a cost of war. \nPutting our veterans back to work is a cost of war, just like their \nhealth care and benefits. It is part of what we owe the less than 1 \npercent of men and women who sacrificed for the 99 percent who did not.\n  It is no secret that this is not the easiest time of year to get a \nbill passed.\n  It is too easy to point to the calendar here and level accusations \nabout politics against one another. But in my two decades working on \nveterans issues here in the Senate, I have seen veterans issues rise \nabove politics time and again, even when it seemed our backs were \nagainst the wall. I have seen Democrats and Republicans come together, \nand they have done so because there is one group of Americans who do \nnot care about the calendar or how many days we are out from an \nelection; that is, our unemployed veterans. What they care about is \nfinding work in their communities, finding work that gives them the \nself-esteem they need today, and finding work that helps them provide \nfor their loved ones. We can do that today.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with us in waiving this point of order, \nto join with us in telling our veterans we are not done investing in \ntheir care and benefits, not by a long shot. Join with us in moving \nforward with a bill that is paid for, that will not add to our deficit, \nand that should not be killed by procedural games. Join with us in \nputting veterans above political obstructionism and back to work.\n  I yield the floor and yield back any time that remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 3 months ago the United States Senate came \ntogether and passed a full 5-year farm bill. We did not kick the can \ndown the road. We passed a bill, working together, that provides the \ncertainty America's farmers and ranchers need to continue supporting \nrural jobs and putting food on our tables. So there is absolutely no \nexcuse for Congress to adjourn without sending this bill to the \nPresident's desk to be signed into law. Still, because the House \nrefuses to even bring this bill up for a vote, it looks as though that \nis exactly what is going to happen. It is shameful.\n  Passing the bill in the Senate was not easy; everyone had to make a \ncompromise. But the farm bill touches on the lives of millions of \nAmericans in every single State. It is too important not to act.\n  The Senate's farm bill is true reform. We cut the deficit by more \nthan $23 billion over 10 years. We streamlined programs to make them \nmore efficient. We went back to the drawing board on commodity programs \nand created a true safety net--one that works for America's farmers as \nwell as for the taxpayers--again, cutting the farm program by $23 \nbillion.\n  The House Agriculture Committee pushed out a bipartisan farm bill as \nwell. I give the House Agriculture Committee a lot of credit. It is no \nsecret that there are differences, but even to begin working out those \ndifferences the House needs to catch up, because despite having a \nbipartisan farm bill that passed the House Agriculture Committee, the \nHouse leadership is refusing to take it up.\n  This isn't my first farm bill. I can tell my colleagues from personal \nexperience that this action in the House body is unprecedented. House \nleadership has never blocked a farm bill that\n\n[[Page S6406]]\n\nhas been reported out of the House Agriculture Committee.\n  On September 30, our farm safety net programs expire and the farm \nprogram expires--just 11 days from now. This is our last chance to give \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers the certainty they deserve.\n  This is also an opportunity to provide much-needed disaster \nassistance. Not long after we passed the farm bill in the Senate, a \ndrought began to stretch across the United States. It was on the news \nvirtually every night and has been for months. Wheat and cornfields \nhave been drying up. Without enough forage, ranchers had to face the \ndecision to either sell their herds or purchase extra feed, cutting \ninto their very thin margins.\n  As of this week, more than 2,000 counties have been designated as \ndrought disaster areas by USDA, and 36 of them are in Montana. That is \nwell over half of our State in a disaster.\n  There is a consensus in Congress and across the countryside that \nsomething must be done, and the farm bill is that something. We had a \nbipartisan vote here in the Senate by a large margin and, as I \nmentioned, a bipartisan vote in the House Agriculture Committee.\n  We have so many reasons to be grateful for the hard work of America's \nfarmers and ranchers. They help sustain healthy rural economies. And \nbecause of the strength of America's agriculture, they put food on \ntables around the world. In 2011, agricultural exports reached $137 \nbillion, with a record surplus of more than $42 billion.\n\n  Agriculture supports 16 million jobs nationwide. In Montana, one in \nfive jobs is tied to agriculture. The farm bill is our jobs bill.\n  Last week many Montana farmers and ranchers came to town to talk \nabout the farm bill. They each told me and other Senators and House \nMembers the same thing: We need a farm bill, and we need it now.\n  Three of those Montanans were Bing Von Bergen from Moccasin, Ryan \nMcCormick from Kremlin, and Charlie Bumgarner from Great Falls. Bing, \nRyan, and Charlie, similar to many Montana farmers, plan to go into the \nfield next month to plant their winter wheat. They will be doing so \nwith the current farm bill expired. They will be doing so with no \ncertainty of what the farm programs will be--that certainty which \ncommunity bankers happen to rely on to advance loans so farmers can \nplant.\n  They do not want to see the farm programs expire. They do not want \nshort-term extensions. They need the certainty of a full 5-year farm \nbill.\n  I urge the House to listen to what farmers and ranchers across the \ncountry are saying: The time to pass the farm bill is now.\n  Holding up a farm bill with wide bipartisan support is playing \npolitics with the livelihood of our hard-working rural constituents. \nInstead, let's do our job so farmers can do theirs. Let us answer their \ncalls and pass a 5-year farm bill now.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Russ Sullivan\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to tell you about a \ndedicated public servant and his son--Russ Sullivan and Alhaji Amadu \nHassann, or AJ, as he was known by his family and friends.\n  AJ died on July 28 of this year. But in his short life, he inspired \npeople through his exuberance for life, his courage, and his \ndetermination. Born in Sierra Leone, west Africa, in 1992 during the \nmidst of a brutal civil war, violence served as the backdrop to AJ's \nearly childhood in Freetown, Sierra Leone.\n  As a young boy, AJ, his mother, and two sisters were forced to flee \ntheir war-ravaged country to Guinea, where they found safety in a \nrefugee camp. However, life in the refugee camp was difficult. There \nwas no work for the adults, no formal schools for the children, and \nlittle hope for a better life. Unable to return to their homeland, \ntheir lives were put on hold for 8 years as refugees.\n  But AJ remained hopeful for a brighter future. That day came in 2002, \nwhen their father, who was living in the United States, was able to \nbring AJ and his sisters to America.\n  The children--15-year-old Ousmatta, 11-year-old AJ, and 9-year-old \nLaretta--moved in with their father in Virginia. However, their father \nhad struggled in America. Similar to many who do not have steady work, \nhe did not have health insurance. So when AJ's father got a tooth \ninfection, he ignored it. Left untreated, the infection spread \nthroughout his entire body and AJ's father died.\n  An aunt tried to raise the three children on her own but had \ndifficulty making ends meet. The children were split up. A cousin took \nin Laretta, Ousmatta stayed with their aunt, and AJ was taken in by a \nman named Russ Sullivan.\n  Russ has long been serving as a foster parent in the community. He \nhas mentored dozens of young men, becoming the legal guardian of some \nand helping hundreds see a different course for their life. Russ took \nin AJ. Then Russ took on additional responsibilities of becoming AJ's \nlegal guardian.\n  So who is this man Russ Sullivan? Russ Sullivan is the staff director \nof the Senate Committee on Finance. He is known in the Senate--as \nSenator Harry Reid has said--as ``a problem solver.'' Russ has \ndeveloped a reputation for leadership, dedication, and respect for his \ncolleagues. His staff admires him, his colleagues trust him and admire \nhim, and I am honored to call him a friend. Nobody who has met and \nworked with Russ Sullivan has a different point of view. I have never \nheard anyone utter a criticism of Russ Sullivan, and no one ever will; \nhe is that kind of man.\n  Philosopher Thomas Carlyle once said: ``The work an unknown good man \nhas done is like a vein of water flowing hidden underground, secretly \nmaking the ground green.''\n  That is Russ. His name is not in lights. People do not know about \nhim. He is working to solve problems and make the ground green.\n  Under Russ's nurturing care, AJ began to adjust to his new life in \nAmerica. AJ had boundless energy and loved to play soccer. He was fun \nto be around, had a great sense of humor, made friends easily, and \nloved to flirt with the girls.\n  AJ completed high school but had no intention of going to college. \nThat was until Russ came into his life. In April 2011, AJ told a \nnewspaper reporter that his life changed after meeting Russ. This is \nAJ:\n\n       I was just going to do what everybody else was doing--drop \n     out and get a job. But after I met Russ, everything changed \n     about my mentality toward life. He started pushing me and \n     getting me to think harder. . . . He's a great man, and I \n     thank God I met him. . . .\n\n  AJ first enrolled at Salem International University and after 1 year \ntransferred to the University of West Virginia. He majored in sports \nmanagement and loved being a ``Mountaineer.''\n  Then tragedy struck. In a senseless act of violence, AJ was assaulted \nin front of a local college hangout. He fell, hit his head hard--back, \nhead snapped--and over the next few hours slipped into a coma.\n  On Capitol Hill we were in the middle of deficit reduction \nnegotiations. When Russ received the news about AJ, he rushed from \nWashington to West Virginia, where he stayed at AJ's side.\n  Over the next month, Russ was traveling back and forth--back and \nforth--from West Virginia to Washington. This is during the \nsupercommittee talks. Russ was juggling not only his career but also \nAJ's medical treatment. He was also forecasting what we could do. He \nwas fostering several other boys--this is not the only boy Russ was a \nfoster father for--and Russ kept working with the extended family and \nfriends in the loop. He kept working with them and telling them and \nkeeping them informed about AJ's condition.\n  I often hear the media reports about Capitol Hill \nbeing dysfunctional--the sides are polarized and compromise is a dirty \nword. But when Chris Campbell, the Republican Senate Finance staff \ndirector, heard the news about AJ's injury, he enlisted his staff and \nthe Republicans stepped up to help. They took Wednesdays.\n\n  For the next couple months, Russ's boys--18 in total when they are \nall home from college; imagine, Russ Sullivan is the foster father for \n18 different young men--knew that Wednesday night was pizza night, \ncoming from the pockets of the Republican Finance Committee staff. \n``Wednesdays'' was that night.\n  AJ was moved from the West Virginia hospital to Children's Hospital \nand Rehabilitation Center in Washington, DC, where he remained for the\n\n[[Page S6407]]\n\nnext several months until his death in July.\n  We mourn for the loss of this young man--who brought an incredible \nlight to this world and light to Russ's world and to all who met him. \nHe brought such a light in such a short period of time.\n  We are fortunate to have Russ working on Capitol Hill. Russ \nepitomizes public service. He is honest. He is direct, upbeat, \npositive, looking for solutions, cutting through all the redtape. He \nalways seeks to understand the arguments and keeps searching for the \ncommon ground--constantly. Senator Reid keeps asking me: Can Russ help \nhere? What can Russ do about this, in trying to reach out to the other \nside to find an agreement. He has always been someone I respect and \ntrust. He is also someone I have come to admire.\n  Months have passed since AJ's death, but his zest for life remains in \nthe hearts of those closest to him. Russ continues mentoring and \nhelping others, changing lives one after another.\n  Just last week, Russ witnessed a victory for another one of his boys. \nThe boy had been wrongfully convicted of a crime and was facing \ndeportation. But because of Russ's continued diligence and commitment, \nhis innocence was proven and the conviction was overturned. That was \njust a few days ago.\n  Harvard Professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter once said: ``A vision is not \njust a picture of what could be; it is an appeal to our better selves, \na call to become something more.''\n  Russ sees the vision of what could be and rolls up his sleeves to \nmake it happen.\n  I know I speak for all of us on the Senate Finance Committee--and \nmany of us in this body as a whole--when I say: Thank you, Russ. Thank \nyou for making us want to find our better selves, thank you for working \nto make the future better, and thank you for all you do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am personally very grateful for the \nwonderful remarks of my colleague, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, because I do not think any words could express how much Russ \nmeans to all of us. He is a wonderful man. He is a wonderful leader on \nthe committee. He is honest. He is straightforward. He works with you. \nFrankly, we all think the world of him on our side as well. I just wish \nto compliment the distinguished chairman for his beautiful remarks \nabout a tremendous person and the foster children he has worked with.\n  Russ is the epitome of greatness on the Senate Finance Committee and \nas a staff member of the Senate. So I wish to personally pay tribute to \nhim and express my sorrow over the loss of his son AJ and express my \nlove and affection for him. He is a good man, helping a good chairman. \nWe work together very closely, and I have a lot of regard for what the \nchairman just said and a lot of regard for Russ and wish him the best.\n  I hope the Good Lord will comfort him and comfort his soul during \nthis very trying time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to the Senator, thank you very much. I know Russ \ndeeply appreciates that, and we all do. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                Unanimous Consent Request--S.J. Res. 50\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on July 12, 2012, the Obama \nadministration's Department of Health and Human Services issued an \nInformation Memorandum informing States that for the first time in the \n16-year history of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program, \nHHS would permit them to waive welfare work requirements.\n  This action undermines a robust work-first approach that was one of \nthe key features of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act.\n  If allowed to stand, this action could result in activities such as \njournaling, bed rest, and smoking cessation classes being counted as \nwork for the purposes of meeting Federal welfare work performance \nstandards.\n  This change in policy presents a serious substantive question. Should \ntaxpayer dollars go to welfare recipients who are not working but are \ninstead journaling or working to quit smoking?\n  But it presents serious institutional questions as well because the \naction by the Obama administration was, quite simply, a unilateral \npower grab that usurps the constitutional power of the legislative \nbranch, and every Member of this body ought to be concerned about it. \nThat is no small thing.\n  Our Constitution, for good reason, locates the lawmaking power in the \nCongress. That is because our Founding Fathers understood that in a \nrepublic of laws, the lawmakers must represent the people directly. The \npeople must have a close hold on the representatives who create the \nlaws under which we live.\n  If changes are going to be made to the welfare work requirements, it \nshould be up to the Congress to make them. Faceless bureaucrats at HHS \nshould not be the ones making changes to the welfare work requirements. \nYet that is exactly what happened here.\n  Unelected bureaucrats at HHS are attempting to change the law--a law \npassed by the Senate and the whole Congress. If left unchecked, welfare \npolicy is being substantially changed by the Obama administration in a \nway that never would have been acceptable to the people's elected \nrepresentatives in Congress.\n  No administration should be permitted to disregard the laws Congress \npassed and simply make up their own rules.\n  For 16 years, no President, Health and Human Services Secretary or \nGovernor--regardless of political party--believed welfare work \nrequirements could be waived.\n  If the Obama administration believes welfare work requirements should \nbe changed, they should submit a legislative proposal to Congress.\n  In the 3\\1/2\\ years before the July 12 information memorandum, the \nObama administration never offered a legislative proposal to change the \nwelfare work requirements.\n  The unprecedented nature of the Obama administration's power grab is \nsupported by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office.\n  On September 4, 2012, the GAO responded to an inquiry from Ways and \nMeans chairman Dave Camp and me.\n  They determined that the July 12 information memorandum was a rule \nthat should have been submitted to Congress. GAO further found that as \na rule, the information memorandum was subject to the Congressional \nReview Act. The Congressional Review Act provides Congress with an \nopportunity to review and, where appropriate, disapprove rules issued \nby the executive branch.\n  When more and more of the rules that govern the American people are \nbeing made by anonymous and unelected bureaucrats with no \nresponsibility to reflect the priorities of the American people, the \nCongressional Review Act is a critical device and one we should always \nuphold. It allows the people's representatives in Congress to stand up \nand reject a rule emanating from the Federal bureaucracy.\n  The Committee on Ways and Means favorably reported the resolution of \ndisapproval last week. The full House of Representatives will consider \nthe resolution of disapproval this week. I have introduced S.J. Res. \n50, a resolution of disapproval here in the Senate. I am pleased that \nmy legislation is cosponsored by 21 of my colleagues.\n  The Congressional Review Act also provides for fast-track \nconsideration of a resolution of disapproval when a Senator has secured \nat least 30 Senators on a discharge petition. That means no filibuster. \nI am pleased to report that I have well over 30 signatures on the \ndischarge petition. Unfortunately, this expedited process does not kick \nin until later this month.\n  The Senate will be voting on my resolution, there is no question \nabout that. The only question is when. In my view, we should take up \nthis matter now. It is a critical issue for the American people, and it \nis a critical issue for this institution. As the people's \nrepresentatives, it is a dereliction of duty to stand by while \nunelected officials attempt to change the law unilaterally without the \nconstitutionally-prescribed input of the people's representatives in \nCongress. For that reason, in a few moments I will propound a unanimous \nconsent request for debate, followed by a vote on proceeding to the \nresolution of disapproval. It is a simple request. A vote on the \nresolution of disapproval is inevitable. The only question is whether \nthe majority will allow a vote in a timely manner.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Finance be \ndischarged from further consideration of\n\n[[Page S6408]]\n\nS.J. Res. 50, a joint resolution disapproving a rule submitted by HHS \nregarding welfare waivers; that there be 2 hours of debate on the \nmotion to proceed equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees; and that the Senate then proceed to a vote \non the adoption of the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I reserve the right to object. Under my \nreservation, let me first thank my colleague from Utah for bringing \nthis matter before us. But, like him, I was in the Congress in the late \nnineties when we passed the TANF law. I remember being part of welfare \nreform. Prior to that time, we had what is known as AFDC, aid for \ndependent children, which was an entitlement program that offered the \nStates the opportunity to move forward without risk because they were \nguaranteed a certain amount of money for every child who was eligible--\nfor every family who was eligible for welfare funds. We changed that to \nprovide for temporary assistance for needy families, TANF.\n  I remember very clearly working with the States and working with my \ndistinguished colleague, and what we told the States was this: You are \ngoing to get a block grant. That means you are going to be bottom-line \nresponsible for the program, that there will no longer be a guarantee \non the number of families who are enrolled in welfare as to dollars you \nare going to receive.\n  We promised two things: We told the States we were going to give them \nthe tools they needed to get the job done. We provided the funds so \nthey could provide for job training so that the people on welfare would \nhave adequate skills in order to get jobs. We promised them childcare \nso that children could be taken care of while they were in the \nworkforce.\n  We provided the tools, but we also said we would provide the States \nthe flexibility to get the job done. We provided accountability, and \naccountability was the participation rate, which could be satisfied in \ndifferent ways, which said the States have the flexibility to get the \njob done--a model of federalism--but we would let the States experiment \nto figure out the best way to accomplish the end result: getting people \noff of cash assistance, getting them into the workplace.\n  Now, let me point out to my colleagues that the waiver authority has \nbeen in the law for a long time, section 1115. We have had our \ndisagreements with all administrations on the use of the waiver \nauthority. My colleague refers to the GAO's report which dealt with \nfive waivers that were requested from 2000 to 2009. Those State waivers \nsought relief from specific requirements. It did not bring forward an \ninnovative new approach to try to use State experimentation to get the \nbest results.\n  It is interesting that in 2008, under the Bush administration, Health \nand Human Services documented that the waiver authority indeed existed \nas it related to the participation rates and the way in which they \ncould be satisfied.\n  Secretary Sebelius has made it clear that the waiver will only be \nused for a credible plan to increase employment by 20 percent. So she \nis looking at using the waivers to increase participation rates, to \nincrease the number of people who are actually employed. If there is \nnot progress within a year, the State runs the risk of losing the \nwaiver. It is focused on improving employment outcomes for \nparticipants.\n  I must say that I am extremely disappointed about the partisan nature \nof this discussion. I say that because I think we have all seen the ads \nthat have been put on the networks by Governor Romney that accuse the \nObama administration of eliminating the work requirement on TANF, on \nwelfare, when the fact is that the use of this waiver authority has \nbeen to strengthen the work participation rates--to strengthen the work \nparticipation rates. These ads have been condemned by major news \nsources on both the left and right. They understand this. So you would \nthink that once Governor Romney understood that his ad was misleading \nand wrong, he would take it off the air, but instead he has actually \nincreased the usage of this ad, which I find to be outrageous. Maybe it \nis consistent with Governor Romney's recent disclosure of his concern \nfor half of America, saying it is not his problem.\n  My job--our job--is to consider the needs of all of our constituents. \nTANF is a program that I think represents a model in federalism. It \nallows us to learn from the States so we can take their best models and \nuse them for national policies. That is the reason for federalism. That \nwas the reason we went to TANF reform. What the waiver authority is \nbeing used for is to give us that experimentation.\n  We have heard from more and more States that Congress mandates too \nmuch. I hear from my Republican colleagues all the time that we have \ntoo many mandates. Well, some States have a better way of doing it. \nRather than spend their money dealing with the mandates, they said: \nLook, we will accomplish the bottom line. We will get more people \nworking. We will get better results. We will get people better trained. \nWe will not only get people employed, but they will have the skills to \ngo up the employment ladder, to really succeed and have good-paying \njobs in their lifetime. Let's do what is right, and then you can learn \nfrom us, rather than having to listen to the specific mandates some of \nmy colleagues would like to see in stone here from Washington.\n\n  This was a commitment we made to the States in the nineties. The \nwaiver authority is in existing law. The Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, Secretary Sebelius, is only using it for innovative \napproaches that increase the work responsibilities of the State, not \ndiminish them. That has been well documented.\n  For all of those reasons, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I appreciate my colleague's remarks, much \nof which I agree with. That still does not negate the fact that the \nadministration has acted unilaterally as the executive branch to usurp \npowers of the legislative branch. That is the issue. It is a very \nimportant issue. It is the responsibility of the Congress, not the \nPresident, to give the States flexibility with regard to the work \nrequirement. The Constitution is pretty explicit on that.\n  GAO reported today that even though States had requested or inquired \nabout waivers, no administration--not the Clinton administration, not \nthe Bush administration, not the Obama administration--believed they \nhad waiver authority; that is, until July 12 when HHS did this. I think \nthey knew they were wrong.\n  The latest GAO report details how whenever States requested TANF \nwaivers in the past, HHS responded that no such authority exists. \nBetween 2000 and 2009, during the Clinton, Bush, and even Obama \nadministrations, HHS has consistently told States they have no waiver \nauthority. Specifically, GAO finds that at least five States asked HHS \nabout TANF waivers during that period. In two of those cases, GAO said \nthe HHS official response said they ``did not have authority to provide \nwaivers.'' In the three other cases when States asked informally, GAO \nreports that HHS responded saying that ``the requested waiver authority \nwas not available.''\n  Separately, in 2005 and 2007 HHS published two ``program \ninstructions'' about flexibilities in TANF, both indicating that no \nwaiver authority existed. In these instructions, HHS stated, ``We have \nno authority under current law to waive any of the TANF requirements'' \nand ``We have no authority to waive any of the provisions of the Act.'' \nOnly the Obama administration has claimed the ``authority,'' \ncircumventing Congress.\n  Look, this is not just a political issue, as the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland, one of my dear friends here, said. We both \ngraduated from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. I have great \nadmiration for him and great feelings toward him. But only the Obama \nadministration has claimed this ``authority'' circumventing Congress. \nThe latest GAO report highlights that only the Obama administration has \nclaimed the authority to waive welfare work requirements. Further, GAO \nnotes that this action by current HHS officials is in response to the \nPresident's February 2011\n\n[[Page S6409]]\n\nmemorandum, which, according to subsequent administration guidance, \nsolicited ``input on significant statutory barriers that could be \naddressed through waivers.''\n  Especially when viewed in the context of the President's ``we can't \nwait'' agenda, it is clear that this HHS proposal is part of an \norganized administration effort to circumvent Congress and its \nlegislative authority. We have seen that time after time with an \nabusive use of Executive orders.\n  Look, TANF has worked amazingly well because of the work requirements \nin TANF. There is a good reason no other administration has tried to \npull this type of a stunt.\n  Whether you agree with the administration or not, it seems to me we \nought to first uphold the rights and powers of the legislative branch \nof government that cannot be circumvented just because a President \nwants to do something on his own. That is what is involved here. I \nthink we ought to all stand, Democrats and Republicans, and say: Look, \nyou are not going to be able to do this. If you want to do it, then you \nare going to have to do it through statutory changes or at least ask \nCongress for permission.\n  That is the purpose of asking for this vote which has been objected \nto. I guess we will do it during the lameduck session. But the purpose \nis to stand up for the rights of the Congress of the United States and \nespecially the rights of the Senate that are being ignored.\n  There is a lot more I can say about it. That basically covers it. I \nappreciate my colleague's feelings on this matter, but to put it in the \ncategory that this is Mitt Romney trying something--Mitt Romney has had \nbasically nothing to do with it other than he agrees with what we have \ndone. He said that after we did it. He did not come to me and ask me to \ndo it.\n  The fact is we are standing for the legislative prerogatives that we \nreally ought to stand for and that the GAO said should be stood for \nbecause they declared it a rule. The GAO is not in the pockets of \nRepublicans or Democrats; it is there to try to determine these types \nof issues that are extremely important legal issues, extremely \nimportant legislative issues, extremely important separation-of-powers \nissues. So that is what we are doing here, and it really shouldn't even \nbe a political issue. We ought to just vote and let it go at that. But \nit has been objected to, and I am willing to wait until the appropriate \ntime to have a vote.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I very much appreciate my friend Senator \nHatch, and we are good friends, and I very much appreciate the point he \nmakes. I do need to correct at least two points.\n  One, I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh undergraduate, not \nlaw school. I am a graduate of the University of Maryland Law School, \nand I want to make sure my friends in Maryland know it was their law \nschool.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I certainly retract my \nstatement on that. But I feel bad the Senator didn't graduate from the \nUniversity of Pittsburgh, as I did.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Well, I was afraid to apply. I wasn't sure I would get \nin.\n  The second point, on a more substantive matter on this debate, is \nthat I wish to point out the requests that were made for waivers \nbetween 2000 and 2009 were from the final requirement. They didn't seek \nto bring forward a demonstration program or a different way to get to \ntheir results. The difference here is that States should have the \nflexibility to come in with innovative ways if they accomplish at least \nwhat we set out in law for them to accomplish. In fact, with these \ndemonstration waivers, they will have to do better on the end result on \npeople working. I just wanted to point that out because I thought there \nwere differences from the prior requests that were made and Secretary \nSebelius's response.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I would just add that if they want that \ntype of authority, they should come to the Congress and ask for it \nbecause we put that authority subject to Congress's decisionmaking, and \nit shouldn't be done unilaterally by an out-of-control approach by the \nexecutive branch. That is what is involved, and it is important. \nWhether one is a Democrat or a Republican, we ought to have an \nunderstanding of the legislative and executive branches and our rights \nand prerogatives in Congress. There is nothing that says States can't \nadd work requirements that are legitimate work requirements in the \nstatute. They didn't need this type of unilateral decision by the HHS \nDepartment to do that. That is the point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Franken pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 3562 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Franken pertaining to the introduction of S. 3557 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The Ryan Budget\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, today as I have done for days since we \nhave been in session since we returned from our August break, I have \nbeen talking about the impact of the Ryan budget, which is now the \nRomney-Ryan budget, on America and what it would mean for our future. I \ntake the floor today as I have in the past to talk about one aspect of \nit. In the past I have talked about impact on health care, on \neducation, on the social safety net. Today I wish to talk about what \nthe Romney-Ryan budget does to our infrastructure, to job training, to \navenues to the middle class for people.\n  The real question the American people face this coming election is: \nAre we going to restore and rebuild the middle class or are we going to \ncontinue to shift even more and more of our wealth to just a few at the \ntop at the expense of the middle class?\n  My Republican friends have made clear where they stand on this. They \nhave done so when nearly every Republican in Congress voted in favor of \nthe Ryan budget plan which Governor Romney embraced as ``marvelous.'' \nThe very centerpiece of the Ryan budget is a dramatic shift of even \nmore wealth to those at the top, huge tax cuts for the richest 2 \npercent. Those making more than $1 million a year would get an extra \n$394,000 a year in tax breaks under the Ryan budget. That is on top of \nthe $265,000 they already have. That brings it up to well over \n$400,000, almost $500,000 a year they would get.\n  We keep hearing a lot of talk about entitlements for the poor. \nGovernor Romney, when he talks about entitlements, always focuses on \nthe poor. How about this. If you make over $1 million you are entitled \nto it. You will not hear him talk about that entitlement.\n  How do the Republicans in the Ryan budget pay for these huge tax cuts \nthat total over $4.5 trillion over 10 years? The Romney-Ryan budget \nwould partially offset the tax cuts by making deep, Draconian tax cuts \nthat undergird the middle class and that are essential to the quality \nof life in this country--everything from education, student grants, \nloans, to highways, bridges, other infrastructure projects.\n  Last, the Romney-Ryan budget offsets big new tax cuts for those at \nthe top by actually raising taxes on the middle class. Yes, you heard \nme, that is exactly right. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates \nthat under the Ryan plan, middle-class families with children would see \ntheir taxes go up on average by more than $2,000.\n  The bottom line is that the Ryan budget does not reduce the deficit. \nThe savings they gain by slashing spending and raising taxes on the \nmiddle class basically go to offsetting the $4.5 trillion in new tax \ncuts, which, I just pointed out, go to the wealthiest Americans.\n  I think this shows you right here what would happen to the deficit. \nWe always hear the talk about balancing\n\n[[Page S6410]]\n\nthe budget. The truth is Representative Ryan and Mr. Romney are not \ninterested in balancing the budget. Their plan would not balance the \nbudget until 2040--28 years from now.\n  As I said earlier, Mr. Ryan is a true acolyte of former Vice \nPresident Cheney who, in an unguarded moment, said that deficits don't \nmatter. That was Vice President Cheney. If you look at the debt piled \nup under the Bush years, you will see they didn't think deficits \nmatter.\n  Look at this. Here is the debt held by the public under the Ryan \nbudget from 2013 to just 2022, in the next 10 years. Look at the debt. \nThe debt does not go down, it goes up. Where does this debt go? Tax \ncuts for the wealthiest Americans, that is where it goes.\n  Representative Ryan doubles down on the theory that if we give an \neven greater share of wealth to those at the top, it will magically \ntrickle down, a theory that was tried under President George W. Bush. \nBut in the years after those Bush tax cuts we know what happened to \njobs in America--they plummeted in the years after George Bush and \nthose tax cuts went into effect.\n  Today I want to focus specifically on the impact of the Romney-Ryan \nbudget on our Nation's infrastructure and job training. Both, I \nbelieve, are crucial for the creation of middle-class jobs in a \ncompetitive global economy. Regrettably, the Ryan budget would be a \ndevastating one-two punch to our Nation's economy and slash investment \nin infrastructure which would slash hundreds of thousands of well-\npaying jobs. It would radically reduce funding for job training, \nreducing opportunities for the unemployed to get retooled for jobs in \nsectors of the economy that are doing well, where they are needed.\n  The United States now competes in a global marketplace. To improve \nour competitiveness and to give our workers the education and skills \nthey need to compete, both our public and private sectors must make a \nrobust investment in infrastructure, education, and job training.\n  Overcrowded and crumbling roads, outdated waterways, other means of \ntransportation and transport have a profoundly damaging effect on our \neconomy. This increases the time and expense of moving goods, it hurts \nour global competitiveness, as I said, especially at a time when our \nrivals in the global marketplace are investing heavily in both \ninfrastructure and job training.\n  Even maintaining our current levels of infrastructure investment will \nhave negative consequences for our economy. That is if we just maintain \nwhat we have.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers predicts that, if current \ntrends continue, by 2020 our continuing infrastructure will result in \n900,000 fewer jobs and $900 billion in lost economic growth.\n  This was the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2011. They said:\n\n       The deficiencies in America's roads, bridges and transit \n     systems cost American households and businesses roughly $130 \n     billion, including approximately $97 billion in vehicle \n     operating costs,\n\n  You can read that to mean potholes and things that bang your car up.\n\n       --$32 billion in delays and travel time,\n\n  If you have been stuck in a lot of traffic.\n\n       --$1.2 billion in safety costs and $590 million in \n     environmental costs.\n\n  That is the Society of Civil Engineers. That is not part of the \nDemocratic Party or any party. This is a nonpartisan economic look at \nwhat is happening in our infrastructure.\n  By slashing these investments to even lower levels, the Ryan budget \nwill only make these problems worse, not better. In fact, the Ryan \nbudget cuts transportation spending by one-third in the first year.\n  We are not talking about a little nip and a tuck on infrastructure. \nHere is the fiscal year 2012--enacted--transportation budget: $89 \nbillion. The Ryan-Romney budget for next year, $57 billion. It is \nalmost a one-third cut. Think what that would mean to the jobs in \nAmerica. Think what it means to our crumbling infrastructure.\n  Then you have to compare how much we are investing in our \ninfrastructure to what one of our biggest competitors, China, is doing. \nHere is China. As a percent of their gross domestic product, they are \nspending 9 percent of their GDP on infrastructure. Here is the United \nStates. In 1960, when I was a college student working summer jobs, \nlaying pavement and building bridges on the Interstate Highway System, \nwe were spending 4 percent of our GDP on infrastructure. We are now \ndown to 2.4 percent. And the Romney-Ryan budget would take that even \nlower.\n  So already our Federal investments in infrastructure are inadequate. \nFor example, we have failed to bring the half-century-old Interstate \nHighway System into the 21st century. Again, the Romney-Ryan budget \nwould make that even worse. The Romney budget would make deep cuts to \nfunding for the Corps of Engineers which is already grossly underfunded \nand struggling to maintain a deteriorating waterway system so crucial \nfor the movement of bulk goods, and, I might add, also crucial for \nflood control.\n  The Ryan budget would also take a meat axe to Federal funding for job \ntraining and education, America's pathway to the middle class. It would \njeopardize vital job services for millions of Americans. Thirty-one \nmillion Americans got Federal help with their job searches last year--\nhelp to write their resumes, prepare for interviews, information about \nthe best jobs available in their local area, referrals to job openings. \nSeveral hundred thousand were also able to participate in job training \nunder Federal programs. This gave these American workers the \nopportunity to compete for good jobs so they have a shot at the middle \nclass. It created a steady supply of skilled workers for U.S. \nbusinesses, made their operations more productive, and it helped them \nto grow.\n  Think about it; several hundred thousand people out of work were able \nto participate in job training because of Federal programs. That is \npart of Mr. Romney's 47 percent that he says he doesn't care about, who \nare the takers in our society. No, no, Mr. Romney, they are not takers. \nThese are people struggling to make a better life for themselves and \ntheir families. They want job training. They want better education. \nThey want to upgrade their skills. They want to work. The Romney-Ryan \nbudget would pull the rug out from underneath them and say: Tough luck, \nyou are on your own. I don't think they should be on their own; they \nshould be part of our American family.\n  Without sustained robust investments in quality infrastructure and \nwell-trained workers, America will fall behind and job creation will \nsuffer. This is a critical threat to the future of the middle class in \nour country.\n  In essence, the Ryan budget essentially rejects the very possibility \nthat the Federal Government can act to spur economic growth, boost \ncompetitiveness, and create good middle-class jobs. But this flies in \nthe face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. At critical \njunctures going back to the beginning of our Republic, the Federal \nGovernment has stepped up to the plate, acting decisively to spur \neconomic growth, foster innovation, and help create jobs. In 1791, \nAlexander Hamilton presented to Congress his landmark Report on \nManufactures, a set of Federal policies designed to strengthen the new \nRepublic's economy by creating a network of roads and canals.\n  The most visionary 19th century advocate of Federal investments to \nspur economic growth was the first Republican President, Abraham \nLincoln. In 1862 he signed the Pacific Railway Act to finance \nconstruction of the transcontinental railroad, one of the great \ntechnological feats, by the way, of the 19th century. But Lincoln did \nmore; he created the Department of Agriculture to modernize agriculture \nand distribute free land to farmers. As a proud graduate of Iowa State \nUniversity, I also note Lincoln dramatically expanded access to higher \neducation across the United States by signing into law the Land Grant \nCollege system. Taken together, these initiatives had a transformative \nimpact on the U.S. economy.\n  It is humorous to imagine how today's Republicans would have reacted \nto Lincoln's agenda. What if Abraham Lincoln were to present this today \nto the tea party? He would not get anywhere.\n  Later, in the 1950s, there was another Republican president, Dwight \nEisenhower, who championed one of the greatest public works projects in \nour national history, construction of the\n\n[[Page S6411]]\n\nnational highway system. A 1996 study concluded that the Interstate \nHighway System is an engine that has driven 40 years of unprecedented \nprosperity in America.\n  In recent times, the Federal Government has funded and spearheaded \nscientific discovery and innovation. The Department of Defense invented \nthe Internet. It was Federal research that led to the invention of the \nglobal positioning satellite system. Any discussion of the Federal \nGovernment's historic role in discovery and innovation and job creation \nmust acknowledge the staggering achievements of the National Institutes \nof Health. More than 80 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for NIH-\nsupported research. So it is absurd to claim that the Federal \nGovernment cannot serve a positive and even profound role in boosting \nthe economy and spurring innovation. But the Romney-Ryan budget demands \nthat we permanently hobble the Federal Government. That is the Romney-\nRyan budget. This negative, defeatist viewpoint is dead wrong, and the \ndisinvestment it advocates will only send our country into a death \nspiral of stagnation and decline.\n  Going back to the 1930s, the American people have supported and \nstrengthened a kind of unique American social contract. The social \ncontract says a cardinal rule of government is to provide a ladder of \nopportunity so that every American can realistically aspire to the \nAmerican dream. The Ryan budget would rip up that social contract.\n\n  Don't take my word for it. Former Reagan economic adviser Bruce \nBartlett on the Ryan budget said this:\n\n       Distributionally, the Ryan plan is a monstrosity. The rich \n     would receive huge tax cuts while the social safety net would \n     be shredded to pay for them.\n\n  The Ryan budget rips up the social safety net, disinvests in our \ninfrastructure, cuts funding for job training, cuts money for \neducation, cuts money for health care. As I said, it is a negative, \ndefeatist viewpoint that will set our country into a death spiral of \nstagnation and decline.\n  The Romney-Ryan budget would replace the unique American social \ncontract that we have with a survival-of-the-fittest, winner-take-all \nphilosophy that tells struggling, aspiring Americans and their \ncommunities: Tough luck, you are on your own.\n  I agree with former President Bill Clinton. We have two philosophies: \nthe Romney Ryan budget--tough luck, you are on your own--or the other \nphilosophy that we are all Americans and we are all in this together. \nWe are all mutually supportive. We believe in a ladder, a ramp of \nopportunity, and, yes, we believe the Federal Government has a powerful \nrole to play in making sure all Americans can aspire to the American \ndream. They can reach the middle class. They can achieve the highest of \ntheir potentialities and their abilities. That is the difference.\n  I think the American people need to know what is in the Ryan budget. \nOne might say: Well, a budget is a budget.\n  A budget is a blueprint. Just as we build a building, we have to have \na blueprint; a budget is a blueprint for the future of where we want to \ngo. Communities have budgets, families have budgets, schools have \nbudgets. We have a budget so we can plan. It represents where we want \nto be in the future. The Ryan budget is a blueprint for defeat and a \ndeath spiral into stagnation for America.\n  I believe the more the American people understand and know what is in \nthat Ryan budget, the more they are going to turn it aside and say: No, \nwe can do better than that in America. We need a budget that reflects \nour hopes and aspirations and our abilities as Americans to work \ntogether to achieve the American dream for all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the Senate is sort of wrapping up its \nbusiness, if you will, until after the election. It is ironic, in a \nway, that there are so many big issues in front of us as a nation--so \nmany challenges--yet we are talking about things I am sure are \nimportant, but, once again, we are punting, kicking the can down the \nroad on all the big crises in front of us as a nation.\n  I have to say that never before has a President and a Senate done so \nlittle when the Nation's challenges are so great. People have talked \nabout the fiscal cliff repeatedly, and people have talked about the \nfiscal crisis in which we find ourselves in terms that I think ought to \nfrighten all Americans. It certainly ought to frighten Members of \nCongress when we talk about the most predictable crisis in American \nhistory, probably in human history. It is not like it is any surprise \nwhat is going to happen. We are repeatedly reminded by all of the \nexperts that if we don't deal with this issue of the fiscal cliff, it \nwill have devastating, catastrophic impacts on our economy, on our \nnational security, on our country, and on the American people. Yet we \nare not addressing it and doing what we should be doing to avert the \ndisaster ahead of us, the fiscal cliff that faces us on January 1 of \nthis next year.\n  It is not as though there isn't already a lot of evidence that we \nhave big problems. We just crossed the $16 trillion level in terms of \nour debt. We have added over $1 trillion of debt every single year now \nfor the past 4 years, since President Obama has taken office. That is \n$50,000 for every man, woman, and child in America. Everybody in \nAmerica--man, woman, or child--now has $50,000 as their share of \nFederal debt. So it is a fiscal crisis unlike anything we have seen \nbefore, and it has, as I said, been predicted.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has said if we don't deal with the \nfiscal cliff, it will plunge the economy into recession. They have \nsuggested that it will reduce by 2.9 percent the size of the economy. \nWe actually will have a contraction of the economy in the first 6 \nmonths of next year.\n  They have also projected it will drive unemployment above 9 percent. \nGranted, we are over 8 percent today. We have been at 8 percent now for \n43 consecutive months. That is the longest stretch in history. In fact, \nif we go back to the time the Bureau of Labor Statistics started \nkeeping unemployment data and we add up the data for the 11 Presidents \nfrom Harry Truman through the end of the George W. Bush \nadministration--about 60 years--there were 39 months where the \nunemployment rate exceeded 8 percent. That is 11 Presidents in about 60 \nyears of history where we have had unemployment above 8 percent.\n  We have now had unemployment above 8 percent for 43 consecutive \nmonths. So 39 months in the first 60 years since they started keeping \ndata, and 43 months now in a row under the current administration.\n  We have the Federal Reserve telling us if we don't deal with our \nfiscal crisis, the economy is going to soften next year.\n  We have ratings agencies such as Moody's suggesting that if we don't \nhave a plan in place not only to deal with the sequestration that is \ngoing to occur at the end of the year in a way that is paid for but \nalso to deal with the longer, structural problem--the debt and deficits \ncrisis we have in this country--we are facing a downgrade in our credit \nrating.\n  You had the World Economic Forum come out just recently with their \nassessment about the world's most competitive economies. Back in \nJanuary of 2009 when President Obama took office, the World Economic \nForum found that the United States had the No. 1 most competitive \neconomy in the world. In terms of global competitiveness, the United \nStates was ranked No. 1. Now we have dropped. We had dropped to fifth, \nand this year, just recently, as I mentioned, when they came out with \ntheir current rankings, the United States had dropped down to seventh. \nSo in a short 4-year timespan, we have gone from first in terms of \nglobal competitiveness down to seventh. That does not speak well for \nthe steps that are being taken here in this country to make America \ncompetitive in the global economy, to deal with the problems of \nspending and debt and the fiscal cliff that is ahead of us.\n  It is interesting to note that at the World Economic Forum--what did \nthey point to in terms of their analysis?\n\n[[Page S6412]]\n\nWhy did they come to the conclusion that the United States had fallen \nfrom first in January of 2009 when the President took office to seventh \nhere this year? Well, they pointed out spending, debt, taxes, \nregulations, redtape--all the things that come from Washington, DC; all \nthe things that are controlled by policies here in Washington; the \nregulations that continue to spin out of various government agencies \nthat drive up the cost of doing business in this country, that make us \nless competitive; the higher taxes that are being assessed on our \neconomy in so many different ways; and, of course, all the taxes that \nare going to take hold, take effect as part of ObamaCare, the health \ncare law that was passed a couple years ago, that begin to kick in. So \nyou are going to have higher taxes. You have the redtape associated \nwith doing business in this country and the bureaucracies, the \nmandates, the requirements that are imposed on our small businesses and \nour job creators. And then, of course, as I said, you have this massive \namount of debt that hangs like a cloud over our economy. These are all \nfactors that contribute to this assessment that has basically \ndowngraded the United States from the No. 1 position in terms of global \ncompetitiveness to No. 7.\n  So the question before the house is, What can we do? What should we \nbe doing to avert that crisis? Well, it strikes me, at least, that it \nstarts with having a plan and working together, having the President \nstep forward with a plan that would make sure our economy does not go \ninto a recession next year; that makes sure the defense cuts that would \noccur under the sequester--which are terribly disproportionate relative \nto the size of the defense budget as a percentage of our total budget--\ndo not harm our national security interests; figure out ways to solve \nthat problem; reduce spending in other areas to redistribute the cuts. \nDefense represents only 20 percent of the entire budget, but it gets 50 \npercent of the cuts under this across-the-board sequester that would \ntake effect on January 1 of next year.\n  Our national security experts and our military leadership have said \nthat if these cuts take effect, we will have the smallest Army since \nthe beginning of World War II. You have to go back to 1940 to find a \ntime when we would have had an Army that is that small. You have to go \nback to 1915, before World War I, to find a time when we would have had \na Navy that is as small as it will be if these cuts take effect in the \nnumber of ships we have at our disposal. And we would have the smallest \nAir Force, literally, in the history of the Air Force.\n  That is what our military leadership is telling us will happen if \nthese devastating cuts take effect. You have had the Secretary of \nDefense, Leon Panetta, the President's own Secretary, say that this \nwould be catastrophic, that these cuts would be disastrous. You have \nthe service chiefs saying the very same thing.\n  So we have all this right in front of us, staring us in the face, and \ninstead of dealing with that crisis we are putting bills on the floor \nthat really do not have near the consequence--as I said, I am sure \nimportant; I am not denigrating at all any of the legislation the \nSenate is considering, but it seems to be right now geared a lot more \ntoward the election than it is about saving the country and doing the \nthings that are necessary to avoid this cliff that is ahead of us and \nall the disastrous consequences that come with it.\n  Now, just again, a point of fact, and I mentioned this before. We \nhave had now 43 months of 8 percent unemployment or above. We have 23 \nmillion Americans who are either unemployed or underemployed. We have \nseen that the data continues to suggest how sluggish our economy is, \nthe impact it is having on the middle class in this country. In fact, \nmiddle-class Americans are continually hit by continued bad news.\n  You start with the fact that since President Obama took office, \naverage incomes have gone down almost $4,000. Added on top of that is \nthe fact that fuel prices have literally doubled in that timeframe--now \nmore than doubled. In fact, we hit, in the month of September--this \nmonth--the highest fuel prices ever for the month of September. That is \na cost that is borne by middle-class Americans. One of the biggest \ncosts, biggest expenses in their lives is dealing with getting their \nkids to and from school, getting to work, taking care of the day-to-day \nactivities for which they are responsible. The cost of fuel is a very \nimportant pocketbook issue for middle-class Americans. Then you have \nnews the Kaiser Foundation came out with that says health care premiums \nhave gone up by 29 percent. That is despite all the assertions when \nObamaCare was being debated that it would drive health care costs down. \nIn fact, the President, as he campaigned for office 4 years ago, talked \nabout bringing the premium for an average family down by $2,500. Well, \nthe opposite has happened. According to the Kaiser Foundation, health \ninsurance costs have gone up by 29 percent. Instead of coming down by \n$2,500 for the average family, they have gone up by over $3,000 for the \naverage family. So whether it is health care costs, fuel costs, tuition \ncosts, which, by the way, have gone up by 25 percent, or average \nincomes that have gone down, you see this worsening picture for average \nAmericans. All of that will be dramatically complicated by what is \ngoing to happen on January 1 if we do not take action to avert that \ncrisis.\n  What happens on January 1? As I mentioned, you have an across-the-\nboard cut. It is across the board in the sense that everything gets \nhit, but not everything gets hit proportionately. Defense, as I said, \ngets 50 percent of the cuts although it represents only 20 percent of \nthe budget. You are going to have all these cuts that take effect \nthat hurt the national security budget and the jobs that go with that, \nbut you also have taxes going up. Tax rates go up on January 1, which \nwill absolutely devastate job creation in this country if they are \nallowed to take effect. In fact, the total amount of tax increases that \nwill hit us on January 1, if Congress does not take action, over a 10-\nyear period is about $5 trillion--about $5 trillion over a 10-year \nperiod in additional taxes.\n\n  Even if you say, as the President does, that you want taxes to go up \njust on people who make more than $200,000 a year or couples who make \nmore than $250,000 a year, you are harming almost 1 million small \nbusinesses--the very people we are looking to to create the jobs to get \nthe economy moving again--almost 1 million small businesses that file \nincome tax returns. They are passthrough entities or flowthrough \nentities organized as subchapter S corporations or LLCs; therefore, \nthey file their business income on their individual tax returns. And \nthey would see their taxes go up--almost 1 million small businesses \nthat represent 25 percent of the workforce, hire 25 percent of the \nworkforce in this country. So that is a huge tax increase that is \nfacing job creators in this country come January 1 of next year.\n  These are things on which the House, the Senate, and the President of \nthe United States ought to be focused. Yet we are not getting that \nfocus. In fact, it is hard to get even information from the President \nof the United States about how he would implement the sequestration \nproposal. We had passed legislation earlier this summer which he signed \ninto law in August which required him to submit to the Congress a \nproposal for how he would implement sequestration. We finally, after a \ndelay--he missed the deadline--received that last week, but, again, it \nlacks specificity, it lacks detail. Congress asked to have that on \nprogram, project specific areas, and we did not get that. So as a \nconsequence, again, we are still operating without the information that \nis necessary to do something to replace that sequestration.\n  I have to say that the House of Representatives has attempted--they \npassed in their budget--in the subsequent reconciliation bill that went \nwith it--a replacement for this sequestration so that we would not have \nthis $\\1/2\\ trillion cut in our national security budget and all the \nattendant problems and risks that come with that. Yet that was not \npicked up, that was not acted on here in the Senate.\n  So, unfortunately, we are where we are, which is we are going into \nthe election season now. We have not dealt with the across-the-board \ncuts, the sequestration. We have not dealt with the issue of taxes \ngoing up on January 1 on the people who create jobs in this country. \nFor that reason, we have all\n\n[[Page S6413]]\n\nthese analysts--independents analysts, government analysts--concluding \nthe same thing; that is, we are headed for a train wreck. That is what \nwe ought to be focused on right now.\n  Frankly, that is not going to happen unless we get some leadership \nfrom the President of the United States. We have to have the President \nengaged, involved in these discussions if we are going to try to solve \nthis problem. I would hope the leadership here in the Senate would be a \npartner to that as well. I know there are Republicans here who have \ntried to get votes on ways to replace the sequestration or come up with \na substitute for the defense cuts that it includes. We have tried and \nactually gotten some votes on actually extending the tax rates at the \nend of the year, but that was voted down here. But the Democratic \nleadership in the Senate has to be a party to discussions, as does the \nPresident of the United States, in order for us to do what is necessary \nto avert what we know is going to be a calamity come January 1 unless \nwe change course.\n  As we begin to conclude this particular session of the Senate--I see \nthat my colleague, the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso, who is a \nphysician, a doctor, is here. I know he has spoken at great length \nabout the impact of many of the policies that are coming out of \nWashington on our small businesses, on our middle class, and I \ncertainly would want to give him an opportunity to make some \nobservations about that as well. But I want to conclude by saying I \nhope that before this catastrophe hits us, we have the foresight and \nthe willingness and the courage to take on these big issues. You cannot \nsolve big issues in this city without leadership. It is going to take \nleadership from the President of the United States. It is going to take \nleadership in the Senate. As I stand here today, we have not seen that. \nWe have not passed a budget in 3 years. We have not dealt with any of \nthe long-term problems that are posed and raised by the fiscal cliff \nthat hits us on January 1 of next year. I hope that changes. I hope to \nsee that leadership. And I hope we can get this country back on track.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with \nthe remarks of the Senator from South Dakota, who speaks so eloquently \non the major issues facing our Nation, the concerns of people all \naround the country: their quality of life, the cost of energy, the cost \nof their health care, the impact of government regulations and rules \nthat make it harder and more expensive for small businesses to add \nworkers to their rolls.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  I come to the floor today as a physician, a doctor who has practiced \nmedicine in Wyoming, taking care of families there for about a quarter \nof a century, to do as I have done week after week since the health \ncare law was passed: to give a doctor's second opinion about the health \ncare law because one of the reasons I got involved in politics was, as \na doctor, I have concern for my patients, worried that they were not \ngetting the care they need from the doctor they want at a lower cost, \nrealizing the impacts of costs on the availability of care, the quality \nof care. So when the health care law was passed, I had great concerns \nbecause I felt it was going to end up being bad for patients, bad for \nthe providers--the nurses and doctors who take care of those patients--\nand terrible for the American taxpayer.\n  It was interesting that during the discussion of the health care law, \nNancy Pelosi, the then-Speaker of the House, said that in terms of the \nhealth care law, first you had to pass it before you got to find out \nwhat is in it. Well, the law has been passed, and as more and more \npeople are finally finding out what is in it, the law continues to be \nvery unpopular. But it is interesting that when a law is written behind \nclosed doors, passed in the dark of night, when people on the side who \nvoted for it actually never read it, did not understand the \nimplications, that here we are 2 years later with so many people still \nsaying: What is in it?\n  One of the things I want to visit about today is an editorial in the \nNew York Times from just a couple of weeks ago. It was while I was \ntraveling around the State of Wyoming, visiting with people, visiting \nwith former patients, that an editorial came out with the headline ``A \nGlitch in Health Care Reform.''\n  Well, for 2 years I have been coming back to the Senate floor, week \nafter week after week, talking about things that were in this health \ncare law--unintended consequences, things people did not realize were \nthere, did not understand were there, were surprised to find out were \nthere.\n  So the headline is ``A Glitch in Health Care Reform.'' Right under \nthat, the subheadline is ``Millions of middle-class Americans could be \nleft without affordable coverage.'' And then my favorite line, the \nfirst line, the first paragraph:\n\n       Confusing language in the health care reform law has raised \n     the possibility that millions of Americans living on modest \n     incomes may be unable to afford their employers' family \n     policies and yet fail to qualify for government subsidies to \n     buy their own insurance.\n\n  Confusing language. That is what happens when a law is written behind \nclosed doors, not read by the people who voted for it, and the Speaker \nof the House of Representatives of the United States of America says: \nFirst, you have to pass it before you get to find out what is in it. \nAnd this is an editorial in the New York Times 2 years after the health \ncare bill has been signed into law: Confusing language. ``A glitch in \nhealth care reform. Millions of middle-class Americans could be left \nwithout coverage.''\n  So it is not a surprise that I will continue to come to the floor \nwith a doctor's second opinion because we will continue to find where \nconfusing language leaves people confused.\n  Now, one of the areas that is so often discussed on the Senate floor \nis the Congressional Budget Office. Well, they came out today with a \nnew report. It talks about the health care law. No surprise. They said \nthey got it wrong a couple of years ago. They have relooked at the \nnumbers. This is the Congressional Budget Office that is supposed to be \nan expert on making some assumptions and making some suggestions and \nsome predictions. Today they came out with a report called ``Payments \nof Penalties for Being Uninsured Under the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act.''\n  Now, let's go back. Payments of penalties for being uninsured. Well, \nthis is a health care law that reaches into every home in America and \nsays: You must buy a government-approved product. You must have health \ninsurance. Not enough money to pay for doctors to care for patients but \nplenty of money for IRS agents to investigate the American people.\n  What does it say when we go through the report? They said, well, they \nthought there would be about 4 million people who would have to pay \npenalties for being uninsured under the health care law. Well, they \nwere only wrong, they say, by 50 percent. They were off by 50 percent; \nnot 4 million but 6 million Americans will be penalized and have to pay \ntaxes under the health care law which the Supreme Court found to be \nconstitutional.\n  Well, it may not be unconstitutional, but it is still unworkable, \nvery unaffordable, and very unpopular. So I come to the floor week \nafter week as new reports continue to come out saying CBO was wrong. \nThe New York Times, talking about ``confusing language.''\n  You know, I would say James Madison, the father of the Constitution, \nhad it right when he said:\n\n       You should pass no laws so voluminous they cannot be read, \n     so incoherent they cannot be understood.\n\n  But that is what Democrats in the House and the Senate did when they \npassed and when the President signed the health care law.\n  Now, another report has just come out within the last couple of days. \nI recall the President, when he was talking about the health care law, \nsaid computerizing medical records would cut waste and eliminate \nredtape. Now what does the report say? Well, it says the amount of \npaperwork, the amount of manhours put into just complying with the \nrules and the regulations they have come up with--they are predicting--\nand I will get into those who have done the predictions--that \nbusinesses and families will end up spending 80 million--80 million--\nhours a year on paperwork trying to comply with this health care law.\n\n[[Page S6414]]\n\n  Former Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Fred Goldberg said the \ncurrent form of the Obama health care law ``will be a needless \nadministrative and compliance quagmire for millions of Americans.'' The \nWays and Means Committee in the House of Representatives under \ncommittee chairman David Camp found that more than half of those 80 \nmillion manhours will be consumed by small businesses. That is the \ngroup that can least afford to have to spend this kind of time, this \nkind of manpower. Talk about productive work and nonproductive work, \nthis goes into the category of nonproductive work. So they are either \ngoing to hire more people to just do paperwork or take people from \ndoing productive work and move them onto the nonproductive side.\n  They are talking about 40,000 full-time people working the number of \nhours they would work to get this 80 million manhours of work. It is \nwasteful. It creates no wealth overall to the economy. It is not a \nproductive activity. So those are the things we see week after week.\n  Then, finally, last week there was a group of franchise owners who \nwere traveling around visiting with Members on Capitol Hill about the \nimpact of the health care law on them and on their small businesses. \nThey want to hire people. They want to get people to work. We know \nunder the President's economy, there are 23 million Americans who are \neither unemployed or underemployed, people looking for work, looking \nfor better work, looking for more hours.\n  But let's look at the incentives as well as the consequences that are \nincluded in the health care law. Well, these small franchise owners \nwill tell you that in order to try to comply with the law and not be \ndriven out of business because of the expense of the penalties and the \nhigh level of insurance they would have to provide to their workers, \nthey only have a couple of choices.\n  One of the choices--they do not like it, but one of the choices is to \ncut the number of hours an employee works because then they are a part-\ntime employee. Then they do not have to receive the benefits of the \nmandate, of the health care law. That is not what they want to do. It \nis not what the employees want. They want to work more hours. But the \nconsequences of what the Democrats in this institution have passed, the \nconsequences are that people who want to work more are going to lose \nthat opportunity.\n  The other thing they are looking at is saying, well, just drop paying \nfor insurance at all and pay the fine. Pay the penalty because the \nconsequences and the incentives are such that the fine is, from a \nbusiness standpoint, the path to follow rather than to provide the high \nlevel of insurance the President mandates. It may be a lot more \ninsurance than people want or need or that the businesses can afford.\n  So I will continue to come back to the floor to talk about the \nPresident's broken promises. He said: If you like what you have, you \ncan keep it. We now know people who like their health insurance are not \ngoing to be able to keep it. He said the insurance rates would drop by \nabout $2,500 per family per year. We have seen the rates have gone up \nmore than $3,000 a year instead of dropping $2,500 a year.\n  The promises are many. The realities are quite different than what \nthe President has promised. That is why the American people continue to \nfind the health care law unpopular. It is why our seniors who have seen \n700 billion of their Medicare dollars taken away from them, not to save \nMedicare but to start a whole other government program for others, that \nis why they know it is going to be harder to find a physician to take \ncare of them, especially if their physician retires or if they move to \na new location.\n  That is why I will continue to come back to the floor to continue to \ntalk about trying to help people get the care they need from the doctor \nthey choose at a lower cost. This health care law is bad for patients. \nIt is bad for providers, nurses, and doctors who take care of those \npatients. It is terrible for the American taxpayers. That is why I \nbelieve we need to repeal and replace this broken health care law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                            The Ryan Budget\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \ntalk about the upside-down values and blatant dishonesty that \nCongressman Paul Ryan and other Republicans have put down on paper and \nare trying to present to the American people as their responsible \nbudget. The truth is it is anything but. The Ryan budget would be \ndevastating for middle-class families. It would gut our investments in \neducation and job training, research, and our Nation's future. It would \ndo all of that while cutting taxes for the richest Americans and \nbiggest corporations.\n  Now, if that is not bad enough, it gets even worse. The Ryan \nRepublican budget would permanently cut tax rates for the wealthiest \nAmericans to the lowest level in more than 80 years--more than 80 \nyears. It would cut taxes for the rich below the scheduled top rate of \n39.6 percent, below the Bush tax cut rate of 35 percent, all the way \ndown to just 25 percent if you are a millionaire or billionaire. But \neven that is not all.\n  What Paul Ryan and the Republicans do not want people to know is \ntheir budget does not even add up. It is fiscal fraud. It is a bait-\nand-switch. It is a desperate attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of \nthe American people. Ryan and the Republicans claim they would pay for \ntheir massive tax cuts for the rich by ``closing loopholes and ending \ndeductions.'' But they never say which loopholes they would close or \nwhich deductions they would eliminate.\n  In fact, they have been pressed over and over to lay out their plan \nby the media, by the public, by Democrats. And they refuse. It is just \na big secret. This past weekend, both Governor Romney and \nRepresentative Ryan were asked again and again to offer even one \ndeduction they would limit. Pick one. Any one. They were asked that so \nthe American people could judge their plan. Both refused. It begs the \nsimple question: What are they hiding?\n  Well, a former Reagan adviser, Bruce Bartlett, slammed Ryan's budget \nin the Fiscal Times writing: ``He offers only the sugar of rate \nreductions without telling us what the medicine of base broadening will \nbe. . . . ''\n  He says:\n\n       Any tax reform plan that simply asserts it will collect a \n     certain percentage of GDP in revenue while specifying the \n     rate structure but not defining the tax base is fundamentally \n     dishonest, in my opinion.\n\n  Well, I agree. Why is this? Why are Ryan and the Republicans so \nspecific about the taxes they are going to cut for the rich and so \nvague about how that is going to be paid for? Well, Ryan and the \nRepublicans know when we do the math it becomes very clear that under \ntheir Republican budget the rich pay less and the middle class pay more \nand the national debt continues to grow. The math does not add up.\n  Here is why, here is what the Republicans do not want the American \npeople to think about: The most expensive loopholes and deductions, the \nones Republicans would need to eliminate to even start paying for these \ncuts for the rich, those are the ones that middle-class families depend \non and the ones they benefit from the most, such as the personal and \ndependent exemptions, deductions for their home mortgages, charitable \ncontributions, State and local taxes, child tax credit, college tuition \ncredit.\n  If these deductions are eliminated while tax rates are slashed for \nthe rich, it would mean a massive transfer of the tax burden onto the \nbacks of our middle class. The richest Americans get a massive tax \ncut--an average of over $250,000 a year for someone who makes $1 \nmillion a year, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center--but \nthe middle class, those families who depend on those critical \ndeductions such as the home mortgage deduction, end up paying more. \nThey would benefit far less from the marginal rate cut than the extra \nthey would pay after losing those deductions.\n  If that sounds unbelievable, that is because it is. If that sounds \nlike something no elected official would ever want to talk about doing, \nwell, that is exactly right. So what Ryan and the Republicans do when \nthey are asked is simply deny it. They simply say: Oh, that is not the \ncase. They claim that loopholes and deductions will only be eliminated \nfor the rich, and the middle class does not have to worry about \nanything.\n  Well, that sounds nice, but here is what they will not tell the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S6415]]\n\npeople: It does not add up. The Tax Policy Center took a look at a plan \nthat made a similar claim. Even viewing it in the most generous way, \nthey could not get it to work. They said:\n\n       Even when we assume that tax breaks--like the charitable \n     deduction, mortgage interest deduction, and the exclusion for \n     health insurance--are completely eliminated for higher-income \n     households first, and only then reduced as necessary for \n     other households to achieve overall revenue-neutrality--the \n     net effect of the plan would be a tax cut for high-income \n     households coupled with a tax increase for middle-income \n     households.\n\n  That last point is very important. According to independent analysts, \nif you cut rates for the rich as much as the Republicans want, and pay \nfor it by closing loopholes and ending deductions, there is no way to \navoid having the middle class pay more. That is a fiscal reality. It \nlays bare the fraud in the Ryan Republican budget.\n  Not only does the Ryan Republican budget decimate programs middle-\nclass families depend on, not only does it end Medicare as we know it \nand push health care costs onto the backs of our seniors, not only does \nit cut investment in jobs, in education, in training, in research, in \ninnovation, in roads and bridges, it does not even add up. It is a \nfiscal fraud. I am hoping, now that the American people have the \nopportunity to see this clearly, Republicans will stop playing games. \nLet us get serious about the fiscal future of our country and work with \nus on a balanced approach to cut spending responsibly, call on the \nwealthy to pay their fair share and actually reduce the deficit and the \ndebt. As soon as they are ready to do that, as soon as they are ready \nto accept reality and end this fiscal fraud, I know Democrats are ready \nto make the kind of balanced and bipartisan deal the American people \nexpect and deserve.\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are trying to work through all the issues \nwe have. There are a few of them--not too many but a few. But I want \neveryone to know we can finish all of our work tomorrow. We can finish \nit all tomorrow, but we are not going anyplace. We are staying here \nuntil Tuesday, probably 3 or 3:30, because we have Yom Kippur on \nWednesday, and then we will be right back here on Thursday. We have to \nfinish our work.\n  So that means if we can't work things out, we are going to be here \nFriday, Saturday, and Sunday. I know we talk about this once in a \nwhile, and usually we are able to work things out, and I am glad we \nare. But just in case we can't, no one should think they are going to \nbe able to catch an airplane out of here on Friday.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3525\n\n  Mr. President, I will be very quick. I know the assistant leader for \nthe minority is here and I don't want to take a lot of his time.\n  The Senator from Montana, Mr. Tester, has assembled a broad package \nof legislation. It is bipartisan in nature, and that is an \nunderstatement, to support the needs of sportsmen throughout the \ncountry. He has worked with these groups, and I have been in meetings \nwith him where he has tried to get Democratic Senators to back off and \nlet this package go forward, and there have been adjustments made \nbecause of problems Republicans had and Democrats had. So I appreciate \nvery much his work.\n  What his bill does is to combine about 20 bills that are important to \nthe sportsmen community around this country. These measures would \npromote hunting, fishing and recreational access and they would foster \nhabitat conservation through voluntary programs. More than 50 national \ngroups support this. These are sportsmen and conservation groups.\n  This is an example of leadership that is important in this body, to \nwork on things that bring together a disparate group of bills, \nbipartisan in nature, and try to move forward. We ought to pass this \npackage today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 504, \nS. 3525, the Sportsmen's Act of 2012; that the bill be read a third \ntime and passed; the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with \nno intervening action or debate; and any statements related to the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I had asked \nthe distinguished majority leader if I requested an amendment to his \nrequest to add a piece of legislation that he and I both support \nwhether he would have to object to that, and I am presuming his answer \nis he would have to object. As a result, rather than doing that and \nforcing him to object, I will simply pose my objection at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Sportsmen's Act. The \nSportsmen's Act is a good piece of legislation. It is a piece of \nlegislation where, quite frankly, it would be one of the few times in \nthis body Democrats and Republicans could come together and actually do \nsomething that is good for this country and not play politics with it.\n  The outdoor traditions in this country are deep and are an important \npart of our heritage. That is why 2 years ago, when I became chair of \nthe Sportsmen's Caucus, I made it a goal to do something, something \nsignificant, that would help this country's hunters and anglers.\n  This week we have an opportunity to play politics as usual or to get \nsomething done. This Sportsmen's Act is the biggest package of \nsportsmen's bills in a generation. It combines, as the majority leader \nsaid, nearly 20 different bills--all important to the sportsmen \ncommunity.\n  These bills increase access for recreational hunting and fishing. \nThey support land and species conservation. They protect our hunting \nand fishing rights. Most important, they take ideas from both sides of \nthe political aisle. It is not about Democrats. This bill isn't about \nRepublicans or Independents. This bill is about Americans and the great \noutdoors we all share as a nation.\n  This bipartisan bill is supported by 56 different conservation and \nwildlife groups, ranging from the Nature Conservancy and the National \nWildlife Federation to the NRA. It earned their endorsement because it \nincludes a wide range of responsible provisions that are important to \nsportsmen and women across America.\n  In my role as chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, \nsportsmen continually tell me about the importance of access to public \nlands. Right now there are 35 million acres of public land that \nsportsmen cannot access. That is why this bill requires 1.5 percent of \nthe annual funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund set-asides \nto increase public land access, ensuring sportsmen across the country \naccess to some of the best places to hunt and fish in this country.\n  This bill also reauthorizes the North American Wetlands Conservation \nAct. This voluntary initiative provides matching grants to landowners \nwho set aside critical habitat for migratory birds such as ducks. Over \nthe last 20 years, volunteers across America have completed more than \n2,000 conservation projects and protected more than 26 million acres of \nhabitat under this successful initiative. The North American Wetlands \nConservation Act is a smart investment in both our lands and our \nwildlife, and it needs to be reauthorized, as this bill does.\n  My widely supported bill authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to \nreevaluate the price of duck stamps to keep up with inflation. Revenue \nfrom these duck stamps has been used to purchase or lease more than 6 \nmillion acres of wetlands and preserve a viable waterfowl population. \nThis bill also funds new shooting ranges while encouraging Federal land \nagencies to cooperate with State and local authorities to maintain \nexisting ranges.\n  This is a responsible bill that takes into account the needs of the \nentire sportsmen community. Some folks around Washington are asking: \nWhy is this important? But hunting and fishing is a way of life in \nplaces such as Montana. One in three Montanans hunt\n\n[[Page S6416]]\n\nbig game, and over 50 percent of Montanans fish. Outdoor recreation \ncontributed $646 billion in direct spending to the economy in this \ncountry just last year. Hunting and fishing is not just recreation, it \nis a critical part of our economy.\n  In Montana, hunting and fishing brings $1 billion a year to our \neconomy, nearly as much as our State's cattle industry. It is big \nbusiness. It drives and sustains jobs. With bow hunting season open and \nrifle hunting season opening in just a few days, this bill is as timely \nas ever.\n  The Sportsmen's Act of 2012 is balanced, it is bipartisan, and it is \nwidely supported. It is also fiscally responsible. The bill has no \ncost.\n  I have been chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus for 2 \nyears. In that time I have had folks from all over the country telling \nme why they love to hunt and fish. They have also told me how outdoor \nactivities support our economy and create new jobs while sustaining old \nones. But they have also told me about how much their outdoor heritage \nmeans to their families and about how concerned they are about losing \nthose traditions.\n  Frankly, they have told me about how frustrated they are with \nWashington and how too many good ideas--ideas from both parties--get \nleft behind because of political gridlock right here. By approving this \nsportsmen's package, we will conserve some of our most productive \nhabitat, pass on our hunting and fishing traditions to future \ngenerations, and entrust the lands and water we share to them.\n  Sportsmen from across the West have been waiting for a bill such as \nthis for a generation--a bill with widespread support that preserves \nour outdoor economy and secures our outdoor heritage for our children \nand grandchildren. I know it is getting close to election season, but \nwe have time left.\n  The time we are working on is the taxpayers' dime, and I think we \nought to get something done. Let's take some good Democratic ideas and \nsome good Republican ideas and pass them. Let's actually do something \nfor the 90 million sportsmen and women who reside in this country and \nbuild our economy. Now is the time.\n  We have an opportunity to take a bill that does good things for this \ncountry across the board that, quite frankly, if a vote was held on \nthis bill today, I am confident would pass with a large bipartisan \nmajority. But as long as we are going to play political games and as \nlong as we are going to hold up legislation, we will never get to the \npoint where we can do what is right by the American people.\n  I urge we get to work and get it done.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, earlier today I voted against invoking \ncloture on the motion to proceed to a 6-month spending bill, a stopgap \nmeasure, and I wish to explain to my colleagues and my constituents why \nI voted that way.\n  I am deeply disappointed that the Senate has been unable to complete \nthe annual appropriations bills on time before the start of the new \nfiscal year. This is a failure that only reinforces the public's \nperception of gridlock in Washington. It is not as if the start of a \nfiscal year is a surprise to Members of this body. It happens every \nyear on October 1. We know the spending authority is going to run out \nand we know one of the most important responsibilities of the Congress \nis to pass the appropriations bills.\n  While the House of Representatives has managed to pass 7 of the 12 \nannual spending bills, the Senate majority leader regrettably has not \nbrought a single regular appropriations bill to the Senate floor for \nconsideration.\n  It is important to note that the Senate Appropriations Committee did \nits job. Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman \nCochran, we have reported 11 of the 12 appropriations bills, in many \ncases with strong bipartisan support. For example, as the ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing \nand Urban Development, and Related Agencies, I worked very closely with \nthe subcommittee's chairman, Senator Patty Murray, to craft a truly \nbipartisan bill for fiscal year 2013. The T-HUD bill strikes a balance \nbetween thoughtful investment and fiscal restraint. In fact, this bill \nhonors an allocation that is nearly $14.5 billion or 22 percent less \nthan fiscal year 2010 levels. These deep cuts reflect an even deeper \ncommitment to getting our fiscal house in order.\n  I am proud of the work Senator Murray and I did on this bill and the \nstrong bipartisan vote of 28 to 1 this bill received from the \nAppropriations Committee this past April. Like our bill, the \nAgriculture appropriations bill, the Commerce, Justice, and Science \nbill, the Department of Defense bill, Energy and Water, Homeland \nSecurity, Legislative Branch, Military Construction and Veterans \nAffairs, and the State Department and Foreign Operations bills were all \nreported from the Appropriations Committee on a bipartisan basis.\n  In putting together all of these bills, the Appropriations Committee \nfunctioned the way committees are supposed to function. We worked \ntogether to develop thoughtful and fiscally responsible bills that \ncould be brought to the full Senate for consideration, debate, \namendment, and, most likely, passage. But, instead, not a single one of \nthose bills--not even those bills for which the counterpart had been \npassed by the full House--was brought to the Senate floor.\n  I am very disappointed that House and Senate leaders have announced \nthat rather than consider and complete these appropriations bills, they \nwould instead kick the can down the road by passing a 6-month stopgap \nfunding bill. The House has done just that and will soon leave town.\n  With 2 weeks left in the fiscal year, it is still not too late. There \nis no reason why the individual spending bills could not be brought to \nthe Senate floor, allowing Senators to offer amendments and letting the \nSenate work its will on this important constitutional responsibility. \nGiven the state of our Nation's economy and the need to ensure that tax \ndollars are wisely and appropriately spent, it is simply unacceptable \nthat we would agree to put our government on autopilot for the next 6 \nmonths rather than working together to establish priorities, make the \ntough choices to evaluate programs, and to restrain spending.\n  Long-term continuing resolutions such as the one we are about to \nconsider represent an abdication of our responsibility and often end up \nwith government departments and agencies, particularly the Department \nof Defense, incurring additional costs due to delays and uncertainty. \nThink how difficult it is for Federal managers to decide whether they \ncan enter into long-term contracts to consider changes in programs, to \nmanage the dollars they have, when they don't know what is going to \nhappen 6 months from now. In some cases we do even shorter continuing \nresolutions that create chaos and additional costs throughout the \nFederal Government.\n  As our Nation struggles to recover and to regain its economic \nfooting, we must provide more certainty by completing appropriations \nbills on time. I am extremely disappointed this did not occur for \nfiscal year 2013 and, therefore, I will continue to oppose the \ncontinuing resolution to protest what I believe is a failure of \nleadership.\n  Let me be clear: I do not support a government shutdown, but it is \nunacceptable that not a single one of the regular appropriations bills \nhas been brought to the Senate floor for consideration. Indeed, it has \nbeen more than 3 years since the Senate has passed a budget. This is \nsimply wrong. We must do our work. The American people deserve better.\n\n\n                             CYBER SECURITY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise as chairman of the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Subcommittee to engage with the ranking member \nof the subcommittee to clarify some apparent confusion on the \ncontinuing resolution provision regarding cyber security.\n  The language in section 137 of this continuing resolution regarding \ncyber security is explicit and clear. The phrase that is apparently in \nquestion refers solely to improvements in the Federal Network Security \nprogram.\n  Federal Network Security is a limited program that provides security\n\n[[Page S6417]]\n\nsystems on Federal government networks.\n  No funds or language expand any Department of Homeland Security \nauthorities.\n  And, none of the funds or language in section 137 have anything to do \nwith regulation of private sector infrastructure, and we have confirmed \nthat in writing with the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Without this provision, the program will be suspended due to lack of \navailable funding and the monitoring of Federal civilian networks will \nbe delayed by as much as 6 months, leaving them vulnerable to \ninfiltration and subsequent breach--and that is all we are trying to \nprevent with this provision.\n  Federal systems are increasingly targeted by individuals, \nsophisticated criminal organizations, and nation states that desire to \ndo us harm. There were 106,000 cyber security incidents on Federal and \nother systems reported in 2011. We should not postpone critical \ninvestments to secure Federal systems.\n  I should also add that this provision is an abbreviated version of \nwhat is contained in both of the House-passed and Senate-reported \nFiscal Year 2013 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bills--\nsomething our Committees have been working on all year.\n  I will now yield to the subcommittee's distinguished ranking member, \nwho I believe agrees with this clarification.\n  Mr. COATS. I concur with the clarification of my distinguished \ncolleague from Louisiana on the continuing resolution funding and \nlanguage regarding cyber security.\n  I strongly support the inclusion of this provision and see it as \nessential, but also limited in scope to only the securing of our \nvulnerable Federal civilian networks.\n  There is clearly disagreement about the best way to address cyber \nsecurity more broadly, but that is a completely separate issue from the \nprovision in this continuing resolution.\n  As a result, I want to make it very clear to my colleagues that this \nprovision does not intrude upon the authorizers' jurisdiction, enable a \nnew Executive order on cyber security, or fund new actions to regulate \nprivate sector infrastructure in any way.\n  Again, I thank the Chairman for yielding to me on this issue, and I \nyield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the ranking member for his concurrence. I \nconcur with his remarks.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Recognizing Nebraska Heroes\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I am here today to recognize two \nincredible heroes from Blue Hill, NE, for their courageous actions \namidst a terrible tragedy.\n  On September 5, an accident between a schoolbus and a semitrailer \nclaimed the lives of four members of this close-knit farming community \nin Webster County, NE. My thoughts and my prayers continue to be with \nthe victims, their loved ones, and the entire Blue Hill community \nduring this very tragic time.\n  But through the sorrow of this terrible tragedy, a story has emerged \nthat truly epitomizes the word ``hero.'' As one Nebraska newspaper \nsaid:\n\n       By the grace of God, not all of the kids riding the bus \n     home from school [have been] buried. But their fates could \n     have been much different, if not for two guardian angels.\n\n  There were five other students riding the bus on that day who, \nbecause of the selfless actions of two brave men, are still alive \ntoday. Ron Meyer and Phil Petr arrived on this horrific scene just \nmoments after the crash. Immediately, the two bravely ran onto the \nburning bus, risking their own lives to save the lives of others. They \nswiftly and courageously pulled five children to safety. A nearby \nrancher who witnessed their actions said he is sure the five survivors \nwould have encountered a much different fate had Ron and Phil not been \nthere that day. They are guardian angels whose heroic actions will \nnever be forgotten.\n  There were other heroes who arrived on the scene and acted quickly to \nprovide care--first responders who also deserve to be commended. First \nresponders risk their lives to save others each and every day, just as \nour gratitude to them should be expressed throughout the year. But \nspecial recognition is owed to average citizens who happen upon \nhorrific scenes and take heroic action.\n  Although Ron and Phil would never ask for it, many in this community \nhave called for their heroism to be recognized and to be honored, and I \ncould not agree more. Their willingness to risk their own lives to save \nothers serves as a source of inspiration for all of us.\n  I am honored to call them my fellow Nebraskans, and I want to \npersonally thank them. I thank them for their courage and their \nselflessness.\n  Acknowledging their heroism in no way lifts the grief and the sorrow \nthat gripped the community and our State after this crash.\n  I pray that God brings peace and healing to all those who have been \naffected. But because of Ron and Phil, my prayer is also a prayer of \ngratitude.\n  I thank God for these heroes. I know that no recognition can \nadequately convey the gratitude felt by the families of the five \nchildren whom they saved from that burning bus.\n  Mr. President, I stand before you today on behalf of the Blue Hill \ncommunity and all of my fellow Nebraskans to offer my deepest \nappreciation to Ron Meyer and Phil Petr.\n  May God bless them and God bless all those affected by this terrible \ncrash.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are trying to work through and finish all \nthe issues we need to address before we can finish this work period. I \nwish to make it very clear to everyone, as I said a couple hours ago on \nthe floor, that we can finish all our work tomorrow. But if we don't \nfinish it tomorrow, we are going to continue to work on Friday, \nSaturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, until late in the afternoon.\n  We have to get done a few things that are important. I know there are \na lot of things we aren't going to be able to do, but that has been the \nway it has been all Congress. I am prepared now to ask consent to move \nalong on one very significant part of what we need to do. The consent I \nwill read into the Record in just in a short time addresses voting on a \ncontinuing resolution we need to keep the government running. It \naddresses votes on very different concerns of others who have sought to \nhold up consideration on the continuing resolution. I believe, with \nthis consent, we have gone that extra mile.\n  The junior Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Paul, has been said to be \nholding up everything. We have two American Ambassadors, one to Iraq \nand one to Pakistan, and one would think we should be able to get this \ndone. We have had something extremely important sponsored by, I think, \n81 Senators, a containment resolution relating to Iran. So without \nbelaboring the point, I have worked things out with Senator Paul, and \nwe are going to have a vote on something he has wanted a vote on for a \nlong time. We can do that.\n  I explained to a few Republicans earlier today--in fact, some last \nnight--that I was working with Senator Paul and I think we have done \nthat. He has been reasonable, and even though ideologically I sometimes \ndisagree with him, I have always found him to be someone I can talk to. \nSo I will be terribly disappointed if this person, whom it has been \nsaid by the Republicans appears to be holding up everything, now isn't \nholding up everything and that the Republicans, if there is an \nobjection to this, are just hiding behind him because there is no \nreason we shouldn't\n\n[[Page S6418]]\n\nbe able to move forward with this legislation.\n\n\n  Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3576, S.J. Res. 41, and H.J. Res. 117\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding cloture \nhaving been invoked, at a time to be determined by me, after \nconsultation with Senator McConnell, it be in order and the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 3576, which is the legislation I \nhave just referred to by Senator Paul, the text of which is at the \ndesk; that there be up to 60 minutes of debate, equally divided between \nSenators Paul and Kerry or their designees; that upon the use or \nyielding back of that time, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of \nthe bill; that the vote on passage be subject to a 60-vote affirmative \nthreshold; that if the bill does not achieve 60 affirmative votes, it \nbe considered as having been read twice, placed on the calendar; that \nfollowing the vote on passage of that legislation, S. 3576, the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 418, S.J. Res. 41; that \nthere be up to 60 minutes of debate equally divided between Senators \nKerry and Paul or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back \nof that time, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the joint \nresolution; that if the joint resolution is not passed, it be returned \nto the calendar; that following the vote on the joint resolution, the \nSenate resume consideration of H.J. Res. 117, the continuing \nresolution; that the motion to proceed be agreed to, there be up to 60 \nminutes of debate, equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees prior to a vote on passage of the joint resolution; that the \nvote on passage be subject to a 60-vote affirmative threshold; that \nfollowing the vote, the majority leader be recognized; and, finally, \nthat no amendments, motions or points of order be in order during the \nconsideration of these measures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I appreciate \nthe majority leader's attempt to put several of these items together. I \nwould note that our side has only had a little over an hour to try to \nwork this through our membership. I know there is one objection that I \nwill need to interpose, but I would encourage the majority leader to \nmeet with Senator McConnell when he is available so they can continue \nto work on this as a potential way to proceed. But at this time, on \nbehalf of Senator John McCain, I will interpose an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to everyone within the sound of my voice, I \nsay again, we shouldn't be surprised. Even though there had been all \nthis focus on Senator Paul, that he was holding up everything, that is \nnot the way it is. He is not holding up everything. It is the \nRepublicans.\n  All this has been cleared on my side. It is unfortunate. We will \ncontinue to work to reach an agreement. We need to move this vote on \nthe CR. Unless we have some agreement, it is going to occur at 8:45 \ntomorrow night, which is when the 30 hours expires. So I think we need \nto continue to see if we can work our way through the logjam the \nRepublicans have put up here.\n  If nothing happens, we will be out of here in a little bit tonight \nand proceed to vote tomorrow night. But Rand Paul is not holding up \nthings, as has been rumored around here for weeks.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 8 and S. 3412\n\n  Mr. President, on July 25, the Senate conducted two important votes \non dealing with the so-called fiscal cliff. That day the Senate voted \non extension of the tax cuts enacted in 2001, 2003, and 2009. \nDemocrats, and a majority of the Senate, voted to extend tax cuts for \n98 percent of American families while at the same time reducing the \ndeficit by $1 trillion over 10 years. Republicans, on the other hand, \ninsisted on a vote on their plan--a plan that provided tax breaks \naveraging $160,000 for millionaires at the same time it increased taxes \nby $1,000 for 25 million American middle-class families. On July 25, we \nheld votes on those two plans. The Senate voted down the Republican \nplan on a bipartisan basis by a vote of 45 to 54. The Senate passed the \nDemocrats' plan by a vote of 51 to 48.\n  Since then, the House of Representatives also voted on this matter \nand the House sent the Senate its revenue measure. Now that we have had \nthe debate and the votes, it is time to go to conference with the \nHouse. The Senate has voted and so has the House. It is time for us to \nresolve our differences. We believe the tax extenders should not apply \nto people making more than $250,000 a year. We should extend them for \npeople making less than $250,000 a year. So let's have a conference on \nthis. This process would be important.\n  Unfortunately, I am sorry to say, my Republican friends often place \nroadblocks in the way of routine Senate business. This is simply \nroutine. Just last week, Moody's said it would probably cut America's \ncredit rating if congressional leaders couldn't reach an agreement to \naddress the fiscal cliff and produce long-term deficit reduction. The \nbill the Senate passed in July is a big part of dealing with that \nfiscal cliff and the American people deserve their leaders to move to \nadvance this legislation, and that is why I am going to ask the \nfollowing consent, which is simply going to conference on a bill that \nhas passed the House and a bill that has passed the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 502, H.R. 8; that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken and the text of S. 3412, a bill extending the tax cuts I have \nreferred to in 2001, 2003, and 2009 for 98 percent of Americans and 97 \npercent of all small businesses, which passed the Senate on July 25, be \ninserted in lieu thereof; that the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime and passed; the Senate insist on its amendment, request a \nconference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses; \nand the chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate, consisting of the membership of the Finance Committee; with all \nof the above occurring with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent the agreement be modified so that rather than \namending H.R. 8, that bill--namely H.R. 8--would be considered read a \nthird time and passed. This request would let that bill go directly to \nthe President's desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope the Record can pick up the smile on \nmy face. Why in the world--when the Senate has already acted, with a \nmajority of the Senate saying we do not believe there should be taxes \nextended to the rich; that we believe in protecting the middle class--\nwould we agree to extending all these tax cuts? We can't do that. That \nwas a bipartisan vote set out in the Senate. That was the Senate's \nposition.\n  We are asking simply to go to conference on the Senate's position. \nThe other side is insisting the minority position prevail. That is an \nunusual situation and that is not the way democracy in America works. \nSo I would not accept his modification to my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's original \nrequest?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, the unanimous consent \nrequest of the majority leader is that we have 60 minutes, equally \ndivided, in a vote on the Rand amendment. Is that part of the unanimous \nconsent?\n  Mr. REID. It would be 60 minutes on the amendment, equally divided \nbetween Senator Kerry and Senator Paul. If the Senator wants more time, \nand we are not doing much now, we could have more time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would hope the majority leader would have some \nunderstanding that we are talking about cutting off aid to several \ncountries that are allies which could have an incredible effect on the \nentire Middle East. The majority leader wants to have 60 minutes, \nequally divided, on a measure that, if passed, would have the most \nDraconian effects on the entire Middle East, a part of the world that \nis in turmoil now. The majority leader wants to have 60 minutes, \nequally divided, and with no amendments, obviously, as it is the \nmajority leader's practice not to allow any amendments. I may want to \nhave a side-by-side. This is an issue of the utmost gravity and the \nutmost importance and the majority leader wants to have an hour, \nequally divided.\n\n[[Page S6419]]\n\n  It is absolutely mind-boggling, and I think if we are going to cut \noff all aid to several of our allies, including the Camp David \nagreements which call for aid to Egypt, including an ally in the region \ncalled Libya where we just lost our brave Ambassador--and the majority \nleader wants to have 60 minutes equally divided and with no one allowed \nto have any amendments, second degree, side-by-side, and then says \nRepublicans are at fault?\n  I say to the majority leader, I have watched this Senate deteriorate \nin a way that is almost spectacular. Here we are on the day before the \nmajority leader wants us to go out of session, and we are supposed to \njust have a vote on an amendment that has the most profound effect on \nthis Nation's security, with 60 minutes equally divided.\n  I don't have a smile on my face, I tell the majority leader. I have a \nlook of incredulous dismay and disgust.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it would seem to me that the Senator's \nconcern should be directed toward Senator Paul, not me. It sounds to me \nhe may vote against the Paul amendment from what I have heard. If he is \nthat concerned about it, I think we should get it up, and if we want \nmore time, we could have more time on it. But at this stage, no \namendments would be called for, and I think we should vote on the Paul \namendment.\n  I think it is pretty clear as to what has gone on this past Congress. \nWhen the Republican leader says his No. 1 issue is to make sure Obama \ndoesn't get reelected, I think that probably is what has held up this \nCongress from doing all kinds of things.\n  Now, let me rewind. Since I have been the majority leader--which has \nbeen 6 years--we have had to try to overcome 380 Republican \nfilibusters. This is two now. During the same period of time--6 years--\nthat Lyndon Johnson was President--and he was majority leader before he \nbecame President--he had to file cloture once.\n  My friend from Arizona and I have served together now 30 years in the \nCongress. His agitation should not be directed toward me. They are the \nones holding up hundreds of bills in the Energy Committee and basically \neverything we have tried to do because their No. 1 goal, if they follow \ntheir leader--and they have done a pretty good job doing that--has been \nto make sure the country is in such a shape that maybe they may get \nlucky and have Governor Romney elected.\n  So if there is going to be objection by the assistant majority \nleader, I understand that. But don't be blaming Rand Paul for \neverything being held up.\n  Here is what we have held up, and I will mention it just briefly. \nWouldn't it be nice if America had an ambassador to Iraq? Wouldn't it \nbe nice if America had an ambassador to Pakistan? Wouldn't it be nice \nif a piece of legislation that has 81 cosponsors dealing with the Iran \ncontainment resolution, that we could vote on that?\n  So as I have indicated--and this will be the third time today--we \nhave work to do--not a lot but we have work to do. One is to pass the \ncontinuing resolution, and we will do that. We can either do it the \nhard way or the easy way. As you know from the vote on the motion to \nproceed to that, there is overwhelming support for that. That is as \nbipartisan as anything could be. The Speaker and I worked on this with \nour staffs, and we came up with something I think is pretty fair. So we \nare going to pass that. If the Republicans want to stall on that like \nthey have on everything else, they can do that. But we are going to \nfinish this.\n  The American people need that done, and we are going to get it done. \nIt may take a vote on Saturday, it may take one on Sunday, but we are \ngoing to finish the CR. So everybody should understand we are not going \nanyplace. My No. 1 place to go is the Senate. That is my life, the \nSenate. So I am going to be here and make sure that we do as much of \nthe people's business as we can, in spite of their No. 1 goal being to \ndefeat Obama rather than trying to legislate for the American people.\n  As I understand it, the request that I made has been objected to, and \nthe request of the Senator from Arizona has been objected to; is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader's original request, H.R. \n8, has not been objected to.\n  Mr. KYL. And the leader is right with regard to intentions. His \nintention was to object to my request; mine is to object to his \nrequest. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. So we have dual objections.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The majority leader.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Request--\n                           H.R. 9 and S. 3521\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last month the Senate Finance Committee \nreported bipartisan legislation on what are called the tax extenders.\n  The Finance Committee tax extender legislation addresses a \nsignificant part of the so-called fiscal cliff. The Finance Committee \nbill would extend relief from the alternative minimum tax through 2013. \nIt would extend tax incentives for renewable energy and energy \nconservation through 2013, and it would extend through 2013 the \ntraditional extenders, among which are the R tax credit, the State \nand local sales tax deduction, and the tuition deduction.\n  The Finance Committee reported that bill with a strong bipartisan \nvote of 19 to 5. The bill cuts taxes by $205 billion. It cuts taxes by \n$143 billion in fiscal year 2013 alone. Passing this bill today would \nhelp remove some of the uncertainties surrounding tax policy. Passing \nthis bill today would help our economy. Passing this bill is the least \nwe should do now.\n  So I ask unanimous consent the Senate Finance Committee be discharged \nfrom further consideration of H.R. 9; that a Baucus amendment, which is \nat the desk, the text of which is identical to S. 3251, the Family and \nBusiness Tax Cut Certainty Act of 2012 as reported by the Finance \nCommittee, be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with \nno intervening action or debate, and any statements related to the bill \nbe placed in the Record at the appropriate place as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is our view \nthat the extension of many provisions of the Tax Code, which is the \nsubject of the leader's request, makes some sense if we extend all of \nthe provisions of the Tax Code we can.\n  With that in mind, I ask that the consent be modified so that the \ntext of House-passed bill H.R. 8 be added to the substitute referred to \nby the leader; further, that the bill then be read a third time and \npassed as amended.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have already reached that position. That \nis not how things work in a democracy or, I doubt, anyplace else. So I \nobject to my friend's suggested modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. KYL. We would also then object to the original request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, would the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. Sure.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am not against the Rand Paul amendment \nbeing voted on by the Senate. I do object to an hour equally divided. I \nobject to the fact that we do not have either side-by-side or second-\ndegree amendments, which is the normal parliamentary procedure.\n  Since the majority leader had to inject the ``No. 1 objective is \ndefeat Barack Obama'' routine again, I would like to point out this is \nthe least productive Congress since 1947; that for the first time in 51 \nyears we are not taking up the Defense authorization bill; for the \nfirst time in 51 years, when we are fighting a war in Afghanistan, that \nwe can't find the time in the Senate to take up the bill that is so \nimportant to the security of this Nation.\n  So the majority leader shouldn't be proud of his record, as he \nmentioned, including the fact that this Congress is the least \nproductive since 1947. But most of all, in 50 years--in 50 years--we \nhave not taken up the Defense authorization bill that we have taken up \nfor 50 years because other majority leaders who set the calendar have \nunderstood its importance to the men and women who are serving in the \nmilitary and our national security.\n  I again urge that instead of this back-and-forth and mutual \nobjections and nothing getting done around here--I know and the \nmajority leader knows we could take up the Defense authorization bill \nand get it done in a matter\n\n[[Page S6420]]\n\nof a few days, and we could have since June. But instead we do this \nback-and-forth, which makes us the least productive Congress since \n1947, with an approval rating by the American people that deservedly is \nin the single digits.\n  So I repeat: I would be glad to enter into a unanimous consent \nagreement on the Rand amendment, although I would also tell the \nmajority leader that we may now be establishing a precedent that one \nSenator can hold up the entire Senate until that Senator gets the vote \nhe is demanding.\n  I could hold up the Senate and demand a vote on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, which was reported to this body in June. Senator Kyl \ncould hold this body hostage for a vote because of the various pieces \nof legislation they have. I am not doing that, but I am saying when we \nare looking at an issue as serious to this Nation's security as cutting \noff all aid in one fell swoop without even amending, or with an hour of \ndiscussion, I think it is almost incredible that we would consider such \na parliamentary procedure when we are talking about what is at stake.\n  So I hope we can work out an agreement. I don't feel like staying \nhere this weekend either, but I also have some concern about the safety \nand security of the men and women who are serving in our diplomatic \ncorps overseas because if that amendment did pass, I guarantee you, you \nwould see a reaction in these countries if we announce arbitrarily that \nwe are cutting off all aid to them.\n  So I think we ought to understand the consequences of the Rand \namendment, and it probably would take more than an hour equally \ndivided.\n  I thank the majority leader for listening.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to my friend--and he is my friend for whom I \nhave admiration and respect--the senior Senator from Arizona makes my \ncase. He is absolutely right. This is, I am sorry to say, the least \nproductive Congress perhaps ever. Why? Because everything we have tried \nto do they have objected to. Everything.\n  Once in a while we are able to work together to get something done, \nbut he has made my case for me, absolutely, because their No. 1 goal \nhas been to defeat the President of the United States for reelection.\n  Now, we have had a lot of debates. Senator Paul has been here many \ntimes talking about this issue. I have no lock on wisdom around here. \nThere are a lot of people who have much more wisdom than I do. But I do \nhave the obligation to try to move legislation along on things that we \nhave to work on here. If people want more time on this, fine. I have \nworked with Senator Paul. He has agreed to this. If there are some \nreasonable changes, I will agree to those. I am not locked in. But \nwhoever wants to do this, I would suggest they go to Senator Paul, not \nto me. I am happy to be a conduit to try to get something done that is \nreasonable and fair.\n  If an hour is too short, we haven't been doing much today, there is \nplenty of time to debate legislation. So I am happy to do that.\n  Mr. President, I understand the rules of the Senate fairly well. This \nis not the first time a Senator has held things up. I came here during \nthe days of the Senator from Ohio, Howard Metzenbaum, and he was pretty \ngood at slowing things down and holding things up. Jesse Helms was \nreally good at it, and we have had a number of others.\n  So as I have said on the Senate floor, I think we should change some \nrules around here. I am not for getting rid of the filibuster. I don't \nwant to get rid of the filibuster, but we need to change the filibuster \nrule. Why should we have, on every piece of legislation, a motion to \nproceed? It takes the Senate a week to get on a bill when a single \nSenator objects to it. That doesn't sound very good to me.\n\n  I hope with a new Congress we can change some of the rules around \nhere. But I am happy to work with my friend from Arizona. I know he is \nsomeone who travels the world. He has been in the forefront of changes \nthat have taken place in this world. I understand his concern about \nthis legislation.\n  If he has something else he thinks might work better than this, talk \nto Senator Paul. I am always reachable, any time of the night or day.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I make a response to the leader?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I believe it is not Senator Paul who sets the parameters \nfor how many hours of debate and amendments and others; I believe it is \nthe majority leader. Could I talk to the majority leader about how long \nthe debate should be or whether we can have amendments? That is all I \nam saying.\n  Mr. REID. I will say this so it will save a lot of trouble for \nanybody. We are not going to have amendments to this. Amendment days \nare over. We have been blindsided many times on amendments.\n  I will be happy if my friend can come up with something that will \nallow maybe a side-by-side or something. I will be happy to do that. I \nam open to negotiations in any way that is reasonable. If someone does \nnot want to contact Rand Paul, I will--if somebody feels awkward doing \nthat, I do not. I feel totally free to talk to any Senator about \nanything. That is why I reached out to Rand Paul.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I might continue, I think the point is \nthis unanimous consent was made before everyone had been fully \nconsulted. I appreciate the leader is trying to move things along, but \nit does illustrate the proposition that everyone needs to be consulted \nso the question of time and potential other considerations could be \ndealt with. I suspect, through the leader's good offices, that will be \ndone this evening and tomorrow morning. Perhaps something can be worked \nout, as I said when I interposed my objection.\n  But one point I wanted to make is this. The objection I interposed on \nbehalf of Senator McCain tonight has nothing whatsoever to do with the \nRomney campaign against President Obama. We just heard my colleague, \nSenator McCain, talking about the concerns he has cutting off aid cold \nturkey to some very important countries in the world in the middle of a \ncrisis.\n  Who will be another speaker raising those same concerns tomorrow? Our \nDemocratic colleague, Senator Kerry. This is a bipartisan question of \nwhether this is the right policy for our country. I suspect the Obama \nadministration and the President himself would generally be supportive \nof the position expressed by Senator McCain and Senator Kerry.\n  I wish we could have a conversation around here, just once, without \nhaving it portrayed as some kind of partisan political exercise. This \nis not a partisan political exercise. It is a question of reasonable \npeople having different views about what the best policy is, and the \nlives of Americans are on the line so it needs to be considered \ncarefully, thoroughly, and with other options possibly being raised. \nThat is what my colleague Senator McCain is saying. That is why I \ninterposed the objection on his behalf.\n  I do think, if the parties can get together tonight, tomorrow, \npotentially work out a way to approach the issue so it can be debated \nfor the appropriate length of time and any alternatives presented, then \nwe could move on with things. But let's do it in the context of the \nissue before us, not suggesting it has something to do with the \nPresidential campaign because that would be incorrect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the reason I went into that is because my \nfriend Senator McCain talked about how little we have accomplished. I \ndidn't bring that up. I indicated why we have accomplished so little.\n  I also say to my two Republican friends who are on the floor--there \nare three actually--this: The resolution, a piece of legislation that \nSenator Paul is putting forward, I am not going to vote for it. Senator \nPaul knows that. Democrats are not going to vote for this. The problem \nis the Republicans are split, not us. They are split. Their own caucus \nis split on what to do with the Paul amendment, not us.\n  I am happy to work with everybody. I have conferred. I say to the \nRepublican assistant leader, I talked to my leadership team this \nmorning. I talked to my caucus today about this. Republicans have a \ncaucus the same time we do and they knew, and they knew before the \ncaucus because everybody knew, what was going on with this. It was no \nsecret. I talked to Republican Senators before their caucus. This is no \nsurprise.\n  The hour time I put was arbitrary. I acknowledge that. If somebody \nwants more time to debate this issue, I am fine. I don't care.\n\n[[Page S6421]]\n\n  I appreciate my friends' involvement, both of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                       Disclosure of Tax Returns\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as a matter of senatorial courtesy, \nsince I am referring to some things that the majority leader has said \npreviously, not recently but previously, I have informed him of what I \nwas going to say.\n  On August 2, the majority leader decided that the valuable time of \nthis body would be best employed by speculating on the contents of the \ntax returns of Presidential candidate Governor Mitt Romney. These \nremarks also touched on the vetting process of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. It is that aspect of this to which I want to refer.\n  As a senior member of the Finance Committee as well as former \nchairman and ranking member, I have come to familiarize my colleagues \nwith the committee's vetting process.\n  On Thursday, August 2, the majority leader exclaimed:\n\n       As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns. If a \n     person coming before this body wanted to be a Cabinet \n     officer, he couldn't be if he had the same refusal Mitt \n     Romney does about tax returns.\n\n  This statement demonstrates a misunderstanding of the confirmation \nprocess for Cabinet officials and the Finance Committee vetting process \nin particular. The fact is, most prospective Cabinet officers do not \nneed to disclose their tax returns. Actually, no prospective Cabinet \nofficer is required to make their returns public in ordinary \ncircumstances. To my knowledge, the Finance Committee is the only \ncommittee that asks nominees to provide copies of tax returns. \nSpecifically, the Finance Committee asks that nominees provide copies \nof their last three Federal tax returns. The committee may request \nfurther returns if it is warranted by the circumstances of that \nparticular time.\n\n  The committee asks for this information for a few reasons. To begin \nwith, many nominees referred to the Finance Committee, such as the \nSecretary of Treasury and the Commissioner of the IRS, will be able to \nexercise significant influence over tax policy and administration. \nAdditionally, the examination of a nominee's tax return sheds light on \nthe nominee's character. Over the last few years, several high flyers \nin the Obama administration have come up short when measured by their \ntax returns. Therefore, the vetting process utilized by the Finance \nCommittee has received a lot of attention.\n  Only two Cabinet officers and one position with the status of Cabinet \nrank are referred to the Finance Committee. These are the Secretaries \nof Treasury and the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as \nthe U.S. Trade Representative. As I said before, to my knowledge, the \nFinance Committee is the only committee of the Senate to request copies \nof actual tax returns. This means that not counting the Vice President, \nthere are 19 members of the Cabinet who do not release their tax \nreturns during the Senate confirmation process.\n  As I said, no Cabinet official is required to make his or her tax \nreturns public. This goes to the details of the Finance Committee's \nvetting process. All nominees referred to the committee are required to \nsubmit copies of their last three filed tax returns. These copies, \nalong with other financial data, are shared with a very limited number \nof staff, specifically designated by the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Senate Finance Committee.\n  While being reviewed, the returns themselves are kept under a very \ntight control. Most staff for the committee and ranking member do not \nhave access to the tax returns. Neither the chairman nor the ranking \nmember may unilaterally release the tax returns or information obtained \nfrom those tax returns. This means that even when I was chairman of the \ncommittee, rules prohibited me from unilaterally releasing a nominee's \ntax return or even making public that nominee's specific tax \ninformation.\n  When an issue is identified pertaining to a nominee's tax \ninformation, the chairman and the ranking member jointly determine how \nto proceed. Information is only released under bipartisan agreement and \nafter consultation with the nominee.\n  For example, Secretary Geithner was given the opportunity to withdraw \nhis nomination before the world learned of his failure to pay all his \ntaxes. He was also provided an opportunity to review the bipartisan \nmemo the committee eventually released.\n  In sum then, no nominee vetted by the Finance Committee needs to make \ntheir tax returns public, and in the majority of the cases no \ninformation is released. Additionally, the purpose of the vetting is \nnot to damage the credibility of the nominee. I bet those seeking \nGovernor Romney's tax returns are operating under a completely \ndifferent standard. I especially find it interesting that the majority \nleader compared Governor Romney to Cabinet officials when speculating \nas to the contents of Governor Romney's returns. There seems to be an \nimplication that a discovery of unsatisfied tax obligations would be \nproblematic to the leader. While the majority leader may want to \nspeculate as to whether Governor Romney has paid his taxes, there are \nnominees and officials of the current administration we know did not \ncompletely satisfy their tax obligations.\n  I will start this trip down memory lane with our current Treasury \nSecretary. Due in large part to his failure to pay self-employment \ntaxes, irregularities in Mr. Geithner's returns added up to his owing a \ntotal of $48,268 in taxes and interest to the IRS. Those seeking a full \naccounting of the episode may read the bipartisan memorandum prepared \nby the Finance Committee, which is part of the record of his January \n2009 nomination hearing. As I said, we don't need to speculate whether \nSecretary Geithner completely paid his taxes. We know as a fact he did \nnot, to the tune of over $48,000.\n  Secretary Kathleen Sebelius disclosed that in preparation of her \nconfirmation she filed amended tax returns for 2005, 2006, and 2007. \nShe voluntarily made this information public in the form of a letter to \nChairman Baucus and me. This letter was printed in the record of her \nnomination hearing. The result of those amended returns was that she \npaid a total of $7,040 in additional taxes and $878 in interest to the \nInternal Revenue Service.\n  Finally, I wish to mention former Senator Tom Daschle, who was the \nadministration's nominee to be Secretary of HHS for a brief period of \ntime in 2009. Although Mr. Daschle withdrew his nomination before the \ncommittee held a hearing on his nomination, it was widely reported, \nincluding in the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times, that he \nfailed to pay more than $128,000 in taxes in the 3 years prior to his \nnomination.\n  In mentioning Secretaries Geithner and Sebelius and Mr. Daschle, I am \nnot suggesting anything beyond the reported facts of their \ncircumstances or that their tax errors were intentional. I just want to \nremind the majority leader of these situations where it is not \nnecessary to speculate on whether taxes were owed.\n  While I appreciate the leader's newfound attention to the Finance \nCommittee's vetting process, I wish to assure everyone has clear \nunderstanding of how this vetting process in the Senate Finance \nCommittee works. I will be happy to discuss the committee's procedure \nwith any interested colleague. I am sure Ranking Member Hatch and his \nstaff would also be happy to discuss the process with anyone who was \ninterested.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           A Higher Standard\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I extend my appreciation to \nthe senior Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley. He indicated he was going \nto say a few things about me and he told me beforehand, and I \nappreciate that. That is the way the Senate should operate. So I \nappreciate very much my friend from Iowa doing that.\n  He came to the floor and, in effect, said that I said--I have said it \non a number of occasions, but he picked one date--that Governor Romney \ncould not be confirmed as a Cabinet officer because to be a Cabinet \nofficer, you have\n\n[[Page S6422]]\n\nto give at least 3 years of your tax returns. Sometimes they ask for \nmore. So my friend Senator Grassley came to the floor and suggested he \ncould be confirmed. Well, not really. The Senator from Iowa conceded my \npoint. Mitt Romney could not be confirmed for Treasury Secretary. He \ncould not be confirmed as Secretary of Health and Human Services. He \ncould not be confirmed as Trade Representative. He could not even be \nconfirmed as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Public Affairs and \na number of other positions.\n  But there is a larger point to be made here. And why they would bring \nthis up again I do not know, but they did. But there is a larger point \nto be made here. When you are running for the highest office in the \nland--President of the United States--you are also held to a higher \nstandard of conduct than someone who wants to be a Cabinet officer or \nsub-Cabinet officer who gives us their tax returns.\n  The least Mitt Romney owes the American people--the least he owes \nthem--is some honesty and openness. That we do not have.\n  The Senator from Iowa is correct about one thing--and this is what he \nsaid: The contents of a candidate's taxes do speak volumes about his \ncharacter. That is what Senator Grassley said, and I agree with him.\n  Let's not forget, Mitt Romney could solve this problem tomorrow--\ntonight--by releasing his tax returns, which he refuses to do. Why?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6422-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

The Association is an independent \nalliance of institutions that preserve the papers of Members of \nCongress and use those papers to promote the study of Congress.\n  Congress Week's theme this year is ``Congress: Chosen by the \nPeople.'' Congress is the only branch of the Federal Government that is \nelected by the people. It is important, as Members of Congress, to \nmanage and preserve our own papers for future historical research and \nstudy of our democracy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nPresident of the Association of Centers for the Study of Congress and \nthe Chair of the Congressional Papers Roundtable about Congress Week be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                   September 2012.\n       Dear Member of Congress: In honor of Congress Week (16-22 \n     September 2012), the Congressional Papers Roundtable (CPR) \n     and the Association of Centers for the Study of Congress \n     (ACSC) encourage you to remember H. Con. Res. 307 (5 March \n     2008), ``expressing the sense of Congress that Members' \n     Congressional papers should be properly maintained and \n     encouraging Members to take all necessary precautions to \n     manage and preserve these papers.''\n       Established in 1986, the Congressional Papers Roundtable is \n     composed of members of the Society of American Archivists who \n     work with or have an interest in the papers of members of \n     Congress and the records of Congress. CPR provides a forum \n     for discussing developments and developing guidelines in the \n     preservation and management of congressional papers and \n     records.\n       In 2003, ACSC was founded as an independent alliance of \n     institutions and organizations that support a wide range of \n     programs designed to inform and educate students, scholars, \n     policy-makers, and members of the general public on the \n     history of Congress, legislative process, and current issues \n     facing Congress. ACSC encourages the preservation of material \n     that documents the work of Congress, including the papers of \n     representatives and senators, and supports programs that make \n     those materials available for educational and research use. \n     The association also welcomes the participation of \n     institutions and individuals committed to the goal of \n     promoting a better understanding of Congress.\n       ACSC has sponsored an annual celebration of ``Congress \n     Week'' since 2009. The central goal of this national \n     initiative is to foster the study of the U.S. House and \n     Senate, and to promote a wider appreciation for the vital \n     role the legislative branch plays in our representative \n     democracy. This year's theme, ``Congress: Chosen by the \n     People,'' is drawn directly from language in the Constitution \n     and emphasizes that Congress is the only branch directly \n     elected by the people. During Congress Week, ACSC members and \n     participating organizations will feature a range of events \n     including lectures and exhibits to highlight the role of \n     legislative branch and the participatory role of citizens in \n     registering to vote, staying informed on issues, and making \n     one's opinions known to members of Congress.\n       Every day, the House and Senate make significant \n     contributions to our nation's history. As a Member of \n     Congress, the archival preservation of your papers is a long-\n     lasting form of service to constituents in your state and \n     throughout the nation. We urge you to embrace the tenets of \n     H. Con. Res. 307:\n       (1) Members' Congressional papers (including papers of \n     Delegates and Resident Commissioners to the Congress) should \n     be properly maintained;\n       (2) each Member of Congress should take all necessary \n     measures to manage and preserve the Member's own \n     Congressional papers; and\n       (3) each Member of Congress should be encouraged to arrange \n     for the deposit or donation of the Member's own noncurrent \n     Congressional papers with a research institution that is \n     properly equipped to care for them, and to make these papers \n     available for educational purposes at a time the Member \n     considers appropriate.\n       Documenting our democracy through the preservation of the \n     record created by Congress is the work of many. In addition \n     to the efforts of the National Archives, the endeavor \n     involves the efforts of libraries, archival repositories, \n     historical societies, and congressional and public policy \n     centers in every state across the nation. We cannot succeed \n     without you. Please take steps to preserve the historical \n     legacy of your state and nation as represented in the records \n     generated by your congressional office.\n           Sincerely,\n     Leigh McWhite, Chair,\n       Congressional Papers Roundtable, Society Association of \n     American Archivists and Political Papers Archivist, \n     University of Mississippi.\n     Sheryl B.

TAULBEE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor to report to my \ncolleagues some sad news. A brave Kentucky law-enforcement officer has \nfallen in the line of duty. Officer Mark A. Taulbee of the Hodgenville, \nKY, police department was killed on Sunday, September 16, when his \npolice vehicle crashed during the pursuit of a suspect.\n  Officer Taulbee had been with the Hodgenville Police Department for \n13 months. Prior to that, he had been a deputy with the Butler County \nSheriff's Department for 3 years. He is survived by his wife Elizabeth \nand two children, Audra and Austin.\n  Officer Taulbee upheld a great tradition of service and sacrifice \nthat is observed by the many men and women in local, State, and \nnational law enforcement across America. Our country owes them a debt \nof gratitude for putting their lives on the line to protect us and our \ncommunities.\n  Tragically, Officer Taulbee is the first and only Hodgenville police \nofficer ever lost in the performance of his duty. Across America, 84 \nlaw enforcement officers have fallen in the line of duty in 2012. That \nincludes two from the Commonwealth of Kentucky, out of a total of \napproximately 7,800 sworn law enforcement officers statewide.\n  I know my Senate colleagues will join me in sending my deepest \nsympathies to Officer Taulbee's family and his colleagues at the \nHodgenville Police Department. We have the deepest admiration and \nrespect for police officers in every community across America.\n  We recognize theirs is both an honorable job and a dangerous one. \nThey bravely risk their lives for ours, and America appreciates \neverything they do. We cannot be grateful enough for them and their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, a recent article appeared on the Web site of \ntelevision news station WAVE-3 of Louisville paying tribute to Officer \nTaulbee and noting the loss felt by his fellow officers. I ask \nunanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From WAVE3.com, Sept. 18, 2012]\n\n           Hodgenville Police Chief Remembers Fallen Officer\n\n       Hodgenville, KY (WAVE).--Services have been set for a \n     Hodgenville police officer who died in the line of duty.\n       Officer Mark Taulbee, 44, had been a long-time law-\n     enforcement officer in eastern Kentucky before moving to \n     Hodgenville a little more than a year ago.\n       Despite being at the department a short time, the chief \n     said Officer Taulbee had a lasting impact on the police \n     force.\n       ``Just like family. It's really hard,'' said Hodgenville \n     Police Chief Steve Johnson. ``We're very tight, and it's been \n     a shock to all of us.''\n       The police department of five now prepares to say goodbye \n     to one of its own.\n       ``I am thinking this is the only officer we've ever lost in \n     the line of duty,'' Johnson said.\n       A makeshift memorial of crosses can be found where the \n     crash happened.\n       Taulbee was chasing a suspect around 3:00 Saturday morning.\n       In the midst of the case, another call came into 911. ``A \n     lady said a police car had wrecked in front of her house and \n     the officer was laying outside the vehicle,'' Johnson said.\n       Taulbee was rushed to a hospital. ``His wife was working at \n     Hardin Memorial Hospital when he arrived. She's an X-ray \n     technician,'' Johnson said.\n       It's believed that's the last time she saw him. He was then \n     rushed to University of Louisville Hospital.\n       ``My understanding was that he was on his way to surgery or \n     to X-rays and his heart stopped. They did CPR but were unable \n     to bring him back,'' Johnson said.\n       Johnson said his phone has been ringing non-stop with calls \n     from across the country, offering support.\n       ``Hopkinsville and Elizabethtown are going to send officers \n     over to work the city so all my units can go to his funeral. \n     I guess that's what's hitting us so hard.

Mr. President, this Monday, September 17, our Nation \ncelebrated one of our greatest founding documents the document that has \nguided the discourse of our great Nation for 225 years. Every September \n17, we celebrate Constitution Day.\n  Americans of all walks of life are united by the ideals of equal \njustice, limited government, and the rule of law. It was the vision and \ndetermination of the Founders who wrote and signed the Constitution \nthat makes our celebration today possible.\n  More than two centuries ago, the Founders met in Philadelphia to \ncreate a constitution that would preserve liberty and foster freedom. \nThey established three separate branches of government and a system of \nchecks and balances among them. Ours is still the oldest written \nConstitution in use in the world.\n  The most important purpose of Constitution Day is to teach these \nlessons to the younger generations. I am pleased to say that the \nKentucky Department of Education has made resources available to \nsecondary schools across the Commonwealth to help them recognize this \nspecial day.\n  The University of Kentucky marked Constitution Day by inviting \nspeakers and holding historical forums. And at the University of \nLouisville, Constitution Day was celebrated with a constitution quiz \nbowl and constitution cupcakes.\n  So on this day, we recognize the students, teachers, and community \nleaders in Kentucky and across the Nation who promote and protect the \nideals of our glorious Constitution.\n  We also say a special thanks for our men and women in uniform who \ndefend it.\n  More than two centuries ago, the 39 signers of our Constitution gave \nus a more perfect union through a document that endures and guides us \nhere today.\n  They understood, as we all must, that above all, government serves to \nsecure the blessings of liberty for the people of our great Nation. It \nis an honor to stand on this floor and recognize how we have reaped the \nfruit of their efforts these many years later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6424-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6424-S6425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING GEORGE JOHN `G.J.'

Kentucky mourns the passing of Mr. George \nJohn Smith of London, KY, who passed away on August 17 of this year at \nthe age of 59.\n  Known as G.J. to his many players, friends, and fellow baseball fans, \nMr. Smith was a Laurel County native born in 1953. He began his \ncoaching career at Laurel County High School in 1977. When he stepped \ndown from that position 26 years later, he was ranked among the \nwinningest high school baseball coaches in Kentucky with over 600 \nvictories.\n  G.J. was also the athletic director at South Laurel and the Laurel \nCounty Board of Education. He was inducted into the Laurel County \nSports Hall of Fame and the Kentucky High School Baseball Coaches \nAssociation Hall of Fame. He was also a member of Mt. Zion Church of \nChrist.\n  In college, G.J. played basketball at the University of Kentucky \nunder coach Adolph Rupp. He is survived by his wife Judy; two sons, \nCameron and Trey; a sister and brother-in-law, Charlie Jean and Terry \nMack; and many other beloved family members and friends.\n  I ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in extending sympathies to \nthe family of G.J. Smith as well as his many friends and players. As \nthe home of Pee Wee Reese and the Louisville Slugger, the Commonwealth \nof Kentucky has certainly contributed more than its share to America's \ngreatest pastime. I am pleased the legacy of G.J. Smith will be \nremembered as a part of the Bluegrass State's baseball history as well.\n  Mr. President, an article describing G.J. Smith's life of achievement \nrecently appeared in the Whitley County-area publication the Times \nTribune. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Times Tribune, Aug. 20, 2012]\n\n                         G.J.

Smith, former Kentucky \n     Wildcat and long time Laurel County coach and athletics \n     director, died of a heart attack at the age of 59.\n       Smith was considered an ambassador of sports in Laurel \n     County on many occasions\n\n[[Page S6425]]\n\n     and his love of student athletes is something he'll always be \n     remembered for. Though he held many titles in his career, the \n     one title most common among those that knew Smith was that of \n     a friend and teacher.\n       Former South Laurel basketball coach Steve Wright, who \n     coached under Smith in baseball as an assistant and \n     basketball when Smith was the AD, said Smith's experiences \n     and heartfelt dedication is what sticks out to him more than \n     anything.\n       ``He's the most fierce competitor I have ever been \n     around,'' Wright said. ``When you were around him, he just \n     taught you the value of winning and doing well.\n       ``The thing I learned from him most was that the kids \n     always came first,'' Wright added. ``No matter what he did, \n     he always wanted what was best for the students no matter \n     what the situation was.''\n       Wright said one of his fondest memories with Smith was \n     after South Laurel won the state championship in 2005, when \n     they shared a special moment after the game.\n       ``He wasn't a real emotional guy, but after that game he \n     came over and gave me a big hug,'' Wright said. ``It was a \n     moment as coach, it was a moment as an AD and it was a moment \n     as a father and I'll always remember that.\n       ``We were able to share a dream that we both had,'' he \n     added. ``It really was like a mountain top for both of us, \n     and I look back on that because it was a moment that I think \n     he really enjoyed and could say `my school just won the state \n     championship.' ''\n       As a basketball player in his younger days, Smith became \n     the only player to lead two different teams to the Sweet 16 \n     in consecutive years after he first led Hazel Green in 1970, \n     and Laurel County after consolidation in 1971, when he was \n     also named a High School All-American and played for the \n     Kentucky All-Stars.\n       Smith's coaching career spanned 26 years, with a career \n     total of 662 wins, 15 district titles and six region \n     championships as head coach. Smith's teams never had a losing \n     season during Smith's tenure and won 30 games six times.\n       Current Corbin baseball coach Rob Ledington, who played for \n     Smith in high school and got his first coaching job under \n     him, said his relationship with Smith was often misconstrued, \n     yet grew in Smith's later days.\n       ``Our relationship was a lot stronger than a lot of people \n     realized,'' said Ledington. ``I got my start in baseball with \n     him as a player and I got my first coaching job under him.\n       ``A lot of the stuff that I do as a coach, as a teacher, \n     and as a father, I learned from him,'' he added. ``Outside of \n     my immediate family, he was the most influential person in my \n     life. We've had disagreements, but that's just part of being \n     a family. It's a sad day for baseball and it's just as sad a \n     day for me personally.''\n       As a result of Smith's high-school basketball accolades, he \n     was a member of Adolph Rupp's famed Super Kitten recruiting \n     class. While he was at UK, Smith was a part of history twice \n     as he played in the final games of John Wooden of UCLA (the \n     1975 NCAA Championship game) and Rupp. Smith said on several \n     occasions that his favorite UK memory was when the Wildcats \n     knocked off top-ranked Indiana, 92-90, to end the Hoosiers' \n     34-game winning streak in the Mideast Regional final game in \n     Dayton, Ohio.\n       Arrangements will be handled by House-Rawlings Funeral Home \n     in London.\n       The family will hold a visitation after 6 p.m. Monday night \n     and the funeral will be Tuesday at 11 a.m.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6424-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6424-S6425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING GEORGE JOHN `G.J.'

''\n       As a basketball player in his younger days, Smith became \n     the only player to lead two different teams to the Sweet 16 \n     in consecutive years after he first led Hazel Green in 1970, \n     and Laurel County after consolidation in 1971, when he was \n     also named a High School All-American and played for the \n     Kentucky All-Stars.\n       Smith's coaching career spanned 26 years, with a career \n     total of 662 wins, 15 district titles and six region \n     championships as head coach. Smith's teams never had a losing \n     season during Smith's tenure and won 30 games six times.\n       Current Corbin baseball coach Rob Ledington, who played for \n     Smith in high school and got his first coaching job under \n     him, said his relationship with Smith was often misconstrued, \n     yet grew in Smith's later days.\n       ``Our relationship was a lot stronger than a lot of people \n     realized,'' said Ledington. ``I got my start in baseball with \n     him as a player and I got my first coaching job under him.\n       ``A lot of the stuff that I do as a coach, as a teacher, \n     and as a father, I learned from him,'' he added. ``Outside of \n     my immediate family, he was the most influential person in my \n     life. We've had disagreements, but that's just part of being \n     a family. It's a sad day for baseball and it's just as sad a \n     day for me personally.''\n       As a result of Smith's high-school basketball accolades, he \n     was a member of Adolph Rupp's famed Super Kitten recruiting \n     class. While he was at UK, Smith was a part of history twice \n     as he played in the final games of John Wooden of UCLA (the \n     1975 NCAA Championship game) and Rupp. Smith said on several \n     occasions that his favorite UK memory was when the Wildcats \n     knocked off top-ranked Indiana, 92-90, to end the Hoosiers' \n     34-game winning streak in the Mideast Regional final game in \n     Dayton, Ohio.\n       Arrangements will be handled by House-Rawlings Funeral Home \n     in London.\n       The family will hold a visitation after 6 p.m. Monday night \n     and the funeral will be Tuesday at 11 a.m.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6425-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6425-S6426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ERNESTINE CORNETT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I stand before you today to pay tribute \nto a woman who has spent a significant amount of her life working to \ninform and entertain local communities in eastern Kentucky through the \ntelevision station WYMT. After 20-plus years and a plethora of job \ntitles within the company, Ms. Ernestine Cornett retired from her \nposition as general manager in May of 2012 with as much passion and joy \nin her heart as when she first began.\n  In the mid-1980s, Ernestine, her husband, and their daughter \nrelocated from the city of Lexington to Perry County. It was here that \nthe admirable works produced by Cornett began. Responding to an ad in \nthe newspaper began the journey of this extensive television-business \ncareer. I have great respect for Ernestine as she started at the \nbottom, worked hard, and eventually progressed to the top of the \nhierarchical ladder.\n  Ambitiously, she pressed through to accomplish great things, not only \nfor eastern Kentucky but also for the television company in which she \nwas employed. Working for WYMT television station, Ernestine knew that \nher friends and family would be adequately updated with weather and \nnews announcements, as well as sports and other forms of entertainment. \nThe television station matured and displayed ample signs of success \nwhile Ernestine was aboard with the company.\n  Her motivation in life was to make sure that eastern Kentucky was \nknowledgeable and well-informed. Finally, after 27 years of working, \nErnestine Cornett retired in order to enjoy time with family and the \nnext phase of her life. Ernestine trusts that WYMT will continue to \nprosper and the team members will carry on with her same passion.\n  The Hazard Herald recently published an article about the \naccomplishments of Ms. Ernestine Cornett, and I would ask unanimous \nconsent that said article be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Hazard Herald, May 30, 2012]\n\n       Ronald Reagan was president, very few people had ever heard \n     of high-definition television, and a small CBS affiliate with \n     the call letters WYMT was about to revolutionize the way \n     eastern Kentuckians got their news each day.\n       It was 1985, just two years after Ernestine Cornett and \n     husband Keith had returned to their native Perry County with \n     their four-year-old daughter Ashley in tow. Keith had just \n     sold his accounting and income tax business in Lexington.\n       They were, as Ernestine put it, ``starting over in familiar \n     surroundings.''\n       A graduate of Hazard High School, and then Morehead State \n     University, Ernestine Cornett had been substituting in the \n     city and county school districts when she ran across an ad in \n     the Hazard Herald for a position at this new television \n     station. She answered the ad, interviewed with a Lexington \n     broadcaster by the name of Ralph Gabbard, and got the job in \n     the avails coordinator position, a job which she described as \n     consisting of inputting advertiser information and ensuring \n     that the ad would have time on the air.\n       ``Frankly, at the time, I had no idea what I was suited for \n     in the television business,'' Cornett said. ``Certainly I had \n     no experience, but evidently Mr. Gabbard knew.''\n       Mr. Gabbard must have known, because in a couple of years \n     she took the position of sales assistant and then office \n     manager. And then, in 1990, when station manager Wayne Martin \n     was promoted to the WKYT station in Lexington, Cornett also \n     received a promotion and began what would be a career heading \n     WYMT that would last more than 20 years. That career will \n     come to an end with Cornett's retirement later this month, \n     but it was Martin whom she credited with her long tenure at \n     WYMT, and with her landing the job in the first place.\n       ``Certainly Wayne Martin was a big part of my success at \n     WYMT, as he recommended me for his replacement, and although \n     I was intimidated at the prospect, I knew it was a once-in-a-\n     lifetime opportunity,'' Cornett said.\n       Martin returned to Hazard on Tuesday of this week, as he \n     attended a special lunch to honor Cornett's career and noted \n     that her leadership has been a cornerstone at WYMT now for 22 \n     years.\n       ``Her leadership has been one which I know I've tried to \n     emulate because of her integrity, and sense of fair play, and \n     her absolute passion for eastern Kentucky,'' Martin said.\n       WYMT was purchased by Gray Television in 1994, an Atlanta-\n     based media company that owns several other stations, \n     including WKYT in Lexington and WVLT in Knoxville. When Gray \n     took over WYMT, Cornett's title changed to vice-president and \n     general manager.\n       In the years that Cornett has headed WYMT, the station has \n     shown growth and success, and has also maintained its \n     relevancy as eastern Kentucky's only localized television \n     broadcast. There are no other television stations that cater \n     solely to the eastern Kentucky market. The station has been \n     able to do that, Cornett explained, because the station \n     serves the community, both as a local advertising source and \n     a news outlet that offers hard news updates and features, as \n     well as weather, sports, and entertainment options for the \n     residents of eastern Kentucky. That was something that had \n     never been done on television prior to WYMT's creation.\n       And as a native and resident of eastern Kentucky, as well \n     as the leader of a media outlet, Cornett knows well the \n     importance that a news organization can represent, and the \n     service it can provide.\n       ``As a local, I was a manager fully invested in the success \n     of this station because I can remember what it was like \n     before WYMT came along,'' she said. ``I would not want to \n     return to those times. Now, I will be fully invested in the \n     station in new ways, as a viewer, as a consumer.''\n       But there have been a lot of changes and challenges along \n     the way that Cornett oversaw during her career. Gone are the \n     analog broadcasts, and WYMT's newscasts are not solely \n     offered on television anymore.\n       ``Our news can be watched on the World Wide Web and on \n     mobile devices,'' she noted. ``And, although it took us years \n     to get a satellite truck, there are now small portable \n     devices that can transmit news packages through phone and \n     data lines. Technology in this business is always moving \n     forward. Our challenge is to keep up.''\n       Cornett will spend her last day at the station in Hazard on \n     Friday, and of course, after a long career there are going to \n     be some things she will miss, from the people she meets every \n     day in the station's hallways to\n\n[[Page S6426]]\n\n     the excitement of being inside the news machine as it does \n     its work. But at the same time, she knows that WYMT won't \n     miss a beat with the management team in place, and she's \n     certainly happy about that.\n       ``We have a great cohesive crew here and a great management \n     team in Neil Middleton, Jim Boggs, Louise Sizemore, and \n     Philip Hayes,'' she noted. ``I am leaving the station in very \n     capable hands, thus I have am leaving with a wonderful sense \n     of pride and peace.''\n       Cornett said she doesn't have any specific plans after her \n     retirement is final, and after attending school or working \n     for the majority of her life, she is ready for what she \n     called ``unstructured days.''\n       ``I have no immediate plans except to enjoy my family, get \n     up every day and do what pleases me,'' she said, and from all \n     accounts that is something she has certainly earned.\n       ``She's a very compassionate person, and she realizes the \n     needs, day to day, of the people that work here,'' noted Phil \n     Hayes, chief engineer at WYMT. ``She didn't micromanage \n     anyone, but she was able to comprehend and anticipate what it \n     took to make this station operate as efficiently as it has, \n     and she's just a great person to work with.''\n       ``You couldn't have a better boss than Ernestine Cornett,'' \n     added Neil Middleton, WYMT's news director. ``I think the way \n     we look at Ernestine is, she was our boss, but more \n     importantly she is our friend, and she is family.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6426-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING MARTIN DOCK SCOTT, JR.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nhonored Kentuckian and a man of great accomplishment who proudly served \nour country. Mr. Martin Dock Scott, Jr. of Bowling Green, KY, passed \naway Wednesday, September 5, 2012, due to cancer. He was 65 years old.\n  I have great appreciation for Mr. Scott, as he lived such a \nremarkable life. After graduation from Menifee County High School, Mr. \nScott served in the United States Army from 1966 to 1970. He served \nwith B Company, 1st Battalion, 52nd Infantry, 198th Light Infantry \nBrigade. Thus far is evidence enough that Mr. Scott lived a worthy \nlife, yet he continued onward, and so the list of his service and \naccomplishment also continues.\n  While in the military, Mr. Scott served in Chu Lai, Vietnam, and \noperated out of LZ Stinson and other landing zones. Needless to say, \nMr. Scott put his life on the line for this country. In July 1970, Mr. \nScott was honorably discharged.\n  Among his many military decorations, he earned two Bronze Stars. The \nfirst, with ``V'' Device, was awarded to Mr. Scott in February 1970 for \nexpressing heroism under combined ground and mortar attack while his \nplatoon was providing security for Dai Loc hamlet. The second medal was \nreceived in April 1970 for ``meritorious achievement in connection with \nmilitary operations against a hostile force.''\n  Mr. Scott graduated from Eastern Kentucky University, married ViAnn \nFord in November 1969, and started a family. I want to convey my \ndeepest condolences to the many family members and friends who knew and \nwere loved by Martin Dock Scott, Jr.\n  I would ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in commemorating his \ncommitment to service and in extending sympathies to the Scott family. \nThe Commonwealth of Kentucky will be proud to remember the life and \ndeeds of Mr. Martin Dock Scott, Jr.\n  Mr. President, an obituary for Mr. Scott as provided by the family \nrecently appeared in local newspapers. I ask unanimous consent that \nsaid obituary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n       Bowling Green, KY.--Martin Dock Scott, Jr., 65, answered \n     his Lord's call on Wednesday, September 5, 2012, surrounded \n     by family at his residence following a brave battle with \n     cancer.\n       Martin was born January 10, 1947, in Dayton, Ohio. He \n     graduated from Menifee County (KY) High School in 1965 after \n     which he served his country in the U.S. Army in Korea and in \n     Viet Nam 1966 to 1970, receiving two Bronze Stars during \n     action in Viet Nam. He served on the Bowling Green Police \n     Department as patrolman and later as detective from November \n     11, 1970 until his retirement on April 30, 1989, when he then \n     became a Commonwealth's Detective for the Warren County \n     Commonwealth's Attorney's Office. Martin served 23 years \n     under Commonwealth's Attorneys Morris Lowe, Steve Wilson, \n     Michael Pearson, and Chris Cohron.\n       Martin was an active member of the Kentucky Fraternal Order \n     of Police for 39 years, serving as President of Bowling Green \n     Lodge #13 for 12 years and as President of the Kentucky State \n     Lodge for 18 years.

On June 27, 2012, Congress presented the Congressional \nGold Medal to the first African Americans to serve in the United States \nMarine Corps, the Montford Point Marines. More recently, the personal \nstory of three of those marines from southern Illinois was brought to \nmy attention.\n  Most people have heard of the Tuskeegee Airmen and the Buffalo \nSoldiers, but until recently, the Montford Point Marines were largely \nunknown to the general public. During the 1940s, segregation and \ndiscrimination were pervasive in this country. Unfortunately, the \nMarine Corps was no exception.\n  To counteract the injustice, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued \nan Executive order that prohibited racial discrimination in the \nnational defense industry, including Federal agencies. This order \nforever changed the Marine Corps from an all-white fighting force to \none comprised of those willing to serve.\n  Camp Montford Point, NC, is the site where the first African \nAmericans who joined the Marine Corps were trained. Nearly 20,000 \nAfrican Americans trained there, many of whom served honorably in World \nWar II. The marines established Camp Montford Point adjacent to Camp \nLejeune and those who trained there were known as the Montford Point \nMarines.\n  One man who answered the call to serve was Carbondale, IL, resident \nArchibald Mosley. In 1942, Mosley said that he was a ``girl-crazy'' \ntypical teenager ready to graduate from high school in Jackson County, \nIL. An exceptional student, Mosley was asked by the principal, along \nwith a handful of other students, to serve in the marines.\n  Mosley enlisted with two of his friends, Saul Griffin, Jr. and James \nFrance. Mosley, because his records indicated that he had some college, \nwas chosen to lead the others. They were sent to train at Camp Montford \nPoint.\n  The conditions for the recruits at Montford Point were miserable. The \nwhite men who trained at Camp Lejeune lived in barracks. The African-\nAmerican men were housed in huts made of beaverboard--similar to thick \ncardboard. The huts had little, if any, heat in the winter and no \nrelief from the sweltering temperatures in the summer. Nor did they \nhave access to the same equipment. The African Americans didn't know \nhow bad it was--they weren't allowed into the same areas at their White \ncolleagues.\n  Amazingly, despite their willingness to die for their country, the \nMontford Point Marines still faced incredible injustices after the \ndeplorable conditions during training. One situation that has \ncontinually bothered Mosley was when German prisoners of war were \nallowed to eat before the African-American Marines. He couldn't \nunderstand why the enemy would be able to eat before one of their \nmarine brothers--it appeared that loyalty didn't extend beyond race.\n\n[[Page S6427]]\n\n  After World War II, marines were sent home to be congratulated by the \nPresident. The Montford Point Marines weren't even recognized for their \nservice.\n  Decades after the doors opened at Camp Montford Point, in November of \nlast year, Congress finally voted to award these honorable men with the \nhighest civilian award in the United States because of their honorable \nand noble service to America. They were called to serve and they \nresponded--nearly 20,000 strong.\n  Despite the poor treatment, despite the poor jobs, despite the \nsubstandard conditions, the Montford Point Marines served their \ncountry. Before all else, they were Americans. Archibald Mosley and his \nfriends lived and breathed the Marine Corps motto, Semper Fidelis, \n``Always Faithful.''\n  I am thankful that they did. I am also thankful that our Nation took \nthe steps we did to ensure those brave Americans received the \nrecognition they were denied for so many years.\n  Saul Griffin, Jr. and James France didn't live to see it, sadly, but \nReverend Mosley and many of his fellow marines were able to make the \ntrip to Washington this summer to receive the long delayed thanks from \na grateful Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6427-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ANNIVERSARY OF ENACTMENT OF THE LEAHY-SMITH AMERICA INVENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Sunday marked the 1-year anniversary of the \nenactment of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. One year ago, I was \npleased to stand on a stage at the Thomas Jefferson High School for \nScience and Technology in Virginia with House Judiciary Committee \nchairman Lamar Smith, Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office \nDavid Kappos, Acting Commerce Secretary Rebecca Blank, and others. \nTogether, we watched President Obama sign into law the most important \nchanges to our Nation's patent laws in 60 years.\n  Many of the provisions of the legislation took effect on the 1-year \nanniversary, while other important changes, such as the shift to first-\ninventor-to-file, will take effect in 6 months. I commend the Patent \nand Trademark Office, PTO, for the work they have done, in a \ntransparent manner, to prepare for the new procedures that take effect \nthis week.\n  At its best, our patent system encourages exploration and invention, \ncreating wealth, and providing jobs. Abraham Lincoln famously said that \n``the patent system added the fuel of interest to the fire of genius.'' \nBut when patents are granted on unpatentable subject matter or on \nobvious creations already in use, they can be misused to stifle \ncompetition.\n  The new patent law will aid the PTO in separating the wheat from the \nchaff, weeding out low-quality patents that infect our system, and \nbolstering those patents that truly advance ``the progress of science \nand useful arts.''\n  While the changes made by the patent bill were sweeping, I am under \nno illusion that they solved all the problems that confront our patent \nsystem. The assertion of patents is too often still used by patent \ntrolls to extract payment even where there is not infringement of a \nvalid patent because the cost of litigation makes settlement more \nexpedient, and the ``tech patent wars'' among the large mobile phone \ncompanies show the perils to competition that can come when companies \ndo not reach business-to-business resolutions of their patent disputes. \nBut the improvements made by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act will \ngo a long way to making the system work better for inventors and \nimplementers.\n  Enactment of the patent bill was more than a victory for American \ninventors, large and small; it was a demonstration that Congress can \nstill work in a bipartisan, bicameral matter. I stood proudly on the \nstage 1 year ago with a Republican chairman of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, watching the President sign a law on which Chairman Smith \nand I had worked closely together for 6 years.\n  The legislative success of the patent bill shows what we can achieve \nwhen we put aside rhetoric and, instead, negotiate and collaborate in \ngood faith. We held countless bipartisan, bicameral meetings, \nbriefings, and discussions with all interested parties. We worked \nclosely with Director Kappos, then-Secretary of Commerce Locke, and \nMembers of Democratic and Republican leadership in both the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives.\n  In short, the process that took the patent bill from the Congress to \nthe President for his signature was one of which we can all be proud. \nIn an increasingly partisan Congress, I was pleased to have the \nopportunity to lead a legislative process that was, from start to \nfinish, both bipartisan and bicameral.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6427-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GENERAL CRAIG McKINLEY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

He received his commission as a distinguished graduate of the \nROTC program at Southern Methodist University and entered undergraduate \npilot training at Moody Air Force Base in Georgia in 1974. With the \nconclusion of military engagement in Vietnam, the nation's military \nleaders faced a number of questions, including the future role of the \nNational Guard. These same questions would later guide General \nMcKinley's efforts to lead the National Guard toward its current role \nas an operational force.\n  General McKinley has had a distinguished career, including \nassignments as an instructor pilot, the commander of the 125th Fighter \nWing, the commander of the 1st Air Force, and the commander of the \nContinental United States Region of the North American Aerospace \nDefense Command. He served in the U.S. European Command and as Director \nof the Air National Guard. These assignments culminated in General \nMcKinley earning his fourth star as Chief of the National Guard Bureau. \nHe did all of this while logging over 4,000 flying hours in a wide \nrange of aircraft and earning the rating of command pilot.\n  While I could reflect on many notable moments in General McKinley's \ncareer, I will never forget one in particular. It was November 10, \n2011, when Senator Levin and Senator McCain convened an historic \nhearing of all six sitting Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Department of \nDefense General Counsel, and General McKinley, to examine a proposal I \nhad introduced to add the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. Despite the arguments against this change by all \nsix sitting Joint Chiefs, General McKinley's measured and reasonable \nresponses won the day. Ultimately, 71 senators came to agree with \nGeneral McKinley and joined as cosponsors of what is known commonly as \nthe second National Guard Empowerment Act. This bill became law in \nDecember 2011, and General McKinley was a decisive factor in this \nvictory for the National Guard. Without his resolve to see the almost \nhalf a million men and women of the Guard represented at the top \nmilitary panel in the national command structure, we would not have \ntriumphed.\n  General McKinley has offered steady leadership to the Guard during a \ntruly historic period. I am grateful to have had him as a partner. \nWithout him, I doubt our nation would have the world-class operational \nreserve that we have today.\n  Congratulations, General McKinley. Best wishes to you, Cheryl, \nPatrick, and Christina as you retire to civilian life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6427-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6427-S6428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REQUEST FOR CONSULTATION\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to \nSenator McConnell dated September 19, 2012, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, Sept. 19, 2012.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am requesting I be consulted \n     before the Senate enters into any unanimous consent \n     agreements or time limitations regarding the Local Courthouse \n     Safety Act of 2012, S. 2076.\n\n[[Page S6428]]\n\n       While I support the motive behind this legislation and \n     believe ensuring the safety of state and local courthouses is \n     a noble goal, I believe the responsibility to address this \n     issue lies with the state and local governments. I do not \n     believe the federal government has the authority under the \n     Constitution to provide training for local and state law \n     enforcement or to provide security equipment to state and \n     local courthouses at the federal government's expense. \n     Further, I believe the training program this bill authorizes \n     duplicates existing federal training programs.\n       First, S. 2076 authorizes the Director of the State Justice \n     Institute (SJI) to carry out ``a training and technical \n     assistance program designed to teach employees of State, \n     local, and tribal law enforcement agencies how to anticipate \n     and respond to violent encounters during the course of their \n     duties, including duties relating to security at State, \n     county, and trial courthouses.'' The purpose of SJI is to \n     further the development and adoption of improved judicial \n     administration in state courts in the United States, which is \n     not a federal responsibility under the Constitution. States \n     are responsible for the administration of their courts. \n     Adding an additional allowable purpose to SJI merely broadens \n     the unconstitutional reach of this agency. Further, even \n     though S. 2076 does not provide any additional funding for \n     SJI the agency could use the authorization of additional \n     responsibilities as a basis for requesting future \n     appropriations from Congress.\n       Second, the SJI training program authorized in this bill \n     potentially duplicates existing federal training programs \n     available to state and local law enforcement. The following \n     programs already exist:\n       1. U.S. Marshal Service's National Center for Judicial \n     Security, Office of Protective Intelligence; Shares threat \n     information with state and local law enforcement agencies and \n     provides training to state and local law enforcement officers \n     who provide courthouse security. Also, provides guidance and \n     support to district offices and Judicial Security Inspectors \n     (JSIs) conducting high threat proceedings and protective \n     responses.\n       2. U.S. Marshal Service's National Center for Judicial \n     Security Fellowship Program; Provides a three-month training \n     program for state, local, and international ``court security \n     managers.''\n       3. FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) division and Law \n     Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA) programs; \n     UCR and LEOKA collect data on law enforcement officers who \n     have been killed or assaulted in the line of duty. The FBI \n     then conducts LEOKA training programs for state and local law \n     enforcement personnel based on this data.\n       4. FBI's Law Enforcement Training for Safety and Survival \n     (LETSS) program; Trains FBI, police officers, and \n     international law enforcement personnel in survival \n     techniques.\n       5. FBI Field Police Training program; Includes firearm \n     training for state and local partners.\n       6. FBI's Law Enforcement Executive Development Association \n     program; Trains heads of state and local law enforcement \n     agencies with between 50 and 500 personnel.\n       7. Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training \n     (ALERRT) program; Trains officers in dealing with violent \n     situations, including those they face outside of buildings \n     and in urban settings. Includes core classes such as ``Basic \n     Active Shooter Level I and II,'' ``Terrorism Response \n     Tactics--Advanced Pistol,'' ``Combat Rifle,'' ``Combat \n     Pistol,'' ``Advanced Rifle Marksmanship,'' and ``DOD Sniped \n     Course.''\n       8. Community Oriented Policing Services programs (COPS);\n       9. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Law \n     Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) programs; and The \n     Survival Shooting Training Program (SSTP) under FLETC is an \n     eight and a half day training program that teaches law \n     enforcement officers (LEOs) ``how to employ several types of \n     weapon systems found in most police arsenals (the service \n     handgun, shotgun, submachine gun and rifle). The LEOs will \n     develop marksmanship skills as well as all pertinent gun \n     handling skills (drawing from the holster, reloads, immediate \n     action, movement and more) at a rapid yet controlled pace. \n     Ultimately, the SSTP prepares the LEOs to survive a deadly \n     force confrontation through competent decision making and \n     confident gun handling skills.'' The Reactive Shooting \n     Instructor Training Program (RSITP) under FLETC trains law \n     enforcement instructors in handling their firearms to survive \n     high-stress situations.\n       10. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms' National \n     Firearms Examiner Academy programs. The training program \n     includes training that enables state and local law \n     enforcement officers to identify armed gunmen and increase \n     their ``margin of safety.''\n       Finally, this bill gives state and local courthouses \n     priority in obtaining excess federal security equipment for \n     free from the Government Services Administration after a \n     short request period is given to federal agencies. The \n     courthouse would only pay the costs of transporting the \n     equipment. Equipment purchased by the federal government--and \n     thereby the American taxpayer--should be utilized by the \n     federal government if at all possible. If not, federal \n     agencies may have to purchase equipment they otherwise could \n     have obtained for free but for the state and local \n     governments taking it. Also, giving states and localities the \n     ability to obtain this equipment for free may lead to \n     situations where they acquire the equipment simply because it \n     is free, not because they truly need it.\n       Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution enumerates the \n     limited powers of Congress, and nowhere are we tasked with \n     funding or becoming involved with state and local court \n     security. I firmly believe this issue is the responsibility \n     of the states and not the federal government. However, if \n     Congress does act in this area, we should evaluate current \n     programs, determine any needs that may exist, and prioritize \n     those needs for funding by cutting from the federal budget \n     programs fraught with waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication.\n       Congress must start making tough decisions rather than \n     continuing to kick the can down the road, leaving our \n     children and grandchildren to clean up the mess. It is \n     irresponsible for Congress to jeopardize the future standard \n     of living of our children by borrowing from future \n     generations. The U.S. national debt is now over $16 trillion. \n     That means over $50,000 in debt for each man, woman and child \n     in the United States. A year ago, the national debt was $14.3 \n     trillion. Despite pledges to control spending, Washington \n     adds billions to the national debt every single day. In just \n     one year, our national debt has grown by $1.7 trillion or \n     11.8%. We cannot continue to support federal funding for \n     programs and initiatives that are not federal \n     responsibilities as dictated by our Constitution. Otherwise, \n     we will never get our fiscal house in order.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Tom A. Coburn, M.D.,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6428-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6428-S6433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND 501(c)(4) ORGANIZATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our representative form of government is \nbased on the premise that citizens who vote in our elections are \ninformed about who is seeking to influence elections. Sadly, we \ncontinue to see that information obscured by organizations who are \nmisusing our tax code for political gain.\n  As we have discussed on this floor many times, the Supreme Court \nopened our campaign finance system to a torrent of unlimited and secret \nspecial-interest money in Citizens United. But even the Supreme Court \nacknowledged in Citizens United that disclosure is important:\n\n       ``[P]rompt disclosure of expenditures can provide \n     shareholders and citizens with the information needed to hold \n     corporations and elected officials accountable for their \n     positions and supporters. Shareholders can determine whether \n     their corporation's political speech advances the \n     corporation's interest in making profits, and citizens can \n     see whether elected officials are in the pocket of so-called \n     moneyed interests.'' Citizens United v. FEC, 130 S. Ct. 876, \n     916 (2010).\n\n  Yet, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, as of September \n13, spending on political advertising by groups that either do not \ndisclose, or only partially disclose their donors, has increased four-\nfold, from $32 million in the 2008 election to more than $135 million \nat the same point in the current election.\n  These groups are exploiting our tax code by organizing as tax-exempt \n``social welfare'' groups and then spending tens of millions of \nundisclosed dollars on political campaigns.\n  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)--the organization that grants \nthese groups their tax-exempt status in the first place--should be \nprotecting the voting public from these groups that pretend to be \nacting in the social welfare but are instead engaging in partisan \npolitics.\n  The law in this area is clear. 26 U.S.C. Sec. 501(c)(4) states that \n``Civic leagues or organizations not organized for profit but operated \nexclusively for the promotion of social welfare, or local associations \nof employees, the membership of which is limited to the employees of a \ndesignated person or persons in a particular municipality, and the net \nearnings of which are devoted exclusively to charitable, educational, \nor recreational purposes'' are exempt from taxation. The word \n``exclusively'' is in the tax code for a reason. Congress didn't say \n``partially,'' or ``primarily.'' We said that these groups had to be \noperated ``exclusively'' for the promotion of social welfare. The IRS, \nin writing the implementing regulations to the statute, said that, ``An \norganization is operated exclusively for the promotion of social \nwelfare if it is primarily engaged in promoting in some way the common \ngood and general welfare.'' [emphasis added] By substituting the word \n``primarily'' in the regulation with the word ``exclusively'' in the \nstatute, the IRS essentially redefined what Congress required a social \nwelfare organization to be.\n  Mr. President, I asked the IRS for an explanation as to why they have \nnot\n\n[[Page S6429]]\n\nresponded to the increasing growth of groups that parade as social \nwelfare groups but are obviously organized for politically partisan \npurposes. In my letters, I asked the IRS how they interpret the \nexplicit language in the tax code which says that entities must operate \n``exclusively'' for the promotion of social welfare, to allow any tax \nexempt partisan political activity by 501(c)(4) organizations. Their \nresponse? That the regulation has been in place for over 50 years. That \nis not an excuse if new abuses require a review of an IRS regulation.\n  I also asked the IRS if they are fulfilling their enforcement \nfunction by notifying these groups that are obviously engaged primarily \nin political activity that they are violation of the law. Again, the \nIRS response was inadequate. During the past 6 months, according to the \nIRS letter, no notices of proposed or final revocation have been issued \nto section 501(c)(4) organizations. None. So even under the \n``primarily'' test the IRS is not enforcing the law in the face of the \navalanche of evidence that our laws are being flouted.\n  The law is clear. Even the watered-down IRS regulation is clear. It \nis time that the IRS enforces the law, or at least its own regulation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the correspondence with the IRS be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Homeland Security and \n           Governmental Affairs,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2012.\n     Hon. Douglas H. Shulman,\n     Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Commissioner Shulman: I am writing to express my \n     concern about how the IRS interprets the law regarding the \n     extent to which 501(c)(4) ``social welfare'' organizations \n     can engage in partisan political activity. The July 13, 2012 \n     response by Lois G. Lerner, Director of Exempt Organizations, \n     to my June 13, 2012 letter was unsatisfactory.\n       In the response, Ms. Lerner stated that ``The IRS takes \n     steps to continually inform organizations of their \n     responsibilities as social welfare organization to help them \n     avoid jeopardizing their tax-exempt status,'' and ``actively \n     educates section 501(c)(4) organizations at multiple states \n     in their development about their responsibilities under the \n     tax law.'' [Emphasis added.]\n       Her discussion does not describe an IRS initiative to \n     ``continually inform'' or ``actively educate.'' Rather, it \n     shows the IRS is passively making some information available \n     once a 501(c)(4) entity is already in existence. Further, her \n     discussion of the explanatory materials available to the \n     public, and the materials themselves, are confusing. This \n     leads to a predictable result: organizations are using \n     Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(4) to gain tax exempt \n     status while engaging in partisan political campaigns. There \n     is an absurd tangle of vague and contradictory materials that \n     the IRS provides. Making the problem worse is that the IRS \n     knows there is a problem because of the public nature of the \n     activity, but has failed to address it.\n       First, the law.\n       26 U.S.C. Sec. 501(c)(4) states that ``Civic leagues or \n     organizations not organized for profit but operated \n     exclusively for the promotion of social welfare, or local \n     associations of employees, the membership of which is limited \n     to the employees of a designated person or persons in a \n     particular municipality, and the net earnings of which are \n     devoted exclusively to charitable, educational, or \n     recreational purposes'' are exempt from taxation. [Emphasis \n     added.] Merriam-Webster defines ``exclusively'' as ``single, \n     sole; whole; undivided.'' Therefore, it would appear that the \n     law prevents entities that organize under Section \n     501(c)(4)from any activity that is not operated exclusively \n     for the promotion of social welfare or an association of \n     employees.\n       Consistent with the law is a 1997 letter from the IRS \n     denying tax-exempt status to a group called the National \n     Policy Forum. The letter indicates that the IRS based its \n     denial on the fact that the organization was engaged in \n     partisan political activity, stating that ``partisan \n     political activity does not promote social welfare as defined \n     in section 501(c)(4),'' and that the applicant ``benefit[s] \n     select individuals or groups, instead of the community as a \n     whole.\n       One part of Internal Revenue Service Publication 557 in its \n     guidance states, consistent with the law, that:\n       ``If your organization is not organized for profit and will \n     be operated only to promote social welfare to benefit the \n     community, you should file Form 1024 to apply for recognition \n     of exemption from federal income tax under section \n     501(c)(4).'' [Emphasis added]\n       Another part of Internal Revenue Service Publication 557 \n     starts off by agreeing with the law and states, ``Promoting \n     social welfare does not include direct or indirect \n     participation or intervention in political campaigns on \n     behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public \n     office.'' The IRS is accurately and clearly stating, in some \n     places at least, that ``social welfare'' advocacy does not \n     include campaigning for or against a candidate or candidates.\n       So far, so good--until that same Publication 557 states: \n     ``However, if you submit proof that your organization is \n     organized exclusively to promote social welfare, it can \n     obtain an exemption [from taxes] even if it participates \n     legally in some political activity on behalf of or in \n     opposition to candidates for public office.''\n       That language seems inconsistent with the other referenced \n     parts of Publication 557 (as well as being inconsistent with \n     law and precedent), unless it means that the exemption isn't \n     available for the political activity portion funded by \n     501(c)(4) receipts.\n       Further, an IRS regulation that interprets Section \n     501(c)(4) states that, ``An organization is operated \n     exclusively for the promotion of social welfare if it is \n     primarily engaged in promoting in some way the common good \n     and general welfare of the people of the community.'' \n     [Emphasis added.]\n       So the IRS regulation says the law's requirement of \n     ``exclusively'' really means ``primarily,'' something very \n     different from ``exclusively.''\n       The IRS webpage cites an internal training article which \n     states:\n       ```[S]ocial welfare' is inherently an abstruse concept that \n     continues to defy precise definition. Careful case-by-case \n     analyses and close judgments are still required.'' [Emphasis \n     added.]\n       Fair enough.\n       In its Compliance Guide for Tax-Exempt Organizations, the \n     IRS gives direction regarding how to make a case-by-case \n     evaluation whether a communication is political. That Guide \n     says that the following factors indicate that an advocacy \n     communication is political campaign activity:\n        The communication identifies a candidate for public \n     office;\n       The timing of the communication coincides with an electoral \n     campaign;\n       The communication targets voters in a particular election;\n       The communication identifies the candidate's position on \n     the public policy issue that is the subject of the \n     communication;\n       The position of the candidate on the public policy issue \n     has been raised as distinguishing the candidate from others \n     in the campaign, either in the communication itself or in \n     other public communications; and\n       The communication is not part of an ongoing series of \n     substantially similar advocacy communications by the \n     organization on the same issue.\n       The guide further lays out the factors that indicate when \n     an advocacy communication is not political campaign activity:\n       The absence of anyone or more of the factors listed above;\n       The communication identifies specific legislation, or a \n     specific event outside the control of the organization, that \n     the organization hopes to influence;\n       The timing of the communication coincides with a specific \n     event outside the control of the organization that the \n     organization hopes to influence, such as a legislative vote \n     or other major legislative action (for example, a hearing \n     before a legislative committee on the issue that is the \n     subject of the communication);\n       The communication identifies the candidate solely as a \n     government official who is in a position to act on the public \n     policy issue in connection with the specific event (such as a \n     legislator who is eligible to vote on the legislation); and\n       The communication identifies the candidate solely in the \n     list of key or principal sponsors of the legislation that is \n     the subject of the communication.\n       It is clear from the application of those factors that what \n     is going on in the U.S. with certain 501(c)(4) organizations \n     in their television advertisements are political campaign \n     activities.\n       Below are two transcripts of advertisements that were put \n     on television by 501(c)(4) organizations. As you can see, the \n     subject of Advertisement #1 is a Democratic Senator, and the \n     subject of Advertisement #2 is a Republican Senator. This is \n     not a partisan issue.\n       Television Advertisement #1:\n       ``It's time to play: Who is the biggest supporter of the \n     Obama agenda in Ohio. It's Sherrod Brown. Brown backed \n     Obama's agenda a whopping 95 percent of the time. He voted \n     for budget busting ObamaCare that adds $700 billion to the \n     deficit. For Obama's $453 billion tax increase. And even \n     supported cap-and-trade which could have cost Ohio over \n     100,000 jobs. Tell Sherrod Brown, for real job growth, stop \n     spending and cut the debt. Support the new majority agenda at \n     newmajorityagenda.org.''\n       Television Advertisement #2: \n       ``Before Wall Street gave him $200,000 in campaign cash. . \n     . . Before he voted to let bank CEOs take millions in \n     taxpayer funded bonuses. . . . Dean Heller was a stockbroker. \n     No wonder he voted against Wall Street reform; against \n     holding the big banks accountable. Heller even voted to risk \n     your Social Security here, in the stock market. Dean Heller: \n     he votes like he still works for Wall Street, and that's bad \n     for you.''\n       Those ads, and so many like them, clearly fit the factors \n     the IRS has laid out in its guide for what constitutes a \n     political campaign activity. The advertisements make no \n     pretense at nonpartisanship; they are blatantly and \n     aggressively partisan communications.\n\n[[Page S6430]]\n\n       Entities that file under Section 501(c)(4) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code and take advantage of its tax exemption benefits \n     should have to make a choice: either lose their exempt status \n     (and pay taxes) or eliminate the partisan political activity.\n       The IRS needs to immediately review the activities of \n     501(c)(4) entities engaging in running partisan political ads \n     or giving funds to Section 527 organizations that run such \n     ads. The IRS needs to advise 501(c)(4) entities of the law in \n     this area and the factors it will look at in reviewing \n     501(c)(4) status and tax exemption issues.\n       Please provide me with the following information no later \n     than August 10, 2012:\n       1. How can the IRS interpret the explicit language in 26 \n     U.S.C. 501(c)(4), which provides that ??510??(c)(4) entities \n     must operate ``exclusively'' for the promotion of social \n     welfare, to allow any tax exempt partisan political activity \n     by 501(c)(4) organizations?\n       2. Since partisan political activity does not meet the IRS \n     definition of ``promoting social welfare,'' how can an \n     organization that participates in any partisan political \n     activity be``organized exclusively to promote social \n     welfare?''\n       3. The Exempt Organizations 2011 Annual Report and 2012 \n     Work Plan states: ``As in any election year, EO will continue \n     its work to enforce the rules relating to political campaigns \n     and campaign expenditures. In FY 2012, EO will combine what \n     it has learned from past projects on political activities \n     with new information gleaned from the redesigned Form 990 to \n     focus its examination resources on serious allegations of \n     impermissible political intervention.''\n       a.

How many persons are involved in the enforcement of the \n     501(c)(4) rules?\n       4. The Exempt Organizations 2011 Annual Report and 2012 \n     Work Plan states that 501 (c)(4) organizations ``can declare \n     themselves tax-exempt without seeking a determination from \n     the IRS. EO will review organizations to ensure that thel \n     have classified themselves correctly and that they are \n     complying with applicable rules.''\n       a. Why does the IRS allow 501(c)(4) organizations to self-\n     declare?\n       b. When an organization ``self declares'' as a 501(c)(4) \n     organization, how does the IRS get notice and how long does \n     it take the IRS to conduct the review to ensure that that \n     organization has classified itself correctly?\n       5. The IRS Compliance Guide for Tax-Exempt Organizations \n     states:\n       ``When a 501(c)(4), (5) or (6) organization's communication \n     explicitly advocates the election or defeat of an individual \n     to public office, the communication is considered political \n     campaign activity. A tax-exempt organization that makes \n     expenditures for political campaign activities shall be \n     subject to tax in an amount equal to its net investment \n     income for the year or the aggreate amount expended on \n     political campaign activities during the year, whichever is \n     less.''\n       a. How does the IRS keep track of these explicit \n     communications and ensure that the organization pays this \n     tax?\n       b. What is the reason for the requirement that the tax will \n     be based on ``whichever is less'' between its net investment \n     income for the year or the aggregate amount expended on \n     political campaign activities?\n       c. What tax would an organization have to pay if it spends \n     all of its income on political advertising (therefore it has \n     NO net investment income)?\n       6. Ms. Lerner's letter quotes the IRS webpage on Social \n     Welfare Organizations:\n       ``The promotion of social welfare does not include direct \n     or indirect participation or intervention in political \n     campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for \n     public office. However, a section 501(c)(4) social welfare \n     organization may engage in some political activities, so long \n     as that is not its primary activity. However, any expenditure \n     it makes for political activities may be subject to tax under \n     section 527(f)?'' [Emphasis added]\n       a.

How does the IRS keep track of these political \n     activities and ensure that the organization pays the tax \n     under section 527(f)?\n       7.

If so, where can they \n     be accessed?\n       8. Internal Revenue Service Publication 557 states that, if \n     a 501(c)(4) entity can ``submit proof that [the] organization \n     is organized exclusively to promote social welfare, it can \n     obtain an exemption even if it participates legally in some \n     political activity on behalf of or in opposition to \n     candidates for public office.''\n       Have the following 501(c)(4) organizations a) applied for; \n     and if so, b) received the described exemption for political \n     activity from the IRS?\n       a.

Have you reminded 501(c)(4)s which publicly seem to be \n     operating in the partisan political arena as to the factors \n     you will consider in determining whether they are engaging in \n     partisan political activity?

Again, it is urgent that I receive your answers by \n     August 10, 2012.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n                                  Chairman, Permanent Subcommittee\n     on Investigations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                     Internal Revenue Service,\n\n                                 Washington, DC., August 24, 2012.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I am responding to your letter to \n     Commissioner Shulman dated July 27, 2012, requesting \n     additional information about section 501(c)(4) organizations. \n     This response supplements the previous responses dated June \n     4, 2012 and July 13, 2012, and addresses the additional \n     questions raised in your recent letter.\n       Question 1. How can the IRS interpret the explicit language \n     in 26 U.S.C. Sec. 501(c)(4), which provides that 510(c)(4) \n     entities must operate ``exclusively'' for the promotion of \n     social welfare, to allow any tax exempt partisan political \n     activity by 501(c)(4) organizations?\n       We note that the current regulation has been in place for \n     over 50 years. Moreover, unlike Internal Revenue Code section \n     501(c)(3), which specifically provides that organizations may \n     ``not participate in, or intervene in . . . any political \n     campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for \n     public office.''), section 501(c)(4) does not contain a \n     specific rule or limitation on political campaign \n     intervention by social welfare organizations.\n       Question 2. Since partisan political activity does not meet \n     the IRS definition of ``promoting social welfare,'' how can \n     an organization that participates in any partisan political \n     activity be ``organized exclusively to promote social \n     welfare?''\n       As stated above, longstanding Treasury Regulations have \n     interpreted ``exclusively'' as used in section 501(c)(4) to \n     mean primarily. Treasury Regulation Sec. 1.501(c)(4)-\n     1(a)(2)(i), promulgated in 1959, provides: ``An organization \n     is operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare \n     if it is primarily engaged in promoting the common good and \n     general welfare of the people of the community.'' Applying \n     this Treasury Regulation, Revenue Ruling 81-95, 1981-1 C.B. \n     332, concluded that ``an organization may carry on lawful \n     political activities and remain exempt under section \n     501(c)(4) as long as it is primarily engaged in activities \n     that promote social welfare.''\n       Question 3. The Exempt Organizations 2011 Annual Report and \n     2012 Work Plan states: ``As in any election year, EO will \n     continue its work to enforce the rules relating to political \n     campaigns and campaign expenditures. In FY 2012, EO will \n     combine what it has learned from past projects on political \n     activities with new information gleaned from the redesigned \n     Form 990 to focus its examination resources on serious \n     allegations of impermissible political intervention.''\n       a. Typically, how long after a complaint to the IRS does a \n     compliance review begin?\n       b. What approximate time does it take to review the \n     complaint?\n       The IRS routinely receives examination referrals from a \n     variety of sources including the public, media, Members of \n     Congress or their staff, and has a longstanding process for \n     handling referrals so that they receive an impartial, \n     independent review from career employees. When the IRS \n     receives a referral about a particular organization, it is \n     promptly forwarded to the Classification unit of the Exempt \n     Organizations (EO) Examination office in Dallas, Texas. \n     Pursuant to IRM 4.75.5.4(1), within 30 days of receiving the \n     referral, the Classification staff begins evaluating whether \n     the referral has examination potential, should be considered \n     in a future year, needs additional information to make a \n     decision, or falls within the categories of matters that are \n     referred for EO Referral Committee review. Although IRM \n     4.75.5.4(1) sets a goal of 90 days to complete reviews of \n     referrals, the time it takes to fully review a particular \n     referral varies, depending on such factors as the issues \n     involved and the availability of relevant information (i.e. \n     organization's Forms 990, external sources such as media \n     reports, internet searches, etc.).\n       In those cases in which the IRS needs additional \n     information about the subject of a referral that is not \n     readily available, such as its Form 990 that has not been \n     filed yet for the tax year at issue, Classification may \n     suspend classifying the referral and places it in the follow-\n     up category until the additional information is available. \n     Once the additional information is received, reviewed, and \n     supports the referral being classified as having examination \n     potential, the referral is sent to unassigned inventory, \n     until a revenue agent with the appropriate level of \n     experience for the issues involved in the matter is available \n     to conduct an examination.\n       Once in inventory, there are numerous factors that can \n     affect how long it takes to\n\n[[Page S6431]]\n\n     complete the examination process. While it is difficult to \n     predict how long any single examination will take, for cases \n     closed in FY 2011, the average time it took to close a case \n     was 210 days.\n       c. How many persons are involved in the enforcement of the \n     501(c)(4) rules?\n       The Exempt Organizations (EO) function is responsible for \n     the enforcement of section 501(c)(4) statutory rules and \n     regulations as well as those applicable to all other types of \n     tax-exempt organizations.\n       For FY 2011, the total number of EO staff was 889. Other \n     than the 14 employees in the Director's office, the three EO \n     offices are staffed as follows:\n       Rulings and Agreements (R), which includes EO \n     Determinations and EO Technical, ensures organizations meet \n     legal requirements during the application or private letter \n     ruling process, and through guidance. In FY 2011, R had 332 \n     employees.\n       EO Examinations (Exam) is comprised of various units, \n     including the Classification unit, the EO Compliance Unit, \n     and the Review of Operations unit. Exam develops processes to \n     identify areas of noncompliance, develops corrective \n     strategies, and coordinates with other EO functions to ensure \n     compliance, so that organizations maintain their exempt \n     status. In FY 2011, Exam had 531 employees.\n       EO Customer Education and Outreach (CE) coordinates, \n     assists and supports the development of educational materials \n     and outreach efforts for organizations to understand their \n     responsibilities under the tax law. In FY 2011, CE had a \n     staff of 12 employees.\n       The employees in these functions are responsible for the \n     regulation of all types of tax-exempt organizations, \n     including section 501(c)(4) organizations.\n       Question 4. The Exempt Organizations 2011 Annual Report and \n     2012 Work Plan states that 501(c)(4) organizations ``can \n     declare themselves tax-exempt without seeking a determination \n     from the IRS. EO will review organizations to ensure that \n     they have classified themselves correctly and that they are \n     complying with applicable rules.''\n       a. Why does the IRS allow 501(c)(4) organizations to self-\n     declare?\n       The Internal Revenue Code expressly provides that certain \n     tax-exempt organizations must give notice to the IRS, by \n     filing an application for exemption, in order to claim tax-\n     exempt status. The Internal Revenue Code does not require an \n     organization to provide notice to the IRS to be treated as \n     described in section 501(c)(4). By contrast, for example, \n     Section 508 generally requires an organization to provide \n     notice to the IRS before it will be treated as described in \n     section 501(c)(3).\n       b. When an organization ``self declares'' as a 501(c)(4) \n     organization, how does the IRS get notice and how long does \n     it take the IRS to conduct the review to ensure that the \n     organization has classified itself correctly?\n       As with other tax exempt organizations, organizations \n     claiming to be tax-exempt under section 501(c)(4) generally \n     are required to file a Form 990 on an annual basis.\n       The Exempt Organizations office of the IRS is responsible \n     for the compliance of over one million organizations with \n     diverse goals and purposes. In order to ensure the highest \n     degree of compliance with tax law while working with limited \n     resources, EO maintains a robust and multi-faceted post-\n     filing compliance program that conducts reviews of exempt \n     organizations in various ways, such as:\n       Review of Operations (ROO) reviews: Because a ROO review is \n     not an audit, the ROO carries out its post-filing compliance \n     work without contacting taxpayers. Instead, the ROO looks at \n     an organization's Form 990, website, and other publicly \n     available information to see what it is doing and whether it \n     continues to be organized and operated for tax-exempt \n     purposes. If it appears from a ROO review that an \n     organization may not be compliant, the organization is \n     referred for examination.\n       Compliance checks: In a compliance check, IRS contacts \n     taxpayers by letter when we discover an apparent error on a \n     taxpayer's return or wish to obtain further information or \n     clarification. A compliance check is an efficient and \n     effective way to maintain a compliance presence without an \n     examination. We also use compliance check questionnaires to \n     study specific parts of the tax-exempt community or specific \n     cross-sector practices.\n       Examinations: Examinations, also known as audits, are \n     authorized under Section 7602 of the Code. For exempt \n     organizations, an examination determines an organization's \n     continued qualification for tax-exempt status. We conduct two \n     different types of examinations: correspondence and field.\n       Because the IRS cannot review every existing organization \n     in every tax year, we use the review techniques described \n     above to maximize our coverage of the tax exempt sector in \n     both our general program work and our project work. The \n     project work, which results from our strategic planning \n     process, is designed to focus on specific areas affecting the \n     EO sector and to direct more effective use of our resources \n     in the effort to strengthen compliance and improve tax \n     administration. Described in the EO 2012 Work Plan, the \n     sections 501(c)(4), (5) and (6) Self-Declarers is one such \n     project. This project focuses on organizations that hold \n     themselves out as being tax-exempt rather than seeking IRS \n     recognition of their exempt status.\n       Question 5. The IRS Compliance Guide for Tax-Exempt \n     Organizations states:\n       ``When a 501(c)(4), (5) or (6) organization's communication \n     explicitly advocates the election or defeat of an individual \n     to public office, the communication is considered political \n     campaign activity. A tax-exempt organization that makes \n     expenditures for political campaign activities shall be \n     subject to tax in an amount equal to its net investment \n     income for the year or the aggregate amount expended on \n     political campaign activities during the year, whichever is \n     less.''\n       a. How does the IRS keep track of these explicit \n     communications and ensure that the organization pays this \n     tax?\n       Tax-exempt organizations filing Forms 990 or 990-EZ are \n     required to report political activities. Organizations that \n     engage in direct or indirect political campaign activities \n     are also required to complete Schedule C of Form 990 or 990-\n     EZ. Organizations subject to tax under section 527(f) are \n     required to comply with the statutory reporting and payment \n     rules. The IRS also receives referrals regarding such \n     activities from a variety of sources that are handled through \n     an impartial, independent review. See the response to \n     question 3 for the description on the IRS referral process.\n       b. What is the reason for the requirement that the tax will \n     be based on ``whichever is less'' between its net investment \n     income for the year or the aggregate amount expended on \n     political campaign activities?\n       The statute under section 527(f) explicitly states that a \n     501(c) organization is subject to its tax based on ``an \n     amount equal to the lesser of--(A) the net investment income \n     of such organization for the taxable year, or (B) the \n     aggregate amount expended during the taxable year for such an \n     exempt function.''\n       c. What tax would an organization have to pay if it spends \n     all its income on political advertising (therefore it has NO \n     net investment income)?\n       Under the statute cited above, an organization that \n     otherwise meets the requirements of section 501(c)(4) social \n     welfare tax-exempt status, which spends all its income on \n     political advertising and has no net investment income would \n     not owe any tax under section 527(f). It may however, through \n     such spending (and depending on the otherwise applicable \n     facts of the case), no longer qualify as an organization that \n     is tax-exempt under section 501(c)(4).\n       Question 6. Ms. Lerner's letter quotes the IRS webpage on \n     Social Welfare Organizations:\n       ``The promotion of social welfare does not include direct \n     or indirect participation or intervention in political \n     campaigns on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for \n     public office. However, a section 501(c)(4) social welfare \n     organization may engage in some political activities, so long \n     as that is not its primary activity. However, any expenditure \n     it makes for political activities may be subject to tax under \n     section 527(f). [Emphasis added.]\n       a. What is the statutory basis of the language that allows \n     501(c)(4) organizations to engage in some political \n     activities?\n       Please see responses to questions 1 and 2, above.\n       b. How does the IRS keep track of these political \n     activities and ensure that the organization pays the tax \n     under section 527(f)?\n       Section 501(c)(4) organizations filing Forms 990 or 990-EZ \n     are required to report political activities. Organizations \n     that engage in direct or indirect political campaign \n     activities are also required to complete Schedule C of Form \n     990 or 990-EZ. Organizations subject to tax under section \n     527(f) are required to comply with the statutory reporting \n     and payment rules. The IRS also receives referrals regarding \n     such activities from a variety of sources that are handled \n     through an impartial, independent review. See the response to \n     question 3 for the description on the IRS referral process.\n       Question 7. In her July 13 letter, Ms. Lerner states that \n     the IRS also addresses the issue of political activities in \n     the Forms 990 and 990-EZ.\n       Are Forms 990 and 990-EZ made public? If so, where can they \n     be accessed?\n       Yes, Forms 990 and 990-EZ are made public. Tax-exempt \n     organizations are required to make their returns widely \n     available for public inspection. Organizations are required \n     to allow the public to inspect the Forms 990, 990-EZ, 990-N, \n     and 990-PF they have filed with the IRS for their three most \n     recent tax years. Exempt organizations also are required to \n     provide copies of these information returns when requested, \n     or make them available on the Internet. The annual \n     information returns also are available from the IRS, as well \n     as from third-party sources that post them on their websites.\n       Question 8. Internal Revenue Services Publication 557 \n     states that, if a 501(c)(4) entity can ``submit proof that \n     [the] organization is organized exclusively to promote social \n     welfare, it can obtain an exemption even if it participates \n     legally in some political activity on behalf of or in \n     opposition to candidates for public office.''\n       Have the following 501(c)(4) organizations a) applied for; \n     and if so, b) received the described exemption for political \n     activity from the IRS?\n       a.

Citizens for a Working America Inc.\n       l. Susan B. Anthony List\n       Initially, to clarify, section 501(c)(4) organizations do \n     not receive ``exemption for political activity.'' Rather, \n     organizations are recognized under section 501 (c)(4) as tax-\n     exempt when they demonstrate that they plan to be primarily \n     engaged in activities that promote social welfare. If they \n     meet that standard, the fact that they engage in other \n     activities that do not promote social welfare, such as \n     political campaign intervention, will not preclude \n     recognition of their tax-exempt status. Whether an \n     organization meets the statutory and regulatory requirements \n     of section 501 (c)(4) depends upon all of the facts and \n     circumstances, and no one factor is determinative.\n       As discussed in our response to you dated June 4, 2012, \n     section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code prohibits the \n     disclosure of information about specific taxpayers unless the \n     disclosure is authorized by some provision in the Internal \n     Revenue Code. The IRS cannot legally disclose whether the \n     organizations on your list have applied for tax exemption \n     (unless and until such application is approved). Section 61 \n     04(a) of the Code permits public disclosure of an application \n     for recognition of tax exempt status only after the \n     organization has been recognized as exempt.\n       Searching the names exactly as provided, our records show \n     that the following organizations have been recognized by the \n     IRS as tax exempt under section 501(c)(4).\n\n     Americans For Prosperity\n     American Future Fund\n     60 Plus Association\n     Patriot Majority USA\n     Citizens for a Working America Inc.\n\n       With respect to the other organizations for which you \n     inquired, we will be able to determine if they have been \n     recognized by the IRS as tax-exempt with additional \n     information, such as an address or EIN, that specifically \n     identifies the organization. Organizations often have similar \n     names or maintain multiple chapters with variations of the \n     same name. With respect to many of the other organizations \n     you identified, numerous organizations in our records have \n     very similar names. IRS staff can work with your staff in \n     identifying the specific organizations for which you are \n     interested. IRS staff is also available to assist your staff \n     to navigate searchable databases on the IRS public website. \n     As previously discussed, information on organizations with \n     applications currently pending legally cannot be provided \n     unless and until the application is approved. Please note \n     that organizations that hold themselves out as tax-exempt \n     without IRS recognition and organizations that have pending \n     applications for recognition are required to file annual \n     returns/notices.\n       Question 9. Have you reminded 501(c)(4)s which publicly \n     seem to be operating in the partisan political arena as to \n     the factors you will consider in determining whether they are \n     engaging in partisan political activity? If not, why not?\n       As described in the July 13, 2012 response, the IRS takes \n     several steps to continually educate organizations of the \n     requirements under the tax law and inform them of their \n     responsibilities to avoid jeopardizing their tax-exempt \n     status. We believe these steps ensure the IRS administers the \n     nation's tax laws in a fair and impartial manner.\n       I hope this information is helpful. If you have questions, \n     please contact me or have your staff contact Catherine Barre \n     at (202) 622-3720.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Steven T. Miller,\n\n                                           Deputy Commissioner for\n     Services and Enforcement.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Homeland Security and \n           Governmental Affairs,\n                                  Washington, DC, August 31, 2012.\n     Hon. Douglas H. Shulman,\n     Commissioner, Internal Revenue Service,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Commissioner Shulman: Thank you for the August 24, \n     2012 response by Steven T. Miller, Deputy Commissioner for \n     Services and Enforcement, to my July 27, 2012 letter.\n       I find it unacceptable that the IRS appears to be passively \n     standing by while organizations that hold themselves out to \n     be ``social welfare'' organizations clearly ignore the tax \n     code with no apparent consequences.\n       Frankly, the response that ``long standing Treasury \n     Regulations have interpreted `exclusively' '' as used in \n     section 501(c)(4) to mean ``primarily'' and the argument that \n     ``section 501(c)(4) does not contain a specific rule or \n     limitation on political campaign intervention by social \n     welfare organizations'' are not persuasive. The word \n     ``exclusively'' as written in the statute is clear and speaks \n     for itself. Its clarity is not diminished because the section \n     does not mimic words in another section, which words are also \n     clear.\n       As a follow-up to your letter, I would like to know the \n     following:\n       1. If the IRS determines that an organization that has been \n     given 501(c)(4) status has not engaged primarily in social \n     welfare activities, but instead was primarily engaged in \n     activity within the scope of section 527, what are the \n     consequences for the organization? What are the consequences \n     for such an organization having not filed timely Forms 8871 \n     and 8872? Must they file such forms after the fact? What \n     taxes would be due? Will contributions that already have been \n     made to that organization be taxable to that organization?\n       2. How many 501(c)(4) organizations which appear to be \n     primarily engaged in political activity have been notified by \n     the IRS within the last 6 months that they may be in \n     violation of the law?\n       It is urgent that I receive your answers promptly, and no \n     later than September 10, please.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Carl Levin,\n\n                               Chairman, Permanent Subcommittee on\n     Investigations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                     Internal Revenue Service,\n\n                             Washington, D.C., September 14, 2012.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I am responding to your letter to \n     Commissioner Shulman dated August 31,2012, requesting \n     additional information about section 501(c)(4) organizations. \n     This response supplements the previous responses dated June \n     4, 2012, July 13, 2012 and August 24, 2012, and addresses the \n     additional questions raised in your recent letter.\n       Question 1. If the IRS determines that an organization that \n     has been given 501(c)(4) status has not engaged primarily in \n     social welfare activities, but instead was primarily engaged \n     in activity within the scope of section 527, what are the \n     consequences for the organization? What are the consequences \n     for such an organization having not filed timely Forms 8871 \n     and 8872? Must they file such forms after the fact? What \n     taxes will be due? Will contributions that already have been \n     made to that organization be taxable to that organization?\n       If an IRS audit or examination concludes that a section \n     501(c)(4) organization does not engage primarily in social \n     welfare activities, the IRS may revoke the tax-exempt status \n     of that organization. If the tax-exempt status is revoked, \n     the organization is a taxable entity effective, in general, \n     as of the first day of the tax year under examination. The \n     organization is required to file Federal income tax returns, \n     generally a Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax. The tax \n     treatment of the organization's contributions and other \n     income is determined under normal rules of Subtitle A.\n       Whether an organization no longer qualifies to be tax-\n     exempt under section 501(c)(4) does not determine whether it \n     is a political organization under section 527. Section \n     527(e)(1) defines a political organization as a party, \n     committee, or other organization that is organized and \n     operated primarily for the purpose of directly or indirectly \n     accepting contributions or making expenditures for an exempt \n     function (as defined in 527(e)(2)). If an organization meets \n     this definition, then its tax status is determined under \n     section 527.\n       Subject to certain exceptions, to be tax-exempt under \n     section 527, a political organization is required to give \n     notice electronically to the Service. The required notice \n     form is Form 8871, Political Organization Notice of Section \n     527 Status. To be tax-exempt, the political organization must \n     file Form 8871 within 24 hours after the date on which it was \n     established. If the organization has a material change in any \n     of the information reported on Form 8871, it must file an \n     amended Form 8871 within 30 days of the material change to \n     maintain its tax-exempt status. When the organization \n     terminates its existence, it must file a final Form 8871 \n     within 30 days of termination.\n       An organization that is required to file Form 8871, but \n     fails to file on a timely basis, will not be treated as a \n     tax-exempt political organization for any period before the \n     date Form 8871 is filed. The taxable income of the \n     organization for any period in which it failed to file Form \n     8871 (or, in the case of a material change, the period \n     beginning with the date of the material change and ending on \n     the date it satisfies the notice requirement) is subject to \n     tax and must be reported on the annual income tax return Form \n     112Q-POL. The tax is computed by multiplying the \n     organization's taxable income by the highest federal \n     corporate tax rate, currently 35 percent. For purposes of \n     computing its taxable income for any period, the organization \n     includes its exempt function income (including contributions \n     received, membership dues, and political fundraising \n     receipts), minus any deductions directly connected with the \n     production of that income, but may not deduct its exempt \n     function expenditures for the period.\n       Generally, tax-exempt political organizations that have, or \n     expect to have. contributions or expenditures exceeding \n     $25,000 during a calendar year are required to file Form \n     8872, Political Organization Report of Contributions and \n     Expenditures, beginning with the first month or quarter \n     during the calendar year in which they accept contributions \n     or make expenditures. A tax-exempt political organization \n     subject to the periodic reporting requirement may choose to \n     file Form 8872 on a monthly basis or on a quarterly/\n     semiannual basis, but it must file on the same basis for the \n     entire calendar year. In addition, tax-exempt political \n     organizations that make contributions or expenditures with \n     respect to an election for federal office as defined in \n     527(j)(6) may be required to file pre-election reports for \n     that election.\n       A tax-exempt political organization that does not timely \n     file the required Form 8872, or that fails to include the \n     information required on the Form 8872. must pay an amount \n     calculated by multiplying the amount of contributions and \n     expenditures that are not disclosed by the highest federal \n     corporate tax rate, currently 35 percent.\n\n[[Page S6433]]\n\n       Question 2. How many 501(c)(4) organizations which appear \n     to be primarily engaged in political activity have been \n     notified by the IRS within the last 6 months that they may be \n     in violation of the law?\n       When the IRS examines a section 501(c)(4) organization, the \n     objective of the audit is to determine whether that \n     organization qualifies for tax-exempt-status as a social \n     welfare organization. As discussed in our June 4, 2012 \n     response to your March 30, 2012 letter, that determination \n     looks to whether the organization is primarily engaged in \n     activities that promote social welfare, not organized or \n     operated for profit, and the net earnings of which do not \n     inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or \n     individual. The examination looks at the activities engaged \n     in during the complete taxable year at issue. Although the \n     promotion of social welfare does not include direct or \n     indirect participation or intervention in political campaigns \n     on behalf of or in opposition to any candidate for public \n     office, a section 501(c)(4) social welfare organization can \n     engage in political activities as long as it is primarily \n     engaged in activities that promote social welfare.\n       If the IRS believes that an organization does not meet the \n     requirements under section 501(c)(4), the IRS notifies the \n     organization of its intention to revoke the organization's \n     exempt status, explaining the law and reasons for the \n     proposed revocation. The organization has 30 days from the \n     date of that letter to protest or appeal the determination \n     before a final revocation letter is issued to the \n     organization.\n       During the past six months, no notices of proposed or final \n     revocation were issued to section 501(c)(4) organizations. \n     Note that the IRS currently has more than 70 ongoing \n     examinations of section 501(c)(4) organizations (this \n     includes examinations for a variety of issues, some of which \n     include whether the organization is primarily engaged in \n     activities that promote social welfare). It is also important \n     to note that the Service also maintains a determination \n     process to review the operations of an organization to \n     determine whether it should be recognized as tax exempt. In \n     this area, we also review compliance with the legal \n     requirements, including whether an organization is primary \n     engaged in activities that promote social welfare. There are \n     currently more than 1,600 organizations in the determination \n     process seeking recognition as a section 501(c)(4) \n     organization. The level of political activity is an issue in \n     a number of these determination cases.\n       I hope this information is helpful.

But \nhe has served our Nation with great distinction and ability.\n  Bruce was appointed to be a district court judge by President Clinton \nin 1995. During the 17 years of his service in that position he has \nexemplified the integrity and high standards of fairness and \nimpartiality which we strive for in our Federal judiciary.\n  Throughout his years as a Federal judge he has never lost sight of \nthe real-life effects of the court's decisions on the lives of those \nwho come before the court.\n  Bruce and his wife Mary have exciting plans for the next chapter of \ntheir lives. They are close friends to my wife Anne, and me. We wish \nthem the very best in future years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6433-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JONA OLSSON\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Jona Olsson, \nfire chief of the Latir Volunteer Fire Department located near Questa, \nNM. Olsson was recently honored as the 2012 Volunteer Fire Chief of the \nYear by Fire Chief for her tireless work at the Latir Volunteer Fire \nDepartment and her efforts to increase diversity in the local fire \nservice. She was honored on August 3, 2012, during the opening session \nof the International Association of Fire Chiefs' Fire-Rescue \nInternational Conference and Exhibition in Denver, CO.\n  After moving to New Mexico in 1999, Olsson was recruited to join the \nLatir Volunteer Fire Department. She quickly became integrated in the \nfire department, rising through the ranks, serving as a training \nofficer, deputy chief, and eventually fire and EMS chief for the \ndepartment in 2006. Olsson has facilitated training to individual \ndepartments and fire conferences across North America, as well as the \nUnited Kingdom.\n  During tough economic times, Olsson and other volunteers have \ncontinued to expand the fire department, increasing training hours and \nthe number of qualified volunteers. All 18 of Latir's volunteer \nfirefighters are structure trained, 13 are qualified with wildland Red \nCards, and nine have EMS licenses. The Latir Volunteer Fire Department \nalso has an active junior firefighter program. In addition, the fire \ndepartment recently built a new addition to the fire station and \npurchased another fire engine.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in honoring Jona Olsson and the \nexcellent work of the Latir Volunteer Fire Department. The dedication \nof Olsson and the community volunteers helps ensure the delivery of \nvital services to New Mexico residents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6433-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6433-S6437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, I am delighted to commend the Solon \nElementary School of Solon, ME, on being named a 2012 National Blue \nRibbon School of Excellence. This prestigious recognition of high \naccomplishment was bestowed by Secretary of Education Arne Duncan.\n  Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools award is considered the \nhighest honor an American school can obtain.

Mr. President, I rise today during Suicide Prevention \nMonth to recognize the Army's Suicide Stand Down Day, which will take \nplace later this month on September 27, 2012.\n  The stand down is an opportunity for the Army to take a hard look at \ncurrent efforts to address the issue of suicide among soldiers and \nfocus on ways to improve these efforts. It will emphasize eliminating \nthe stigma surrounding mental health injuries, which too often prevents \nour service men and women from getting the help they need.\n  This could not come at a more critical time. The incidence of suicide \namong our troops has skyrocketed to alarming levels due, in part, to \nover 10 years of repeated and protracted deployments to combat zones \naround the world. In fact, the Army experienced a record-high 38 \nActive-Duty suicides in July and is on track to surpass last year's \ntotal. This is absolutely tragic and requires urgent and sustained \naction.\n  The central theme of the stand down is ``Shoulder to Shoulder: We \nStand up for Life.'' This is such a critical message--our \nservicemembers should never have to suffer alone. Our military men and \nwomen make tremendous sacrifices each and every day in service to our \nNation, and we have a sacred obligation to take care of them in return. \nThis means ensuring they feel comfortable seeking the care that they \nneed without fear or repercussion or being stigmatized. This also means \nimproving access to mental health care and providing support for our \nmilitary families.\n  While there is no single solution to preventing military suicide, \nefforts like the Army's Suicide Stand Down Day are important steps \nbecause they provide an opportunity to have a frank conversation across \nall levels of leadership about the profound stressors our troops are \nexperiencing.\n  I strongly encourage all branches of our military to continue to \nreview and improve their suicide prevention programs because it is \nclear that more must be done and that it must be done now.\n  Suicide reaches far beyond one individual--it devastates entire \nfamilies and affects communities. Our military families are resilient \nand they display incredible courage in the face of so many unique \nchallenges, but no one person or family can be strong all the time.\n  That is why we must continue to do everything in our power to send \nthe message to our servicemembers, veterans, and their families that it \nis OK to ask for help and that the care and support they need is \nwaiting for them.\n  I urge our citizens, our government, and our Nation to continue to \nstand shoulder to shoulder with our Armed Forces and recommit ourselves \nto stemming the tide of military suicide once and for all because we \ncan all agree that one suicide is one too many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6438-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6438-S6440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ELECTION IN TAIWAN\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in August I submitted a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that the U.S. Government should \ncontinue to support democracy and human rights in Taiwan following the \nJanuary 2012 Presidential and legislative elections. The International \nElection Observers Mission has prepared a Report on the National \nElection in Taiwan that includes some important details and findings. I \nask unanimous consent that the summary of that report be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Report on the National Election in Taiwan, January 14, 2012\n\n       To: International Committee for Fair Elections in Taiwan\n       From: The International Election Observers Mission (IEOM)\n       By: Woodrow W. Clark II MA, PhD, Lead Author and Senator \n     Frank Murkowski, Chair and all IEOM Members.\n\n\n                                Overview\n\n       Taiwan is an island nation of 23.2 million people (November \n     2011) in an area of 35,980 sq. km. The nation has 18.1 \n     million eligible voters, all citizens who are 20 or more \n     years of age. The winner of the January 14, 2012 Presidential \n     Election, with 51.6 per cent of the vote, was Mr. Ma Ying-\n     jeou, the incumbent and the nominee, Chinese Nationalist \n     Party (Kuomintang or KMT). Ms. Tsai Ing-wen of the opposition \n     Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) followed with 45.6 per \n     cent and the nominee of the small People First Party (PFP), \n     Mr. James Soong received about 2.8 per cent of the vote \n     (Taiwan Election Results, January 2012).\n       At the same time, voters also elected the 113 members of \n     the national parliament, the Legislative Yuan. The KMT won 64 \n     seats, while the DPP won 40 seats and the PFP, the Taiwan \n     Solidarity Union (TSU) and non-partisan independent \n     candidates each won three seats. Compared with the 2008 \n     legislative election, the KMT won 17 fewer seats, the DPP \n     gained 13 additional seats, the PFP won two additional seats \n     and the TSU, with its three seats, returned to the \n     legislature after a four-year absence.\n\n\n                          Political Background\n\n       Taiwan experienced a long political struggle during the \n     authoritarian era. Democracy in Taiwan only began after the \n     death of President Chiang Ching-kuo in January 1988 and the \n     accession of Lee Teng-hui to the presidency. The political \n     system is not divided between ``left'' and ``right,'' though \n     the DPP does place somewhat more emphasis on ``social \n     justice.'' Instead, ``the primary political cleavage between \n     the political parties has been and remains the issue of \n     national identity, often referred to as the `unification-\n     independence' issue'' (Taiwan Elections Handbook, 2012: \n     p.13), or between the ``pan-blue'' alliance (Kuomintang and \n     associated parties) and the ``pan-green'' alliance (DPP and \n     aligned parties).\n       Mr. Ma's percentage of the vote fell from the 58 per cent \n     he gained four years earlier and, as indicated earlier, the \n     new KMT majority in the legislature was much less than the \n     huge victory, which it won in 2008 (Cole, March 9, 2012).\n\n\n           The International Election Observer Mission (IEOM)\n\n       Eighteen (18) observers from seven countries were invited \n     by the International Committee for Fair Elections in Taiwan \n     (ICFET) to form an International Election Observation Mission \n     (IEOM) for the January 2012 Presidential and Legislative \n     elections in Taiwan. See the list of members of the IEOM \n     below in Table 1.\n       The group consisted of observers from Australia, Canada, \n     Denmark, France, Japan, Sweden, the Netherlands, and the \n     United States, ranging in experiences from academia, elected \n     representatives, religious groups, businesses, and civil \n     society. As observers, the IEOM members tried to be strictly \n     neutral in all their activities, data gathering, and \n     conclusions.\n       Most members of the IEOM were in Taiwan from January 10-15, \n     2012. Members visited locations in Taipei, Kaohsiung, Tainan, \n     and Taichung. As a group, they met with campaign organizers, \n     staff, and candidates from the three political parties \n     running presidential tickets: the Democratic Progressive \n     Party (DPP), the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT), and the \n     People First Party (PFP). Then, on the day before the \n     election (January 13, 2012) and during Election Day (January \n     14, 2012), the IEOM split into smaller groups of 2-4 members \n     who observed political rallies, street campaigns, and polling \n     station as well as the Central Election Commission counting \n     center on Election Day.\n       This report consists of direct IEOM observations by its \n     members as well as other sources, including the Taiwan and \n     international press as well as post-election news sources in \n     Chinese and English. Other observer groups were also present \n     in Taiwan.\n       One other neutral observation group, the Asian Network for \n     Free Elections Foundation (ANFREL), headquartered in Bangkok, \n     Thailand, deserves special mention. ANFREL produced an \n     Observers Report (entitled ``Credible Elections but a Tilted \n     Playing Field'') after the Election that corresponds with \n     many IEOM observations as well as our Press Release and this \n     Report. The ANFREL Report (2012) will be cited herein.\n\n\n                              Full Report\n\n  The full report of the IEOM was published in Taiwan on June 11th \n2012, and is available on the website of the International Committee \nfor Fair Elections in Taiwan (ICFET) at: http://\nwww.taiwanelections.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Taiwan-2012-\nElections-IEOM-Final-Report.pdf\n\n[[Page S6439]]\n\n          Key Sections: Nation Elections and Set of Conditions\n\n     The National Election: democracy and identity politics\n       Over the past twenty years, many surveys have been \n     conducted on the identity of Taiwan's citizens. Overall, the \n     numbers who consider themselves solely Taiwanese have \n     increased from 17.3 per cent in 1992 to 54.2 per cent in June \n     2011. At the same time, the numbers who consider themselves \n     solely Chinese have declined from 25.5 per cent in 1992 to \n     only 4.1 per cent in June 2011. This development has \n     continued since Ma become president in 2008. Furthermore, a \n     recent survey shows that 74 per cent prefer independence, if \n     given a free choice, and more than 81.7 per cent refused to \n     accept the ``One country, Two systems'' proposal from China \n     (Danielsen, 2012, pp. 141-142).\n       Taiwan has much more income equality than most countries \n     today, and according to some commentators is one of the most \n     ``equal societies'' in East Asia. However, inequality has \n     been rising in recent years, so that about 20 per cent of the \n     Taiwan population earns over six times that of the bottom 20 \n     per cent of the population. While the unemployment level \n     remains low by international comparison, it too has been \n     rising, affecting mainly lower and working-class people.\n       The national elections on January 14, 2012 were the fifth \n     direct presidential and the seventh direct parliamentary \n     election. Many have called Taiwan's elections ``a beacon of \n     democratic practices in Asia'' (Baum and van der Wees, 2012). \n     Thus, many other nations in Asia and around the world were \n     watching the Taiwan election process and its outcome very \n     carefully. Taiwan has indeed become more ``democratic'' over \n     the last twenty-four years, due to its allowing the existence \n     and activities of opposition political parties and the rapid \n     growth of human rights on the island. Nonetheless, these \n     national elections were not perfect. This is why the IEOM, in \n     its post-election Press Release, labeled them ``mostly free \n     but partly unfair'' (Taiwan Elections, 2012).\n       Taiwan is surely not alone among countries across the globe \n     in which movements dealing with social and environmental \n     concerns have been followed up by developments focusing on \n     the establishing and functioning of a genuinely democratic \n     system. ``People power movements'' have also occurred in \n     Eastern Europe and Latin America, and most recently in the \n     Middle East and Northern Africa. . . .\n       Taiwan is also not alone among nations concerned with \n     democracy today. Many western nations face similar problems. \n     Thus, David Kilgour, a member of the IEOM, spoke about \n     election issues in Ontario, Canada in 2005 to the House of \n     Commons Study Group. He noted then that Canada had some \n     similar issues with vote-getting (that is, the process \n     whereby candidates seek votes by offering various forms of \n     financial gains). . . . .\n       Hence the concern for free and open democratic elections is \n     not restricted to nations, which have recently become \n     democratic (Economist, 2012, pp. 47-48). They are also \n     prominent in western developed democratic nations in the \n     West, like the USA, Canada, France, Italy, Spain, and the UK.\n     Conditions for Free Elections\n       In the following section, we follow the universal \n     conditions for democratic elections, as set forth by Wolf \n     (1984), which can be applied to evaluate the national \n     elections in Taiwan in January 2012. These conditions are \n     based upon election observations in Nicaragua during which \n     Wolf identified nine ``Conditions'' that can be applied \n     anywhere in the world (ibid., Preface). Wolf's nine \n     Conditions are:\n       1) Honest watching of each polling station\n       2) Total secrecy in casting the vote\n       3) Voting: Dates, Residency, Inspection, and Counting\n       4) Absence of a climate of coercion and fear\n       5) Pre-election freedom of party organization and activity\n       6) Institutional freedom of intermediate organizations\n       7) Freedom of speech, campaigning, and assembly\n       8) Freedom of access to the media\n       9) Media financing of cable, TV, social and electronic, \n     journals, newspapers, and others\n       The IEOM proposes two additional Conditions both for Taiwan \n     and for other nations:\n       No. 10: Elections not determined or influenced by \n     international pressure or informal relationships.\n       No. 11: All Candidates should have equal access to funding \n     for elections.\n       Overall, the IEOM considers the 2012 Taiwan National \n     Election to have been acceptable for Conditions 1, 2, 4, and \n     6. However, Conditions 3, 5, and 7 through 11 raise issues \n     that should be addressed and corrected in future elections to \n     improve the functioning of democracy in Taiwan.\n\n\n                    Conclusions and Recommendations\n\n       The IEOM would like to thank the organizers of the visit, \n     the ICFET, for their invitation and organizing of the \n     delegation. The IEOM wants to encourage the ICFET to continue \n     in its efforts and to support election observation activities \n     in the future to strengthen Taiwan's democracy, so that it \n     can be shared with other countries in the region and around \n     the world. As the IEOM conducted its observations, the \n     members greatly appreciated the willingness of candidates, \n     party representatives, and government representatives to meet \n     with them. Every party organization and its representatives \n     demonstrated hospitality, and suffered the IEOM's questions \n     with grace and dignity.\n     Areas for Improvement\n       The IEOM and ANFREL (January 2012) delegations made \n     comments on the successes of the Taiwan national election, \n     which are summarized below. Both groups saw ``areas of \n     concern''. These comments are made to provide constructive \n     feedback on the process in the spirit of improving it, so as \n     to provide a vibrant democratic system worthy of Taiwan's \n     people. No matter what happens in the future, China will \n     continue to have an impact and influence in Taiwan, just as \n     its economic impact is being felt around the world. The \n     peaceful interactions between nations will result in building \n     relationships and producing changes for both nations. Ms. \n     Tsai indicated the need for the DPP to work with China during \n     the election campaign.\n       Several key institutions need to be strengthened. For \n     example, civil service and non-elected offices all need to be \n     further de-politicized. Improvements in the legitimacy of the \n     elections and reduction of the politicization of the police \n     and courts would increase trust in them by the people and \n     reduce criticism of them during campaigns. Attention should \n     be put to ensuring the neutrality and impartiality, both real \n     and perceived, of all related government agencies.\n       The IEOM affirms that Taiwan is already a democratic \n     nation. But as with other democracies, there are problems \n     that need to be addressed. These range from public reporting \n     and control of election expenditures to the use of media and \n     neutrality of the administration. The issues of the \n     neutrality of the administrative and judicial systems are \n     serious and need to be addressed through public oversight, \n     evaluation and control. Will the newly re-elected government \n     appoint and oversee ``objective'' and ``transparent'' \n     government officials and judicial officers and move towards \n     much-needed judicial, administrative as well as legislative \n     reforms?\n       The world will continue to watch Taiwan as it ``performs'' \n     and reveals in the next four years what those future steps \n     will be. Taiwan is a sign of hope to many and has been a \n     model of democratic transformation. It should continue to be \n     the ``showcase nation'' for democracy. To do that requires \n     ongoing review and oversight.\n       The IEOM has a number of specific recommendations:\n       A) Thoroughly and honestly resolve the longstanding problem \n     of KMT party assets, including their source, use and \n     investments that create a huge imbalance in financial \n     resources available to each party. This imbalance distorts \n     everything else in Taiwan's elections, including that which \n     is otherwise fair. These hidden assets also provide huge \n     hidden funds to use for election media and other public \n     relations activities. President Ma has stated he wants to \n     resolve the status of these funds, but has not done so as \n     yet. In his new term, the proof will be in his actions.\n       B) Strengthen enforcement and public promotion of campaign \n     spending laws, and close the many loopholes that candidates \n     and parties can use.\n       C) Make consequences real for candidates who buy votes, \n     such as disqualification from running in future elections. \n     For example, in 2008 the PFP Plains Aboriginal candidate Lin \n     Cheng-er was removed as a legislator after he was convicted \n     of vote-buying, yet he ran again as a PFP candidate in 2012 \n     and won. We believe he should have been disqualified from \n     running.\n       D) Use party discipline to combat vote-buying. Parties can \n     mobilize members to assist with the oversight of compliance \n     with election laws and can establish committees to gather \n     evidence concerning election improprieties. However, it is \n     the individual candidates who will make the difference. In \n     short, it is the candidates, not the parties, who buy votes.\n       E) Change the household registration system to allow people \n     to vote where they actually work or study in Taiwan and thus \n     end the need to travel long distances in Taiwan to vote. This \n     is already practiced in many countries.\n\n\nTable 1: Members of The International Election Observers Mission (IEOM)\n\n       United States--Frank Murkowski, Former Senator and Former \n     Governor of Alaska (USA); USA, Chair of IEOM Mission; Woodrow \n     Clark II, PhD.

Mr. President, on February 25, 1812, by an act of the Rhode \nIsland General Assembly, the Rhode Island Medical Society was \nchartered. In short order, physicians in the State adopted bylaws and \nelected officers, becoming the eighth State medical society in the \nNation. Over the past 200 years, the Rhode Island Medical Society has \nworked to fulfill its founding principle to consistently improve \npatient care. That principle is reflected in its many accomplishments \nin the field of public health.\n  By 1852, just 40 years later, Rhode Island became the fourth State to \ncollect, analyze, and publish birth, marriage, and death statistics on \nan annual basis. Soon after, it began distributing clinical papers of \npeers regarding public health trends and treatments. These early \nactions reflect a keen understanding of disease prevention and health \npromotion, as well as the collaborative nature of medicine.\n  Since these early years, the Rhode Island Medical Society has \nadvanced public health efforts that run the gamut from sanitation to \nvaccination.

Mr. President, we recognize September as Ovarian \nCancer Awareness Month.\n  This year, the American Cancer Society estimates that 22,000 women \nwill develop ovarian cancer and more than 15,550 women will lose their \nbattle with this deadly cancer.\n  In the last 40 years, the National Cancer Institute, NCI, academic \nmedical centers, and researchers across the country have made \nremarkable strides in improving treatments and therapies for various \ncancers.\n  Today, there are 12 million Americans who are cancer survivors.\n  Despite this progress, effective treatments for some cancers--\nincluding ovarian cancer--remain elusive.\n  This month, we support these women, their families, and the tireless \nefforts of health care providers and researchers across the country.\n  That is why I joined more than a dozen Senate colleagues as an \noriginal cosponsor of the National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month \nResolution.\n  If detected earlier, an ovarian cancer patient has a 94 percent \nchance of surviving longer than 5 years.\n  However, only 20 percent of ovarian cancer is detected in its early \nstage, and when diagnosed in the advanced stage there is only a 30 \npercent chance of survival.\n  This makes ovarian cancer the deadliest of all gynecologic cancers.\n  The National Ovarian Cancer Awareness Resolution designates September \nas Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month and encourages the efforts of cancer \nadvocates to increase public awareness.\n  It also supports the NCI and medical researchers work to develop a \nreliable early detection test.\n  I have long been an advocate of cancer patients and research.\n  During the health reform debate, I successfully worked to pass the \nClinical Trials Amendment.\n  Because of the amendment's inclusion in the Affordable Care Act, ACA, \nhealth insurance companies can no longer use participation in a \nclinical trial as a reason to deny health insurance coverage for \nroutine health care.\n  This provision of the ACA is especially important for diseases like \novarian cancer that desperately need advancements in effective \ntherapies.\n  As we recognize the importance of advancing ovarian cancer research \nand commend the struggle ovarian cancer patients and survivors \nencounter, we must ensure that researchers get the necessary funding \nand patients receive access to comprehensive care and coverage.\n  I will continue to support the goals of Ovarian Cancer Awareness \nMonth--not just in September--throughout the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6440-4", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6440-S6441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE LEGEND OF LATROBE\n\n  Mr. CASEY.

Mr. President, Henry Ford once said, ``Anyone who \nstops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps \nlearning stays young. The greatest thing in life is to keep your mind \nyoung.''\n  On October 12, 2012, Montana Tech in Butte, MT, will honor two people \nwho embody that very spirit: Frank and Ann Gilmore. As reflected in \ntheir stories, both Frank and Anne recognize the importance of \neducation and giving back to society.\n  A Mississippi native, Dr. Frank Gilmore sought educational \nopportunities early and often. He was the first member of his family to \nearn a college degree. Frank's intellectual curiosity paved the way for \nan impressive academic career, one that includes studies at the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. Frank \nobtained a bachelor's degree in chemistry from Virginia Military \nInstitute, and then went on to earn his Ph.D. in organic chemistry with \na minor in industrial relations at MIT. His career in higher education \nbegan in 1967 at the University of Mississippi. Dr. Gilmore then taught \nat the West Virginia University Institute of Technology, and finally \njoined Montana Tech in 1998 as chancellor.\n  Montana Tech has earned a reputation as one of the finest science, \nengineering, and technical colleges in the world, and much of its \nsuccess can be attributed to the incredible leadership under Dr. Frank \nGilmore. Under Dr. Gilmore's chancellorship, The Princeton Review \nselected Montana Tech as one of its ``Best 368 Colleges'' for 11 \nconsecutive years. One of Dr. Gilmore's proudest accomplishments is \nimproving Montana Tech's efforts to find students employment before \nthey even graduate.\n  During Frank's time as chancellor, Montana Tech boasted placement \nrates for its graduates between 93 and 98 percent. And, lucky for us, \n70 to 80 percent of Tech graduates chose to remain and work in Montana.\n  Frank's dedication to his students went far beyond the classroom. I \nproudly partnered with Montana Tech in 2007 and 2010 to organize the \nMontana Economic Development Summits. We could not have asked for a \nbetter host than Montana Tech. Frank proudly offered the campus to hold \nworkshops and host some of the world's most influential business and \neconomic leaders. The connections made at Montana Tech during those \nsummits have yielded untold investment and job opportunities for \nMontanans.\n  Not only is Dr. Gilmore's career in education inspiring, he also \nserved his country with distinction in the military. He first served as \na Marine Corps reservist when he was a teenager, then as an Active-Duty \nsoldier in the Army, and finally as a captain in the Army Reserve.\n  This past year, Frank was appointed as president of the Barry M. \nGoldwater Scholarship and Excellence in Education Foundation. The \nGoldwater Foundation was established to encourage college students to \npursue science, math, and engineering. I proudly advocated for Dr. \nGilmore's appointment, as I cannot think of anyone more qualified to \nlead these efforts.\n  Ann Louise Gauthier Gilmore was also the first in her family to earn \na college degree. She received her bachelor's degree in dietetics from \nthe University of Northern Colorado. Like Frank, she also honorably \nserved in our Nation's military.\n  Ann joined the U.S. Army in 1961 and completed her dietetic \ninternship at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC. She \ncontinued to serve our Nation in the Army Medical Corps until her \nhonorable discharge in 1963 as a first lieutenant.\n  Not only has Ann demonstrated a life-long commitment to education and \nto our country, she has directed her talents toward serving her \ncommunity. Ann worked with the Women, Infants and Children, WIC, \nProgram in Mississippi, the PEO, Philanthropic Educational \nOrganization, a sisterhood committed to empowering women through \neducation, and served on the board of the Butte Symphony Orchestra.\n  Frank and Ann's stories give us hope that there are dedicated, hard-\nworking folks in our schools, providing our children with the tools \nthey need to succeed. In a world more competitive than ever before, it \nis essential that we provide all Montanans with a world-class \neducation. Investing in Montana's young minds is the best way to keep \nus competitive with our global neighbors and to ensure a solid economic \nfuture.\n  Thanks to the community's overwhelming generosity and support, \nMontana Tech constructed a new university center to honor Frank and Ann \nGilmore. The new Frank & Ann Gilmore University Relations Center serves \nboth students and alumni. The center provides a much-needed venue for \nstudents to meet their future employers, as well as place for alumni to \nconvene and reminisce about their time at Montana Tech.\n  As we all can see, both Frank and Anne possess an insatiable hunger \nfor education which they have used to better their community. The \nUniversity of Montana, the Butte and Anaconda communities, and \nespecially the Montana Tech students, faculty, and staff, all know that \nwith people like Frank and Ann, Montana will continue to become an even \nbetter place to live, work, and raise a family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6441-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL PREPAREDNESS MONTH\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to proclaim September 2012 \nas Alaska Preparedness Month. No one can predict when or where the next \ncrisis will be, and as a state that is particularly vulnerable to \nnatural disasters and human-caused emergencies, it is essential that \nAlaskans be prepared to respond to any crisis that may arise.\n  The American public remains largely uninformed on and unprepared for \npossible disasters and other life-threatening emergencies in their \ncommunities. Since government agencies and disaster organizations \ncannot bear sole responsibility for preparing and responding to \ndisasters, it is important for all to plan ahead.\n  National Preparedness Month is a nationwide effort led by the \nAmerican Red Cross to raise awareness about the importance of planning \nfor all types of emergencies. Held each September, National \nPreparedness Month aims to encourage American households to learn more \nabout preparedness and to create a family disaster plan.\n  It is my hope that by proclaiming September 2012 as Alaska \nPreparedness Month, Alaskans will be inspired to make sure they are \nwell-equipped to deal with any and all possible crises in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6441-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6441-S6442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING ALBERT ADAMS\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, on August 13, 2012, Senator Al \nAdams passed away peacefully at home in Anchorage, AK, surrounded by \nfamily.\n  Albert P. Sikiagruk Adams was born June 18, 1942, in Kotzebue, AK. He \nattended Mt. Edgecumbe High School in Sitka. Following high school, he \nattended the University of Alaska Fairbanks and RCA Technical \nInstitute.\n  Al Adams is survived by his wife, Diane; his children Al ``Sonny'' \nAdams, Guy Adams, Herb Adams, Michelle Merculieff, Thomas Adams, and \nLuke Adams. He is survived by his sisters Adra Distefano, Sarah \nScanlan, and\n\n[[Page S6442]]\n\nDarlene ``Red'' Seeberger, their families, and his brothers-in-law John \nand Thomas Simonson, Mike Scanlan, and Don Distefano and sister-in-law \nPeggy Simonson. He also leaves his beloved grandchildren and extended \nfamily members.\n  Al lived a life of service and was known for a generosity of spirit \nand a drive to help others in both his public and private life.\n  To his family, he was a beloved husband, father, and grandfather for \nwhom family was the highest priority. He often organized subsistence \nhunting and fishing trips for his children, where he passed down \ntraditional Inupiat skills. He coordinated all the logistics for these \nmemorable outings and even served as camp cook, making sure everyone \nwas well fed. Whether dipnetting at the mouth of the Kenai River, \ncaribou hunting outside of Kotzebue, or visiting the fish wheel at \nChitina, he let his wife, children, and grandchildren know they were \nloved and they came first and foremost in his life.\n  He was also a romantic and loving husband, planning vacations for his \nwife, Diane, to celebrate and share the milestones they achieved \ntogether as a couple. Travel was one of his favorite pastimes and one \nhe loved to share with her.\n  Although he led a very public life, he also was a man of many unsung \ngood deeds on a personal level. Many people did not know he kept cash \nin his vehicle console to give those in need, or that he provided meals \nto those who were hungry. At Christmas, boxes of turkeys would arrive \nat Bean's Cafe and money for holiday goody bags would arrive at the \nFriends Church. The individual recipients never knew who had lent them \na hand.\n  Even when Al was ill, he cared for others and tried to ease their \nworries with humor. He wanted others to be comfortable and to enjoy \nlife. He put people first and was always prepared to serve them. He \nbelieved in God, in a higher power, and was a teacher and mentor to \nmany.\n  Publically, Al's service to his beloved State improved the lives of \nthose he represented in rural Alaska. His long career in public service \nbegan in the late 1960s and included 8 years in the Alaska State House \nbeginning in 1980, during which he represented District 37 which \nincluded the communities of the NANA/Maniilaq and Arctic Slope regions. \nFrom 1988-2000, he served in the Alaska State Senate, also representing \nthe Bering Straits/Kawerak region.\n  Following his retirement from the Alaska State Legislature, Al served \nas president of Adams Management Services and worked for the Northwest \nArctic Borough and North Slope Borough as an adviser sharing his \nunderstanding of State government and how it could help the people of \nrural Alaska.\n  In 2003, he began a new career as a lobbyist with a focus on \nrepresenting rural and Alaska Native interests. He again provided a \npowerful voice in Juneau and Washington, DC, drawing on his years of \nState legislative experience. He brought the same passion to lobbying \nthat he had as a legislator, always saying those he represented weren't \nhis clients, they were his people. He tirelessly promoted the continued \nsuccesses of Mt. Edgecumbe High School because of the valuable \nopportunities it provides to develop relationships among talented young \nAlaska Native people.\n  Al's hospitality to his peers, staff, clients and visitors at the \nState capitol is still remembered to this day. His door and telephone \nlines were always open to Alaskans, no matter where they lived. He \nworked hard to guarantee rural Alaska gained its fair share of State \nfunding and he joined his colleagues on statewide efforts that \nbenefitted all Alaskans.\n  An astute lawmaker, he was a master at understanding politics and \nState finances and chaired the powerful House Finance Committee during \nhis 8-year term in the State House. He served 18 years on the \nLegislative Budget and Audit Committee and 12 years on the Operating \nBudget Conference Committee. He served on other key committees that \nhelped protect subsistence and bring needed infrastructure and social \nservices to rural Alaska.\n  He fought hard for the establishment and continued existence of the \nPower Coast Equalization (PCE) program; convincing the Alaska \nLegislature to establish an endowment to fund PCE in perpetuity.\n  Prior to his legislative service, he held other positions as \npresident of Kikiktagruk inupiat Corporation. He also served on \nnumerous boards including the Alaska Airlines Advisory Board, Arctic \nPower, Mt. Edgecumbe and NANA Regional Corporation.\n  When I was elected mayor of Anchorage, AK, Al met with me and \nreminded me Anchorage is Alaska's largest Native community. When I was \nelected Senator, he continued to advise me on how together we could \nhelp all Alaskans.\n  The people of Alaska will miss Senator Al Adams. He was a friend, a \nmentor, a humanitarian and an example for many generations of leaders. \nI will miss Al for not only his guidance on doing what's right for all \nof the people of Alaska but for his wit and his friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6442-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PETALUMA ALL-STAR TEAM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to congratulate the \n2012 Petaluma National Little League All-Star team for capturing third \nplace at the 66th Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA. The \ndetermination, sportsmanship and love of the game that these young \nathletes exhibited captured the imagination and support of people in \nPetaluma and throughout California.\n  Since its establishment with three teams in 1939, Little League \nBaseball has grown to become the world's largest youth sports program, \nenabling millions of children from 80 countries in 6 continents to \nenjoy and compete in the American pastime. This year the Little League \nWorld Series featured eight regional representatives from the United \nStates and eight international teams.\n  The Petaluma National All-Star team qualified for the Little League \nWorld Series by winning the District 35 Tournament in Petaluma, the \nSection I Tournament in Fairfield, the NorCal Division II Tournament in \nFremont and the Western Regional Tournament in San Bernardino.\n  At the Little League World Series, the Petaluma All-Stars achieved \nseveral impressive and memorable feats. In the U.S. Championship game, \nthe Petaluma All-Stars staged one of the biggest and most thrilling \nrallies in Little League World Series history when they plated 10 runs \nin the bottom of the sixth to force their game against the team from \nGoodlettsville, TN into extra innings. Although their valiant effort \nwould ultimately fall short, the remarkable determination and \ncompetitiveness exhibited by these young athletes will forever be a \npart of the lore of the Little League World Series. The next day, the \nPetaluma team showed its resilience by defeating the team from \nAguadulce, Panama to place third worldwide behind the eventual Little \nLeague World Series championship team from Tokyo, Japan and the U.S. \nChampionship team from Goodlettsville, TN.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and the Petaluma community in \nrecognizing all the members of the Petaluma National Little League All-\nStar team on this wonderful achievement: Kempton Brandis, Blake Buhrer, \nLogan Douglas, Quinton Gago, Daniel Marzo, Dylan Moore, James O'Hanlon, \nAustin Paretti, Porter Slate, Hance Smith, Bradley Smith, Cole Tomei, \nAndrew White and a team of dedicated coaches, parents and \nvolunteers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6442-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6442-S6443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DEATH OF SACAGAWEA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I wish to speak \ntoday to commemorate the life of Sacagawea and the impacts her life has \nhad on the development of our great Nation. While there is some \ncontroversy regarding the death of Sacagawea, most research indicates \nthat this year marks the 200th anniversary of her reported death in \npresent day South Dakota.\n  Sacagawea is historically most famous for guiding Captains Meriwether \nLewis and William Clark, along with her husband and infant son, on U.S. \nPresident Thomas Jefferson's Corps of Northwestern Discovery expedition \nto the Pacific Coast and back from 1804 to 1806.\n  Sacagawea, the daughter of a Shoshone chief, was born around 1788 in \npresent-day Idaho. At a young age, she was captured by the enemies of \nthe\n\n[[Page S6443]]\n\nShoshones, the Hidatsa, and sold to a French-Canadian trapper named \nToussaint Charbonneau. Charbonneau married Sacagawea and the two lived \namong the Mandan and Hidatsa tribes of the upper Missouri river in \npresent-day North Dakota. When Lewis and Clark came to the area on \ntheir journey in November of 1804, they commissioned Charbonneau and \nSacagawea, who was with child, to serve as interpreters. With the help \nand knowledge of Sacagawea, the Lewis and Clark expedition reached the \nPacific Ocean in November of 1805.\n  It was reported that Sacagawea died on December 20, 1812, at Fort \nManuel Lisa, which overlooked the Missouri River near the present-day \ncity of Kenel, in Corson County, SD. John Luttig, the trading post's \nclerk, wrote: ``This evening the wife of Charbonneau, a Snake Woman, \ndied of a putrid fever. Aged about 25 years. She left an infant girl.''\n  Though Sacagawea had a short and difficult life, her legacy still \nlives on. The celebration of her life also gives us a great opportunity \nto recognize the rich culture and heritage of our Native American \ntribes. As we bear in mind her life, death, and impact, I encourage \neveryone to join in also commemorating the unique culture of the \nindigenous peoples of the United States.\n  Later this month, the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation will \nbe holding their regional meeting in Fort Pierre, SD. The South Dakota \nChapter of the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation, Encounters on \nthe Prairie, will be hosting this regional meeting which will be \ncommemorating the 200th anniversary of Sacagawea's reported death. I am \nproud to speak about the rich piece of our Nation's history she was a \npart of. Her memory and the heritage in which she embodies, continues \nto inspire us in South Dakota and across the Nation.\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 200th \nAnniversary of the reported death of Sacagawea within the borders of \nwhat is now South Dakota. At this time I would like to commemorate her \nfor her contributions to the Lewis and Clark Expedition.\n  Sacagawea accompanied Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on the \nNorthwestern Discovery Expedition to the Pacific Coast for the U.S. \nPresident Thomas Jefferson's Corps. In recognition of her service and \nbravery, the Central South Dakota Chapter of the Lewis and Clark Trail \nHeritage Foundation, known as Keepers of the Story, Stewards of the \nTrail, are hosting a regional meeting September 28, 29, and 30, 2012. \nThe meeting will be open to the public in the cities of Fort Pierre, \nPierre, Mobridge, and Kenel, SD. To help commemorate the bicentennial \nof the reported death of Sacagawea, the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage \nFoundation will travel to Fort Manuel Lisa.\n  The story of Sacagawea, while short, is one of great success and \nworthy of remembrance. Her guidance and interpretation were vital to \nLewis and Clark's journey. I hope my fellow colleagues will help me \ncommemorate the 200th anniversary of the reported death of Sacagawea by \nrecognizing her sacrifice and efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6443-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL CITY, CALIFORNIA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I take this opportunity to \nrecognize and celebrate the 125th anniversary of National City, located \nin San Diego County, CA.\n  National City was founded in 1868 and incorporated on September 17, \n1887, making it the second oldest city in San Diego County. The land on \nwhich it stands had earlier been an Indian rancheria, home of Apusquele \nband of the Hamacha tribe. In 1769 it had become one of the ranches \nused by the Mission San Diego de Alcala, and the padres called it La \nPurisima Concepcion.\n  In the late 19th century, National City pioneered the shipping and \ntransportation systems for San Diego, constructing the area's first \nwharf and introducing the first transcontinental railroad terminus; the \nNational City Depot, built in 1882, is the last one standing out of the \noriginal five transcontinental terminus railroad stations and is \ndesignated as a California historical landmark. Another local cultural \ntreasure ``Brick Row,'' built in 1887 is the only Philadelphia-style \nrow housing in the southwestern United States and is listed in the \nNational Register of Historic Places.\n  Today, National City's 3-mile-long port along San Diego Bay is part \nof Naval Base San Diego, the largest U.S. Navy base on the west coast. \nIn addition to its leading role as a naval gateway, National City is \nconsidered a symbolic link between San Diego and Mexico.\n  On September 22, residents of National City will gather for a \ncitywide 125th anniversary picnic at Kimball Park. I congratulate the \npeople of National City on this special occasion and salute their rich \nhistory and wonderful community spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6443-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING JOE GARLAND\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last summer Massachusetts lost a \ngentleman, the fishing industry lost an icon and I lost a friend. For \nyears Joe Garland served as the unofficial historian of Gloucester, \nMA--its fishermen, its boats and its life. If you visit the Fisherman's \nMemorial on Gloucester's waterfront on a stormy winter day, the statue \nof the Heroic Mariner seems to be steering the whole town into the wind \ntoward fair weather. And if you look closely at the statue, you can \nalmost see Joe Garland in its carved granite face, full of grit and \ndetermination, guiding his beloved Gloucester through headwinds and \ntroubled waters.\n  He's been gone for more than a year now, but his memory lives on \nthrough his loving wife Helen, his family, his friends and through the \ncontinuing legacy of the schooner Adventure.\n  In my Boston office, I have a copy of his book about the Adventure, \nwhich he helped to restore. When I received it many years ago, it \narrived with an invitation from Joe to tour the schooner and, of \ncourse, I didn't waste any time accepting his invitation. He welcomed \nme aboard, and his tour made the Adventure's history come alive--from \nits construction in 1926 through its career as a ``highliner,'' the \nbiggest moneymaker of them all, landing nearly $4 million worth of cod \nand halibut during her career.\n  As Joe himself once wrote, ``The Adventure is a survivor, not a \nvision. She is here, real and beautiful . . . I can stand on those \ndecks with the whole-sail breeze, arms hooked into the rigging, and \nwatch her go, watch the miles bubble out from under the stern as they \nhave done now for more than fifty [now nearing 100] years. She is \nfantastic!''\n  As we celebrate the historic restoration of the Adventure, and \ncelebrate Joe's incredible life, I know that he is smiling down on us \ntoday, on what would have been his 90th birthday. Mr. President, the \nworld weathers so many storms, but at the center of each we find people \nof character who revive our hope and give us strength. Joe Garland was \nsuch a man, and we are all blessed to have had his strength and his \ncharacter as an example, and we are equally blessed that he left us \nwith such a marvelous schooner, the Adventure, as an enduring reminder \nof his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6443-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6443-S6444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DAVID WOOD\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ncareer of David Wood, the founding Executive Director of Affordable \nHousing, Education and Development (AHEAD), Inc. in Littleton, New \nHampshire. After over 20 years of hard work to make affordable housing \nand home ownership a reality for hundreds of NH families, David will \nstep down from his position at the end of this year. I would like to \ntake this opportunity to thank him for his remarkable commitment to \nhelping those in need.\n  Since 1991, AHEAD has provided safe and affordable rental housing, \nfamily support, and financial education to thousands of people living \nin rural northern New Hampshire. Under David's direction, the \norganization now owns and operates 304 units of affordable multifamily \nrental housing in nine communities in our State. Furthermore, AHEAD has \nassisted more than 600 families buying their first homes and helped \nrescue another 250 households facing foreclosures.\n  AHEAD has received numerous awards over the last 20 years in \nrecognition of the positive impact that David and his staff have \nbrought to our\n\n[[Page S6444]]\n\nNorth Country. These accolades include the USDA Rural Development New \nHampshire Partner of the Year in 2002, the Federal Home Loan Bank-\nBoston Partner of the Year, and the Citizens Bank Champion in Action in \n2005.\n  In addition to his full-time responsibilities at AHEAD, David has \nserved on the Board of the New Hampshire Community Development Finance \nAuthority for 20 years, spending four of them as its chair. He has been \nan active member of the National Neighbor Works Association and spent 6 \nyears on the Advisory Council for the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. \nDavid has also been a crucial voice in Housing Action New Hampshire's \nadvocacy efforts to promote affordable housing across our State.\n  These impressive accomplishments demonstrate David's dedication to \nimproving the lives of families in Coos and northern Grafton Counties. \nI am sure that David will modestly attribute this success to his \ntalented and dedicated team of staff and supporters, but it was his \nvision for community development that led to the founding of AHEAD. His \nbelief in stable families as the foundation of a vibrant community \nresulted in projects like the McKee Inn in Lancaster and Littleton Town \n& Country Family Housing. Because of his commitment to this cause, \nhundreds of families in New Hampshire now have access to safe, warm, \nand affordable homes.\n  Put simply, Mr. President, David has made New Hampshire a better \nplace to live and raise a family. I know that the great energy and \nspirit with which he has led AHEAD for the past 20 years will endure at \nthis enormously successful non-profit organization. I congratulate \nDavid on all his achievements and wish him the best in his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6444-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the \naccomplishments of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts (BCBSMA), a \ncompany that has provided affordable health insurance options for \nfamilies in the Commonwealth for the past 75 years.\n  As our Nation's health care system has evolved, BCBSMA has remained a \nleader in the industry by focusing on the principles of service, \nleadership, and innovation. In fact, it was the first organization of \nits kind to offer statewide insurance coverage for hospitalization--\nproviding all working families a financially realistic option so they \ncould afford a hospital stay when it was needed. And decades later, \nBCBSMA was instrumental in helping to create several of the State's \nbest-known health maintenance organizations (HMOs).\n  BCBSMA has been actively working to improve the health of their \nmembers through an innovative benefit design that focuses on prevention \nand customized wellness programs, encourages community-based care, and \nimproves care coordination.\n  Additionally, they have been national leaders in payment reform by \ndesigning an innovative model that has demonstrated the ability to \nimprove the quality of patient care while simultaneously slowing the \ngrowth of health care spending. In 2008, BCBSMA created a new payment \nsystem called the Alternative Quality Contract (AQC). This model \nrewards physicians and hospitals for the quality and outcomes of the \ncare they provide to patients. Providers receive a global budget for \ntheir patients and are responsible for any excessive spending and are \nrewarded for quality. This combination of the global budget and pay-\nfor-performance incentives establishes provider accountability for both \nthe quality and cost of care.\n  BCBSMA isn't just committed to its members; they are leaders in the \ncommunity with a distinct focus on corporate citizenship and civic \nengagement. They spend countless hours working within the community to \nmake a measurable and sustainable impact on issues such as child \ndevelopment, healthy environments, and family nutrition. During the \nlast year, BCBSMA associates volunteered to perform more than 26,000 \nhours of community service throughout Massachusetts. In their tradition \nof supporting the work of not-for-profit organizations, BCBSMA is \ncommemorating their 75th anniversary by providing grants to community \nstakeholders working to advance the health and nutrition of families \nfacing economic hardship.\n  BCBSMA founded the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation \nin 2001, one of the largest health-focused private philanthropies in \nNew England, to expand access to health care. The Foundation played an \nimportant role in the passage of Massachusetts health reform in 2006 by \nproviding reliable data and objective analysis to policy-makers and \nconvening stakeholders for sessions of public debate. Massachusetts now \nhas the best health care coverage rate in the Nation with 98.1 percent \nof residents having health insurance, including 99.8 percent of all \nchildren.\n  Not only did BCBSMA work to expand health care coverage in the \nCommonwealth, they were a leader in the national effort to expand \nhealth care coverage to all Americans. BCBSMA was the only health plan \nin the Nation to file an amicus, or ``friend of the court'', brief in \nsupport of the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act when it was \nconsidered by the Supreme Court earlier this year. They believed the \nhealth reform law was critical to ensure that all Americans have the \nsame health care benefits and protections that Massachusetts residents \nhave known for years.\n  As we continue to implement the Affordable Care Act, I am confident \nthat BCBSMA will be there every step of the way. They are rated among \nthe nation's best health plans for member satisfaction and quality and \ntheir commitment to both exceptional and affordable health care is \nclearly evident to their nearly three million members in Massachusetts.\n  I congratulate Andrew Dreyfus, President and Chief Executive Officer, \nand all the employees at BCBSMA who work together to advance the \navailability of quality health care on this remarkable milestone. I \nlook forward to the innovation and leadership you will deliver over the \nnext 75 years for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6444-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6444-S6445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE LOWELL MILKEN CENTER\n\n Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I wish to commemorate the \nLowell Milken Center's 2012 National Projects Kick-off. Located in Fort \nScott, KS, the Lowell Milken Center discovers, develops, and \ncommunicates the stories of unsung heroes who have made a profound and \npositive difference on the course of history. The Lowell Milken Center \nwas opened in 2007 as an international nonprofit organization focused \non creating a better future by developing projects that teach respect \nand understanding. This approach has been built upon student-driven, \nproject-based learning so that Americans and people around the world \nmay learn that each of us has the responsibility and the power to take \nactions to improve the lives of others.\n  During its 6 years of operation, the center has hosted over 15,000 \nvisitors and reached over 550,000 students in 5,000 schools by telling \ninspiring stories of unsung heroes to influence change in behaviors and \nattitudes. In May, I had the pleasure of visiting the Lowell Milken \nCenter. During my visit, I was able to meet the center's visionary and \nfounder Norm Conard and its program director Megan Felt. Both are \noutstanding Kansans who have helped shape the way we approach history \nand learning. Ms. Felt has been honored nationally and internationally \nfor her projects with students, and she is the founder of the \ninternationally acclaimed work, ``Life in a Jar: The Irena Sendler \nProject.''\n  Irena Sendler was a devout Catholic who helped save the lives of \n2,500 children during the Holocaust in Poland. She smuggled children \nout of a Warsaw ghetto and placed them with families not threatened by \nthe Nazis. Toward the end of the war, she was arrested, severely \nbeaten, and almost died for her actions to save these children.\n  In 1999, three high school students from Uniontown, KS, uncovered the \nremarkable story of Irena Sendler after Uniontown High School teacher \nNorm Conard tasked his students to compete in a National History Day \ncontest. The students investigated an article published in 1994 \nmentioning Sendler and uncovered a heroic story that had gone virtually \nunreported. The students eventually met their hero and began exchanging \nletters.\n\n[[Page S6445]]\n\n  This relationship inspired the students to write a play about \nSendler's life and work. ``Life in a Jar: The Irena Sendler Project'' \ncontinues to be performed in Uniontown, KS, and has been preformed \nacross the U.S. and in Europe. Fortunately, this project brought \nSendler much overdue national attention in Poland, and in 2007 Sendler \nwas nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. In 2008, Irena Sendler passed \naway at age 98.\n  The Lowell Milken Center continues to pursue those often missed in \nhistory books and to promote cross-cultural understanding in the world. \nIt is an honor to represent the Lowell Milken Center in the United \nStates Senate, and I commend their efforts to promote the unsung heroes \nwho changed the world through the 2012 National Projects Kick-\noff.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6445-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO KRISTEN McGONIGLE\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor a \nremarkable citizen, Kristen McGonigle of Concord, NH. On June 9, 2012, \nKristen saved the life of a fellow runner during a local road race.\n  Every June, Portsmouth, NH hosts a 10K road race in conjunction with \nMarket Square Day, an annual celebration honoring the renovation of one \nof the historic city's vibrant downtown areas. Kristen was \nparticipating in the race when she noticed another runner, Steve \nWhitney, showing signs of a significant heart attack.\n  As a cardiac care nurse at Concord Hospital with more than 16 years \nof experience, Kristen immediately recognized Steve's symptoms and took \nswift action to save his life. Kristen possessed the skills necessary \nto keep Steve alive until paramedics arrived. In fact, Kristen \ncontinued to perform chest compressions even after the arrival of \nemergency medical technicians. Her quick action ensured that Steve \nsafely reached the qualified health care providers at Portsmouth \nRegional Hospital.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart \ndisease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Sadly, \nnearly every American knows an individual impacted by heart disease, \nand all too many people suffer a catastrophic cardiac event similar to \nthe one Steve Whitney experienced.\n  Nursing professionals dedicate their working lives to caring for \nthose in need, providing the comforts and necessities required for \ntheir patients to regain strength and recover good health. The frequent \nacts of heroism performed by these men and women often go unnoticed, \nbut it is impossible to overvalue the work they perform. The daily \nefforts of nurses for the betterment of others serve as an invaluable \nbridge to care between doctor and patient.\n  I applaud and thank Kristen for her devotion to those in need. She \nhas spent her career helping others while also caring for her family, \nincluding her husband Kirk and her two children, Camden and Ally. Her \nexemplary behavior gives her family, her workplace, her community, and \nthe State of New Hampshire great pride.\n  I wish to thank Kristen McGonigle for her service and her actions on \nJune 9, 2012, and commend her kindness, compassion, and dedication to \nher field and her fellow citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6445-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING YALE CORDAGE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, it is no secret that my home State \nof Maine boasts an expansive coastline, unmatched in beauty. With its \nnumerous bays and inlets, this coastline provides endless opportunities \nfor the many industries that have come to be known as quintessentially \nMaine, including commercial fishing, shipbuilding, and pleasure \nboating. One excellent example is Yale Cordage of Saco, ME, a small \nbusiness dedicated to manufacturing quality products used by industries \nthroughout Maine and the world.\n  Founded in 1950 by O. Sherman Yale, Yale Cordage introduced synthetic \nfiber to the commercial fishing industry when it began manufacturing \nropes. For 20 years its focus remained on commercial fishing; however, \nit expanded its product line to provide ropes for the pleasure marine \nmarketplace when Yale's son Tom, an avid sailor, joined the company. \nFrom there, Yale Cordage began building its reputation as a leader in \nthe pleasure marine industry by introducing technologically innovative \nproducts and, through Tom's leadership as President of the Cordage \nInstitute, influencing industry standards. Moreover, in 1983 Australia \nII won the America's Cup for yacht sailing using all Yale Cordage \nrigging. But Yale Cordage's desire to seek new markets did not stop \nthere.\n  Recognizing certain limitations of the pleasure marine market, Yale \nCordage sought new ways to use its products in different industries. \nNow, Yale Cordage's products are not only found on boats but throughout \nthe world and in a variety of capacities. For example, Central Maine \nPower uses Yale Cordage's products to string new power lines while Bath \nIron Works uses them in the destroyer class of naval warships. You can \nfind Yale Cordage products in the ocean for use with offshore oil rigs, \nbeneath the Earth's surface in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, in the \nsky on the Hood Blimp, at the tops of trees with arborist climbers, and \nrecently at Niagara Falls when Yale Cordage rope was used in the \nhoisting and securing process for the world's first tightrope walk \ndirectly over the falls. The National Data Buoy Center trusts Yale \nCordage products to moor weather buoys critical in the tracking of \nstorms, including the recent hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. Even our \narmed services have taken advantage of Yale Cordage's quality products: \nthe U.S. Army uses Yale Cordage ropes to remove tanks from ditches in \nAfghanistan, and the Navy SEALs use it when rappelling from \nhelicopters.\n  Through hard work, ingenuity, and determination, Yale Cordage has \nevolved from a commercial fishing rope supplier to a $20 million \ncompany that manufactures rope for a wide range of industries. It now \noperates a state-of-the-art facility, and provides jobs for 75 people \nin my home State. Yale Cordage is a shining example of the \nentrepreneurial spirit of Maine. I am proud to commend everyone at Yale \nCordage on their success and offer my best wishes for the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6445-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PETER J. FOS\n\n Mr.VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Dr. Peter \nJ. Fos. In January, Dr. Fos was named the sixth leader and first \npresident of the University of New Orleans. A New Orleans native and \ngraduate of UNO, Dr. Fos received his degree in biological sciences and \na doctor of dental surgery from LSU Health Sciences Center. He also \nearned his masters of public health and doctor of philosophy in health \ncare decision analysis from Tulane University.\n  Prior to being selected as president, Dr. Fos served as a professor \nand program director of health policy and systems management at LSU \nHealth Sciences Center where he oversaw curriculum development and \nassessment and student and faculty professional development.\n  He also served as provost and executive vice president for 3 years at \nthe University of Texas at Tyler and spent 4 years as dean of the \nCollege of Health at the University of Southern Mississippi. Dr. Fos \nhas also held positions at the Mississippi State Department of Health, \nthe University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of Dental Medicine, Tulane \nUniversity School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, and Tulane \nUniversity Department of Health Systems Management.\n  In addition to increasing enrollment under new admissions standards, \nDr. Fos also has both short and long-term goals which include improving \ncommunication both on and off campus and reconnecting UNO to the local \nbusiness community.\n  At a time when Louisiana's higher education system is being asked to \ndo more with less, it is important that those tasked with guiding our \nuniversities into the future do so in ways that will not compromise the \neducational value provided to Louisiana's students. With his long \ncareer educating our youth, I am pleased for Dr. Fos that he has been \nselected to lead UNO, and I congratulate him on this great \nhonor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6445-4", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6445-S6446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n[[Page S6446]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6446-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6446-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on September 14, 2012, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the House has passed the following \nbills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 3245.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an issue \nthat is extremely important to people in Rhode Island and across the \nUnited States: protecting consumers and securing the integrity of \nMedicare by preventing waste and fraud. Individuals who commit Medicare \nfraud are not simply stealing from the government, they are stealing \nfrom the men and women who have paid into the system their whole lives, \nthey are stealing from our Nation's seniors, and they are stealing from \nthe taxpayers. We have an obligation to ensure that Medicare dollars \nare spent keeping seniors healthy, and not lining the pockets of \npredatory opportunists.\n  In March, I held a hearing in Rhode Island on efforts at the Federal, \nState, and local levels to identify and reduce fraud in Medicare and \nMedicaid. I heard testimony from a representative of the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, as well as State and Federal law \nenforcement officials, including Rhode Island's Attorney General, Peter \nKilmartin; and the U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island, Peter Neronha. They \ndiscussed a number of the efforts underway to identify potentially \nfraudulent claims, recover improper payments, and use state-of-the-art \nanalytic software to identify and prevent improper payments.\n  I was pleased to hear about the steps being taken to modernize \nMedicare's anti-fraud efforts, but there is still much that can be \ndone. In particular, I believe we must crack down on deceptive and \nfraudulent telemarketing and email schemes that force unwanted and \nunnecessary medical equipment onto unsuspecting seniors. I have heard \nfrom Rhode Islanders concerned about these ``too-good-to-be-true'' \noffers. During my March hearing, I heard testimony about Medicare \nbeneficiaries receiving unsolicited phone calls from a company called \nPlanned Eldercare, which promised to provide them with free medical \nproducts. If a senior agreed to the offer, Planned Eldercare would \nsubmit as many claims as it could to Medicare on that beneficiary's \nbehalf, even if the products for which they were submitting claims were \nnot medically necessary or even requested by the senior. This scheme \ndefrauded Medicare out of more than $2.2 million.\n  These schemes prey on older Americans and rob Medicare of millions of \ndollars that would otherwise be used to improve the health and well-\nbeing of seniors. We must do more to prevent fraud of this kind, which \nis why I am joining with my colleague, Senator Blumenthal, in \nintroducing the Telemarketing Fraud Modernization Act. This bill would \nclose loopholes in the existing telemarketing fraud statute and update \nthe law to include Medicare, Medicaid, and health care fraud, as well \nas schemes to fraudulently induce investments--like Ponzi schemes. It \nwould also expand existing law to apply to schemes perpetrated via \nemail, instant messages, and other forms of electronic communication. \nUpdating the telemarketing fraud statute will give law enforcement \nagencies the tools they need to rein in scam artists, protect our \nNation's seniors, and strengthen the integrity of the Medicare program.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle on this important issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRANKEN (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mr. Begich, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Blumenthal, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 3557. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to prohibit \ninstitutions of higher education that participate in programs under \ntitle IV of such Act from including predispute arbitration agreements \nin enrollment contracts; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a bill I have \njust introduced, the Arbitration Fairness for Students Act, and to talk \nabout why it is so important to protect our Nation's students.\n  Access to higher education is becoming increasingly important in our \nNation. In 2018, 70 percent of the jobs in\n\n[[Page S6459]]\n\nour State, Minnesota, will require some postsecondary education. We \nmust also make sure access to higher education remains and stays a \npositive experience and not a damaging one. Colleges and universities \nneed to deliver on the promises they make to students. If they don't, \nstudents need to be able to hold them accountable.\n  That is why I have introduced this bill today along with Senator \nHarkin and six cosponsors, including Senator Sanders. It would prohibit \nany school participating in the title IV Federal student aid system \nfrom forcing its students to forego access to the courts when they have \na valid dispute and instead forcing them into private arbitration \nproceedings. This bill is simply about accountability. It is about the \nbasic American right to seek justice in our court system--a right that \nis, unfortunately, being denied now to thousands of students after the \nlandmark Supreme Court decision in the AT Mobility v. Concepcion \ncase.\n  A recent report from Public Citizen and the National Association of \nConsumer Advocates highlights how that decision is harming students. \nBefore that decision, thousands of students who had attended a chain of \nculinary schools formed a class action lawsuit alleging that the school \nhad exaggerated the salaries of its graduates, and they won. The \nstudents received payments of up to $20,000 each, which they \ndesperately needed since, according to the lawsuits, these students \ntypically had more than $40,000 in student loan debt.\n  But that was before the Concepcion decision, which now allows \ncorporations to block class action lawsuits through the use of \nmandatory arbitration clauses in their contracts. Now, a group of \nstudents who can prove they were lied to by their college can be barred \nfrom accessing our court system. I think that is wrong, and my bill \nwould change that.\n  But don't just take it from me. Take it from judges who are ruling in \nthe post-Concepcion world and who believe that students are being hurt. \nIn one recent case students alleged that a school misrepresented basic \nfacts, such as the cost of education and the school's accreditation \nstatus. The students even showed they had to sign the enrollment \ncontract, which contained the mandatory arbitration clause, before they \nwere allowed to speak to financial aid counselors.\n  The court ruled against the students, citing the Concepcion decision. \nAccording to the court:\n\n       The argument had considerable validity and the court would \n     likely have found the Arbitration Agreements at issue here \n     unconscionable . . . if it were issuing this decision pre-\n     Concepcion.\n\n  The court also said that Concepcion ``likely foreclosed the \npossibility of any recovery for many wronged individuals.''\n  As I said, this bill is about accountability. It is also about \ncollege affordability. Our higher education system often requires \nstudents to take on tens of thousands of dollars in debt. In exchange \nfor this debt, students believe they are receiving an education that \nwill allow them to pay that money back, often because that is exactly \nwhat the school is telling them. But what if the school is lying? \nStudents need to be able to hold those schools accountable for their \nactions. Otherwise, what is going to stop other schools from charging \nwhatever they want and convincing their students they can afford it by \nlying? We can stop these anticonsumer, antistudent contracts, and my \nbill would do just that.\n  Congress has acted several times to protect individual industries \nfrom abuse of mandatory arbitration clauses. In 2001, Congress heard \nfrom William Shack, a long-time automobile dealer from Nevada. He told \nhis story to Congress about how he and a partner had been working \ntogether to open a Saturn dealership, investing a lot of money, when \nSaturn suddenly pulled the deal.\n  As a result of the arbitration clause in their contract, Mr. Shack \nand his partner were required to arbitrate the dispute. In his \ntestimony, he said Federal legislation was the only remedy available to \nprotect auto dealers from the imposition of these unfair contract \nprovisions and to preserve State procedural and substantive \nprotections. He explained:\n\n       We reject categorically the idea that we ``voluntarily'' \n     agreed to submit to mandatory binding arbitration.\n\n  The most compelling portion of Mr. Shack's testimony was this:\n\n       [T]he dispute drove home to us in a drastic fashion just \n     how one-sided the mandatory binding arbitration process can \n     be for dealers. We were surprised to learn that, despite the \n     great system of justice that we have in this country, we \n     could be deprived of the basic right to an impartial decision \n     on the merits of our case. That is a grave injustice.\n\n  In response to stories like Mr. Shack's, Senator Orrin Hatch \nintroduced the Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness \nAct. The bill had 66 cosponsors--an equal number of Democrats and \nRepublicans. Unsurprisingly, there was opposition to this legislation--\nthe Chamber of Commerce testified against it. But Congress decided to \nprioritize the rights of auto dealers to seek justice in our courts, \nand in November of 2002, Congress passed this bill and made it law.\n  Today automobile dealers cannot be bound by mandatory arbitration \nprovisions in their contracts with their manufacturers. This change \ndidn't result in a flood of litigation. It simply provided some equal \nfooting for small auto dealerships to bargain with the large \nmanufacturers. Once Congress determined that this particular industry \nwas subject to the abuse, it took action to protect the vulnerable \nparty.\n  Congress again acted in 2007 to protect members of our Armed \nServices. Congress heard from military leaders that predatory lending \ntargeted at our Nation's servicemembers was impairing our country's \nmilitary readiness. In response, Republican Senator Jim Talent from \nMissouri, along with his colleague Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, a \nDemocrat, introduced an amendment to the 2006 national defense \nauthorization bill. Their provision prohibited predatory lending \npractices, including a prohibition on enforcing mandatory arbitration \nclauses in financial agreements with servicemembers. This amendment \npassed the Senate unanimously, and it went into effect in 2007.\n  Despite strong opposition from the Wall Street lobby, Congress came \ntogether in a bipartisan manner to target abuses against our \nservicemembers.\n  In addition to auto dealers and servicemembers, Congress has also \ntaken up the plight of poultry growers. In a 2007 hearing in the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, one witness shared this terrible story. Gertrude \nOverstreet was a 67-year-old contract poultry farmer. She operated two \nchicken houses, so her total monthly income, including food stamps, was \nless than $1,000 a month for her and her husband. Mrs. Overstreet had a \n10th grade education.\n  When the poultry producer for whom she worked violated the terms of \ntheir agreement, that company required Mrs. Overstreet to bring her \nclaim into arbitration, where she was required to pay $27,000 in \nupfront costs before she could even get a hearing. Mrs. Overstreet \ndidn't know what arbitration was or that her legal remedies had been \nstripped from her. This is an elderly couple who could not afford the \ncost of their medication, much less $20,000 in upfront arbitration \nfees.\n  This might be the most compelling example of disparate bargaining \npower, a giant poultry processor versus Mrs. Overstreet. But Senator \nGrassley took up this cause and introduced the Fair Contracts for \nGrowers Act. Thanks to his efforts, when the farm bill passed the \nfollowing year, it included provisions that enabled poultry farmers to \nopt out of mandatory arbitration clauses imposed by the big processors.\n  Most recently, Congress took up an amendment that I introduced in the \nnational defense authorization bill in the fall of 2009. Some of the \nmost offensive uses of mandatory arbitration clauses that I have seen \nare by overseas military contractors against women who have been \nvictimized on the job. Too many women working for military contractors \nhave had to endure unimaginable workplace harassment and environments. \nThose women deserve their right to a day in court just like the auto \ndealers, the servicemembers, and the poultry farmers. Once again, the \namendment passed with broad bipartisan support. Once again, Congress \ntook steps to tackle the most egregious abuses of mandatory \narbitration.\n\n[[Page S6460]]\n\n  When confronted with a group that has been victimized by mandatory \narbitration clauses, Congress has repeatedly taken steps to protect the \nlittle guy and their right to a day in court, and we have done so on a \nbipartisan basis. I believe Minnesota's students--and students across \nthe country--deserve the same protection we have afforded to auto \ndealers, to servicemembers, poultry farmers, and employees of military \ncontractors. The Arbitration Fairness for Students Act would provide \nthat protection, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Begich, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Gillibrand, \n        Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 3562. A bill to reauthorize and improve the Other Americans Act of \n1965, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today I am very proud to introduce the \nOlder Americans Act reauthorization of 2012 bill along with 14 of my \ncolleagues, including Senators Blumenthal, Kerry, Mikulski, Begich, \nAkaka, Durbin, Gillibrand, Klobuchar, Leahy, Wyden, Franken, Johnson, \nand Merkley. This bill is the result of an impressive team effort. We \nhave reached out to a number of members on the committee and others who \nhave brought forth ideas of their own, and I am very proud as chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging to have introduced this \nbill. I wish to thank the director of the subcommittee, Ashley Carson \nCottingham, for her work, as well as Sophie Kasimow and Erica Solway.\n  It is disappointing to me that this important piece of legislation \nhas not been dealt with during this session, but on behalf of the \nmillions of elderly people to whom it applies and for whom it will make \nlife better, I am introducing it today because it will lay the \ngroundwork for what we have to do next session.\n  Originally enacted in 1965, the Older Americans Act was the first \nedition by the Federal Government to help senior citizens remain \nindependent in their homes and in their communities. The Older \nAmericans Act has historically received bipartisan support.\n  This act provides Federal funding for some important programs with \nwhich many Americans are familiar. Among others is the Meals on Wheels \nProgram. All over America we have seniors who are frail, who are unable \nto leave their homes, and every single day all over this country there \nare volunteers who are delivering hot, nutritious meals to seniors. I \nwish to thank all of those volunteers and to tell them we are going to \ndo the best we can to increase funding to end some of those waiting \nlines that now exist throughout this country in terms of seniors being \nable to get the Meals on Wheels Program.\n  Another important nutrition program the Older Americans Act deals \nwith is the Congregate Meal Program. Every day in Vermont and I know \nall over this country the elderly come to senior centers, where they \nsocialize and have a good time and are able to break through their \nisolation and also receive nutritious meals. The meals they receive are \nsignificantly funded by the Congregate Meal Program. In my view, they \nare inadequately funded, and we want to increase funding for that \nprogram as well.\n  I would mention that in the State of Vermont alone--just one small \nState--almost 1 million Congregate and Meals on Wheels are served every \nsingle year. That is 1 million meals in a small State such as Vermont.\n  Mr. President, we are in the midst of a terrible recession. \nUnemployment is too high, wages are too low, and many people have lost \ntheir homes. But in the midst of this recession, we do not talk enough \nabout the plight of many elderly people. They are living their lives, \noften in great financial distress, under the radar screen. I think we \nare not paying enough attention to their problems.\n  Today, incredibly enough, one in five seniors over the age of 65 is \nliving on an average income of $7,500 per year, and the number of \nseniors going hungry is rising. Hunger among seniors in the United \nStates today is a serious problem. In fact, there are over 5 million \nseniors who face the threat of hunger and others who are struggling \nevery single day to make sure they have enough food in the refrigerator \nto take care of their most basic needs.\n  The very good news is that the Older Americans Act has developed \nprograms to address these needs. Yet, because we have more seniors who \nare in need of these programs, it is absolutely imperative that we \naddress the problems of hunger and make sure every senior in this \ncountry gets the nutrition he or she needs.\n  This bill we are submitting today with 14 cosponsors will request \nhigher authorization for nutrition programs, for supportive services, \nand for jobs programs. One of the things the Older Americans Act does--\nand not a lot of people know this--is it provides employment \nopportunities for many seniors. This is important because not only does \nit allow hard-pressed seniors to earn additional revenue, but it also \nallows them to go out into the workforce and put meaning into their \nlives, which is extremely important. This legislation also provides for \nchronic disease self-management and the Long-Term Care Ombudsman \nProgram. The bill also strengthens efforts to identify and prevent \nelder abuse--a serious problem in our country--support for family \ncaregivers and care coordination activities, workforce for seniors, and \nincreases protections for seniors living in nursing homes and receiving \nhome care services.\n  Mr. President, we need to see the reauthorization of the Older \nAmericans Act early in the next Congress. With 10,000 baby boomers \nturning 65 each day and middle-class families experiencing rising costs \nfrom education to health care as well as the need to provide care to \ntheir aging relatives, we are at a critical moment in terms of how we \naddress the very serious problems facing senior citizens.\n  The interesting point about the Older Americans Act and about the \nNutrition Program is that while, yes, it is an investment of Federal \ndollars, in the long run it actually saves us money. We had a very \ninteresting hearing on this issue, and we heard from physicians who \ntold us what common sense would suggest. If seniors do not get the \nnutrition they need, if they become malnourished, they are obviously \nmore likely to become ill, end up in an emergency room or in the \nhospital. In addition, when we have senior citizens who are not getting \nthe care and attention they need at home, the nutrition they need, they \nare more likely to suffer serious falls, break hips, and end up in a \nhospital, at great expense.\n  So the bottom line here is not really rocket science. It is that if \nwe make sure seniors throughout the country--those who are vulnerable, \nwho are frail, who do not have a lot of money--get the nutrition and \nthe attention they deserve while at home, they will be healthier and \nless likely to end up in emergency rooms and in hospitals at great \nexpense to our health care system. So investing in the Older Americans \nAct is not only the right thing to do, it is not only the humane thing \nto do in terms of taking care of the most vulnerable and fragile people \nin our society, it also makes good financial sense for our country.\n  Mr. President, I thank very much the 14 cosponsors we have. We are \ngoing to aggressively do our best to make sure this legislation is \npassed either in the lameduck session or when we return next year.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \nremarks of the Senator from Vermont. I am one of the cosponsors of the \nreauthorization of the Older Americans Act, and before I talk about a \nbill I have just introduced, I would like to underscore the fact that \nthe Older Americans Act was introduced in 1965, and it allows seniors \nto stay in their homes and also saves money. It costs $6 a day to do \nMeals on Wheels per senior. This allows a senior to stay in their home \nand not go to a nursing home. We know what a nursing home costs every \nday. So this is an example of common sense. Seniors want to stay in \ntheir homes if they can.\n  I have been with the Presiding Officer, my colleague from the State \nof\n\n[[Page S6461]]\n\nMinnesota, doing roundtables on the Older Americans Act. It is a great \nprogram that we need to reauthorize in order to do really a commonsense \nthing, which is allow seniors to stay where they want to stay--in their \nhomes--and at the same time not have them spending the kind of money \nthey would be spending in a nursing home or in that kind of facility. \nSo I commend the Senator from Vermont.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Klobuchar, \n        Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Murkowski, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Shaheen, and \n        Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 3567. A bill to establish the Commission to Study the Potential \nCreation of a National Women's History Museum, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the National Women's \nHistory Museum Commission Act of 2012, a bill that would create a \ncommission to evaluate and plan into the establishment of a museum that \nwould be dedicated to women's history in our Nation's capital city. I \nappreciate the co-sponsorship of Senator Mikulski, Senator Hutchinson, \nSenator Lieberman, Senator Murray, Senator Akaka, Senator Merkley, \nSenator Klobuchar, Senator Stabenow, Senator Murkowski, Senator \nLandrieu, Senator Shaheen, and Senator Boxer.\n  American women have made invaluable contributions to our country in \nsuch diverse fields as government, business, medicine, law, literature, \nsports, entertainment, the arts, and the military. The need for a \nmuseum recognizing the contributions of American women is long overdue.\n  In 1999, a Presidential commission on commemorating women in American \nhistory concluded that, ``Efforts to implement an appropriate \ncelebration of women's history in the next millennium should include \nthe designation of a focal point for women's history in our Nation's \ncapital.''\n  Although Congress has made commendable provisions for the National \nMuseum for African American History and Culture, the National Law \nEnforcement Museum, and the National Museum of the American Indian, \nthere is still no institution in the capital region dedicated to \nwomen's role in our country's history.\n  This bill would be a good step toward rectifying this oversight. The \nbill would simply establish a commission, similar to what was done for \nthe African American History and Culture Museum, to develop a feasible \nplan for establishing such a museum in here in Washington, D.C.\n  It is important to note that, unlike previous museum commissions, \ntaxpayers will not shoulder the funding of this project. The proposed \nlegislation calls for the commission to fund its own costs.\n  A museum dedicated to women's history would help ensure that future \ngenerations understand what we owe to the many generations of American \nwomen who have helped build, sustain, and advance our society. They \ndeserve a museum to present the stories of pioneering women like \nabolitionist Harriet Tubman, founder of the Girl Scouts Juliette Gordon \nLow, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, astronaut Sally Ride, \nand Senator Margaret Chase Smith.\n  Yes, of special pride to the State of Maine is a legendary \npredecessor in the Senate seat I now hold: Margaret Chase Smith, the \nfirst woman nominated for President of the United States by a major \npolitical party, and the first woman elected to both houses of \nCongress. Senator Smith began representing Maine in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in 1940, won election to the Senate in 1948, and \nenjoyed bipartisan respect over her long career for her independence, \nintegrity, wisdom, and courage. She remains my role model and, through \nthe example of her public service, an exemplar of the virtues that \nwould be honored in the National Women's History Museum.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 3572. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, title 5, \nUnited States Code, the Small Business Act, and the Small Business \nInvestment Act of 1958 to provide certainty for small business \nconcerns, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill boost America's small businesses and help them escape unnecessary \nregulations that are stifling creativity, growth, and job creation. \nThis legislation will encourage small businesses to invest and hire, \ngiving the economy a much needed lift.\n  Two of the most vital issues looming over small business job creators \nare tax and regulatory uncertainty. This bill aims to, among other \nthings, deliver targeted tax relief to small businesses with eight \ndifferent tax provisions, and protect small businesses from burdensome \nregulations. The Restoring Tax and Regulatory Certainty to Small \nBusinesses Act of 2012 will provide small business owners and \nentrepreneurs with the confidence they need to expand, thrive, and \nprosper in today's insecure economy.\n  My friend and colleague, Small Business Committee Chair Landrieu, \nrecently proposed a small business relief act with some similar \nmeasures. However, Chair Landrieu's bill lacks many of the tax and \nregulatory reforms that small businesses are seeking. While her bill \ndoes contain some measures that I support, and which I have worked with \nher to include in a freestanding bipartisan small business jobs bill, \nit does not include any provisions to protect small businesses from \narduous regulations. Additionally, it omits tax provisions that were \nincluded in our joint bill, S. 2050, that need to be addressed. By and \nlarge, this bill has some merits and I commend Chair Landrieu for \npressing forward the national conversation on these critical issues, \nbut the bill I am introducing today goes further by including both \nregulatory, and additional tax relief for small businesses.\n  The Restoring Tax and Regulatory Certainty to Small Businesses Act \nincludes eight indispensable tax extenders that will provide targeted \ntax relief to small businesses and extend the essential tax relief \nprovisions that were included in the bipartisan Small Business Jobs Act \nof 2010, P.L. 111-240. We have endured more than 40 straight months of \nunemployment over 8 percent and have yet to see changes implemented to \nease the burdens on job creators. With this bill, the Nation's small \nbusinesses, which create at least two-thirds of all new jobs, will \nfinally enjoy tax relief in many different forms.\n  Small businesses should be rewarded for taking risks and increasing \ninvestments. Under this bill, the 100-percent capital gains exclusion \nwill be extended, as will the availability of Section 179 expensing, \nwhich gives businesses the option of writing off the cost of qualifying \ncapital expenses in the year of acquisition in lieu of recovering these \ncosts over time through depreciation. Additionally, the carryback of \ngeneral business credits to offset 5 years of taxes as a cash-flow tool \nfor businesses that are currently not realizing profits will be \nextended, giving small businesses even more funds to put toward future \nendeavors.\n  Prior to the enactment of the Small Business Jobs Act, taxpayers \ncould generally only claim allowable general business credits against \ntheir regular tax liability, and only to the extent that their regular \ntax liability exceeded their alternative minimum tax--AMT--liability. \nWith this bill, qualified small businesses will now be able to reduce \ntheir AMT liability for general business credits by allowing credits to \nbe applied against regular income tax and AMT liability.\n  Additionally, this bill will permit contractors that do not complete \ncontracts within a single year to benefit from bonus depreciation. \nAnother provision was designed to benefit businesses that were \ninitially C corporations, but elected to be taxed as S corporations and \nhad net built-in gains when they made the S corporation election. Under \nthis bill, small businesses will also be able to deduct more for \nstartup costs, and be able to deduct health insurance premiums against \npayroll taxes, both of which are significant matters to new and \ndeveloping small business owners. Thanks to these new tax provisions, \nbusiness owners will be empowered to increase participation in domestic \nand global markets.\n\n  Besides these critical tax provisions, the bill also provides real, \nmeaningful\n\n[[Page S6462]]\n\nregulatory relief for job creators. Since the enactment of the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, P.L. 104-121, \nmore than 50,000 new rules have gone into effect, each with an \nestimated impact of more than $100 million annually. More than 3,000 \nnew Federal rules are established each year. And alarmingly, small \nfirms with fewer than 20 employees bear a disproportionate burden of \ncomplying with Federal regulations. These small firms pay an annual \nregulatory cost of $10,585 per employee, which is 36 percent higher \nthan the regulatory costs facing larger firms. This bill will \nstrengthen existing laws and enable the SBA Office of Advocacy to \nprotect small businesses from these burdensome regulations.\n  The Restoring Tax and Regulatory Certainty to Small Businesses Act \nincorporates the latest version of the Freedom from Restrictive, \nExcessive, Executive Demands and Onerous Mandates, FREEDOM, Act--a \nnecessary, targeted regulatory reform bill that will provide small \nbusinesses with much needed relief from onerous, one-size-fits-all \nFederal regulations. These provisions would: (a) require agencies to \nconsider foreseeable indirect costs of rules; (b) increase the number \nof small business review panels charged with helping agencies better \nconsider small businesses during the rulemaking process; (c) add teeth \nto the existing requirement that agencies regularly review the \nregulations on their books to determine if they are outdated or \nneedlessly burdensome; and (d) allow small businesses to seek judicial \nreview during the proposed rule stage, concerning whether an agency \ncomplied with its legal obligation to conduct an economic impact \nanalysis with the rulemaking. Regrettably, current law does not allow \nsmall businesses to challenge this in court until after a burdensome \nrule is finalized, when it is already too late.\n  A recent survey of 500 small business owners along the east coast \nfound that 71 percent of employers plan to maintain current employee \nlevels and only 21 percent plan to hire one or two more workers in the \nnear future. Business owners are reluctant to hire because of the \nsluggish pace at which the U.S. economy is recovering, the uncertain \nfiscal future, and the overly burdensome regulations currently in \nexistence. The NFIB reported that small business optimism is also at \nits lowest level since October 2011. Now is the time to reverse these \ntrends and give small businesses, our one bright spot of job creation, \nthe certainty and motivation they need to grow and provide more jobs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 3577. A bill to eliminate conditions in foreign prisons and other \ndetention facilities that do not meet primary indicators of health, \nsanitation, and safety, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join today with the \nsenior Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, in introducing \nlegislation that has already attracted broad support--from across the \nsocial and political spectrum.\n  This bill, titled the Foreign Prison Conditions Improvement Act of \n2012, seeks to address a much neglected, global human rights and \nhumanitarian problem--the inhumane treatment of people in foreign \nprisons and other detention facilities.\n  On any given day, millions of people are languishing in foreign \nprisons, many in pretrial detention having never been brought before a \njudge or formally charged or proven guilty of anything, deprived of \ntheir freedom in abysmal conditions, often for years longer than they \ncould have been sentenced to prison if convicted.\n  Others are imprisoned after being convicted of offenses, often after \nwoefully unfair trials, including for nothing more than peacefully \nexpressing political or religious beliefs or defending human rights. \nRegardless of their status they have one thing in common. They are \ndeprived of the most basic rights and necessities--safe water, adequate \nfood, essential medical care, personal safety, and dignity.\n  Anyone who has been inside one of these facilities, or seen \nphotographs or press reports of what they are like, understands that \nthis is about the mistreatment of human beings in ways that are \nreminiscent of the Dark Ages.\n  A few examples illustrate the point. In Haiti's National Penitentiary \nbefore the 2010 earthquake, more than 4,000 prisoners were confined in \na space built for less than 900. Many did not have room to lie down and \nhad to sleep standing up. Sanitation was practically non-existent. \nDeadly contagious diseases were rampant. The overwhelming majority of \ninmates had never been formally charged, never seen a lawyer or a \njudge. The earthquake damaged the prison and the prison guards fled, \nleaving the inmates to fend for themselves without food or water. They \nmanaged to get out, but the squalid facility filled up again.\n  I recall a newspaper article about how in Benin, in West Africa, the \nskin of prisoners was ragged from the extraction of fly larvae, an \naffliction that is symptomatic of the deplorable conditions. Many \ninmates suffer from tuberculosis, scabies, parasites, lung infections \nor other illnesses. The prison in Abomey, located in southern Benin, \nwas built in 1904 to house a maximum of 150 prisoners. More than 1,000 \nhave reportedly been confined there.\n  In February of this year, a fire at the Comayagua Prison in Honduras \nkilled 360 inmates. In one overcrowded cell block only 4 of 105 \nprisoners survived. More than half of those who died were waiting to be \ncharged or tried.\n  It is common in prisons from Latin America to the Middle East, \nAfrica, and Asia for inmates to be severely malnourished and to go for \nmonths without being able to wash. Many prisoners depend for survival \non food brought to them by relatives. In many countries individuals \nawaiting trial, young and old, are housed together with convicted, \nviolent criminals.\n  Prisoners and other detainees in many countries are also routinely \nvictimized by poorly trained, abusive guards who are virtually \nunsupervised and unaccountable to any higher authority. Sexual abuse of \nmen, women and children is common.\n  A government commission in Cameroon reported that an average of five \nprisoners die per month in a prison there, simply from lack of proper \nmedical care. Inmates in many countries suffer from HIV/AIDS and other \nillnesses in prisons with no medical records, where doctors do not \nenter. Prisoners intentionally cut or otherwise harm themselves in the \nhope of receiving medical attention for life-threatening illnesses. If \nand when they are released they infect the local population.\n  A New York Times article described how prisoners in Zambia were \npunished by being stripped naked and held in solitary confinement in \nsmall, windowless cells, sometimes for days on end, in ankle-to-calf-\nhigh water contaminated with their own excrement. It is like something \nout of The Count of Monte Cristo, only worse because it is happening in \nthe 21st Century. But the article went on to describe how Zambia's \nPrison Service conducted its own internal audit, appointed a new \nmedical director, and allowed human rights workers access to its \nfacilities. The legislation Senator Inhofe and I are introducing seeks \nto provide incentives for those kinds of improvements. Our bill would \ndo the following:\n  First, it calls attention to this long ignored problem. Most people \nknow little if anything about what goes on inside foreign prisons, and \nmany would prefer not to know.\n  Second, it sets forth primary indicators for the elimination of \ninhumane conditions in foreign prisons and other detention facilities, \nsuch as human waste facilities that are sanitary and accessible, and \nadequate ventilation, food and safe drinking water.\n  Third, it requires the Secretary of State to report annually on the \nconditions in prisons and other detention facilities in at least 30 \ncountries receiving United States assistance or under sanction by the \nUnited States, selected by the Secretary's determination that such \nconditions raise the most serious human rights or humanitarian \nconcerns.\n  Fourth, it encourages the Secretary and the Administrator of the U.S. \nAgency for International Development to furnish assistance for the \npurpose of eliminating inhumane conditions where such assistance would \nbe appropriate and beneficial.\n  For countries that are not making significant efforts to eliminate \nsuch\n\n[[Page S6463]]\n\nconditions, the Secretary is to enter into consultations with their \ngovernment to achieve the purposes of the Act.\n  The legislation also provides for training of Foreign Service \nOfficers, and directs the Secretary to designate, within the Department \nof State's Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, an official \nwith responsibility for implementing the provisions of the Act.\n  Finally, it authorizes the expenditure of funds to implement the Act.\n  Once enacted, the Foreign Prison Conditions Improvement Act of 2012 \nwill help foreign governments ensure that prisoners in their countries \nare treated as any people deprived of their freedom should be--as human \nbeings, with dignity, in safety, and provided the basic necessities of \nlife.\n  In countries around the world, the United States is helping to reform \njustice systems and strengthen the rule of law. No justice system can \nclaim to deliver justice if prisoners and other detainees are treated \nlike animals, or worse. By helping to change attitudes, and showing how \nwith relatively little money prison conditions can be significantly \nimproved, we can help advance the cause of justice more broadly.\n  Millions of people around the world look to the United States as a \ndefender of justice. This legislation will further that goal and it \nreflects the best instincts of the American people. It has already been \nendorsed by a wide range of groups, including Amnesty International, \nUSA; Baptist World Alliance, Division of Freedom and Justice; Ethics \nand Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention; \nHuman Rights First; Human Rights Watch; International CURE; \nInternational Justice Mission; International Prison Chaplains' \nAssociation; Jewish Council for Public Affairs; Just Detention \nInternational; Justice Fellowship/Prison Fellowship Ministries; \nNational Association of Evangelicals; National Religious Campaign \nAgainst Torture; New Evangelical Partnership for the Common Good; Open \nSociety Policy Center; Penal Reform International; Religious Action \nCenter of Reform Judaism; United Methodist Church, General Board of \nChurch and Society; and the United States Conference of Catholic \nBishops. I want to thank these groups for their support and their \nefforts to focus attention on this urgent problem.\n  Identical legislation is being introduced today in the House by \nRepresentatives Chris Smith and Russ Carnahan, both of whom care deeply \nabout this issue, so this is a bipartisan, bicameral effort.\n  Finally, I want to thank Senator Inhofe, who has visited many African \ncountries and has witnessed the problems this legislation seeks to \naddress, as well as his staff, who have been very helpful in this \nprocess. At a time when some people seem to get satisfaction from \ncalling Washington broken, this is another example of how two Senators \nand two Representatives, of different parties, whose political views \noften differ, can work together in furtherance of a just cause.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I introduce \nthe Foreign Prison Conditions Improvement Act along with my friend from \nVermont, Senator Patrick Leahy.\n  This bill seeks to identify and eliminate unhealthy and unsafe prison \nconditions found in developing countries like Haiti and on the African \ncontinent where millions suffer in inhumane conditions.\n  Overcrowded, unsanitary detention and incarceration facilities \nendanger lives. This extremely high risk environment is a breeding \nground for disease, particularly HIV/AIDs and tuberculosis, and creates \ngrave risks to communities in which released prisoners live. Studies \nestimate that HIV infection rates in prisons in developing countries \ncan be as much as 50 times higher than in the general population, and \ntuberculosis infection rates in prisons there are more than 20 times \nhigher than in the general population.\n  Our bill encourages these developing nations to provide humane and \nsanitary prison conditions so that prisoners can be released in good \nhealth, and thus stem one of the causes of the spread of HIV and \ntuberculosis among the general public. Our bill also focuses on \neliminating excessive pre-trial detention and dysfunctional justice \nsystems which frequently result in prisoners and other detainees \nspending years in unhealthy prison conditions before their cases are \neven adjudicated. Tragically, inadequate, misplaced or lost records \noften result in the incarcerated being held indefinitely because their \ncases have never been heard. Unbelievably, such poor recordkeeping has \nkept many in prison long after their sentences have been served.\n  Specifically, our bill calls upon the Department of State to submit \nto Congress an annual report that describes inhuman prison conditions \nin at least 30 countries receiving U.S. foreign assistance. It gives \nthe Secretary of State and Administrator of the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development the discretion to restructure, reprogram or \nreduce U.S. foreign assistance to these countries based upon whether \nthey are making ``significant efforts'' to eliminate inhuman conditions \nin their prisons and other detention facilities.\n  The goals of this bill are noble, but it will take close monitoring \nand hard work by our U.S. Foreign Service personnel on the ground \noverseas to fulfill this work. That is why our bill directs the \nSecretary of State to provide training to these embassy and consulate \npersonnel so that they can effectively investigate and assess prison \nconditions in foreign prisons as well as assist these foreign \ngovernments to adopt substantive prison reforms. The Secretary is also \ndirected to designate and task a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State \nwithin the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor with the \nresponsibility for gathering the information for the annual report and \nmake recommendations to the Secretary based off its conclusions.\n  I have visited Africa frequently, and I believe that given the \nchance, the majority of Africa's leaders will welcome the opportunity \nto interact with our embassy and consulate personnel and adopt the best \npractices for achieving the elimination of unhealthy and unsafe \nconditions in their prisons and other detention facilities.\n  The task at hand reminds me of the teaching of Jesus in Matthew \n25:39:40 when he said, ``when did we see you sick or in prison and \nvisit you?'' And the King will answer them, `Truly, I say to you, as \nyou did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.' \n''\n  We are all our brothers' keepers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6463-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6463-S6464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 559--HONORING REAR ADMIRAL JONATHAN W.

Res. 560\n\n       Whereas because of geographic position, Maryland and the \n     citizens of Maryland played a key role in the military and \n     political struggles of the Civil War;\n       Whereas during the conflict, controlling Maryland was key \n     due to the proximity to Washington D.C., the fact that \n     Maryland shared a border with Virginia and the States still \n     remaining in the Union, and the position of Baltimore as a \n     key railroad link to the West;\n       Whereas, on September 4, 1862, General Robert E. Lee led \n     his Confederate Army of northern Virginia across the Potomac \n     River near Leesburg, Virginia into Maryland, marking first \n     invasion by General Lee of the North during the Civil War;\n       Whereas, on September 7, 1862, General George B. McClellan \n     moved the Union Army of the Potomac forces out of Washington \n     D.C. in pursuit;\n       Whereas, over the ensuing 2 weeks, pitched battles were \n     fought in Harper's Ferry and Shepardstown in West Virginia \n     and South Mountain and Antietam in Maryland, as the 2 forces \n     confronted one another amidst the Appalachian Mountains;\n       Whereas on September 17, 1862, the climax of the Maryland \n     Campaign took place on the banks of Antietam Creek, near the \n     town of Sharpsburg, Maryland;\n       Whereas on September 17, 1862, fighting began before dawn \n     when Union forces advanced on Confederate defensive positions \n     behind Antietam Creek, launching 3 assaults along the \n     Cornfield, East Woods, West Woods, and Sunken Road for 8 \n     hours;\n       Whereas the brutal fighting to cross Burnside Bridge and \n     into Sharpsburg lasted until the afternoon and both armies \n     suffered heavy casualties, ending the combat after a gruesome \n     12 hours;\n       Whereas both sides engaged in slow, savage fighting at \n     close range, resulting in the single bloodiest day of war in \n     American history, with nearly 23,000 total casualties, \n     representing 25 percent of the Union force, and 31 percent of \n     the Confederate force;\n       Whereas the tactical result of the battle was inconclusive, \n     as each side maintained position until the bitter end;\n       Whereas on September 18, 1862, as the opposing armies \n     gathered the wounded and buried the dead, General Lee \n     withdrew the Confederate Army back across the Potomac River \n     into Virginia, ending the invasion;\n       Whereas the Battle of Antietam pitted Marylanders on \n     opposite sides of the fighting, emblematic of national \n     division of the Civil War pitting ``brother against \n     brother'';\n       Whereas the people of the United States honor those \n     Marylanders and others who valiantly fought in the Civil War, \n     endured the hardships brought on by the conflict, and who \n     made the ultimate sacrifice to form a more perfect Union; and\n       Whereas during the sesquicentennial of the Maryland \n     Campaign, it is fitting that the National Park Service, the \n     Maryland Heritage Areas Authority, and all others involved \n     recognize the bravery and steadfast determination of the \n     Marylanders and all people affected by the Civil War: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 150th anniversary of the Maryland \n     Campaign of the Civil War, culminating in the Battle of \n     Antietam; and\n       (2) recognizes the dedication and commitment of the \n     National Park Service, the Maryland Heritage Areas Authority, \n     and all others involved, for preserving the heritage and \n     promoting the rich history of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6464-2", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6464-S6465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 561--RECOGNIZING NATIONAL NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE \n MONTH AND CELEBRATING THE HERITAGES AND CULTURES OF NATIVE AMERICANS \n     AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF NATIVE AMERICANS TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \nJohnson of South Dakota, Ms. Murkowski, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Tester, Mr. \nFranken, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, and Mr. Johanns) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n                              S.

Res. 563\n\n       Whereas phenylketonuria is a rare, inherited metabolic \n     disorder that is characterized by the inability of the body \n     to process the essential amino acid phenylalanine, and which \n     causes mental retardation and other neurological problems, \n     such as memory loss and mood disorders, when treatment is not \n     started within the first few weeks of life;\n       Whereas newborn screening for phenylketonuria was initiated \n     in the United States in 1963 and was mandated by the Newborn \n     Screening Saves Life Act of 2008 (42 U.S.C. 201 note);\n       Whereas approximately 1 of every 15,000 infants in the \n     United States is born with phenylketonuria;\n       Whereas the 2012 Phenylketonuria Scientific Review \n     Conference affirmed the recommendation of lifelong dietary \n     treatment for phenylketonuria made by the National Institutes \n     of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement 2000;\n       Whereas adults with phenylketonuria who discontinue \n     treatment are at risk for other serious medical issues such \n     as depression, impulse control disorder, phobias, tremors, \n     and pareses;\n       Whereas women with phenylketonuria must maintain strict \n     metabolic control before and during pregnancy to prevent \n     fetal damage;\n       Whereas children born from untreated mothers with \n     phenylketonuria may have a condition known as maternal PKU \n     syndrome, which can cause small brains, mental retardation, \n     birth defects of the heart, and low birth weight;\n       Whereas phenylketonuria is treated with medical food;\n       Whereas, although there is no cure for phenylketonuria, a \n     treatment involving medical food and restricting \n     phenylalanine intake can prevent progressive, irreversible \n     brain damage;\n       Whereas maintaining a strict medical diet for \n     phenylketonuria can be difficult to achieve, and poor \n     metabolic control can result in a significant decline in \n     mental and behavioral performance;\n       Whereas access to health coverage for medical food varies \n     across the United States, and the long-term costs associated \n     with caring for untreated children and adults far exceed the \n     cost of providing medical food treatment;\n       Whereas scientists and researchers are hopeful that \n     breakthroughs in phenylketonuria research will be \n     forthcoming;\n       Whereas researchers across the United States are conducting \n     important research projects involving phenylketonuria; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness of phenylketonuria among the general public and the \n     medical community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates December 3, 2012, as ``National \n     Phenylketonuria Awareness Day'';\n       (2) encourages all people in the United States to become \n     more informed about phenylketonuria; and\n       (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the National PKU \n     Alliance, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving \n     the lives of individuals with phenylketonuria.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6465-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6465-S6466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 564--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 2012 AS \n              ``NATIONAL MEDICINE ABUSE AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Udall of \nNew Mexico, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Portman, Mr. Coons, Mr. Rockefeller, \nMr. Cornyn, Mr. Manchin, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Casey) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 564\n\n       Whereas over-the-counter and prescription medicines \n     approved by the Food and Drug Administration have been \n     determined to be safe and effective when used properly;\n       Whereas the misuse or abuse of these medicines can be \n     extremely dangerous and produce serious side effects;\n       Whereas the Office of National Drug Control Policy reports \n     that medicine abuse is the fastest-growing drug problem in \n     the United States, and the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention has classified medicine abuse as an epidemic;\n       Whereas the 2011 Monitoring the Future survey, funded by \n     the National Institutes of Health, and the 2011 National \n     Survey on Drug Use and Health, sponsored by the Substance \n     Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, both \n     illustrate that, after marijuana, over-the-counter and \n     prescription medicines account for the most frequently abused \n     drugs among 12th graders;\n       Whereas the access teenagers often have to prescription \n     medicines in home medicine cabinets and the lack of \n     understanding by teenagers of the potential harms of these \n     powerful medicines make it more critical than ever to raise \n     public awareness about the dangers of medicine abuse;\n       Whereas the Drug Enforcement Administration and many State \n     and local law enforcement agencies have established drug \n     disposal programs (commonly referred to as ``take-back \n     programs'') to facilitate the collection and destruction of \n     unused, unwanted, or expired medications, thereby helping to \n     take outdated or unused medications off household shelves and \n     out of the reach of children and teenagers;\n       Whereas National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month promotes \n     the message that over-the-counter and prescription medicines \n     are to be taken only as labeled or prescribed, and that using \n     such medicines to get high or in large doses can cause \n     serious or life-threatening consequences;\n       Whereas observance of National Medicine Abuse Awareness \n     Month should be encouraged at the national, state, and local \n     levels to increase awareness of the abuse of medicines;\n       Whereas a nationwide prevention and education campaign has \n     been launched by the national organization that represents \n     5,000 anti-drug coalitions nationwide, along with the \n     association representing makers of over-the-counter \n     medicines, to provide local coalitions with tools, training, \n     and outreach strategies to engage and educate parents, \n     grandparents, teachers, law enforcement officials, retailers, \n     doctors, and other healthcare professionals about the \n     potential harms of cough medicine abuse; and\n       Whereas educating the public about the dangers of medicine \n     abuse, encouraging parents to talk about medicine abuse with \n     their teenagers, mobilizing parents to safeguard their home \n     medicine cabinets, and promoting abuse prevention are \n     critical components of what must be a multi-pronged effort\n\n[[Page S6466]]\n\n     to curb over-the-counter and prescription medicine abuse: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of October 2012 as ``National \n     Medicine Abuse Awareness Month''; and\n       (2) urges communities to carry out appropriate programs and \n     activities to educate parents and youth of the potential \n     dangers associated with medicine abuse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6466-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 565--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF \n          OCTOBER 20, 2012, AS THE ``NATIONAL DAY ON WRITING''\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Brown of Ohio, \nand Mr. Akaka) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 569\n\n       Whereas the well-being of the United States requires that \n     the young people of the United States become an involved, \n     caring citizenry of good character;\n       Whereas the character education of children has become more \n     urgent, as violence by and against youth increasingly \n     threatens the physical and psychological well-being of the \n     people of the United States;\n       Whereas, more than ever, children need strong and \n     constructive guidance from their families and their \n     communities, including schools, youth organizations, \n     religious institutions, and civic groups;\n       Whereas the character of a nation is only as strong as the \n     character of its individual citizens;\n       Whereas the public good is advanced when young people are \n     taught the importance of good character and the positive \n     effects that good character can have in personal \n     relationships, in school, and in the workplace;\n       Whereas scholars and educators agree that people do not \n     automatically develop good character and that, therefore, \n     conscientious efforts must be made by institutions and \n     individuals that influence youth to help young people develop \n     the essential traits and characteristics that comprise good \n     character;\n       Whereas, although character development is, first and \n     foremost, an obligation of families, the efforts of faith \n     communities, schools, and youth, civic, and human service \n     organizations also play an important role in fostering and \n     promoting good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages students, teachers, parents, \n     youth, and community leaders to recognize the importance of \n     character education in preparing young people to play a role \n     in determining the future of the United States;\n       Whereas effective character education is based on core \n     ethical values, which form the foundation of a democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas examples of character are trustworthiness, respect, \n     responsibility, fairness, caring, citizenship, and honesty;\n       Whereas elements of character transcend cultural, \n     religious, and socioeconomic differences;\n       Whereas the character and conduct of our youth reflect the \n     character and conduct of society, and, therefore, every adult \n     has the responsibility to teach and model ethical values and \n     every social institution has the responsibility to promote \n     the development of good character;\n       Whereas Congress encourages individuals and organizations, \n     especially those that have an interest in the education and \n     training of the young people of the United States, to adopt \n     the elements of character as intrinsic to the well-being of \n     individuals, communities, and society;\n       Whereas many schools in the United States recognize the \n     need, and have taken steps, to integrate the values of their \n     communities into their teaching activities; and\n       Whereas the establishment of ``National Character Counts \n     Week'', during which individuals, families, schools, youth \n     organizations, religious institutions, civic groups, and \n     other organizations focus on character education, is of great \n     benefit to the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning October 21, 2012, as \n     ``National Character Counts Week''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States and \n     interested groups--\n       (A) to embrace the elements of character identified by \n     local schools and communities, such as trustworthiness, \n     respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and citizenship; \n     and\n       (B) to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies, \n     programs, and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6467-3", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6467]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 570--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 8, 2012, AS ``NATIONAL \n                       PARENTS AS TEACHERS DAY''\n\n  Mr. Blunt (for himself and Mrs. Murray) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 562\n\n       Whereas healthcare information technology and management \n     systems have been recognized as essential tools for improving \n     patient care, ensuring patient safety, stopping duplicative \n     tests and paperwork, and reducing healthcare costs;\n       Whereas the Center for Information Technology Leadership \n     has estimated that the implementation of national standards \n     for interoperability and the exchange of health\n\n[[Page S6470]]\n\n     information would save the United States approximately \n     $77,000,000,000 in expenses relating to healthcare each year;\n       Whereas Congress has made a commitment to leveraging the \n     benefits of healthcare information technology and management \n     systems, including supporting the adoption of electronic \n     health records that will help to reduce costs and improve \n     quality while ensuring the privacy of patients;\n       Whereas the ability to exchange health information \n     confidently and securely between different providers, \n     systems, and insurers is critical to transforming the \n     healthcare delivery system of the United States to improve \n     clinical outcomes for patients, control costs, and expand \n     access to care through the use of technology;\n       Whereas Congress has made real-time health information \n     exchange a priority and an essential component of the \n     Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Records Incentive \n     Programs;\n       Whereas Congress has emphasized improving the quality and \n     safety of delivery of healthcare in the United States; and\n       Whereas, since 2006, organizations across the United States \n     have united to support National Health Information Technology \n     Week to improve public awareness of the benefits of improved \n     quality and cost efficiency of the healthcare system that the \n     implementation of health information technology could \n     achieve: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning on September 10, 2012 and \n     ending on September 14, 2012 as ``National Health Information \n     Technology Week'';\n       (2) recognizes the value of information technology and \n     management systems in transforming healthcare for the people \n     of the United States; and\n       (3) calls on all interested parties to promote the use of \n     information technology and management systems to transform \n     the healthcare system of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              S. Res. 563\n\n       Whereas phenylketonuria is a rare, inherited metabolic \n     disorder that is characterized by the inability of the body \n     to process the essential amino acid phenylalanine, and which \n     causes mental retardation and other neurological problems, \n     such as memory loss and mood disorders, when treatment is not \n     started within the first few weeks of life;\n       Whereas newborn screening for phenylketonuria was initiated \n     in the United States in 1963 and was mandated by the Newborn \n     Screening Saves Life Act of 2008 (42 U.S.C. 201 note);\n       Whereas approximately 1 of every 15,000 infants in the \n     United States is born with phenylketonuria;\n       Whereas the 2012 Phenylketonuria Scientific Review \n     Conference affirmed the recommendation of lifelong dietary \n     treatment for phenylketonuria made by the National Institutes \n     of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement 2000;\n       Whereas adults with phenylketonuria who discontinue \n     treatment are at risk for other serious medical issues such \n     as depression, impulse control disorder, phobias, tremors, \n     and pareses;\n       Whereas women with phenylketonuria must maintain strict \n     metabolic control before and during pregnancy to prevent \n     fetal damage;\n       Whereas children born from untreated mothers with \n     phenylketonuria may have a condition known as maternal PKU \n     syndrome, which can cause small brains, mental retardation, \n     birth defects of the heart, and low birth weight;\n       Whereas phenylketonuria is treated with medical food;\n       Whereas, although there is no cure for phenylketonuria, a \n     treatment involving medical food and restricting \n     phenylalanine intake can prevent progressive, irreversible \n     brain damage;\n       Whereas maintaining a strict medical diet for \n     phenylketonuria can be difficult to achieve, and poor \n     metabolic control can result in a significant decline in \n     mental and behavioral performance;\n       Whereas access to health coverage for medical food varies \n     across the United States, and the long-term costs associated \n     with caring for untreated children and adults far exceed the \n     cost of providing medical food treatment;\n       Whereas scientists and researchers are hopeful that \n     breakthroughs in phenylketonuria research will be \n     forthcoming;\n       Whereas researchers across the United States are conducting \n     important research projects involving phenylketonuria; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness of phenylketonuria among the general public and the \n     medical community: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates December 3, 2012, as ``National \n     Phenylketonuria Awareness Day'';\n       (2) encourages all people in the United States to become \n     more informed about phenylketonuria; and\n       (3) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the National PKU \n     Alliance, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving \n     the lives of individuals with phenylketonuria.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                              S.

Res. 557\n\n       Whereas Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari, who was born in Nyarong, Kham \n     in 1949, was recognized according to Tibetan Buddhist \n     tradition as a reincarnate lama and began his monastic \n     studies at 4 years of age in Lhumorhab Monastery, which was \n     located in what is now Kardze Prefecture, Sichuan Province;\n       Whereas, in 1958, 9-year-old Lodi Gyari fled Nyarong with \n     his family to avoid pursuit by the Chinese People's \n     Liberation Army and was said to have led his group to safety \n     in India through prayer and divinations;\n       Whereas Lodi Gyari, as a young man in India, began a \n     career-long commitment to the Tibetan struggle against \n     Chinese oppression in Tibet, becoming editor for the Tibetan \n     Freedom Press, founder of the Tibetan Review, the first \n     English language journal published by Tibetans in exile, and \n     a founding member of the Tibetan Youth Congress;\n       Whereas Lodi Gyari served as a civil servant in the Central \n     Tibetan Administration of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, as \n     Chairman of the Tibetan Parliament in exile, and as a Deputy \n     Cabinet Minister for the Departments of Religious Affairs and \n     Health and Cabinet Minister for the Department of Information \n     and International Relations;\n       Whereas, in 1991, Lodi Gyari moved to the United States in \n     the capacity of Special Envoy of His Holiness the Dalai Lama \n     and was soon after selected to be President of the \n     International Campaign for Tibet;\n       Whereas, for 3 decades, Lodi Gyari has met with leaders and \n     diplomats of governments around the world and with Members of \n     the United States Congress and parliaments of other nations--\n       (1) to explain the Tibetan position with regard to \n     engagement with China;\n       (2) to urge supportive strategies and policies from \n     governments;\n       (3) to explain the Dalai Lama's ``Middle Way'' philosophy \n     of seeking genuine autonomy for Tibet within the People's \n     Republic of China that contributes to harmony between the \n     Tibetan and Chinese peoples; and\n       (4) to promote Tibetan statecraft as the Dalai Lama's \n     senior ambassador-at-large;\n       Whereas, during his time as Special Envoy based in \n     Washington, DC, Congress approved many policy and \n     programmatic measures on Tibet, which served to \n     institutionalize the Tibet issue within the Government of the \n     United States, most notably the establishment of a Special \n     Coordinator on Tibetan Issues within the Department of State \n     and support for Tibetan refugees;\n       Whereas, in 1999, Lodi Gyari became a United States \n     citizen;\n       Whereas in May 1998, His Holiness the Dalai Lama authorized \n     Special Envoy Lodi Gyari to be the principal person to \n     reestablish contact with the Chinese government on the \n     Tibetan issue;\n       Whereas, between September 2002 and January 2010, Lodi \n     Gyari led the Dalai Lama's negotiating team in 9 formal \n     rounds of meetings with Chinese officials with tireless drive \n     and immense skill, winning the respect of the international \n     community;\n       Whereas Lodi Gyari presented the Chinese government with \n     the Memorandum on Genuine Autonomy for the Tibetan People and \n     its accompanying Note, thus detailing the Tibetan side's \n     vision for a political solution for Tibet consistent within \n     the framework of the Chinese constitutional and laws on \n     autonomy;\n       Whereas Lodi Gyari, in service to the Dalai Lama, came to \n     represent in national capitals around the world, the great \n     hope and conviction that the rights of Tibetans could be \n     protected and their repression could be ended.\n       Whereas, in the personally and professionally difficult \n     task of representing Tibetan interests in dialogue with the \n     People's Republic of China, Lodi Gyari demonstrated spirit, \n     intelligence, and extraordinary tact, and brought civility, \n     reason and a measure of mutual understanding to the Tibetan-\n     Chinese relationship;\n       Whereas Lodi Gyari has credited the far-sighted wisdom of \n     His Holiness the Dalai Lama in empowering the Tibetan people \n     by his devolution of his political authority to an elected \n     Tibetan leadership; and\n       Whereas, Lodi Gyari resigned his position, effective June \n     1, 2012, in the context of the deteriorating situation inside \n     Tibet, including increasing incidents of Tibetan self-\n     immolations, and expressing deep frustration over the lack of \n     positive response from the Chinese side in their nearly 10-\n     year dialogue, and in respect for the process of the \n     devolution of political power to the elected Tibetan leaders.\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the service of Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari as Special \n     Envoy of His Holiness the Dalai Lama;\n       (2) commends the achievements of Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari in \n     building an international coalition of support for Tibet that \n     recognizes--\n       (A) the imperative to preserve the distinct culture and \n     religious traditions of Tibet; and\n       (B) that the Tibetan people are entitled under \n     international law to their own identity and dignity and \n     genuine autonomy within the People's Republic of China that \n     fully preserves the rights and dignity of the Tibetan people;\n       (3) acknowledges the role of Lodi Gyaltsen Gyari, as a \n     naturalized United States citizen, to promoting understanding \n     in the United States of the Tibetan people, their culture\n\n[[Page S6473]]\n\n     and religion, and their struggle for genuine autonomy, human \n     rights, dignity, and the preservation of unique linguistic, \n     cultural, and religious traditions; and\n       (4) strongly supports a political solution for Tibet within \n     the People's Republic of China that satisfies the legitimate \n     grievances and aspirations of the Tibetan people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/09/19/senate-section/article/S6473-1", "month": "09", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 3576\n\n  Mr. REID.
