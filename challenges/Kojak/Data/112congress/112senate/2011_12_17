Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the Senate we work on an adversarial \nbasis lots of times because that is the way the Founding Fathers set up \nour country. I am not going to give a long lecture on this because I \nknow people have a lot to do.\n  This little Constitution was very hard to come by. It was very hard \nto come by. We tried the Articles of Confederation. They did not work \nat all. We had the State of Rhode Island, a little, tiny place, with \nnot many people in it; we had the big State of New York, with lots of \nterritory and lots of people.\n  How were they going to work that out? They could not--until a man \nfrom Connecticut, Elbridge Gerry, came as one of the delegates, in June \nof 1787, to Philadelphia, who said: I have a great idea. It was an idea \nthat had never been tried before. It was a stunningly interesting idea \nthat he had. He suggested to the Founding Fathers a bicameral \nlegislature, having a legislature made up of two bodies, two \nlegislative bodies, the House and the Senate. That is the reason we are \nable to have a constitution.\n  But in the process, built into our Constitution is constant vying for \npower. You have the executive branch, the judicial branch, but within \nthe legislative branch, there is constant vying for power between the \nHouse and the Senate. That is the case, even though both bodies may be \nof one party. When Pelosi was the Speaker, the Speaker and I were very \ngood friends, but we had problems trying to work out things between the \ntwo bodies. When you have one body with one party and the other body \nwith another party, it becomes even more difficult.\n\n  The times we are going through are not unusual for the Senate in the \n200-plus years we have been a country. In fact, they are very peaceful \nand calm compared to sometimes. As we know, a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives did not like what a Senator from Massachusetts was \nsaying. He came over here and, with his cane, nearly beat to death the \nSenator from Massachusetts. The Senator from Massachusetts was out of \nwork for 2 years, and he was irreparably damaged. His health never \nreturned.\n  So I know how difficult and hard it is for people to accept our way \nof doing business. But if you look back over the time we have been a \ncountry, it has worked out pretty well. For example, what we are going \nto vote on shortly--both the omnibus, the spending bill; and the \npayroll tax--were truly legislative accomplishments. They were \ncompromises.\n  The omnibus is much better than it was previously. We were able to \nactually pass individual appropriations bills this year. The goal of \nthe Republican leader and me is to pass them all next year. We are \ngoing to try. It is going to be one of our important issues we have to \ndeal with, to try to get our appropriations bills back together.\n  I, when I first came to the Senate, became an appropriator. I think \nthat committee is so integral to how this body works, and it has not \nbeen working well; that is, the appropriations process.\n  So people may be disturbed about some of the stuff that is on the \nfloor, but it was true legislation because it was compromise. The \nomnibus--there are lots of things in that I do not like, and I will bet \nyou every Senator has something in it that they do not like.\n  With the package we have dealing with unemployment, the package with \nthe payroll tax and SGR, there are things in there I would rather not \nhave in either one of those, but we are here because that is the way we \nwere able to bring this and lead to what I think is an accomplishment \nthat is important for the American people.\n  I appreciate the ability of the Republican leader and myself to sit \ndown and talk, as we do, often, away from all of you, away from \neverybody. We started this conversation alone, and we ended it alone, \nworking on these measures we have here. I know members of my caucus \nsay: Why couldn't I have been in on doing all this stuff? We involved \nas many people as we could.\n  But, ultimately, as hard as it is for the two of us, we, on occasion, \nhave to do what we think is right for the good of the country. So I \nappreciate very much the Republican leader and his ability to remain \nfriends with me, as I do with him. I hope everybody understands today \nis a very important day for our country because we are doing today \nexactly what the Founding Fathers thought we would do.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to make just a few comments \nabout the pipeline-payroll package that the majority leader and I have \noffered on which we will be voting shortly. It is not the bill I would \nhave written. It falls short in several respects, in not having both \ncertainty--the certainty issue is awfully important to the private \nsector if we are going to come out of this economic slowdown. But as \nthe majority leader has indicated, our side approached this debate \nconscious of something Democrats in Washington tend to forget these \ndays; that is, in order to achieve something around here, we have to \ncompromise.\n  As the majority leader indicated, that is, in fact, what we have \ndone. We have crafted a bill not designed to fail but designed to pass. \nThe main thing Republicans were fighting for and got was the Keystone \nXL Pipeline provision authored by Senator Lugar and also Senator \nHoeven, and Senator Johanns was particularly instrumental in working \nout the Nebraska aspects of this to the satisfaction of his Governor \nand his State legislature.\n  So why were Republicans fighting for the pipeline? We knew the whole \nreason we were even talking about temporary tax relief and extending \nunemployment benefits is because 3 years into this administration the \nprivate sector is still gasping, literally gasping for air. So we said \nlet's also do something that would help create private sector jobs. \nLet's start to change the equation and do something that will actually \nget at the heart of the problem.\n  Keystone was an obvious choice. Everybody in Washington says they \nwant more American jobs right now. Well, here is the single largest \nshovel-ready project in America. It is literally ready to go awaiting \nthe permission of the President of the United States.\n  Some of the news outlets are calling this pipeline controversial. I \nhave no idea why it could be called controversial. The labor unions \nlike it, many Democrats want it, it strengthens our national security \nby decreasing the amount of oil we get from unfriendly countries, and \nit would not cost the taxpayers a dime--not a dime. It is a private \nsector project ready to go.\n  All we are doing is saying the President has 60 days to decide \nwhether the project is in the national interest--60 days for the \nPresident to make a decision one way or the other. Since most of us \nhave not heard a good reason from the White House as to why they would \nblock it, I am very hopeful the President, in the course of this 60 \ndays, will do the right thing for the country and get this crucial \nproject underway.\n  The only thing standing between thousands of American workers and the \ngood jobs this project will provide is a Presidential decision. As I \nsaid, I am hopeful and optimistic the President will make the right \ndecision.\n  I thank my friend, the majority leader, for the opportunity to work \ntogether with him on something that could actually pass the Senate and \nbe signed by the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are close to voting on a payroll tax \nextension bill that includes a House provision designed to force the \nPresident to approve the Keystone XL tar sands oil pipeline. Proponents \nof this tar sands project argue that it belongs on this bill for one \nreason: building the pipeline would create jobs.\n  Any construction project creates jobs, and it is no surprise that \nthis debate has come down to this. Unable to sell the pipeline as \nnecessary to meet the country's energy needs, which it is not, or to \nrefute charges that tar sands strip mining and the refining and burning \nof high carbon oil cause egregious harm to the environment and health, \nwhich it does, the Canadian energy company TransCanada has flooded the \nmedia with dire warnings about the American jobs that will be lost if \nthe pipeline is rejected.\n\n[[Page S8747]]\n\n  Not surprisingly, our Republican friends, always ready to fight for \nthe oil companies, have echoed these scare tactics.\n  What they don't tell you is that the 5,000 or 6,000 temporary \nconstruction jobs will disappear once the pipeline is built. Only a few \nhundred permanent jobs are needed to operate and maintain the pipeline.\n  And they also don't mention that the choice is not between jobs or no \njobs. They ignore the tens of thousands of permanent, safe American \njobs that could be created by investing in clean, renewable sources of \nenergy, which, unlike tar sands oil, don't pollute and will not be used \nup in a few short decades.\n  People can disagree about building the Keystone Pipeline, but there \nis more to this than the short-term jobs it would create. Jamming it \nthrough Congress on this bill in the waning hours of the session has a \nlot more to do with politics than jobs.\n  The Keystone provision in this payroll tax extension would force the \nPresident to approve or disapprove the pipeline within 60 days. Any \ndecision to grant a permit would be ``deemed,'' by Congress, to satisfy \nall the environmental requirements, even if it does not, and any \nmodification to the construction mitigation and reclamation plan \n``shall not'' require supplementation of the final environmental impact \nstatement. In other words, don't study the consequences or give the \npublic a chance to comment on the revised plan.\n  This is from Members of Congress who in the last election ran on a \nplatform of ``open'' government. Yet when it comes to helping Big Oil, \nit is a different story. They cut the time for making a decision from a \nyear to 60 days and short circuit the environmental review process. \nForget the science. Forget the public. Preempt the law. Ignore the \nrisk. The only thing that matters is pumping more oil.\n  Tar sands are a particularly dirty source of petroleum, from \nextraction to refinement. Anyone who is interested, regardless of which \nside of this debate they are on, should look at the photographs of the \ntar sands mines in the boreal forests of Alberta. What was once an \nextraordinarily beautiful landscape has been ravaged by heavy \nmachinery, vast ponds filled with polluted water and sludge, and a \nruined wasteland where the forests used to be.\n  We all know that the extraction of oil, minerals, and other natural \nresources harms the environment, but there are degrees of harm. \nExtracting heavy oil from tar sands is among the most energy-intensive \nand destructive.\n  Under the law, the State Department has the responsibility to approve \nor disapprove the pipeline because it crosses an international \nboundary. More than a year ago, I and 10 other Senators--Republicans \nand Democrats--sent the first of a series of letters to the State \nDepartment raising concerns about the proposed pipeline and the impact \nof tar sands oil on global warming.\n  Since then, concern about the pipeline has evolved into a heated \ncontroversy over the impact the pipeline will have on our Nation's \nenergy policy, our continuing dependence on fossil fuels, and the \nenvironment.\n  From the beginning, I had misgivings about the State Department's \nability to conduct a thorough, credible assessment of a project of this \ncomplexity that they were approaching with an attitude of \ninevitability. The State Department did not anticipate the strong \nreaction of Members of Congress of both parties, including several from \nMidwestern States that have been coping with multiple oilspills from \nthe original Keystone Pipeline--oilspills that have caused damage \ncosting hundreds of millions of dollars that company officials have \ntreated as inconsequential.\n  Concerns about the risks of this project have united not only those \nliving along the proposed route but people across the Nation, including \nin Vermont, as well as in Canada, who care about the environment and \nwho understand the need to wean our Nation from oil and other fossil \nfuels.\n  Every President since the 1970s has spoken of the need to reduce our \ndependence on oil and coal, but despite all the speeches, year after \nyear we are more dependent on these finite, polluting sources of energy \nthan ever before.\n  Today, energy companies are spending staggering amounts of money in \nsearch of new sources of oil in some of the most inhospitable places on \nEarth, where its extraction involves great risks to the workers \ninvolved, to the environment, and to precious sources of water for \ndrinking and irrigation.\n  No matter what we do today, later this week, or later this month, \nthis country will be dependent on fossil fuels for many years to come. \nBut while TransCanada and its supporters extol the virtues of the \nKeystone XL Pipeline, as the minority leader and others have done, \nsimply by reducing waste we could eliminate entirely the need for the \nenergy from the oil that would flow through the pipeline. It is one of \nthose inconvenient facts they would prefer to ignore.\n  I come from a State that shares a border with Canada. My wife's \nfamily is Canadian. I have a great fondness for that ``giant to the \nnorth.'' But this issue is not about U.S. relations with Canada. We are \ninseparable neighbors, friends, and allies. There are strong views \nabout this pipeline, pro and con, in both countries. As Americans, we \nhave to do what is right for our country's energy future, for the \nenvironment, for our citizens.\n  Some have argued that if this pipeline is not built, TransCanada will \nsimply build another pipeline to the coast of British Columbia and \nexport the oil to China. But there are significant obstacles and no \nindication that such an alternative route is a viable option.\n  Others maintain that the carbon emissions from extracting and \nrefining this oil would not appreciably exceed those from oil shipped \nby tanker from the Middle East, but they do not address the \nenvironmental harm and pollution caused by the strip mining and \nseparation process.\n  Then there is the jobs issue, which has been shamelessly exaggerated \nin a last-ditch attempt to win votes in a time of economic hardship.\n  Last month, in response to concerns about the crucial aquifer that \nthe pipeline would traverse in the Midwest, the White House announced \nthat the State Department would consider alternative routes through \nNebraska and that the President would make a decision in 2013. Now, \nRepublican defenders of the oil industry want to short circuit this \nprocess, whatever the risks.\n  Fossil fuels are finite, inefficient, and dirty. The cost we pay at \nthe gas pump bears no resemblance to the long-term environmental and \nhealth costs borne by society as a whole.\n  We cannot lessen our reliance on fossil fuels by continually ignoring \nit, nor can we do it by spending huge amounts of money, energy, and \nAmerican ingenuity to search the farthest reaches of the globe for \nevery last drop of oil, regardless of how dangerous or harmful to the \nenvironment.\n  This pipeline would perpetuate a costly dependence that has gotten \nworse year after year, for which we are all to blame. Keystone XL would \nonce again do nothing to address the problems associated with fossil \nfuels. It would virtually assure more oilspills, it would do nothing to \npromote conservation and reduce waste, and it would do nothing to spur \ninvestment in clean energy alternatives.\n  Most important, it would provide yet another excuse to once again \npostpone for another day the urgent, national security imperative of \ndeveloping a sustainable energy policy for this country. That is what \nthe decision about the Keystone XL tar sands oil pipeline has come to \nrepresent regardless of what route it takes.\n  Mr. President, sometimes a bad situation can be the beginning of \nsomething better. Once this bill is passed, President Obama will have \n60 days to decide if building the pipeline is in the national interest. \nHe should reject these strong-arm tactics by the other party. He should \nuse this blatantly political maneuver as an opportunity to inaugurate a \nnew energy policy that will finally end our dependency on foreign oil. \nIt is time to finally put the environment, and the health and energy \nsecurity of the American people, above the interests of the fossil fuel \nindustry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, once again, the Senate finds itself in an \nuntenable situation. We can approve the legislation before us, which is \ninadequate to the needs of our Nation, or\n\n[[Page S8748]]\n\nwe can reject this legislation and make matters even worse. I will vote \nto approve this legislation, but I will do so knowing that we have \nmissed yet another opportunity to do the right thing for the people we \nrepresent. Instead, we are doing some damage to important goals, in \norder to avoid doing even greater damage.\n  We are in this position because our colleagues across the aisle, and \ntheir Republican allies in the House of Representatives, refuse to make \neven the most basic of concessions to reality. The truth is, more than \n3 years after the beginning of a recession, too many Americans are \nstill desperately in need of assistance. Those who are working need us \nto help support economic growth so their jobs are more secure and their \nincomes can grow. Millions are still without work not because they \ndon't want it, but because the number of people seeking work is vastly \ngreater than the number of available jobs and they need us to help \nsupport economic growth so they can find work to support themselves and \ntheir families.\n  Yet what our colleagues have insisted upon is to present us with two \nchoices. The legislation before us would continue middle-class tax \nrelief, the only economic boosts Republicans have allowed us to even \nconsider, but pay for it in a deeply misguided manner because \nRepublicans refused to consider more equitable ways to offset its \ncosts. It would extend unemployment benefits, but in a way that leaves \nthousands of Michigan families facing a sudden loss of their benefits, \nbecause it effectively eliminates 20 weeks of the current 99-week \nmaximum benefit for Michigan and other States where, though \nunemployment remains high, it is beginning to fall. And these \nextensions would last for just 2 months.\n  As bad as that is, the alternative rejecting this legislation is even \nworse. Without passage, economists tell us that the loss of middle-\nclass tax relief could put our already slow economic recovery into even \ngreater doubt. Without passage, even more families, in Michigan and \nelsewhere, will lose the economic lifeline of unemployment benefits. \nMore than 26,000 Michigan families will lose their benefits under the \ninadequate provisions of this bill, but that number would grow to more \nthan 100,000 by Spring without passage of this legislation. Michigan \nresidents would lose eligibility for 73 weeks of emergency unemployment \ncompensation if we do not act today, instead of the 20 weeks we would \nlose if we pass this bill.\n  Mr. President, my State would suffer in other ways if this bill does \nnot pass. It extends the so-called doc fix that is important to health \ncare providers in Michigan and elsewhere. And this bill continues an \nadjustment to the Medicare Program that provides crucial aid to nearly \nhalf of all Michigan hospitals. This so-called section 508 fix is \ntechnical and complicated, but extending it is vitally important to \nMichigan hospitals. Without it, their ability to continue providing \ncare to Michigan's people would be hampered.\n  The method Republicans have demanded to pay for this legislation is \nalso badly misguided. It uses fees paid to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nto offset its costs. Those fees should be going to repair what we all, \non both sides of the aisle, acknowledge is a massive financial problem \nat those enterprises. If we increase these fees, the money should be \nused to help stabilize the value of Americans' homes by reforming these \nenterprises.\n  The very fact that we have had to find ways to pay for middle-class \ntax relief is a remarkable acknowledgement by Republicans, given that \nit has been an article of faith among many of our Republican colleagues \nthat tax cuts pay for themselves. Repeatedly, for decades, they have \npushed for massive tax cuts for the wealthy and sold them with the \npromise that they will pay for themselves. Now, when we face the \nexpiration of tax relief that overwhelmingly benefits middle-class \nfamilies, they tell us that this tax cut must be paid for. Hopefully \nthis inconsistency will not escape the notice of the American people.\n  It didn't have to be this way. Republicans had the chance to accept a \nfair alternative one that extended the payroll tax cut, unemployment \ninsurance and other important tax and Medicare provisions, and that did \nso in a way that provides what our constituents demand from us: a \nbalanced approach that asks all Americans to share in the sacrifices \nnecessary to address our challenges.\n  That approach would ask Americans making more than $1 million a year \nto pay slightly more in taxes. A solid majority of Americans see this \nas common sense: The wealthiest among us have done extraordinarily well \nin recent decades even as middle-class incomes have stagnated, and \nasking those fortunate few to contribute along with middle-class \nfamilies is only fair. Yet Republicans again rejected that equitable \noption out of hand. We will continue to press for it in the challenging \nyear that awaits us.\n  Over the last few months, Republicans have been willing to risk the \nfull faith and credit of the United States, the continued functioning \nof the government, tax relief for middle-income Americans, adequate \nfunding for our military, health care for our seniors, and an economic \nlifeline for the unemployed, all in an effort to protect the interests \nof the wealthiest, most fortunate Americans. None of these threats \nwould loom so large if Republicans would simply acknowledge what \nroughly two-thirds of our constituents now acknowledge: that the \nsolutions to our fiscal problems must include a balanced approach that \nasks the wealthiest Americans to sacrifice along with working families. \nToday, they have demonstrated that they have not yet received that \nmessage, and they have once again forced us to choose between the \nunacceptable and the catastrophic.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just a brief comment on Keystone. I was the \nfirst elected official to write a letter opposing that. I know how I \nfeel about this. I know how my friend, the Republican leader, feels \nabout it. I was responsible for putting it in this bill. That is how \nlegislation works.\n  I would also say we are thankful that we have worked together to make \nsure that 160 million people have not a tax increase but a continued \ntax break. I am also thankful that the lifeline for unemployed people \nis going to continue for at least 60 days.\n  I ask the Chair to report the legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/17/senate-section/article/S8748-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8748-S8753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MIDDLE CLASS TAX RELIEF AND JOB CREATION ACT OF 2011\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1466\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have an amendment to the title that is at \nthe desk, and I ask unanimous consent that it be agreed to.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1466) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       To amend the title so as to read:\n       A bill to extend the payroll tax holiday, unemployment \n     compensation, Medicare physician payment, provide for the \n     consideration of the Keystone XL pipleline, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I voted to prevent a tax increase on \nthe middle class and to continue jobless benefits for millions of \nAmericans and thousands of Rhode Islanders. Unfortunately, despite my \nand many of my colleagues' best efforts, this bill is deeply flawed. It \ndoesn't provide needed certainty to Americans or to our economy because \nit does not provide a year-long extension of the payroll tax cut and \njobless benefits, nor does it include needed reforms, like work \nsharing, which will help prevent layoffs in our still fragile economy. \nBy insisting that jobless benefits be paid for, we are undermining the \ncountercyclical nature of the program and blunting its purpose to \nstabilize our economy. But worst of all, it fails to address a \nprovision of the unemployment insurance law that is absolutely \nnecessary given our current employment crisis.\n  As a result, this bill effectively cuts 20 weeks of unemployment \nbenefits. This means Rhode Islanders who have exhausted their normal UI \nbenefits and extended--EUC08--benefits in February will not be eligible \nto receive the same help that was given to an unemployed person in the \nsame situation back in the middle of 2011.\n  There is no reason to cut back on jobless benefits now. Over 13 \nmillion Americans are out of work, and our Nation is still grappling \nwith the worst case of chronic long-term unemployment since the Great \nDepression. Unemployment benefits are a lifeline to millions of \nfamilies and are our most effective tool in battling economic decline. \nWithout these benefits unemployed Americans who are looking for a job \nwouldn't be able to pay for absolute necessities--their rent, mortgage, \ngroceries, or for transportation as they hit the streets looking for \nwork.\n  This reduction in coverage that my Republican colleagues have \ninsisted upon is deeply damaging to American households and the broad \neconomy. We should not be engaged in these short-term extensions of the \npayroll tax cut and jobless benefits--and then cut those jobless \nbenefits as we go along.\n  In addition to cutting jobless benefits that help a broad swath of \nAmericans, Republicans refuse to ask the wealthiest Americans to \ncontribute to offsetting these policies. The payroll tax and jobless \nbenefits could have been paid for by asking the wealthiest one-tenth of \n1 percent to share in the sacrifice that middle-class America has made, \nbut Republicans have voted time and again in favor of millionaire and \nbillionaires and against tax cuts for the middle class.\n  I will continue to fight for maintaining jobless benefits and \nextending the payroll tax cut through 2012. I will continue to oppose \nefforts that would cut benefits and that would pay for continuing \nbenefits by hurting the middle class.\n  As today's bill shows, though, my Republican colleagues are not \ninterested in helping middle-class Americans and instead insist on \ntacking on controversial environmental riders and including offsets \nthat hit the middle class.\n  Indeed, this bill includes a provision that would require the \nPresident to make a decision on the Keystone XL Pipeline within 60 \ndays. This timeframe would dramatically shorten the important \nenvironmental review of the project, which includes assessing its \npotential impacts on critical water resources in the Ogallala aquifer, \nas well as increased carbon pollution.\n  I have been working to support and urge serious steps to reduce our \ndependence on oil, such as increasing the fuel efficiency of our \nvehicles and developing advanced biofuels. Even if Canadian oil \ndisplaces the importation of oil from other countries, the price of oil \nis determined by the global market, and the best way to decrease our \nexposure to the rising price of oil is to decrease our demand.\n  In addition, since America has recently become a net exporter of \npetroleum products, I am concerned that the proposed pipeline would \nmerely allow big oil companies to import the oil from Canada, transport \nit by a pipeline--and with it, the risks of leaking into a critical \naquifer--down to Texas refineries, where it would be refined into \npetroleum products that, in part, would be exported to foreign markets.\n  It is for those reasons that I have opposed the proposed Keystone XL \nPipeline and urge the President to reject it.\n  As I have stated previously, I would have preferred to pay for this \nlegislation by asking the wealthiest one-tenth of 1 percent of \nAmericans to share in the sacrifices that all other Americans have made \nin working to right our economic ship. However, in the search for pay-\nfors, the House of Representatives added language that would increase \nthe guarantee-fees--g-fees--the government-sponsored enterprises charge \nover the next 10 years, diverting funds away from shoring up the GSEs \nto fund a benefit that is unrelated to our housing markets. If there\n\n[[Page S8753]]\n\nis any capacity to increase the g-fees, those resources should be \ndirected to our housing markets, which still remain too fragile.\n  I find it incredibly ironic that my Republican colleagues, many of \nwhom say they believe the mortgage securitization market should be \ncompletely privatized, have suggested an offset that uses a 10-year \nrevenue stream from the enterprises' business operations as a piggy \nbank for governmental purposes. This seems like inconsistent policy at \nbest.\n  This bill is deeply flawed, but I could not in good conscience vote \nagainst providing a tax cut to the middle class and providing \ndesperately needed relief to nearly 10,000 Rhode Islanders who would \nhave lost jobless benefits through the month of January.\n  I will not stop fighting for the middle class, to continue jobless \nbenefits and working to improve our economy and create jobs. I will \nwork tirelessly to continue the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits \nthrough the rest of the year and to fix this egregious reduction in \nbenefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/17/senate-section/article/S8753-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8753-S8759]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS AND RELATED AGENCIES \n              APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2012--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to consideration of the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 2055, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2055), making appropriations for military construction, the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2012, and for other \n     purposes, having met, have agreed that the House recede from \n     its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate and agree to \n     the same with an amendment and the Senate agree to the same. \n     Signed by a majority of the conferees on the part of both \n     Houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of Thursday, December 15, 2011.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 15 minutes of debate with 5 minutes each for the Senator from \nHawaii, Mr. Inouye; the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran; and the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the omnibus bill the Senate considers this \nmorning represents a victory for compromise, a victory for American \ntaxpayers, and a victory for the appropriations process.\n  The measure before us funds everything from our men and women in \nuniform to students who strive to improve their future through higher \neducation, from environmental protection to protecting our children \nfrom harmful products, and from homeland security to the Securities and \nExchange Commission.\n  With the exception of the Department of Defense, all these agencies \nhave been running on a continuing resolution for well over a year. Mr. \nPresident, this must stop because it is no way to run a government, \nparticularly one that must learn to do more with less. How can an \nagency be more efficient when it is operating under budget plans that \nwere developed 2 or even 3 years ago?\n  Last year, the Congress enacted only one appropriations measure--the \nDefense bill. This year, we have passed a minibus containing three \nbills, and we are now considering the final package incorporating the \nnine remaining bills. While it is true we again fall short of regular \norder, it is also true, if the Senate passes this measure and the \nPresident signs it into law, we will have succeeded in enacting each of \nour bills prior to the end of the calendar year for the first time \nsince 2009.\n  I would note for my colleagues that in the Senate, the Appropriations \nCommittee reported 11 bills, 9 of them with overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport, and by that I mean 30 to 0 or 29 to 1. We moved four of our \nbills across the Senate floor with an opportunity for every Senator to \nprovide amendments. We accomplish all of this at a time when \npartisanship is high and the desire by some to delay even the most \ninnocuous of bills has made it difficult to get any measure to the \nPresident.\n  As chairman of the Defense Subcommittee, I would like to take a few \nminutes to discuss this portion of the bill.\n  The Omnibus appropriations bill includes $633.3 billion for the \nDepartment of Defense. This amount includes a $20.8 billion reduction \nfrom the President's request for the base defense budget and a \nreduction of $2.5 billion from the overseas contingency operations \nrequest.\n  Although these substantial reductions in the defense budget mean many \ntough decisions had to be made, I wish to assure my colleagues that all \nrecommendations in the Defense bill were made in a fully bipartisan, \nbicameral manner.\n  Most importantly, let me assure my colleagues this agreement takes \ncare of our men and women in uniform and their families, fully supports \nmilitary readiness, protects the forces, and maintains our \ntechnological edge. It complies with the earmark moratorium and \ncontains no congressionally directed spending items.\n  At the same time, it reins in defense spending and takes important \nsteps to improve the Department's fiscal accountability. The conference \nagreement recommends 775 reductions to individual programs primarily \ndue to program terminations or delays or changes to policies of \nprograms since the submission of the budget 10 months ago.\n  As the chairman of the full committee, I am proud of the work done on \nthese nine bills by the Appropriations Committee, its members, and its \nstaff, each of whom have worked diligently late into the night for many \nmonths to arrive to this point. All of the subcommittee chairmen and \nranking members should be recognized for their leadership and \nachievement in completing these nine remaining bills.\n  I also wish to recognize the dedicated staff on both sides of the \naisle for their months of effort and their commitment to completing \ntheir individual bills.\n  Mr. President, this is a strong, bipartisan bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote yes and send it to the \nPresident for his signature.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me say I am pleased to join the \nchairman of the committee, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, in \nurging approval of the Omnibus appropriations bill as well as the bill \nto provide funds for disaster relief. These bills fully comply with the \nrequirements of the Budget Control Act. The process for reviewing \nrequests for provisions in this bill were held in open public hearings. \nSenators testified before our committee. Others from around the country \ncame to Washington to express their views.\n  Together with appropriations bills that have already been enacted, \nthe omnibus brings appropriations for the basic operations of our \ngovernment to $1.043 trillion. The disaster bill provides an additional \n$8 billion for disaster relief in response to damages incurred from \nfloods, tornadoes, and hurricanes that have plagued much of the country \nduring the spring and summer months. These funds are within the limits \nestablished in the Budget Control Act, specifically for disaster \nrelief. Total discretionary spending carried in all of the fiscal year \n2012 appropriations bills will be $31 billion below last year's level.\n  I would have to say our committee opened its hearing rooms to those \nwho wanted to express views on the funding levels of all of the \nprograms that were important throughout our Federal budget process. \nThere are some dramatic reductions in spending, such as the Independent \nPayment Advisory Board and the co-op program created in the health care \nbill. We zeroed out funding for some of the energy credit subsidy \nprovisions of this bill. That was hard to do, but savings were needed \nand the committee responded to those needs.\n  The bill eliminates 22 programs in the Labor-HHS chapter for a \nsavings of over $\\1/4\\ billion. But we don't hear about that. People \ndon't brag about reducing funding. But this committee did\n\n[[Page S8754]]\n\nthat because it was responsible, in our judgment, to do it.\n  I am very pleased to have had the honor of working closely with the \nchairman of the committee, one of the finest Members of this Senate, \nand we urge the approval of this legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from Arizona speaks, I ask \nunanimous consent that the next three votes in order be 10 minutes in \nduration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to yield 2 minutes of my 5 \nminutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Here we are again, a bill that is 1,221 pages long that not one \nMember of this body has read. These 1,221 pages represent $915 billion \nin taxpayer money. Yet here we are with not one amendment. We do, \nhowever, have 15 minutes of debate in which to consider a document that \nis 1,221 pages long, representing $915 billion of taxpayer money, which \nis filled with unauthorized, unrequested money.\n  Now, I haven't had a chance, like the rest of my colleagues, to look \nat all of this 1,200-page bill, but we have looked at the defense \nsection. There is $3.5 billion of unrequested, unauthorized funding by \nthe authorizing committee--projects such as this one for Guam.\n  Here are a couple of my favorites. You thought the bridge to nowhere \nwas bad? Well, there are 53 civilian schoolbuses and 53 repair kits for \n$10.7 million and $12.7 million for a cultural artifacts repository. \nThat is in the name of defense. That is in the name of defense--\nschoolbuses and a cultural artifact repository.\n  Here is $100 million for the Next Generation Bomber, which the Air \nForce says they do not want and they do not need. How about this \ncockamamie outfit--the Combat Dragon, which will be crop dusters \nequipped with weapons. Or the C-17s--$225 million additional for C-17s \nthat long ago the military said they did not need.\n  There is $3.5 billion just in the DOD provisions alone. It is \noutrageous. It is outrageous.\n  I have amendments associated with this bill that will save the \ntaxpayers billions of dollars. But, never mind, because we are going to \ngo home for Christmas.\n  Well, let me tell you, I am going home to a State where they do not \nhave enough in the food banks to take care of the homeless this year. I \nam going home to a State where half of the homes are underwater. Yet \nwhat have we done? We have just wasted billions and billions and \nbillions of taxpayer money on projects that are unneeded, unwanted, and \nunrequested.\n  This system is broken. This system is broken. We should have taken up \nthese bills one by one, with amendments, with debate and discussion. I \nwant to tell the majority leader and the Republican leader that next \nyear, we will have a plan, a group of us, to say we must do that.\n  We owe it to the taxpayers of America.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have a question for my colleagues. Are we proud of this \nprocess? Have we fulfilled the responsibility to the citizens of this \ncountry with this process? Nobody can answer yes to that. And yet \nnothing seems to change.\n  You know, $3.5 billion worth of phony earmarks totally puts an \nearmark ban on its head. The idea that parochialism trumps our Nation's \nvital interests puts our responsibility and our oath on its head.\n  I know the hearts of everybody here. They are great. The intentions \nare great. With this bill, we have failed America. We failed America in \nthe process, we failed America in our oath. This next year is going to \nbe much more difficult than anybody can anticipate. At a time when we \nare facing our national survival, business as usual occurs. That is a \nreflection of lousy leadership by all of us, including me. It means I \ndidn't make my case big enough about what the priorities should be in \nour country.\n  It is a great time for reflection. We are going to go home. We are \ngoing to pass this bill that is going to be far less than what this \ncountry needs in terms of its integrity and its actions. Hopefully, we \nwill think and return with a renewed spirit to fix the ship of state \nand do what is in the best interest of the Nation, not what is in the \nbest interest of our parochial political careers.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              boiler mact\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I would like to thank the senior Senator \nfrom Alaska and the senior Senator from Tennessee for joining me to \ndiscuss an issue of great concern to manufacturers across the country, \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's Boiler MACT regulations. I am \npleased to serve with both Senators on the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee on which the Senator from Alaska serves as the Ranking \nMember.\n  It has been our shared goal to ensure that rules crafted by the EPA \nwith regard to industrial boilers be achievable, affordable, and \nprotective of public health and the environment while not costing \nthousands of jobs that we can ill-afford to lose. Unfortunately, EPA \ndid not begin its rulemaking with these goals in mind.\n  To provide EPA with the time the agency itself said it needed to \nrewrite the rules to better serve the public interest, I introduced the \nEPA Regulatory Relief Act earlier this year, which now has the support \nof 41 of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. A nearly identical \nbill passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support this \nfall.\n  With the reconsideration process, EPA has taken steps to respond to \nsome of the concerns raised by U.S. manufacturers. EPA's re-proposed \nrules, however, still do not address the serious and real concerns of \nthe mills that will be most directly affected by these regulations. \nLegislative action is still needed to ensure achievable rules, to allow \nadequate compliance time, and to reduce the risk to business posed by \npending litigation.\n  For these reasons, I was very troubled when the statement of the \nmanagers for Division E of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012 \nincluded the following:\n\n       Boiler MACT.--The conferees are encouraged by the outcome \n     of EPA's reconsideration of the Boiler MACT rule and offer no \n     directives regarding Boiler MACT standards. The proposed rule \n     addresses substantive concerns by including additional \n     flexibility with respect to compliance costs, and a biomass \n     exemption.\n\n  Could the Senator from Alaska clarify that this language in no way is \nan endorsement by the conferees of any particular rulemaking concerning \nthe Boiler MACT issue?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. As a cosponsor of S. 1392, the EPA Regulatory Reform \nAct, I know how important this issue is to my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle. The Senator is correct that this language is not intended \nby the conferees to convey an endorsement of any EPA Boiler MACT \nrulemaking proposal.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the senior Senator from Alaska for clarifying \nthe intent of this language. I remain committed to working with my \nSenate colleagues and the EPA to help ensure that the Boiler MACT rules \nare crafted to protect public health without harming the forest \nproducts industry, which is the lifeblood of many small, rural \ncommunities. Would my friend the senior Senator from Tennessee, who is \nalso an original co-sponsor of the Boiler MACT legislation, like to \naddress this disappointing conference language?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. This issue is of particular importance to me as well. \nI strongly object to the language included in the Interior \nAppropriations bill regarding Boiler MACT. The Boiler MACT is an \nunworkable regulation that will reduce pollutants like mercury, which \nis good policy, but forces those reductions in a way that is not \nrealistic for companies to comply. This regulation could result in the \nloss of 340,000 jobs nationwide and cost Tennessee companies $530 \nmillion. My support for the Omnibus bill does not change my position on \nthis issue, and I will continue to push for the passage of strong \nbipartisan legislation that will overturn the terrible Boiler MACT \nregulation and find a better way to accomplish the pollution reductions \nthat are\n\n[[Page S8755]]\n\nneeded. I thank Senator Collins for her leadership on this issue and I \nalso appreciate the Senator from Alaska clarifying the intent of this \nlanguage.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. chairman, as Chairman of the Department of State and \nForeign Operations Subcommittee, I want to speak briefly about the \nagreement that I and the ranking member, Senator Lindsey Graham, have \nreached with the House and that is reflected in division I of this \nOmnibus bill.\n  I want to thank Senator Graham, along with House Subcommittee chair \nKay Granger and ranking member Nita Lowey and their staffs, for working \nin such a bipartisan way to resolve our many differences. It is a good \nexample of how a divided Congress can deal with controversial issues \nand produce an outcome that protects a broad range of interests.\n  The Department of State and Foreign Operations conference agreement \nis a compromise. It is neither a Democratic nor Republican bill. It \nwill not make anyone completely happy. But while it does not include \neverything that I or Senator Graham wanted, it does a good job of \naddressing the key national security needs of the country.\n  This is a must-pass bill. The alternative is another year of a \ncontinuing resolution, which would force drastic cuts in funding for \nprograms about which Republicans and Democrats feel strongly.\n  This conference agreement does many things. It supports the Nation's \ncounterterrorism efforts in South Asia, the Horn of Africa, and East \nAsia; responds to turbulent events in the Middle East and north Africa \nand threats on the Mexican border; combats transnational crime, piracy \nof intellectual property, and the denial of fundamental freedoms; \npromotes access for U.S. companies to foreign markets; operates and \nsecures our embassies and consulates that serve millions of Americans \ntraveling, working, and studying overseas; preserves U.S. influence in \nkey international organizations and alliances; supports economic \ndevelopment, governance, and the rule of law in Africa, Latin America, \nand Asia; and responds to a massive famine in Somalia, floods in El \nSalvador, and other humanitarian disasters.\n  We do this and much more with a base budget allocation that is $8.7 \nbillion below the President's request and a combined base and overseas \ncontingency operations total that is $6.1 billion below the President's \nrequest.\n  These are not Democratic or Republican issues. The funds in this \nconference agreement will determine whether the United States remains \nthe global leader it has been since the Second World War.\n  Just as past generations rallied to meet the formidable challenges of \nthe Great Depression, the Nazis, and the Cold War, we will bear \nresponsibility if we fail to meet the challenges of today.\n  It is no wonder that other countries--our allies and our \ncompetitors--are spending more each year to project their influence \naround the world and to compete in the global marketplace.\n  Our leadership is being challenged unlike at any time since the Cold \nWar. In Latin America, which is a larger market for U.S. exports than \nany other region except the European Union, our share is shrinking \nwhile China's is growing. It is the same story everywhere.\n  There is simply no substitute for U.S. global leadership. The world \nis changing profoundly, and we cannot afford to retrench or succumb to \nisolationism.\n  The funding in this conference agreement enables us to engage with \nour allies and deter our adversaries and competitors. It is similar to \nwhat was reported by the Appropriations Committee on a bipartisan vote \nof 28 to 2. For those who are focused on reducing Federal spending, it \ncuts base spending by $6 billion below the fiscal year 2011 continuing \nresolution. It freezes spending or scales back many Department of State \nand U.S. Agency for International Development operations and programs \nand will force reductions in planned expenditures.\n  To the extent that there are funding increases in this bill, they are \nprimarily due to the transition from military to civilian operations in \nIraq which will mean billions of dollars in savings to American \ntaxpayers, and to meet pledges to the international financial \ninstitutions.\n  I doubt there is a single Member of Congress who does not care if the \nUnited States becomes a second-or third-rate power. As a Vermonter, I \nknow the people of my State want the United States to live up to its \nideals, to set an example for the rest of the world. We expect the \nUnited States to lead, to build alliances, to help American companies \ncompete successfully, and to protect the interests and security of its \ncitizens.\n  Yet there are unmistakable signs that our global influence is already \nwaning. It is not preordained that the United States will remain the \nworld's dominant power. As former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice \nsaid, ``If we don't lead, somebody else will.''\n  We need to stop acting like these investments do not matter; that the \nState Department is not important; that we do not need the United \nNations; that what happens in Brazil, Russia, the Philippines, Somalia, \nor other countries does not matter; and that global threats to the \nenvironment, public health, and safety will somehow be solved by \nothers.\n  This conference agreement balances our priorities. Again, funding for \nthese programs was requested by Republicans and Democrats.\n  This country is at a crossroads. We can retreat from the world, as \nsome in the other body seem to want while China and our other \ncompetitors continue to expand their influence, or we can remain a \nleader. The conference agreement adopts the latter course, and Members \non both sides of the aisle deserve credit for that.\n  Mr. President, the funding in this bill is strongly supported by the \nDepartment of Defense. Along with the U.S. military, it is the best \nform of insurance the American people have.\n  Finally, I want to thank Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman Cochran, \nas well as the majority and minority leaders for their support in \ncompleting this omnibus bill.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this omnibus appropriations bill funds \nthe Federal Government through September 30, 2012, at the level of \nspending agreed to this past August in the Budget Control Act, which \nreduces overall spending by $2.1 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  If Congress continues to follow the terms of the Budget Control Act, \ndiscretionary spending--which is 39 percent of the Federal budget--will \nincrease at about the rate of inflation over the next nine years.\n  Unfortunately, mandatory entitlement spending--which is 55 percent of \nthe Federal budget--is out of control and is growing at the rate of 3 \nto 4 times inflation over the next 9 years according to the Bipartisan \nPolicy Center.\n  There are some good reasons to support this spending bill.\n  One good reason to support the bill is to support House Republicans. \nNow that they are in the majority, they are changing the priorities of \nthe spending bills in important places, and that is a good start at \nreducing spending and changing the priorities of the government.\n  Another good reason is that the bill is consistent with the Budget \nControl Act. The Omnibus brings total discretionary spending to $1.043 \ntrillion, and it brings total disaster spending to $10.4 billion. Both \nof those figures are consistent with the Budget Control Act and are a \ngood first step toward getting discretionary spending under control \nover the next decade.\n  The bill also supports several important national priorities: It \nprovides an additional $5.1 billion for defense and a $338 million \nincrease for nuclear weapons modernization; increases border security; \nfully funds veterans' healthcare; and shows Congress can lead by \nexample by cutting our own budget by 5.2 percent.\n  The bill denies the administration carte blanche on running the \ngovernment and allows Congress to set priorities as it should in our \nconstitutional system. The omnibus cuts the Environmental Protection \nAgency's budget by $233 million, cuts the National Labor Relations \nBoard's budget by $4 million, and supports the development of Small \nModular Reactors.\n  This year there have been 12 disasters that caused more than $1 \nbillion in damage--the highest on record. Families are struggling to \nrecover from historic tornado outbreaks, flooding, wildfires, and other \nnatural disasters in virtually every part of the country.\n\n[[Page S8756]]\n\n  The omnibus brings total disaster spending for fiscal year 2012 to \n$10.4 billion. The Budget Control Act allows Congress to spend up to an \nadditional $11.3 billion in fiscal year 2012 for disasters. Although \nthis means there is only $900 million left to address any additional \ndisasters in fiscal year 2012, it shows that Congress is starting to \ntake the issue of spending and debt seriously by living within an \nagreed upon framework for total spending.\n  Even though the Budget Control Act does not require disaster spending \nto be offset--some argue that it should be--the Budget Control Act \nensures disaster spending is really for disasters and keeps Congress \nfrom spending more than the historical average. The House has proposed \nto offset this spending with a 1.83 percent across-the-board cut to all \ndiscretionary spending, excluding defense programs, military \nconstruction projects and veterans funding.\n  I do not believe that an across-the-board cut is a wise way to reduce \nspending. Congress should identify wasteful spending, like the credit \nloan subsidies we eliminated in the Energy and Water Appropriations \nbill, and find specific ways to cut spending and make government more \neffective.\n  Any bill of this size will include things we don't support. We do not \ndo enough to reduce duplicative programs, and many programs that should \nbe eliminated are still funded.\n  But there is one provision in the manager's report that I really want \nto take exception to.\n  I strongly object to the language included in the Interior \nAppropriations bill regarding Boiler MACT. The Boiler MACT is a \nregulation that will reduce pollutants like mercury, which is a good \ngoal, but forces reductions in a way that is not realistic for \ncompanies to comply. This unworkable regulation could result in the \nloss of 340,000 jobs nationwide and cost Tennessee companies $530 \nmillion.\n  My support for the omnibus bill does not change my position on this \nissue, and I will continue to push for the passage of strong bipartisan \nlegislation that will overturn the terrible Boiler MACT regulation and \nfind a better way to accomplish the pollution reductions that are \nneeded.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to comment on two specific issues \nregarding the conference report to H.R. 2055, the omnibus spending \nmeasure before us.\n  First, I am pleased that the conference report includes $22 million \nfor the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, or FRIB, at Michigan State \nUniversity. While this is less than the amount in the administration's \nbudget request, it is a clear endorsement by Congress to move forward \nwith this facility.\n  FRIB is critical to maintaining America's worldwide preeminence in \nnuclear physics and a major component of Michigan's economic future. \nMSU has solid and well-known expertise in the field of rare isotopes \nand nuclear physics. It has the largest nuclear physics faculty in the \nNation and a nuclear physics graduate program ranked No. 1 in the \ncountry. Those were some of the reasons it was selected by the \nDepartment of Energy for design, construction, and operation of FRIB \nafter an extensive competition over a multiyear period.\n  I am encouraged that particularly in these difficult budget times the \nCongress has endorsed the importance of this facility. Second, I would \npoint to another critical component of my State's economic future, the \nGreat Lakes.\n  I am disappointed that Great Lakes Restoration Initiative funding has \nbeen reduced from the originally planned funding levels. I am relieved, \nhowever, that $300 million is included in the conference report, $50 \nmillion more than the amount in the House bill.\n  The conference report includes two important provisions related to \nAsian carp and other invasive species that present significant threats \nto the Great Lakes. The conference report includes a provision I have \nrequested authorizing the Army Corps of Engineers to implement \nemergency measures to prevent Asian carp and other invasive species \nfrom entering the Great Lakes. Also welcome is an increase of about $5 \nmillion in funding to operate electric dispersal barriers designed to \nprevent these fish from entering the Great Lakes, bringing funding for \nthe barriers to $23.6 million. The conference report also includes \nabout $3 million to continue study of possible separation of the Great \nLakes from the Mississippi River watershed, which would significantly \nreduce risk to the Great Lakes from Asian carp. I will continue to work \nwith colleagues to urge the Army Corps to accelerate this study.\n  I am disappointed that projects enabling Great Lakes harbor dredging \ncontinue to receive reduced funding. The conference report acknowledges \nthat funding levels are inadequate to meet existing needs. I welcome \nthe conferees' decision to include an additional $173 million in \nfunding for navigation projects nationwide, and I will work to ensure \nthat the Great Lakes, which face a substantial backlog of dredging and \nother operations and maintenance needs, receive a share of this funding \nconsistent with the high level of need.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of both the omnibus \nappropriations bill and the bill to provide funds for disaster relief. \nThey have been approved by the other body by overwhelming, bipartisan \nvotes. I urge the Senate to approve these bills.\n  They fully comply with the requirements of the Budget Control Act. \nTogether with appropriations bills already enacted, the omnibus brings \nappropriations for the basic operations of government to the $1.043 \ntrillion level established in the Act. The disaster bill provides an \nadditional $8 billion for disaster relief in response to the floods, \ntornados and hurricanes that plagued much of the country during the \nspring and summer months. These funds are within the limits established \nin the BCA specifically for disaster relief. Total discretionary \nspending carried in all of the fiscal year 2012 appropriations bills \nwill be $31 billion below last year's level.\n  Within the omnibus there are many adjustments in funding levels for \nindividual programs. The bill increases the base budget for the \nDepartment of Defense by $5 billion. It provides increases for border \nsecurity, nuclear weapons modernization, the National Institutes of \nHealth, and veterans medical care. The bill maintains the maximum Pell \ngrant award at its current level, but pays for that with a series of \nneeded reforms.\n  The bill reduces funding for the National Labor Relations Board, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, FEMA grants, and the Election \nAssistance Commission. It cuts the Independent Payment Advisory Board \nand the co-op program created in the health care bill. It zeroes out \nfunding for energy credit subsidies. It eliminates 22 programs in the \nLabor-HHS chapter for a savings of a quarter of a billion dollars.\n  This conference report also carries a number of policy provisions \nthat are important to members on my side of the aisle. These include \nlimitations on funding for needle exchange programs and certain \nDepartment of Labor regulations. There is language to maintain a \nbalanced permitting process for grazing on Federal lands, construction \nof logging roads, and domestic oil and gas production.\n  I sincerely wish that it were not necessary to act on an omnibus \nbill. I prefer that all Members have the opportunity to consider, \namend, and vote on appropriations bills individually.\n  The Appropriations Committee has consistently produced bills in a \ntimely manner for consideration in the Senate and in the House, but we \nare sometimes unable to advance bills to the floor due to circumstances \nbeyond our control. This year, our efforts were complicated greatly by \nthe absence of a budget resolution and a protracted, summer-long battle \nover the debt ceiling bill.\n  Many members on my side of the aisle have decried the fact that it \nhas been nearly 1,000 days since the Senate last approved a budget \nresolution. That criticism is absolutely valid. It is deplorable that \nat a time of fiscal crisis we have not adopted a comprehensive budget \nin so long.\n  What we do have, however, is a budget for discretionary spending that \nwas laid out in the Budget Control Act. That Act included caps that \nlock in recent cuts in discretionary spending and hold future \ndiscretionary growth below the rate of inflation.\n  The Appropriations Committee did not write the Budget Control Act. \nSome members of our committee voted\n\n[[Page S8757]]\n\nfor it, some against. But 74 members of the Senate did vote for it, \nincluding a majority of members on both sides of the aisle. That is \nmore votes than I can recall any budget resolution ever receiving.\n  So now it is time to implement the Budget Control Act through the \nenactment of the remaining fiscal year 2012 appropriations bills. A \nbipartisan, bicameral agreement has been reached. There is no money to \nbe saved by resorting to a year-long Continuing Resolution. It would be \nan omnibus bill itself, and would result in overspending in some areas \nand underinvestment in others.\n  I am pleased to have worked with Chairman Inouye, our committee \nmembers, and the conferees in the other body to negotiate this \nlegislation.\n  The Senate did not win every argument with the other body. But this \nconference report is a fair compromise with many positive features, and \nit is consistent with the guidance in the Budget Control Act. I hope \nthat it will be a stepping stone toward the more timely and measured \nconsideration of appropriations bills in the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference report and the \ndisaster relief bill.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, as chairman of the Interior, Environment, \nand Related Agencies Subcommittee, I would like to take a few moments \nto highlight some of the provisions of the Interior division of the \nConsolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2012.\n  The subcommittee's conference allocation totaled $29.175 billion. \nAlthough the Interior Subcommittee received a fair allocation, that \nnumber nevertheless represents a real cut of approximately 4 percent \nbelow the commensurate 2011 funding level. Despite the size of the cut, \noverall we were still able to fund critically needed infrastructure \nthat will provide jobs for thousands of Americans in every State in our \nNation.\n  Let me start with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. The \nconference report contains $8.5 billion in new budget authority. That \nis a reduction of approximately 3.5 percent below the equivalent 2011 \nlevel, but still a significant investment in our scientific research \ncapabilities, our environmental programs, and critically needed water \nand sewer infrastructure.\n  Included in the funding for EPA is $1.4 billion for the Clean Water \nState Revolving Fund and $919 million for the Drinking Water State \nRevolving Fund. Combined, this is nearly $800 million more than was \ninitially provided by the House. The investments we are making in the \nclean water fund will lead to the start of approximately 473 new \nwastewater projects nationwide and will put more than 81,000 Americans \nto work when combined with State matching funds. In addition, the \nfunding provided for the drinking water fund translates into 353 new \ndrinking water projects nationwide and more than 50,000 jobs all across \nthe country when combined with State matching funds.\n  This is a tremendous economic boost for every State in the Nation and \none that I am pleased that we could deliver. In addition to the \nfunding, we have ensured that Davis-Bacon wage protections will be \npermanently applied to the use of these funds.\n  No less important than the EPA are the land management agencies that \naccount for the majority of the Interior bill. The conference report \nprovides $5.9 billion for basic operational expenses for the National \nPark Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Forest Service, and \nthe Bureau of Land Management. That amount is virtually identical to \nthe 2011 enacted level and ensures that each of those agencies will be \nable to continue to operate and maintain their facilities as the \nAmerican people expect.\n  The conference agreement includes $197.5 million for the new Bureau \nof Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Included in this amount is an \nadditional $62 million for offshore oil and gas inspections that will \nbe available from inspection fees assessed to the industry, which is \nappropriate given the tremendous profits generated by the industry.\n  The conference report also provides $322 million for the protection \nof land and other environmentally sensitive areas through the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund. This represents an increase of 7 percent over \nthe current enacted level.\n  For Native Americans, the bill provides $6.8 billion to help improve \nthe quality and accessibility of education, health care, and law \nenforcement programs for some of this Nation's most vulnerable \npopulations. Included in that amount is $3.8 billion for Indian health \nservices, an increase of more than 5 percent over last year. These \nfunds will allow those in Indian Country to receive the necessary care \nthey deserve and will go a long way toward stemming the crisis in \nhealth care.\n  The conference report provides more than $1.3 billion for our \ncultural and arts agencies, including $146 million for each of the \nNational Endowment for the Arts and Humanities; $811 million for the \nSmithsonian Institution, including funding to begin construction of the \nAfrican-American History and Culture Museum; and $36 million for the \nKennedy Center.\n  All in all, this bill represents sound investments in the scientific, \nnatural, and cultural resources that come under the jurisdiction of \nthis subcommittee. Given resources at hand, not everyone will be \nsatisfied, but I am confident that we have made wise funding decisions \nthat will maximize our limited dollars.\n  It is also important to note what is not included in the conference \nreport.\n  It is no secret that the Interior and Environment appropriations bill \nattracted more than its fair share of legislative riders that were \ndesigned to prohibit the EPA, and in some cases the Department of the \nInterior, from undertaking their responsibilities to protect public \nhealth and our natural resources. The bill that was considered by the \nHouse this summer was replete with riders that do not belong in an \nappropriations measure. This bill has eliminated or modified these \nlegislative proposals so that agencies can continue to function \neffectively.\n  Finally, I wish to thank the subcommittee's ranking member, Senator \nMurkowski, for all the assistance she provided throughout our \nconference negotiations with the House. She has provided invaluable \nassistance to me this year because of her unique insights into the \nissues that are central to this bill. I sincerely appreciate having had \nthe benefit of her thoughts. I also want to commend and thank the staff \nof the Interior Subcommittee--Peter Kiefhaber, Virginia James, Rachael \nTaylor, and Ryan Hunt of the majority staff and Leif Fonnesbeck of the \nminority staff--for their work, service, and sacrifice.\n  I also want to comment on a few items in the other divisions of this \nconference report. My colleagues who led the negotiations on these \nparts of the bill also faced enormous challenges in reaching agreement \nwith the House, and I commend them for their efforts under difficult \ncircumstances.\n  With respect to Labor, Health and Human Services, HHS, and Education, \nI am pleased that the conference report maintains the maximum Pell \ngrant at $5,550 and continues funding the campus-based aid programs at \nlast year's levels. Absent this Federal student aid, millions of \nAmericans would not be able to afford college. Unfortunately, in order \nto maintain the maximum grant, tough sacrifices were made. The \nconference report rolls back provisions that I fought for to make the \nfinancial aid process easier and more substantial for families with \nmodest incomes. Among other things, the conference report lowers the \nannual income threshold to automatically qualify for the maximum grant \nfrom $30,000 to $23,000. While I believe it is important to maintain \nsupport for the maximum Pell grant, I am troubled by the hurdles being \nerected to qualify for this assistance.\n  I am pleased that the conference agreement includes $28.7 million for \nliteracy and school library programs. I want to thank Chairman Harkin, \nVice Chairman Cochran, as well as Senators Grassley, Stabenow, Wicker, \nand Snowe, who have worked with me to maintain Federal investments in \nthese programs because they recognize that literacy remains at the core \nof academic achievement for all children and is a strong indicator for \nlong-term success and opportunity. The conference report also provides \n$3.48 billion for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \nLIHEAP. While that level is\n\n[[Page S8758]]\n\n$900 million more than the President's request, it nonetheless \nrepresents a $1.2 billion or 25-percent cut for the main Federal \nprogram that assists low-income households with their energy bills.\n  Given the high price of energy, dropping winter temperatures, and the \ntough economy, I hope that we can revisit this issue. To that end, I \nhave been joined by Senators Snowe and Sanders and other colleagues in \nintroducing the LIHEAP Protection Act, which would maintain level \nfunding for the LIHEAP at last year's level of $4.7 billion. We are \nurging leadership to bring up this bill soon so Congress can take \nprompt action to fully restore this funding.\n  Finally, the Labor, HHS, and Education division of the conference \nreport includes nearly $560 million, a $34 million increase, for States \nto purchase immunizations for the uninsured and underinsured. I \nstrongly support this wise investment since every dollar invested in \nthe seven recommended pediatric vaccines saves $16.50 in direct and \nindirect health care costs.\n  Under the Energy and Water division, I am pleased that the bill \nincreases the funding for the Army Corp's Continuing Authorities \nProgram from the levels provided by the Senate and the House. I want to \nthank and commend Chairman Feinstein for working to boost the Section \n205 flood control program from $5 million to more than $18.7 million.\n  As with LIHEAP, the Weatherization Assistance Program, WAP, which \nhelps low-income families improve the energy efficiency of their homes \nand saves each participant an estimated $437 annually in energy costs, \nexperienced a significant reduction from the fiscal year 2011 level, \ndropping 61 percent from $174 million to $68 million. This is the \nlowest funding level since 1978, the year after the program's inception \nin 1977, and I hope that next year we can begin to restore this \nfunding.\n  The Financial Services and General Government division carries \nfunding for the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, and other \nfinancial regulators. I know that Chairman Durbin shares my concern and \nfrustration over the efforts of House Republicans to deprive these \nregulators of the authority and funding to oversee financial markets.\n  Regrettably, the conference report cuts SEC funding by $86 million \nfrom the administration's request and the Senate-passed appropriations \nbill. In addition, the conference report rescinds $25 million from an \nSEC reserve fund that Senator Shelby and I created outside of the \nappropriations process in order to ensure that the SEC would always \nhave access to the funds it needs for technology and long-term funding \nneeds. These cuts were made despite the fact that the SEC's budget is \ncompletely paid for by fees it collects on the securities industry and \nis off-budget. In other words, decreasing the SEC's funding has no \neffect on our budget deficit; it only serves to hamstring the SEC and \nto slow implementation of the Wall Street Reform Act.\n  I do want to acknowledge the fact that while the conference report \ndoes not add resources to what was provided under the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission, CFTC, under the Agriculture Appropriations Act, it \ndoes grant CFTC limit transfer authority so that it will not have to \nlay off personnel. This is not enough to make the CFTC the cop on the \nbeat we need it to be, but it is a critical change.\n  As the months pass and the financial crisis of 2008 seems further \naway, we should not and cannot forget that the failure to effectively \nregulate the financial sector came at tremendous cost to the average \nAmerican. We must remind ourselves of why we passed the Wall Street \nReform Act, and why it needs to be robustly funded, so that we never \nhave to endure such staggering costs again.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the conference report we are voting on \nis far from perfect, but recognizing the limited resources available \nand the challenge of negotiating with the House, it is a reasonable \nagreement.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of H.R. 2055, the Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, 2012, and H.R. 3672, the Disaster Relief \nAppropriations Act, 2012.\n  H.R. 2055 includes the conference report to accompany Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations \nAct, 2012, as well as legislation for the eight remaining \nappropriations bills. H.R. 3672 provides disaster relief funding and \nadditional program integrity funding.\n  H.R. 2055 is divided into nine divisions, one for each of the \nappropriations bills it contains. Each division will be considered \nseparately for budget enforcement purposes.\n  Each of the divisions of H.R. 2055 is within its respective \nsubcommittee's allocation for budget authority and outlays. The bill is \nwithin security and nonsecurity budget authority limits established by \nthe Budget Control Act.\n  In addition to regular funding, H.R. 2055 includes $126.5 billion \nthat has been designated as being for Overseas Contingency Operations. \nH.R. 3672 includes $8.1 billion in funding designated as being for \ndisaster relief and $483 million in additional program integrity \nfunding. Pursuant to section 106(d) of the Budget Control Act, an \nadjustment to the Appropriations Committee's 302(a) allocation and to \nbudgetary aggregates has been made for these amounts in budget \nauthority and for the outlays flowing therefrom.\n  Section 1401 of Division G of H.R. 2055, Legislative Branch \nAppropriations Act, 2012, makes a change to a mandatory program that \nresults in an increase in direct spending in years following the budget \nyear, 2013-2021. This provision is subject to a point of order \nestablished by Section 314 of the 2009 Budget Resolution. H.R. 2055 is \nnot subject to any other budget points of order.\n  H.R. 3672 is not subject to any budget points of order.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    H.R. 2055, CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2012,

We thank our troops for \nwhat they have done in Iraq, for their courage, their sacrifice, and \nfor allowing Iraq an opportunity to forge a democracy moving forward. \nWe also remember and honor the thousands who have lost their lives for \nus and for our freedom and we thank all of them at this time of year. I \nrise in support of this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 349\n\n       Whereas nearly 1,500,000 members of the United States Armed \n     Forces served in Iraq, many serving on multiple deployments;\n       Whereas the members of the United States Armed Forces who \n     served in support of operations in Iraq performed brilliantly \n     in a highly complex and challenging environment, and did \n     everything that was asked of them and more to meet the \n     requirements of the mission;\n       Whereas thousands of members of the National Guard and \n     Reserves left their civilian jobs and livelihoods to support \n     operations in Iraq, making enormous contributions, and \n     serving with distinction;\n       Whereas nearly 4,500 members of the United States Armed \n     Forces made the ultimate sacrifice in giving their lives in \n     support of operations in Iraq;\n       Whereas more than 30,000 members of the United States Armed \n     Forces were wounded serving in support of operations in Iraq;\n       Whereas families of the members of the United States Armed \n     Forces serving in Iraq endured repeated deployments and spent \n     many holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries apart;\n       Whereas, after nearly nine years of combat, we welcome home \n     our veterans and continue to support members of the United \n     States Armed Forces deployed in Afghanistan and elsewhere in \n     the world;\n       Whereas Iraq's destiny and future development now lie with \n     its people; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States recognize the \n     service and sacrifices made by those members of the United \n     States Armed Forces and veterans, as well as their families: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) pays tribute to the members of the United States Armed \n     Forces who served in support of operations in Iraq;\n       (2) calls on the people of the United States to reflect on \n     the service of those members of the United States Armed \n     Forces, veterans, and their families, and honor their \n     sacrifices; and\n       (3) commemorates and honors the contributions made by \n     members of the United States Armed Forces and their families, \n     as the official combat mission in Iraq draws to a close.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/17/senate-section/article/S8760-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MILITARY CONSTRUCTION AND VETERANS AFFAIRS, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n         APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2012--CONFERENCE REPORT--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Valuable legislative time was \nwasted this year on political messaging votes; time that could have \nbeen more properly devoted to the nuts and bolts of legislating. The \nfull Senate, for example, was denied the opportunity to consider the \nDefense Appropriations bill at a time when our men and women in uniform \nare facing looming uncertainty over out-year funding.\n  Despite my overall opposition to this measure, I would note that \nthere are several provisions that I am in favor of in this package. As \nalways, I support funding for the brave members of our military and for \nour veterans. Indeed, I voted for the Senate version of the Military \nConstruction/VA appropriations bill earlier this year and just a few \ndays ago voted for the final version of the Defense Authorization bill. \nAmong the other provisions I support are policy riders such as those \nthat encourage a culture of life and that rein in government overreach.\n  In closing, it is unfortunate that the majority continues to operate \nas it has. I am hopeful that the majority's efforts in this regard do \nnot presage further legislative shortcuts on matters of national \nimportance in the second session of this Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/17/senate-section/article/S8760-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8760-S8761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise to ask unanimous consent of all of \nmy colleagues. Before I explain the unanimous consent request, I will \ngive a little bit of background to S. 1874, which Senator Snowe and I \nhave worked on for some time because of our mutual interest in making \nthe HUBZone process for rural economic development work better.\n  When this process occurs with each census, there is a 2-year \nnightmare of redtape before communities that should benefit from this \neconomic development opportunity have the ability to do so. Across the \ncountry right now, we have rural communities that absolutely need to \nbenefit from this most recent census. They have high unemployment \nrates. They are hit hard by the drop in exports. They are hit hard by \nthe collapse of the housing communities. Sawmills have shut down. Paper \nmills have shut down.\n  So many folks come to this floor to talk about cutting redtape and \ntalk about helping the economy in the heart of rural America. They come \nto this floor and they talk about how important economic development \nand jobs are. And this is a little fix that takes 1 year out of the \nbureaucracy. That is why Senator Snowe and I have worked together on \nthis process.\n  Now, twice we have brought this forward, and twice it has been \ncleared by every Member of this body. Neither time did it make it into \na bill that got to the President's desk. So we are coming back once \nmore to say: Let common sense prevail to fix the entanglement in the \nbureaucracy that is taking away opportunities for rural America. Let's \nput an end to that today.\n  I will defer to my colleague to speak, and then we will ask for \nunanimous consent.\n  I yield to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Oregon \nregarding this critical issue we have been working on for a \nconsiderable period of time and that thought we had really cleared on \nboth sides. This language is mightily important to improving the rural \neconomies of this country, particularly because it would expedite the \nHUBZone designation to allow businesses in those HUBzones to provide \njobs by virtue of the fact that they would get preferential treatment \nin the contracting process.\n  As we know, the Federal Government buys more than $400 billion worth \nof contracts each year. We want to make sure small businesses and \nparticularly those located in hard-hit areas of our country have access \nto those contracting dollars and are able to participate on an equal \nfooting.\n  This would create jobs. So I regret the fact that we are not able to \nget support to move this legislation forward because I know the Senator \nfrom Oregon has tested it on both sides. We have run it through the \nhotline. There are no objections to the language. I cannot understand \nwhy we cannot move this very important legislation that absolutely \nwould be central to creating jobs in the areas that need them the most \nthroughout the country, especially when we have such a high \nunemployment rate.\n  This is not a difficult issue to understand. It is very \nstraightforward. The legislation expedites the timeframe in which these \ndesignations occur for HUBzones, particularly because HUBzones are \nareas that are suffering most with respect to the downturn of this \neconomy.\n  When we have a paltry economic growth of 1.3 percent, of .4 percent, \nor 2 percent, when we have an unemployment rate that is 8.6 percent but \nwe have had 9 percent or higher for a good 28 months, and over 8 \npercent for the last 34 months, we need to do something about it. This \ncould help small businesses, and it could help people in these areas \nwho are currently unemployed. So I would hope there would be no \nobjections with respect to this initiative.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon for his leadership on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  The third sponsor on this bill is Senator Landrieu, the chair of the \nSmall Business Committee. I yield to her.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask the indulgence of my colleague. If my \ncolleague could make the unanimous consent request to which I can \nrespond, then I can leave.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Banking \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1874, the \nHUBZone Qualified Census Tract Act of 2011; that the Senate proceed to \nits consideration; that the bill be read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no interviewing \naction or debate, and any statements related to the bill be printed in \nthe Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there is objection on our side. I will \nobject. But I do want to make a point that as a result of Senator Snowe \nand Senator Merkley's intercession here, our staff has talked to \nSenator Shelby, who says he will try to work to get it cleared and to \nhotline it again on our side today. So at this time, I cannot clear it, \nbut there will be an effort to accomplish that result.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona. We \nappreciate his help. We appreciate the ranking member of the Banking \nCommittee assisting in this matter.\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to add my voice to the \nstrong work that has been done by Senator Merkley and Senator Snowe. As \nthe chair of the committee that has some jurisdiction over the HUBZone \nProgram, I want to urge the Banking Committee and the staff and offer \nthe staff of the Small Business Committee from the majority side to \nwork very hard today to see if we can get this cleared. It is very \nimportant to the ranking member of our committee, who has worked so \nhard, and to the Senator from Oregon, who has made very strong \narguments about expediting and streamlining some of these approvals, so \nI wish them the best.\n  We are going to work today to see if we can get it cleared. It would \nbe the second really substantial victory in the Small Business space, \nhaving gotten our SBIR bill through just recently after 6 years of very \nacrimonious debate. If we can get this fix to the HUBZone Program, it \nwould be terrific.\n  I thank the Senators for their hard work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/17/senate-section/article/S8761-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8761-S8762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO TIM MASSANELLI\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, as we close out the year, I want to take \ntoday to honor the work and career of Tim Massanelli.\n  Last month, Tim stepped down from his position as parliamentarian of \nthe Arkansas House of Representatives, a place where he has worked \nsince 1973--39 good years of valuable public service.\n  When Tim first came to work for the Arkansas House of \nRepresentatives, things were much different than they are today. My \nlongtime friend Dale Bumpers was our Governor and Richard Nixon was \nPresident. I was in the fourth grade.\n  Upholding the mantra of citizen legislators, the Arkansas House had \nno permanent employees and only a small support system in the Bureau of \nLegislative Research. With our Nation and state modernizing, full-time \nemployees were needed in the house, and Tim was in the right place at \nthe right time. He was also exactly the right man for the job.\n  Growing up in Pine Bluff, AR, Tim's family raised him to be civically \nengaged and active in his community--\n\n[[Page S8762]]\n\ntraits he has since passed on to his three sons. With a background in \nsmall business and politics and an expertise in parliamentary \nprocedure, Tim was a natural fit for the parliamentary position. \nHowever, he did not start there. His first session, he worked for the \nhouse soundboard. Tim, through his hard work and smarts and charismatic \npersonality, transformed the office and role of parliamentarian. He \ntook on the responsibility for making the house operations run as \nsmoothly as possible, whether the legislature was in or out of session.\n  Naturally, the parliamentarian advises the speaker and all 100 \nmembers of the State's house about procedural matters. Tim did a great \njob of that over the years, but he became much more important to the \nbody than that. During his time of service, 19 speakers of the house, 7 \nGovernors, and over 1,000 members of the Arkansas House came to rely on \nTim for his knowledge and skills in navigating the legislative process.\n  In years past, the Arkansas General Assembly was dominated by senior \nlegislators with sometimes decades of experience each. When Arkansas \nadopted term limits in 1992, members could only serve three terms, so \nthe constant turnover meant dramatically increased reliance on Tim's \nskills and knowledge. He established a more rigorous orientation for \neach new class of new legislators that taught them how to be good and \neffective representatives. Without his experience and insight, the \nArkansas House and the current members would not be nearly as strong as \nthey are today.\n  On a personal note, let me say this about Tim Massanelli: I consider \nhim a friend. When I was a 27-year-old freshman representative, I was \ndetermined to learn the rules, and Tim was my teacher. You know the old \nsaying that there is no such thing as a dumb question. Well, I put that \nto the test a few times. But he was a mentor, a counselor, a father \nfigure, and he just took care of me. Truthfully, he made himself \navailable to anybody who needed anything. I suspect that same \ncommitment he has to others and to the institution he loves makes him \nthe best deacon Our Lady of the Holy Souls Catholic Church has ever \nhad.\n  He has helped me in many, many ways over the years, but I think the \nbiggest favor he ever did for me was when he told me that his son Randy \nwould be a good hire in the attorney general's office. We hired a lot \nof good people in that office, but everybody agrees that Randy \nMassanelli was the best hire I ever made. He is still the best hire I \never made. The qualities that make Randy so valuable to others were \nengrained in him by Tim Massanelli, and I bet Dottie had a little bit \nto do with that as well.\n  Whether it is his sense of humor, wise counsel, or his skills in \nparliamentary procedure, I know Tim's daily presence will be missed \naround the Arkansas State House of Representatives. I wish him the best \nin his transition and thank him for his many years of service to the \nState of Arkansas.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a woman who \nwas a dear friend of mine, now sadly departed, who was deeply committed \nto serving her community in northern Kentucky, and who left everything \nshe touched a little better off than it was before she found it. I'm \nspeaking of Mrs. Mary Middleton of Fort Mitchell, KY, who tragically \ndied in an accident on November 22, 2011. She was 83 years old.\n  I know northern Kentucky would not be the same if not for the \ntimeless dedication of Mary and her family over more than five decades. \nA community leader, philanthropist, lifelong adventurer and supporter \nof public service, Mary Middleton's loss is a great loss for the people \nof Kenton County and the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Mary grew up in Wisconsin, although there's no doubt that after more \nthan 50 years Kentucky was her home. As a young woman she was keen on \ntraveling the world. Also a frugal woman, she attempted to do so on ten \ndollars a day. Somewhere in France she ran out of money and had to \ntelegraph her father to send her some more.\n  Mary also went to work for the YWCA as a way to travel and have \nsomeone other than her father foot the bill. On a YWCA assignment in \nHawaii, she met a young Naval officer named Clyde Middleton. The couple \nmarried, and when Clyde was transferred to Cincinnati by his employer \nProcter & Gamble, eventually settled in northern Kentucky.\n  ``They got off the airplane and saw all the beautiful trees and said \nthis is where we want to live,'' says their son, John Middleton, who is \nthe Kenton County circuit court clerk. ``And northern Kentucky is a \nmuch better place because she was here.''\n  Mary was determined to make her mark early. In the 1950s, she ran for \na Kentucky State House seat as a Republican, at a time in Kentucky when \nit was impossible to be elected unless you were a man and a Democrat. \nThankfully, times have changed on both counts.\n  Mary did not succeed in that race, but she didn't let that stop her \nfrom having an influence. In 1960, she founded the Kenton County \nRepublican Women's Club, an organization that is still one of the \nstrongest and most active of its type in the State. And Mary continued \nto be involved with the club until her passing.\n  Mary also played a critical role in supporting her husband Clyde's \npolitical career during his two decades of public service in the \nKentucky legislature and as Kenton County judge- executive. And as I \nalready mentioned, her son John is currently the Kenton County circuit \ncourt clerk. Public service runs in the Middleton family.\n  So has compassion for those who are less fortunate. Mary showed that \ncompassion in so many ways--through her volunteer work with the \nSalvation Army, the Red Cross, Church Women United, and her home church \nof Gloria Dei Lutheran. Somehow she also found time to dedicate to the \nCovington Optimist Club and the Florence Woman's Club, as well as the \nKenton County Republican Women's Club she founded.\n  The day before she died, Mary drove a cancer patient to treatment at \nSt. Elizabeth Hospital, something she and Clyde had done for years. \nMary was a teacher at the McMillan Center Alternative School. The \nCincinnati Enquirer honored her in 1981 as a Woman of the Year.\n  This Christmas season, as Kentuckians flock to the shopping malls and \nstores, they will walk by the familiar Salvation Army red kettle and \nhear the bell. Sadly, one bell ringer who will be missing is Mary \nMiddleton.\n  It's a testament to the effect she had on others that, within days of \nher death, dozens of volunteers in Kenton County stepped forward to \nfill the hole she left behind and ring that bell.\n  Elaine and I are profoundly saddened by the loss of Mary Middleton, \nand our deepest condolences go to her family: her husband, Clyde; her \nsons, John, David, and Richard; her daughter, Ann Schmidt; her eight \ngrandchildren, and many other beloved family members and friends.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleagues here in the U.S. Senate join me \nin honoring Mrs. Mary Middleton, mourning her loss, and wishing for \ncomfort for her family. The Cincinnati Enquirer recently published an \narticle celebrating Mary's life. I ask be unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Cincinnati Enquirer, Nov. 23, 2011]\n\n   Northern Kentucky Matriarch Mary Middleton Killed by Garbage Truck\n\n\n Mary Was An Organizer, A Leader, And An Inspiration To Anyone Who Met \n                                  Her\n\n                          (By Brenna R. Kelly)\n\n       Fort Mitchell.--No one was a stranger to Mary Middleton. \n     Whether it was the people donating money as she rang the bell \n     for the Salvation Army, the cancer patients she drove to \n     treatment or the new family who moved onto her street--she \n     cared.\n       Middleton, who was the first northern Kentucky Republican \n     woman to run for office and later became a well-known \n     philanthropist, was hit and killed by a garbage\n\n[[Page S8763]]\n\n     truck Tuesday morning in front of the Fort Mitchell Avenue \n     home where she lived for 52 years. She was 83. ``She loved \n     making people feel good,'' said her son John Middleton, \n     Kenton Circuit Court Clerk. ``I think that's what's going to \n     be the loss, not just for us, but for the whole northern \n     Kentucky community.''\n       It was raining Tuesday morning about 10:20 a.m. when Mary \n     Middleton apparently took a bag of garbage out to a Bavarian \n     garbage truck on her street. Police were still investigating \n     how the accident occurred, but the truck hit Middleton in the \n     street.\n       Emergency responders called for a medical helicopter but it \n     was unable to respond because of the weather. Middleton died \n     at the scene. The driver of the truck was taken to St. \n     Elizabeth Hospital to be tested for drugs or alcohol, which \n     is routine after a fatal accident involving a commercial \n     truck, said Fort Mitchell Police Chief Jeff Eldridge.\n       The driver, John Boaz, has worked for the company for 15 \n     years, said Bavarian spokesman Rick Bruggemann. ``Our deepest \n     condolences and prayers go out to the family,'' Bruggemann \n     said. Boaz, who has an excellent safety record, was \n     devastated, he said.\n       Accident reconstruction experts from Erlanger Police and \n     the Boone County Sheriff's Office are helping Fort Mitchell \n     investigate the accident.\n       Middleton's husband, former Kenton County Judge-Executive \n     Clyde Middleton, was at home when his wife was hit. He called \n     John Middleton at work and word quickly spread across \n     northern Kentucky Republican circles. As Mary Middleton's \n     body lay in the street covered by a sheet and shielded by \n     yellow tarps, family and friends began gathering at the red \n     brick home near the Fort Mitchell Country Club.\n       One of those friends, Shawn Baker, rushed to the home to be \n     with the family.\n       ``I admired Mary more than any person I know,'' said Baker, \n     of Crestview Hills, who was in the Kenton County Republican \n     Women's Club and several other groups with Middleton. ``She \n     had so much class. Mary was an organizer, a leader, and an \n     inspiration to anyone who met her.''\n       Though she was better known as a political wife, it was \n     Mary who made the family's first foray into politics. In the \n     late 1950s she ran for state representative at a time when \n     the area elected men and Democrats, said family friend and \n     Kenton County Republican activist Rick Robinson.\n       She then supported her husband through his two decades in \n     the Kentucky Senate and more than seven years in Kenton \n     County's top job before he resigned in 1998 after a \n     controversy involving the awarding of a courthouse \n     construction bid.\n       ``She was the perfect political wife too, she pushed Dad to \n     do the things and to be nice to people when maybe he didn't \n     want to be nice,'' John Middleton said.\n       Mary Middleton grew up in Wisconsin but was adventurous and \n     left to travel the world. After trying to see the world on \n     $10 a day, she ran out of money in France and had to \n     telegraph her father for money, her son said.\n       She went to work for the YWCA, which sent her to work in \n     Hawaii where she met Clyde, a Naval officer. She followed him \n     to Japan and the couple married.\n       Eventually, Clyde Middleton ended up working for Procter & \n     Gamble in Chicago. When he was transferred to Cincinnati, the \n     Middletons settled in northern Kentucky.\n       ``They got off the airplane and saw all the beautiful trees \n     and said this is where we want to live,'' John Middleton \n     said. ``And northern Kentucky is a much better place because \n     she was here.''\n       In addition to the Salvation Army, she volunteered for the \n     Red Cross, Church Women United, Kentucky Symphony and at her \n     church, Gloria Dei Lutheran. She was also active in the \n     Covington Optimist Club, the Florence Woman's Club and Kenton \n     County Republican Women's Club, which she founded 51 one \n     years ago.\n       In 1981, she was honored by the Enquirer as a Woman of the \n     Year. She was also a teacher at the McMillan Center \n     Alternative School.\n       ``She was everybody's mother,'' said Kenton County Sheriff \n     Chuck Korzenborn, a Republican who counted Middleton as one \n     of his first supporters when he ran for sheriff. ``She was a \n     person who had only one thing on her mind, what was good for \n     the community and the people in it.''\n       ``Mary's fine, she's with her maker and with the Lord. \n     She's fine, but the people down here are going to miss her \n     very, very much.''\n       On Monday, Mary Middleton drove a cancer patient for \n     treatment at St. Elizabeth Hospital, something that she and \n     her husband had done for years. On Tuesday, she was planning \n     her regular visit to a nursing home, where she sat with \n     friends and strangers alike.\n       ``She was truly a humble servant,'' said Becky Sittason, \n     whose grandmother Middleton was planning to visit. ``She \n     doesn't have to flaunt it or say `here is who I helped.' ''\n       Sittason, who has known Middleton since she was 6, only \n     found out she volunteered as a bell ringer when she read it \n     last year in the newspaper.\n       Of all the organizations she was involved in, the Salvation \n     Army was special to Middleton, said both Baker and her son. \n     She helped organize the charity's annual fashion show and \n     would line up volunteers to ring the bell along with her.\n       ``She would never ask anyone to do something that she \n     wouldn't do herself,'' Baker said.\n       Middleton rang the bell for more than 20 years and \n     recruited her entire family for shifts at local stores.\n       ``It just makes your Christmas to know you've done a little \n     something for other people,'' she told the Enquirer last \n     year.\n       In addition to her husband and son John, of Edgewood, she \n     is survived by her sons David, of Lexington; Richard, of \n     Independence; daughter Ann Schmidt, of Orlando; and eight \n     grandchildren.\n       ``Each one of the children could say that they felt \n     special,'' John Middleton said, ``and they were her favorite; \n     that's because she made you feel that way.''\n       ``She always went out of her way to do what's right and to \n     make everybody feel the best about themselves,'' he said.\n       When she died Tuesday, there was a note on her desk she had \n     just written welcoming a family that had recently moved onto \n     the street.\n       ``She didn't know who they were,'' her son said, ``but she \n     wanted to make them feel welcomed. People don't do that as \n     much now days, but she did.''\n       Funeral arrangements are pending with Linnemann Funeral \n     Homes.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I wish \nhim and all the people of Kentucky a great holiday season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/17/senate-section/article/S8763-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8763-S8766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HOMELAND SECURITY BUDGET\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about the \nHomeland Security appropriations bill--one of the nine we approved this \nmorning. I was proud to work with my ranking member, the Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Dan Coats. I am very proud to work with the Senator from \nNew Jersey, Frank Lautenberg, who serves as honorary vice chair of the \ncommittee because of his seniority and expertise in this area. I wanted \nto put into the Record some facts about the bill.\n  This bill has been openly and publicly debated for almost 1 year. \nThere are some very important components of the bill that I think are \nof great interest to the people we serve. First, the bill totals, for \n2012, $39.858 billion, slightly below $40 billion. It is not one of the \nlargest in our government, but it is neither the smallest. It is sort \nof in the midrange of departments, but it is a very important \ndepartment--one just created, as you know, in the aftermath and the \nheartbreak of 9/11. It is a department that has had tremendous success \nin the 10 years but with a lot of growing pains. They had a lot of \ndifficulty getting their feet underneath them and bringing in agencies \nfrom around the government to provide the frontline of defense against \nattacks to our homeland.\n  I commend Secretary Napolitano for the great work she has done in the \nlast 2 years to strengthen this department, to make very tough \ndecisions, which all our Administrators are having to make, about how \nto allocate resources and set priorities because we are reducing \nbudgets. We are in the process of eliminating, trimming, and \nrescinding. That is very difficult because, frankly, almost everything \nwe do on the Federal level is important to somebody, to some entity, to \nsome State, to some business cluster or to some activity of the \ngovernment. Despite the common refrain that there is a lot of waste, \nfraud, and abuse, the fact is, we have been shaving that, eliminating \nthat substantially, over the last several years. Now we are down to the \nbone and muscle.\n  When you are defending a country, you need to have a lot of muscle. \nWhen you are defending a country, you have\n\n[[Page S8764]]\n\nto have a lot of brain power. Then you have to have a lot of backbone. \nThat is what this bill represents, a lot of muscle and a lot of \nstrength to defend our country. There is no guarantee we will not have \nanother attack, but this is the bill that makes that less likely.\n  That is why I will fight, as chair of this committee, to strengthen \nit and to have reliable partners at the State and local levels because \nwe cannot do this alone. We need our local police and our State \ngovernments' eyes on the ground, in neighborhoods--both in urban areas, \nas the Chair basically represents in Delaware--but we also need them \nout in rural areas, where we have very sophisticated and serious \npotential targets for terrorists in terms of power structure, power \ngeneration, electrical structure, energy structure, our ports, which \nare mostly in urban areas, but sometimes we will find a certain niche \nport somewhere out there sort of off the beaten path. We need to \nprotect it all. So we have to be very careful, and the members of the \ncommittee worked very hard to allocate the $40 billion that was given \nto us--$39 billion--which was less than we got last year, in an \nappropriate way. It was less than we got last year, but the needs are \ngreater.\n  Drug trafficking is increasing in Mexico, not decreasing. The \npressures on our southern border are increasing, not decreasing. The \nneed to expedite our travelers faster through the screening, both for \ncommercial and vacation travel, is increasing, not decreasing. People \nthink there is some kind of way we can come to Washington and wave a \nmagic wand and make all these needs go down. Actually, as the needs are \ngoing up, we are flattening and cutting budgets, which makes it very \ndifficult. My job--and I wish to get this point in--as an appropriator \nis made even harder, because despite the good work my ranking member \nhas done on helping us to build this bill, as you know, the Republican \ncaucus has been absolutely unmovable on putting any new money on the \ntable--from any source.\n  We have tried, and the President has tried, to raise revenues from \npeople making over $1 million a year. Actually, you have to make over \n$1 million to pay this surcharge. We have been unable to convince \nanyone on the other side--or very few--we have had one or two \nRepublicans who have stood, and I am very proud of them--to say we have \nto put some more money on the table as we continue to cut programs to \nclose the deficit gap and make sure we have the basics covered.\n  I think Senators McCain and Kyl think the basics are the border. They \nmay be right, and I have supported them. We have added 1,000 new Border \nPatrol agents in the last year, but it costs money. We have had to find \nthat money in this bill. So other things had to be reduced. I \nunderstand that. Businesses do that all the time. But businesses also \nneed to sell more products and bring in more money. Businesses also can \nincrease the prices of products sometimes to bring in more revenue. We \nare having a hard time getting the other side of this body to \nunderstand that sometimes you have to bring in more revenue, as well as \ncutting, to make this work.\n  I am presenting a bill I am proud of, which is $39 billion. It is \ngoing to be very difficult to go much further down and to continue to \ndo that which I am going to outline that we do in this bill.\n  First of all, we spent a lot of time this year--because we had to--\ntalking about disasters. This was the worst year on record for \ndisasters in the United States--from fires in the West, to floods in \nthe Mississippi, to hurricanes raking the Northeast, to tornadoes. We \nhave just had our fill. The weather service, just last week, came out \nand said that this year, for the first time since they recorded this, \nwe had over 12 disasters of over $1 billion each. So this year, 2011, \nwas a very tough year. Our members and I spent a lot of time talking \nabout disasters, so I will not do that at this moment. We have done \nenough talk. We funded FEMA. It was a great victory for people who were \nlooking for our help.\n  I wish to talk about what else the Homeland Security bill does \nbecause it is not just responding to disasters, which I am proud we \ntook care of this morning. We also do a lot of other important work and \nfund a lot of other important entities in this bill, including securing \nour borders--the whole border--the northern border, the southern border \nand ports of entry. I think we have over 125. People don't realize \nthis. They don't see it as they do if they live in Missouri or in \nKansas or maybe even in Arkansas. They are not familiar with the \nborders along Texas or how big they are, and Arizona. But it is a lot \nof land that has to be covered, and it is the Federal Government's \nresponsibility. It takes a tremendous amount of money to secure this \nborder, but our country wants us to do that. So we have invested in \nmore border agents, in better technology, and I am even trying to come \nup with some very cost effective ways to improve the physical \ninfrastructure of the borders because not only do they serve to protect \nour Nation from people who should not come in, but we also have to get \na lot of things across our border, such as all the commerce and traffic \nand vegetables and agricultural products and manufactured products that \nour businesses depend on to have good trade with Canada and Mexico.\n\n  With NAFTA, which is a very important trade foundation for our \ncontinent, we just can't close our borders and shut them down. We have \nto keep them open. America, unlike every other country in the world, is \none of the only countries that both has to fight hard for our security \nbut also remain open as a nation. This is a very hard thing to do. We \nhave to have more research and technology, not less. We have to have \nsmarter border crossings, not the old-fashioned, out-of-date type. That \nis what our bill supports--or, I should say, we try to. We are having a \nvery difficult time because no one will put a dime on the table. So we \nhave to keep finding ways to do this.\n  We have to enforce our immigration laws. Everybody at home tells us \nthey want the laws enforced. But it costs money to enforce those laws, \nand that is in this bill. As I said, we have to facilitate trade and \nprotect our currency.\n  We also secure cyberspace, which is a whole growing enterprise in \nspace that we are learning a great deal about. We will not be fighting \nwars the way we have in the past. Our enemies will be attacking us in \nvery different and innovative ways--not army to army, navy to navy, or \nmen and women on the battlefield, as we have become accustomed. They \nmay be attacking our utility sector, trying to shut down our financial \nsystems. We are so reliant and interrelated on all the digital \nnetworking. It is very frightening to think what could happen, and we \nhave all been in classified briefings to understand what could happen. \nThis bill helps protect all of our Federal agencies and businesses \nexcept for Defense. Defense protects themselves. Our bill has to \nprotect the homeland and the private sector, and we have a long way to \ngo--and not just big companies but small companies have to be \nprotected, and we have to work in partnership with them.\n  Let me mention our TSA in aviation; we fund that. I also want to \nmention this for Louisiana: Our fishermen have had a terrible time. \nMaybe in Delaware and other places along the east coast and the west \ncoast my colleagues will understand this. In the gulf, our fishermen \nare trying to make a living in the middle of hurricanes and oilspills \nand, in addition, we get crawfish and shrimp dumped from places such as \nChina and Vietnam. So we need money in this bill to enforce those trade \nlaws, and I stepped up and significantly enhanced that effort in this \nbill. I was proud to do it for the shrimping and fish industries in our \ncountry, and particularly along the gulf coast. So that is in this bill \nas well.\n  I might mention the Secret Service, which we have to support, in \naddition to the Coast Guard, Customs and Border Protection. There is a \nlot in our $40 billion bill.\n  Let me just make one other point. We have eliminated $204 million of \nrescissions in, as I said, low-priority programs. These were eliminated \nto spend money on high-priority programs. We have reduced \nadministrative funding by over $800 million, and we have reduced the \nheadquarters account by almost $100 million.\n  I am one to shave some of this money off of administration, but I \ncan't go much further, and I will tell you why. This department is a \nhard department to manage, and it can't manage itself. Secretary \nNapolitano must have the resources at the administrative level to\n\n[[Page S8765]]\n\nmanage a department that is only 10 years old, and that brings \ndisparate agencies together to have them function.\n  We have seen what happens when we don't invest in management. We have \nseen what happens when we gut administration. We had a weak shell of \nFEMA show up after Katrina and just about ruined our efforts for \nrecovery. We are never going to see that again. So I am committed to \nfunding the FEMA administration and to funding the Department. We can \ncut, and we have made some cuts, but I am telling the other side we \njust can't keep cutting the administration and then turn around and \nexpect the same agencies to ferret out fraud, waste, and abuse. We need \ngood managers to do that and so we must continue to fund them.\n  I am proud I was able to include $358 million for six Coast Guard \nFast Response Cutters. Those happened to be built in Louisiana--I am \nproud of that--but the decision was made well before I got to be chair \nof this committee for that construction. I am proud to have funded that \neffort and to give the Coast Guard the upgrade of equipment they need \nto do the work we are asking them to do. Their work just continues to \ngo up. They are a very popular part of our Federal Government. I think \neveryone loves the Coast Guard. We are very fond of them in Louisiana \nbecause we depend on them for so many things, and I think their fleet \nneeds to be upgraded.\n  Some of these ships are built in other States--some of their \ninfrastructure is in other States--and I am proud to support the \nOffshore Patrol Cutter. We included $110 million for 40 response boats; \nanother $129 million for maritime patrol aircraft, mission pallets, and \nspares; and we have $18 million to replace a helicopter that crashed. I \ncould recite some other things, but we have tried to do our best by the \nCoast Guard, to upgrade the equipment they need to help us during this \ntime.\n  We have also put in this bill--and I am very proud of this, and I \nhope the public will see some immediate improvements--250 machines for \nadditional advanced imaging technology. We put in funding to pay for \nthis so that people can get through those security lines faster. We are \nlosing a lot of money as a nation with people stuck in lines, and it is \njust slowing down our productivity, which is important because our \nbusinesses need people to travel.\n  Of course, being from a State that depends on hospitality--our \nPresiding Officer just recently visited Louisiana, and we are grateful \nto him and his family for coming to spend some time with us. We would \nlike everyone to come and spend some time in Louisiana--Lafayette, \nBaton Rouge. I know the Presiding Officer had a great time and spent \nsome time in hotels and restaurants.\n  New York depends a lot on tourism, as does Nevada and California, and \nmany other States. When people get hassled too much while traveling, \nthey just stop going. Now, we can't drive our cars everywhere we want \nto go. So making flying a little easier once again for the public, yet \nstill safe, is something I most certainly want to work on.\n\n  Just a couple more comments and then I will close.\n  I want to commend the group in Louisiana at our Cyber Innovation \nCenter. They received--not out of this bill but out of the Department--\na very small grant to help with the improvement on training the \nworkforce to be the cyber warriors we need them to be. We need to do \nthat in Delaware, we need to do that in Louisiana, we need to do that \nin Texas, and we need to do it everywhere.\n  We are not educating and producing the graduates we need to be the \ncyber warriors of the future. We don't want to have our warrior force--\nas much as we are proud to have legal immigrants in our country--\noutsourced to India or China or Japan, to have their Ph.D.s or masters \nor degreed individuals come to do this work. We want to raise our own \nto do this work, and we can do that. I am proud to support some of \nthose efforts in this bill.\n  Unfortunately, the tight spending limits necessitated deep cuts in \nfirst responder grant programs. While we were able to provide $354 \nmillion above the House level for such grant programs, the final \nagreement cuts funding by 30 percent. I believe the Federal government \nhas a responsibility to work with and assist State and local first \nresponders in developing their capabilities to mitigate, prevent, and \nrespond to all disasters whether they are natural disasters or \nterrorist attacks.\n  There are also significant cuts in science and technology activities. \nWhile we were successful in mitigating the excessive cuts contained in \nthe House bill by restoring $129 million, the agreement reduces \nspending by $160 million below fiscal year 2011 levels. I believe that \nthe Department of Homeland Security, like any successful business, must \ninvest in science and technology to address evolving threats and I \nintend to make this program a priority going forward.\n  To minimize these reductions, the agreement includes $204 million of \nrescissions of low priority programs, reduces funding in administrative \naccounts by over $800 million and reduces Departmental headquarters \naccounts by $9 million. The agreement also provides for the orderly \ntermination of the Office of Counternarcotics Enforcement and the \nOffice of Risk Management and Analysis, programs that are either \nredundant or poorly executed.\n  During our negotiations with the House, we were able to eliminate a \nnumber of objectionable language riders, including three immigration \nprovisions that would have limited the Department's authority to \nenforce our immigration laws, a provision that would have prohibited \nTransportation Security Administration employees from collective \nbargaining, and a provision that would have required TSA to reduce \nthousands of screeners and transition toward a private sector work \nforce.\n  I am pleased that we were able to include in the agreement provisions \nthat will: facilitate maintaining or hiring firefighters by local fire \ndepartments; allow FEMA to waive recoupment requirements for disaster \nsurvivors who, through no fault of their own, received overpayments as \nmuch as 6 years ago; extend the National Flood Insurance Program \nthrough May 31, 2012; and extend the authorities of the Chemical \nFacility Anti-Terrorism Standards program for 1 year. The agreement \nalso includes a provision that gives States the flexibility to use FEMA \nhazard mitigation grant funding to reimburse homeowners for storm \nmitigation work originally completed with a Small Business \nAdministration loan. This provision provides equity of benefits among \ndisaster survivors.\n  The agreement includes funding for a number of critical investments \nthat will enhance the department's capacity to respond to an evolving \nthreat:\n\n       Coast Guard funding includes: $358 million for six Fast \n     Response Cutters; $77 million for long lead time material for \n     the sixth National Security Cutter; $25 million for \n     development and design of the Offshore Patrol Cutter; $110 \n     million for 40 Response Boat Mediums; $129.5 million for two \n     Maritime Patrol Aircraft, mission pallets, and spares; $18.3 \n     million to replace a helicopter that crashed in 2010; $15.2 \n     in response to the gulf coast oil spill, to enhance oil spill \n     response capabilities, including 87 new positions; $200.7 \n     million for shore facility projects, infrastructure to \n     support new assets, and military housing; and $63.5 million \n     for a new C-130J aircraft, by transfer from the Department of \n     Defense.\n\n  Funding is included for the Transportation Security Administration \nfor: 250 additional Advanced Imaging Technology machines with the \ncapacity to protect people's privacy; 145 new behavior detection \nofficers; 12 additional multi-modal Visible Intermodal Prevention and \nResponse, VIPR, teams; 20 additional explosives detection canine teams; \nand 53 new positions to strengthen international air cargo security.\n  The agreement provides resources to Customs and Border Protection to \nsupport: 21,370 Border Patrol agents, sustaining the increased levels \napproved in the Fiscal Year 2010 Supplemental; 21,186 CBP officers \nworking at the ports of entry, including 312 new officers and \nadditional canine teams; $5 million for officer and agent integrity \nprograms, including polygraph testing; $5 million to CBP to work within \nexisting laws to increase collection of antidumping and countervailing \nduties and implement aggressive options to level the trade playing \nfield for U.S. companies.\n  The agreement provides $443 million for cybersecurity efforts, an \nincrease of $80 million above Fiscal Year 2011, of\n\n[[Page S8766]]\n\nwhich $22.8 million is for cybersecurity education and awareness. The \nincrease will continue efforts to combat the cyber threat by reducing \npoints of access to Federal computer networks, enhancing intrusion \ndetection through Einstein, and building a cybersecurity workforce \nthrough education and training.\n  So it remains the responsibility of each generation to make the \nnecessary investments to secure our homeland. I take this \nresponsibility seriously, and my members take it seriously as part of \nour Homeland Security Committee. We worked very hard to produce a good \nbill for the country. We are proud of this bill. It is about $40 \nbillion of their money. I hope they believe we are allocating it and \nspending it accordingly.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the hearings we are going to have \nnext year on some important topics, and I will close by wishing you and \nthe staff and everyone here a merry Christmas and a happy and blessed \nholiday.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. RUBIO. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/17/senate-section/article/S8766-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8766-S8767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IMPACTS TO THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE\n\n  Mr. RUBIO. It is a pleasure to be here. This will be my last speech \nof the year. As I said yesterday in another speech, it has been an \nextraordinary honor and privilege to serve in the Senate. I look \nforward to the next 5 years of doing that, God willing. It is a \nphenomenal institution and I am proud to be a part of it, even though \nsome days make you scratch your head.\n  I am here on two things before we close out the year. I have a \nspecific interest on items that impact the Western Hemisphere.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to say that one of the real treats of \nthe last year is being able to work with Senator Menendez on the \nWestern Hemispheric Committee. We share a lot of views in common, and \neven on the ones we don't we have a very cooperative working \nrelationship. It has been a great experience working with him on that, \nand I look forward to more of that next year on that committee and with \neveryone on Foreign Relations.\n  I know there are a lot of big domestic issues happening, but the \nthings around the world matter. They matter a lot to us. I know when \ntimes are tough economically, sometimes we wonder: Why should we care \nwhat is happening halfway around the world?\n  We are not Luxembourg, with all due respect to Luxembourg. We are the \nUnited States of America. What that means is that virtually every \naspect of our life is directly impacted by things that are happening \nsometimes halfway around the world.\n  One of the things that is always in our interest is the promotion of \nfreedom and democracy. It is one of the things that sets us apart from \nother nations. Our greatest export is the American example, the fact \nthat people look to this country and see it is possible for people to \nhave self-government.\n  I know self-government and this Republic sometimes look messy from \nthe outside looking in. As I tell people often, if you saw the way some \nof your food is made, you wouldn't eat it. I think sometimes when you \nlook at the political process and the lights that shine on it, there \nare some things about it and the process that I don't like and you \ndon't like. But it is still better than virtually any other form of \ngovernment that has ever existed on the Earth. We are all privileged \nand blessed to be able to live in this Republic. Any time we have the \nopportunity to speak out on behalf of democracy and freedom, we should.\n  I had, this week, the opportunity to engage on that issue, and I wish \nto publicly acknowledge the work of Under Secretary Sherman, who has \nspent a lot of time talking to me this week about Nicaragua and about \nelections in Nicaragua that were, in my opinion, fraudulent and \nunfortunate because the rest of the hemisphere is moving toward \ndemocracy, the rest of the hemisphere is moving toward free and fair \nelections. In Latin America, sometimes people whom we don't agree with \nwin elections, people who don't like us, who believe the national \ninterests of their country are contrary to ours. But the people chose \nthem.\n  Unfortunately, what happened in Nicaragua is grotesque. This person \nDaniel Ortega, who was a Sandinista, who was once a dictator of that \ncountry, basically has ignored the Constitution and ran for office \nagain. There were extraordinary irregularities. The Carter Center, for \nexample, wasn't allowed to come in and observe it. The OAS has already \ntalked about real problems with that election and we hope to see their \nreport soon.\n  Let me publicly acknowledge the time and effort the Department of \nState spent talking to me on the phone about ensuring that the United \nStates is a forceful voice on behalf of democracy and freedom in \nNicaragua and in the hemisphere. I appreciate their work on that \nbehalf, and I know we are looking forward to the OAS's report fairly \nsoon.\n  Senator Menendez and I have filed a resolution in this institution \nthat I hope we will pass that recognizes the need for this country to \nstand firmly on the side of the Nicaraguan people on behalf of freedom \nand democracy.\n  There is another topic I touched upon the other day; that is, the \npeople-to-people travel to Cuba. I kind of went through these \nitineraries a couple days ago that show basically what these trips are \nall about is nothing more than tourism--just tourism. It is just people \ngoing to Cuba.\n  The reason why this is problematic is because it gives money to the \nCastro government.\n  Today in the Miami Herald is a very disturbing article. The article \nis from Juan Tamayo, who is a reporter who writes for the El Nuevo \nHerald and Miami Herald:\n\n       Cuban dissidents have sent out photos and videos of a large \n     police crackdown in the eastern town of Palma Soriano that \n     left at least five government opponents with head wounds, \n     black eyes and other injuries.\n       One photo of the Dec. 2 roundup of 46 dissidents shows \n     Henry Perales with two wounds on his shaved head that \n     required nine stitches to close. Another shows AbrahanCQ \n     Cabrera with one stitch on his forehead.\n       \"That wound bled a lot because it was on a blood vessel, \n     but it was a kick to the ribs on the right side that made me \n     fall to the ground. . . . It still hurts,'' Cabrera told El \n     Nuevo Herald by phone from Palma Soriano.\n       The images were sent to the newspaper by Luis Enrique \n     Ferrer Garcia, U.S. representative of the dissident Cuban \n     Patriotic Union. His brother, former political prisoner Jose \n     Daniel Ferrer Garcia, heads the Union and was one of the men \n     arrested in the Palma Soriano crackdown.\n       Union members and supporters took two weeks to smuggle out \n     the photos and the videos, via emails, because they had to \n     work slowly and carefully to avoid police agents who were \n     trying to find and seize the images, Luis Enrique said.\n       The Palma Soriano roundup was one of the largest and \n     harshest police crackdowns on dissidents in recent years. All \n     were freed hours or days later--one of them 12 days later--\n     without charges.\n       Forty-six men had gathered in a Palma Soriano house \n     starting on Nov. 30 with plans to stage a street protest two \n     days later to demand the release of all political prisoners \n     and respect for human rights.\n\n  Those sound like pretty reasonable requests to me, release of \npolitical prisoners and respect of human rights. This is what they were \ngoing to protest on behalf of.\n\n       Cell phone videos shot inside the house showed many of the \n     dissidents saying they wanted to show they were not U.S. paid \n     ``mercenaries,'' as the government brands them, but rather \n     ``defenders of human rights.''\n       The unidentified narrator of some of the videos referred to \n     the police already deployed outside ``and the repression that \n     awaits us.''\n\n  So these protesters knew what was about to happen. They have seen \nthis before. This is what happens in Cuba when you speak out in favor \nof human rights and against political prisoners. You get your head \ncracked open. These guys knew this was going to happen, but yet they \nhad the bravery to go forward with it.\n\n       Police indeed arrested the dissidents as they left the \n     house in groups of four and five, and a video taken from a \n     second-story balcony showed them punching some of the \n     protesters and forcing them onto a U.S.-styled\n\n[[Page S8767]]\n\n     yellow school bus parked at the end of the block.\n       Cabrera said the bus driver, dressed in civilian clothes, \n     hit him as well as Perales and several other dissidents with \n     a wrench once inside the bus.\n\n  The bus driver hit them with a wrench once they got inside the bus.\n\n       Other photos show dissidents Misael Valdes Diaz and Alexis \n     Yanch OiCQ with black eyes and Emilio Dinza with a large bump \n     on his forehead. Other dissidents reported black and blues \n     from police strikes.\n       Angel Moya, a former political prisoner who was reported \n     beaten in a police station after his arrest in Palma Soriano \n     Dec. 2, said police punched him on the way from the house to \n     the school bus but not afterwards.\n\n  How nice of them not to punch him afterwards.\n\n       Moya said Friday that he spent 12 days in a police lockup, \n     in a cell that was smelly and had no water or lights and that \n     he shared with common criminals.\n\n  This is Cuba. I doubt this experience is something these tourists \ntraveling on U.S. licenses are going to get to see on their next visit \nto Cuba.\n  The other day I talked about one of these visits that the United \nStates has licensed called Ethics and the Cuban Revolution. How \ninteresting--Ethics and the Cuban Revolution.\n  I wonder if part of that ethics course will be a part about schoolbus \ndrivers dressed as civilians hitting protesters with a wrench. I wonder \nif that is part of their itinerary. I wonder if the part about cracking \npeople's heads open because they are going to peacefully protest in the \nstreet is part of the itinerary in this Ethics and the Cuban \nRevolution.\n  Why do I bring this up again? No. 1, it is outrageous. It should be \ndenounced, and this is a great forum to do it because the world needs \nto know what happens 90 miles from our shores. It is one of the most \nrepressive regimes in the Western Hemisphere's history. It is still in \nplace. It is still ongoing. But here is No. 2. Where do they get the \nmoney to pay these people? Don't you think those guys are getting paid, \nthe civilian busdriver is getting paid to hit people with a wrench or \ndo you think he is doing it for free? How are they paying these police \nofficers? How do you get people to do this stuff? You have to pay them. \nWhere do they get their money to pay them?\n  Their government is a fiasco. They don't know anything about the \neconomy. Do you want to know why the Cuban economy is in the tank? It \nis because the people who run Cuba are incompetent. They have no idea \nabout what a modern economy looks like or how to create one, apart from \nthe fact that they cling to a broken ideology.\n  So where do they get the money to pay for all these things? Sadly, \nwhere they are getting a lot of the money to pay for these things is \nfrom us. It is from people who live in this country who are curious \nabout what happens in Cuba, who are curious--and some who outright \nsympathize with this idea that somehow Cuba is this socialist \nparadise--and they travel there and they leave money there. All these \ntrips, Cuba gets a huge take, and they use it to fund this repressive \napparatus.\n  As I said the other day, I understand and I don't have any false \nillusions that the President is going to change his travel policy \ntoward Cuba or this people-to-people program. But at least make sure \nthese programs are furthering what you say you are trying to further, \nwhich is bringing freedom and democracy to Cuba, instead of being a \nsource of hard currency and hard revenue.\n  A few days ago, I denounced two specific itineraries. I didn't \ndenounce 5 or 10; I pointed out 2 of the most outrageous ones on this \nfloor in a speech I gave. Then I sent that to the State Department and \nsaid: Would you look at this for me? They responded that they would. \nThey told me they would send me a letter. In fact, in conversations I \nhad, they gave me great hope that in fact they too were troubled by \nthese itineraries and that they would start to look at these more \nseriously.\n  Sadly, as a result of what they told me--because one of the things \nthat has been going on around here is I had placed a hold on two \nnominations in the Western Hemisphere as a result of their inaction on \nthis issue.\n  After I spoke to them on the phone, I was hopeful about it and I \nlifted those holds. We were going to vote on those today. Then I got \nthis letter today that, to summarize, basically says: Thank you for \nyour letter, but we can't talk to you about it.\n  That is not what I expected to get, and so we are going to hold those \nnominations again until we take this seriously.\n  This is a problem. This is a problem. We have these companies in \nAmerica that are advertising tourism to Cuba--tourism that is not just \na source of irritation, it is a source of hard currency. It is the \nmoney this regime is using to crack people's heads, to pay so-called \nbusdrivers to beat people with wrenches. It is the money they are using \nto stick people in jails with common criminals, with no access to food \nor water for 12 days, without charges. We are funding a repressive \nregime through these practices, and it has to stop. Someone better take \nthis seriously. When they take this seriously, then we can talk.\n\n  I hope where we are headed here in the coming year is that we will \nstand not just on the side of the Cuban people's desire for freedom and \ndemocracy--no political prisoners, respect for human rights--but stand \nfor that in the hemisphere and the world, because our voice still \nmatters, and I hope this country will always stand firm on those \nissues.\n  Before I left today, I wanted to stand on the floor and talk about \nthis because it is something very important to me and should be \nimportant to our country. I hope in the coming year we will have the \nopportunity in our Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere and in this \nbody and in our conversations with the White House and State Department \nto bring these programs into focus. This people-to-people program is a \nsham. Maybe they are very well intentioned but some of these trips are \nnothing more than tourism that plows millions of dollars into the hands \nof one of the most disgusting and grotesque, repressive apparatuses \nthis hemisphere has ever seen, and it has to stop. Someone has to start \ncracking down on these people, someone has to start cracking down on \nthese agencies, someone has to start cracking down on these trips, and \nmake sure they do what they are intended to do, and that is real access \nto the ways of freedom, to the ways of opportunity, to opening the eyes \nof the Cuban people to the fact that the rest of the world does not \nlive under what they live under--even though most of the Cuban people \nalready know that.\n  It is time we start holding these people accountable. If they are \nfiling these licenses under false pretenses, they need to be \nprosecuted, their licenses need to be suspended. They have to be barred \nfrom having these trips. We have to have people actively monitoring \nthese itineraries that are being sold. We need to match their \napplications for these licenses, and we need to stop approving licenses \nfor these tourist trips.\n  I hope we will make progress on that in 2012 and I hope that is what \nwe will focus on in the year to come.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me wish you and your family and all \nthose who work here a merry Christmas and happy new year. I hope God \ngives you and your families a very good, outstanding, happy, healthy \nnew year.\n  I wish to speak on William Boarman's appointment as Public Printer, \nwhich has been held up for a year and a half, despite being reported \nout of the Rules Committee twice with unanimous bipartisan support. \nEarlier this year, because of the delays, he was appointed to the job \non an interim basis by the President during a recess. During this year \nhe has done an outstanding job as Acting Public Printer.\n  It is extremely unfortunate that this agency, which is so important \nto Congress, to the private sector printing industry, and to the \ncountry, will now be without an effective leader when Mr. Boarman's \nrecess appointment expires after we adjourn, unless this Senate \nconfirms his nomination at last.\n\n[[Page S8768]]\n\n  He has moved quickly this year to make important financial and \nmanagement improvements at the Government Printing Office. These \ninclude cutting costs with a buyout of 15 percent of GPO's workforce, \nwhich will save $33 million annually; greatly reducing costs for \novertime, travel, executive hires, and other discretionary costs; \nreducing GPO's overhead expenses; and negotiating successfully with the \nunions, resulting in a zero increase in salaries.\n  I might add, perhaps he is being held up because of his union \nbackground, but we have seen in his year as acting administrator that \nhe has been fiscally extremely responsible and successful. Maybe he is \nbetter at doing this than other people would be.\n  He also has staff identifying nearly $30 million in outstanding \npayments owed to the GPO by other Federal agencies and collecting \nalmost $15 million of that in a few months.\n  Mr. Boarman ordered the first survey ever of congressional offices on \ntheir need for printed copies of the Congressional Record, resulting in \nan 18-percent reduction in printed copies and more cost savings.\n  Mr. Boarman has aggressively pushed the GPO to extend electronic \nonline publishing and databases, as Congress has asked. In short, he \nhas already demonstrated he is the kind of competent, committed, \nexperienced leader GPO needs.\n  The fact that we have not cleared this nomination is outrageous. The \ntwo Republican Senators who had holds on this nomination, holds that \nhad nothing to do with concerns about Mr. Boarman but with other \nnonrelated nominations, finally released their holds yesterday. Now, \ntoday, some new obstacle has arisen on the Republican side. We know it \nis not an objection to Mr. Boarman himself but we have run out of time.\n  It is appalling when you get a public servant who cares about this \ngovernment, in a nonpolitical place, the Government Printing Office, \nwho has done an excellent job by all accounts--cutting costs, what we \non both sides of the aisle want--and he gets held up. Instead of \ngetting held up he should get an award for the job he has done. Yet he \nis held up and caught in the politics once again. It is so indicative \nof the dysfunction of our government. It is bothersome when someone \nworks so hard and does a good job that his nomination can't get through \nfor secret, undisclosed--it is hard to even figure out what reason.\n  I hope maybe before we leave today my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle will look at Mr. Boarman's record--look at the unanimous vote \nhe received in the Rules Committee; every Republican voted for him--and \nmost of all look at what he has done in the Printing Office, and \nrealizing without a leader many of these gains may be lost, costing all \nof us and the taxpayers millions of dollars, and maybe we will appoint \nhim. Delay in this confirmation has shown the confirmation process at \nits worst and we are now in danger of losing this public servant whose \nwork has produced the kinds of results we want.\n  I urge the Senate to confirm Mr. Boarman so that the GPO can continue \nto make progress.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we know, very clearly, today is Saturday. \nBut the Senate had some very important work to do today, so we stayed \nin session to present some issues to the American public that were \nextremely important. One was to make sure there would be no tax \nincrease on millions of American families--in fact, 160 million.\n  We had a duty to be here, the Senators, but also other people had a \nduty to be here, and they are here. Four very dedicated pages are here \ntoday: Grace Mason, from Roanoke, VA; Kristina Biddle, from Hockessin, \nDE; Mitchell Bustillo, of Fort Worth, TX; and Zach Schroeder, from \nClarksville, TN.\n  They didn't have to be here. They could be home with their families \nduring this holiday season, as the other pages are. Instead, they \nstayed to help keep the Senate running smoothly. They didn't have to be \nasked. They volunteered.\n  We expect a lot of our pages, and I so appreciate their work. I have \nhad two granddaughters who were pages--my two oldest grandchildren--and \nit actually changed their lives. I say that as seriously as I could say \nanything. Ryan and Mattie were not interested much about government. \nThey had other things to do as juniors in high school. But they came \nback here in this environment, where they saw us wandering around and \nmaking speeches and voting and they got interested in reading the \nnewspapers and watching the news more intently. My two granddaughters \nnow are both in France studying abroad. One is a junior at New York \nUniversity, the other is a senior at The New School in New York. I mean \nit when I say their lives were changed as a result of this program. I \nnot only heard it from these two young women, my granddaughters, but I \nhave heard it from their parents, about what a significant change it \nmade.\n  As I said, we expect a lot of the pages. They work long, hard hours, \nas do Senators and their staffs. So I want them to know, speaking for \nevery Senator, the pages here are terrific. We appreciate their work. \nIt is a tradition that has been here for a long time, and I will do \neverything I can to protect the pages and the work they do.\n  I thank them for their service and wish them the very best of \neverything in their next endeavor. But I am confident, as with Mattie \nand Ryan, their lives will have been changed as a result of their being \nhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/17/senate-section/article/S8768-3", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8768-S8769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, we are ready and \nwilling to move forward by consent with a package of nominations, with \npositions both in the executive and judicial branches; and just as soon \nas I receive confirmation from the administration that it will respect \nthe practice and the precedent on recess appointments, we can get those \npeople confirmed.\n  I look forward to receiving this confirmation from the administration \nso\n\n[[Page S8769]]\n\nwe can go forward on this nominations package, but not having received \nthat yet, Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am disappointed that my friend objected, \nbut I want the record to be spread with this:\n  We have done a good job on nominations the last couple of months. \nActually, in the last 3 months, we have accomplished quite a bit. But I \nam kind of reminded of my days of being a younger man and running a \nfoot race. I wasn't fast enough for the short races, so I ran long \nraces. But unless I started fast, it was really hard to catch up. That \nis my concern about these nominations. We have started so slowly, I am \nnot sure we can catch up. I hope we can.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will say that there will be \nnominations we will be able to work our way through, but as I \nindicated, the particular package the majority leader just proffered as \nit is currently constituted will not be able to go forward because of \nour inability to receive from the administration the assurances that \nhave been routinely given at this point with regard to recess \nappointments.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, with the conclusion of the first session of \nthe 112th Congress, the Senate Republican leadership has cost us the \nopportunity to take long overdue steps to address the serious vacancies \ncrisis on Federal courts throughout the country. With one out of every \nten Federal judgeships vacant we can and should be doing all that we \ncan to consider and confirm judicial nominations without unnecessary \ndelays. Regrettably, Senate Republicans have chosen instead to continue \ntheir tactics of unexplained delay and obstruction and to repeat their \ndamaging decision at the end of last year to refuse to consent to votes \non even consensus judicial nominations. Such delaying tactics are a \ndisservice to the American people. The Senate should fulfill its \nconstitutional duty and ensure the ability of our Federal courts to \nprovide justice to Americans around the country.\n  There are 21 judicial nominees awaiting final Senate action, all but \ntwo of them reported with significant bipartisan support, 16 of them \nunanimously. That means nearly every judicial nomination can and should \nbe confirmed before the Senate adjourns. Yet, the Senate's Republican \nleadership is repeating the terrible practice at the end of last year \nin which 19 judicial nominees were blocked by Republicans and stalled \nat the end of the year. It then took until June to take action on 17 of \nthose nominees.\n  The recent filibuster of the D.C. Circuit nomination of Caitlin \nHalligan, a highly-regarded appellate advocate with the kind of \nimpeccable credentials in both public service and private practice that \nmake her unquestionably qualified to serve on the D.C. Circuit, set a \nnew and damaging standard. By refusing to consent to votes on consensus \nnominees before the end of the session, Senate Republicans are setting \nanother damaging standard that will make it difficult for future \nPresidents of either party to fill judicial vacancies.\n  I am speaking about the kinds of qualified, consensus nominees who in \npast years would have been considered and confirmed by the Senate \nwithin days of being reported with the support of every Democrat and \nevery Republican on the Judiciary Committee. Yet, due to Republican \nrefusal to give consent, it will take many months for the Senate to \nconfirm them to start serving on the Federal bench. Meanwhile, millions \nof Americans who are served by the Federal courts in those districts \nand circuits are left with overburdened courts and unneceesary delays \nin having their cases determined.\n  All of these consensus nominees have been through an extensive \nevaluation process before being reported to the Senate for final \napproval. Senator Grassley and I have ensured all of these nominees \nwere fully considered by the Judiciary Committee after a\n\n[[Page S8771]]\n\nthorough, fair process, including completing our extensive \nquestionnaire and questioning at a hearing. Before each of these \nnominees was selected by the President, the White House worked with the \nnominees' home state Senators who support them, the FBI completed an \nextensive background review, and each nominee was reviewed by the \nAmerican Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. \nWhen the nominations have been approved by the Judiciary Committee \nafter this thorough process, there is no reason for the Senate failing \nto vote on them before the end of the session.\n  It is wrong to dismiss the delays resulting from the Senate \nRepublicans' obstruction as merely political tit for tat. This is a new \nand damaging tactic Senate Republicans have devised. They are stalling \naction on noncontroversial nominees. Meanwhile, millions of Americans \nacross the country who are harmed by delays in overburdened courts bear \nthe cost of this obstruction. Nearly half of all Americans live in \ndistricts or circuits that have a judicial vacancy that could be filled \ntoday if Senate Republicans just agreed to vote on the nominations now \npending on the Senate Executive Calendar. It is wrong to delay votes on \nthese qualified, consensus judicial nominees. The Senate should be \nhelping to fill these multiple, extended judicial vacancies before \nadjourning.\n  Our courts need qualified Federal judges, not vacancies, if they are \nto reduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their \nday in court. It is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who are \nseeking their day in court to suffer unnecessary delays. When an \ninjured plaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her medical \nexpenses, that plaintiff should not have to wait for three years before \na judge hears the case. When two small business owners disagree over a \ncontract, they should not have to wait years for a court to resolve \ntheir dispute.\n  With almost one in nine Federal judgeships currently vacant, the \nSenate should have come together to address the serious judicial \nvacancies crisis on Federal courts around the country. Bill Robinson, \nthe president of the American Bar Association, warned recently in a \nletter to Senate leaders that excessive vacancies and high caseloads \n``deprive . . . our federal courts of the capacity to deliver timely \njustice in civil matters and has real consequences for the financial \nwell-being of businesses and for individual litigants whose lives are \nput on hold pending resolution of their disputes.'' Justice Scalia, \nJustice Kennedy and Chief Justice Roberts have also warned of the \nserious problems created by persistent judicial vacancies. This is an \nissue affecting hardworking Americans who are denied justice when their \ncases are delayed by overburdened courts.\n  If caseloads were really a concern of Republican Senators, as they \ncontended when they filibustered the nomination last week of Caitlin \nHalligan to the D.C. Circuit, they would not have blocked us from \nvoting to confirm consensus nominees to fill judicial emergency \nvacancies. They would have consented to consider the nomination of \nJudge Adalberto Jordan of Florida which was reported unanimously on \nOctober to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Eleventh Circuit. \nHe is a well-respected Federal judge and his nomination is strongly \nsupported by Florida's Republican Senator, Mr. Rubio. Yet, despite the \njudicial emergency Republicans continue to delay consideration of that \nnomination. If they were really concerned with caseloads, they would \nhave consented to move forward to confirm Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of \nCalifornia, a well-qualified nominee to fill a judicial emergency \nvacancy on the Ninth Circuit, the busiest Federal appeals court in the \ncountry, with judges called upon to handle double the caseload of the \nother Federal circuit courts. Her nomination was reported unanimously \nby the Judiciary Committee and needs only a final vote by the Senate. \nJudge Nguyen is nominated to fill the judicial emergency vacancy that \nremains after the Republican filibuster of Goodwin Liu.\n  If they cared about caseloads, they should also have consented to \nvotes on the nominations of David Nuffer to the District of Utah, \nMichael Fitzgerald to the Central District of California, Gregg Costa \nto the Southern District of Texas, and David Guaderrama to the Western \nDistrict of Texas, all nominations to fill judicial emergency \nvacancies. Instead, those vacancies will not be filled for several more \nmonths.\n  If Republican Senators were concerned about ensuring that our courts \nhave the judges they need to administer justice for the American \npeople, they would not have refused consent for the Senate to consider \nthese consensus judicial nominees. The secret holds and obstructive \nblocks remind me of the Republican pocket filibusters that blocked more \nthan 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominations from Senate \nconsideration. When I became Chairman in 2001 and made the Committee \nblue slip process public for the first time and worked to confirm 100 \njudicial nominees of a conservative Republican President in 17 months, \nI hoped we had gotten past these partisan tactics. I am disappointed \nafter working for more than a decade to restore transparency and \nfairness to the process of considering judicial nominations that we see \nthe Senate Republicans again using anonymous holds to block progress at \nfilling judicial vacancies.\n  The actions of the Senate Republican leadership today to block action \non 18 qualified, consensus judicial nominations mirrors their action \nlast year when they stalled consideration of 19 judicial nominations \nthat had been reported by the Judiciary Committee and were ready for \nfinal Senate action at the end of last year. That was an abusive \nexercise in unnecessary delay that I believe was without precedent with \nrespect to such consensus nominees. In contrast, Democratic Senators \nproceeded to up or down votes on all 100 of President Bush's judicial \nnominations reported by the Judiciary Committee during his first two \nyears in office, and all 100 were confirmed before the end of the 107th \nCongress.\n  I had hoped and urged that such damaging obstruction not be repeated. \nI had urged that before we adjourned the Senate at least consider the \n18 judicial nominees voted on by the Judiciary Committee who are by any \nmeasure consensus nominees. With vacancies continuing at harmfully high \nlevels, the American people and our Federal courts cannot afford these \nunnecessary and damaging delays. It took until June of this year, \nhalfway into 2011, to consider and confirm 17 of the nominations that \ncould and should have been considered before the end of 2010. Yet \nSenate Republicans are employing the same destructive tactics.\n  For the second year in a row, Republicans have rejected the Senate's \ntraditional longstanding practice of considering all of the consensus \nnominations before the end of the Senate session, setting a standard \nthat before they did it last year was without precedent. We consented \nto consider all of the consensus nominations at the end of President \nReagan's third year in office and President George H.W. Bush's third \nyear in office, when no judicial nominations were left pending on the \nSenate Calendar. That is what we did at the end of the 1995 session, \nPresident Clinton's third year in office, when only a single nomination \nwas left pending on the Senate calendar.\n  That is also what we did at the end of President George W. Bush's \nthird year. Although some judicial nominations were left pending, they \nwere among the most controversial, extreme and ideological of President \nBush's nominees. They had previously been debated extensively by the \nSenate. The standard then was that noncontroversial judicial nominees \nreported by the Judiciary Committee were confirmed by the Senate before \nthe end of the year. That is the standard we should have followed this \nyear. Had we done so, another 18 judges would have been confirmed.\n  The Senate remains far behind where we should be in considering \nPresident Obama's judicial nominations. Nearly 3 years into his first \nterm, the Senate has confirmed a lower percentage of President Obama's \njudicial nominees than those of any President in the last 35 years. The \nSenate has confirmed just over 70 percent of President Obama's circuit \nand district nominees, with more than one in four not confirmed. In \nstark contrast, the Senate confirmed nearly 87 percent of President \nGeorge W. Bush's nominees, nearly 9 out of every 10 nominees he sent to \nthe Senate over two terms. That was a\n\n[[Page S8772]]\n\nhigher percentage of judicial nominees confirmed than President Clinton \nachieved and is far higher than President Obama's nominees.\n  Despite Senate Democrats joining Senate Republicans in confirming a \nhigh percentage of President Bush's judicial nominees, Republican \nSenators continue to point to the handful of President Bush's nominees \nwho were not confirmed to justify their across the board delays and \nobstruction of President Obama's nominees. During their filibuster last \nweek of Caitlin Halligan, President Obama's first nominee to fill the \n9th seat on the D.C. Circuit, we heard several Republicans seek to \njustify the misguided filibuster by pointing to the fact that Peter \nKeisler was not confirmed to fill the 11th seat on that same court. \nTheir selective recollection omits that the Senate did confirm four of \nPresident Bush's D.C. Circuit nominees, twice filling the 10th seat and \nonce the 11th.\n  In her recent column on the New York Times website, Linda Greenhouse \nwrote about how low the judicial confirmation process has sunk with the \nCaitlin Halligan filibuster and the disparate treatment of President \nObama's nominees. She wrote:\n\n     But it seems to me that this tit-for-tat goes only so far. \n     President Bush succeeded in putting four decidedly \n     conservative nominees on the D.C. Circuit. Three remain there \n     today: Janice Rogers Brown, Thomas B. Griffith, and Brett M. \n     Kavanaugh. The fourth was John G. Roberts Jr. It was his \n     seat, which Chief Justice Roberts vacated on Sept. 29, 2005, \n     to which Ms. Halligan was nominated. True, the Republicans \n     didn't get everything they wanted. But they seem determined \n     to make sure that President Obama gets nothing.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Ms. Greenhouse's column be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, if it so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we remain well behind the pace set by the \nSenate during President Bush's first term. By the end of his first \nterm, the Senate had confirmed 205 district and circuit nominees, had \nalready confirmed 168 by this point in his third year, and had lowered \njudicial vacancies to 46. In contrast, the Senate has confirmed only \n124 of President Obama's district and circuit nominees, leaving \njudicial vacancies at more than 80. The vacancy rate remains nearly \ndouble what it had been reduced to by this point in the Bush \nadministration. Senate action on the 18 consensus judicial nominations \npending before the Senate as it ends it session would have gone a long \nway to helping resolve the longstanding judicial vacancies that are \ndelaying justice for so many Americans in our Federal courts across the \ncountry.\n  When the Senate returns in January, I hope that Senate Republicans \nwill abandon these destructive practices and join with us to confirm \nthe qualified, consensus judicial nominations they have stalled. This \ncycle of unnecessary delays must end.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Dec. 14, 2011]\n\n                              Rock Bottom\n\n                         (By Linda Greenhouse)\n\n       Now that another highly qualified judicial nominee has been \n     left as road kill, the question is how much lower can the \n     confirmation process sink.\n       I'm referring to the defeat, by filibuster, last week of \n     Caitlin J. Halligan, President Obama's nominee to the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. \n     I last wrote about Ms. Halligan back in April, at which point \n     her nomination had been pending for more than six months. Now \n     it's dead, on a nearly party-line vote, the Democratic \n     leadership having fallen six votes short of the 60 needed to \n     invoke cloture.\n       The only Republican to break ranks was Senator Lisa \n     Murkowski of Alaska, who won reelection as a write-in \n     candidate and so owes nothing to her Republican bosses. No \n     such independence was shown by the two Republican senators \n     from Maine, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins, so-called \n     moderates whose efforts to explain their votes against \n     permitting Ms. Caitlin's nomination to come to a vote (a \n     simple majority would have approved it) were so contorted as \n     to be barely comprehensible. (Senator Collins mumbled \n     something about needing to shrink the appeals court, failing \n     to note that the Republicans invoked no such workload-related \n     compunctions when they filled not only the ninth seat, to \n     which Ms. Halligan was nominated, but the tenth as well. \n     There are now three vacancies on the 11-member court.)\n       Back in May, Senator Murkowski was also the only Republican \n     to vote to end the filibuster against Goodwin Liu, whom \n     President Obama had nominated to the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. (Now Justice \n     Liu, the former Berkeley law professor may have the last \n     laugh; Gov. Jerry Brown promptly named him to the California \n     Supreme Court.) At 41, Mr. Liu, a Rhodes scholar and former \n     Supreme Court law clerk, is a leading progressive legal \n     scholar of his generation. Although the Republicans came up \n     with other rationales for opposing him, including his Senate \n     Judiciary Committee testimony six years ago against the \n     Supreme Court confirmation of Samuel A. Alito Jr., the actual \n     reason was that they couldn't stand the thought of a young, \n     super smart, energetic liberal sitting on the appeals court, \n     in the launch position to become the first Asian-American on \n     the Supreme Court.\n       Mr. Liu is a friend of mine. I applauded his nomination and \n     was distressed at its fate. But since I don't believe that \n     judges are simply umpires who call balls and strikes, I get \n     the role of ideology in evaluating judicial nominees. What I \n     don't get is what happened to Ms.Halligan, whom I've met only \n     once or twice. She has no ideological markings other than \n     those that identify her with the mainstream of the New York \n     legal establishment, within which, following a clerkship with \n     Justice Stephen G. Breyer, she has made a spectacularly \n     successful career in both the public and private sectors. She \n     was solicitor general of New York State; head of the \n     appellate practice at a major law firm; and is now general \n     counsel to the Manhattan district attorney. She has argued \n     before the Supreme Court five times. Her 45th birthday was \n     Dec. 14.\n       This was not a fight over ideology. It was an effort to \n     keep the president from filling a seat on what is not just \n     another appeals court. The D.C. Circuit is not just a federal \n     court but a national one, with jurisdiction over federal \n     regulatory initiatives and habeas corpus appeals by \n     Guantanamo detainees. Next month, it will hear a potential \n     landmark case on the constitutionality of the Voting Rights \n     Act. Its caseload may not be huge, but its cases tend to be \n     dense, tough and vitally important.\n       When pressed on their treatment of Ms. Halligan, \n     Republicans typically invoke President George W. Bush's two \n     nominees whom the Democrats blocked from the D.C. Circuit, \n     Peter D. Keisler and Miguel A. Estrada, both highly qualified \n     and both prominent conservatives. (The classy Mr. Estrada \n     wrote to the Judiciary Committee in support of Ms. Halligan, \n     as did two dozen other members of leading law firms.)\n       But it seems to me that this tit-for-tat goes only so far. \n     President Bush succeeded in putting four decidedly \n     conservative nominees on the D.C. Circuit. Three remain there \n     today: Janice Rogers Brown, Thomas B. Griffith, and Brett M. \n     Kavanaugh. the fourth was John G. Roberts Jr. It was his \n     seat, which Chief Justice Roberts vacated on Sept. 29, 2005, \n     to which Ms. Halligan was nominated. True, the Republicans \n     didn't get everything they wanted. But they seem determined \n     to make sure that President Obama gets nothing.\n       Across the federal judiciary, confirmation has been \n     proceeding at a slow crawl. This week, the Judiciary \n     Committee held a scheduled confirmation hearing that could \n     have accommodated five nominees. But because Republican \n     senators claimed not to be finished reading the F.B.I. files \n     of four of the nominees, only one, Paul J. Watford, nominated \n     for the Ninth Circuit, was able to appear for his hearing. \n     Nominees who clear the committee without opposition have to \n     wait months for a floor vote because the Republicans won't \n     agree to a speedier schedule. Of 21 nominees now awaiting \n     floor votes, 18 had no committee opposition, but only a \n     handful, at most, will get a vote before the Senate recesses \n     for the year.\n       Just when news on the judicial front could not get more \n     discouraging, I came across something truly bizarre, a \n     position paper by the new front-runner among Republican \n     presidential candidates, Newt Gingrich. Under the title \n     ``Bringing the Courts Back Under the Constitution,'' Mr. \n     Gingrich launches a 28-page attack on ``lawless judges'' who \n     need to be reined in ``if we are going to retain American \n     freedoms and American identity.''\n       The document, he writes, ``serves as political notice to \n     the public and to the legislative and judicial branches that \n     a Gingrich administration will reject the theory of judicial \n     supremacy and will reject passivity as a response to Supreme \n     Court rulings that ignore executive and legislative concerns \n     and which seek to institute policy changes that more properly \n     rest with Congress.'' By rejecting passivity, Mr. Gingrich \n     means impeaching judges for ``unconstitutional'' rulings or, \n     failing to muster the two-thirds majority necessary for \n     impeachment, simply abolishing their positions.\n       Much of the document is a grab bag of long familiar right-\n     wing talking points (Judges who acknowledge foreign law? A \n     threat to ``American sovereignty!'') It is also just plain \n     sloppy, misspelling Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's name \n     throughout. But truly head-spinning is the tenuous hold that \n     this screed, from a onetime history professor, has on \n     American history.\n       Mr. Gingrich writes that the contemporary ``power grab by \n     the Supreme Court'' is a ``modern phenomenon and a dramatic \n     break from all previous American history.'' (Anyone remember \n     the court's response to the\n\n[[Page S8773]]\n\n     New Deal?) Rebuking the court for substituting its will for \n     that of Congress is downright strange, given that it is the \n     Republicans who have run to the federal courts, imploring \n     judges to strike down the Congressionally enacted Affordable \n     Care Act.\n       Perhaps strangest of all is Mr. Gingrich's attack on Cooper \n     v. Aaron, the court's celebrated response to the Little Rock \n     school crisis of 1958. The unanimous opinion, signed \n     individually by all nine justices for emphasis, held that \n     Arkansas and all other states were bound by the court's \n     interpretation of the equal protection guarantee four years \n     earlier in Brown v. Board of Education. Cooper v. Aaron was, \n     as Justice Breyer writes in his recent book, ``Making Our \n     Democracy Work,'' essential in its time and part of the \n     ``hard-earned victory for the rule of law'' that the Little \n     Rock story became. Newt Gingrich is unmoved. Cooper v. \n     Aaron's assertion of the Supreme Court's authority, he \n     writes, was ``factually and historically false.''\n       Thinking back to Ms. Halligan's failed nomination, I \n     actually don't disagree with everything in Mr. Gingrich's \n     manifesto. Four words in boldface type on page 20 caught my \n     attention: ``Electing the right Senators.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/17/senate-section/article/S8773-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to comment on the U.S. war in Iraq, \nwhich thankfully is coming to an end this month. Secretary of Defense \nLeon Panetta made this historic declaration on Thursday at a formal \nceremony in Baghdad.\n  This means many things to many people, but I am certain that it can't \nmean more than to the families of the brave men and women who will be \ncoming home for the holidays--home from Iraq for good. To those men and \nwomen I would like to say: We are proud of what you have accomplished--\nyou deposed a dictator and gave the people of Iraq a singular \nopportunity to chart their own future.\n  And to the families of these brave servicemembers, thank you for the \nloneliness and longing that you endured while your loved ones were \naway. And to those whose loved ones did not return, one can hardly \nimagine your loss.\n  The United States has been at war in Iraq for almost 9 years. \nPresident Obama made a promise to bring this war to a close--and I am \nproud to say he delivered on that promise.\n  Tens of thousands of troops have handed over security \nresponsibilities to their Iraqi counterparts. The U.S. Embassy in \nBaghdad will take the leading role, continuing our engagement through \ndiplomatic channels. Our remaining 4,000 troops will be home by the end \nof the year.\n  Whether you voted for or against the initial authorization for war--\nand I was one of the 23 to vote against it--we can all agree that its \ntoll has been higher than many could have imagined.\n  The disproportionate strain this war placed on our servicemembers and \ntheir families has been enormous--at times almost unbearable--in back-\nto-back deployments, in post-traumatic stress, lost loved ones, and \ndebilitating injuries.\n  Many are living with life-changing injuries.\n  Nearly 4,500 American service men and women have paid the ultimate \nprice for their country, including 116 brave men and women from \nIllinois. Another 1,100 Illinoisans have been wounded physically--just \nsome of the tens of thousands nationwide. Untold numbers still suffer \nfrom post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injuries.\n  And many brave civilians in our Foreign Service and NGO and \ncontractor communities also suffered death and injury.\n  Incredibly, more than 1.5 million Americans served in Iraq. It has \ncost the country almost $1 trillion--considerably more when we factor \nin the long-term costs related to the war.\n  But even as we bring our military deployment in Iraq to a close, it \nis important to remember that two critical commitments remain.\n  The first is the commitment to our men and women in uniform. They \nhave sacrificed so much for the Nation they love--sometimes \neverything--and we will not retreat from the sacred pledge we make to \neach and every servicemember to provide for their needs and for the \nneeds of their loved ones.\n  As President Obama said this week:\n\n       In America, our commitment to those who fight for our \n     freedom and our ideals doesn't end when our troops take off \n     the uniform.\n\n  The second is the enduring political commitment that the United \nStates continues to make to Iraq as a partner and ally and to the Iraqi \npeople. Iraq has also paid a high price--over 10,000 Iraqi soldiers and \npolice lost their lives in the war, and over 100,000 civilians. And \nIraq still faces significant leadership and governance challenges on \nthe path to a stable and peaceful future.\n  Yet, ultimately much of this future will depend on Iraqis and their \npolitical leadership. We have given them a unique--a historic--\nopportunity to govern themselves with tolerance, openness, and freedom.\n  We have done that with the precious blood and treasure of our Nation.\n  We hope that in the end Iraq will follow this path--that it will be \nan ally to the United States and a responsible democratic voice in the \nregion.\n  Through Foreign Service Officers at our Embassy, USAID projects \naround the country, or U.S. foreign assistance--America will continue \nto stand with our Iraqi allies in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, amid this hopeful news that the Iraq war is over, I \nwant to also mention the 1-year anniversary of a brutal election \ncrackdown last December 19 in Belarus.\n  I, Senator Lieberman, and others have come to the floor a number of \ntimes this year to talk about the tragic events of that day--the \nbarbaric crackdown that ensued and that continues today.\n  Last December, after decades of misrule by Belarusian strongman \nAlexander Lukashenko, there was a glimmer of hope that perhaps this \nlast dictator of Europe would ease his authoritarian regime and finally \nallow the Belarusian people to freely choose their own President in an \nhonest and open election.\n  Tragically, those hopes were quickly dashed when Lukashenko claimed \nanother term as President amid elections described by international \nmonitors as seriously flawed.\n  Lukashenko ordered his police force--incredibly still called the \nKGB--to brutally suppress opposition candidates, activists, and \nsupporters who gathered in protest on election night in Independence \nSquare in downtown Minsk.\n  Most of the political opponents who ran against him, along with \nhundreds of their followers, were arrested. Those with suspected ties \nto democratic parties and groups, human rights organizations, and what \nremains of the independent media in Belarus were targeted by the KGB \nfor months afterward.\n  I visited Belarus just weeks following the so-called elections. I met \nwith many of the family members of the jailed activists. Their stories \nwere heartbreaking. Missing fathers, mothers, sons, and brothers--\nlocked away in a Belarusian jail for the crime of running for public \noffice or peaceably protesting a rigged election.\n  Too often those detained were tortured and denied basic legal rights.\n  But that wasn't enough for Lukashenko.\n  Families of the detained were also harassed and Lukashenko even had \nthe temerity to try to seize the 3-year-old son of two activists he had \nimprisoned on bogus charges.\n  Listening to these heart-wrenching stories, I couldn't believe that \nsuch Soviet-era tactics were still being used in Europe today.\n  Lukashenko's actions this past year have pulled the country into \nisolation and made it the subject of international scorn.\n  Our Nation has joined efforts with the European Union to toughen \nsanctions on Belarus, including freezing the travel and assets of \nLukashenko and his enablers and henchmen.\n  I worked with Senators Lieberman, Cardin, McCain, Kirk, and others \nearlier this year to introduce S. Res. 105, which passed unanimously, \ncondemning the sham elections and calling on the Belarusian regime to \nrelease all political prisoners.\n  The resolution also called for new elections in Belarus that meet \ninternational standards, supported the tightening of sanctions against \nthe Belarusian state-owned oil and petrochemical company, and urged the\n\n[[Page S8774]]\n\nInternational Ice Hockey Federation to suspend the 2014 Ice Hockey \nChampionship in Minsk until all Belarusian political prisoners are \nreleased.\n  Let me add that former National Hockey League Hall of Famer and EU \nParliamentarian Peter Stastny; chair of the House Hockey Caucus, \nRepresentative Mike Quigley; and I wrote to International Ice Hockey \nFederation President Rene Fasel urging him not to give the dictatorial \nLukashenko regime the prestige afforded by the World Ice Hockey \nChampionship while political prisoners continue to languish in his KGB \nprisons.\n  So far the federation has ignored this commonsense appeal.\n  Today, a year after the election crackdown, at least 60 candidates \nand/or activists remain imprisoned or face harsh restrictions on their \nfreedoms, including limits on their travel, the ability to work in \ncertain professions, and to freely participate in the political \nprocess.\n  For example, Presidential candidate Andrei Sannikov remains in a KGB \njail. His family--which is granted only sporadic contact with him--\nsuspects that he has been tortured and pressured to sign a letter \nasking for pardon.\n  Mikalai Statkevich, Zmitser Dashkevich, Eduard Lobau, Paval \nSeviarynets, and Zmitser Bandarenka--just to name a few--are also still \nin jail for their participation in demonstrations during and after the \nDecember elections.\n  I hope the Ice Hockey Federation's corporate sponsors for the Minsk \nchampionship also recognize the potential stain to their image by \nsponsoring this event while Lukashenko continues to imprison and \ntorture these innocent people.\n  On the 1-year anniversary of the brutal crackdown we must not forget \nthe Belarusian people and those detained who only wished to exercise \ntheir basic rights of free speech and expression. That is why I am \npleased to see that just this week the Senate passed the Belarus \nDemocracy and Human Rights Act of 2011, which I hope the House will do \nas well before we break for recess.\n  Through legislation such as this and unwavering pressure on the \nLukashenko regime to open its political system, the people of the \nUnited States will continue to stand by the Belarusian people and \nsupport them in their efforts to bring justice to their country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/17/senate-section/article/S8774-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EXPIRING TAX PROVISIONS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in only two weeks, many critical tax \nincentives will expire. These provisions are vitally important to many \nfamilies and businesses. Once again, Congress is leaving town without \ntaking care of business. Once again, Congress is creating uncertainty. \nDuring these tough economic times, uncertainty in the tax arena is the \nlast thing that Americans need.\n  Today families are struggling because of lost jobs and high costs. \nExtending expiring tax incentives will help many American families get \nthrough these tough times.\n  For example, with the rising cost of a higher education, families \nneed help to cover their costs. The Tax Code includes a tuition \ndeduction to assist college students with the rising cost of tuition. \nIn 2009, about 2.4 million families took this much needed benefit.\n  Also expiring is a provision that gives tax relief to the people that \nwe trust with America's future, our children. Many teachers dedicated \ntheir lives to educating our young people. To further this endeavor, \nteachers take money from their own pockets to buy supplies for the \nclassroom. Many do not get much help with these costs. The least we can \ndo is provide a little tax relief. This bill would extend the teacher \nexpense deduction. Over 3.8 million families took this deduction in \n2009.\n  There are also several provisions expiring that benefit American \nbusinesses. Without the tax incentives, businesses will have less \ncertainty and fewer tools to compete in the global arena. This will \nfurther hamper job creation and growth.\n  One such incentive is the research and development credit. The \nprovision rewards companies that strive to create new and improved \nproducts and services by performing research and development. The \nextension of the R credit is essential to American businesses being \ncompetitive in the global market. The extension of the R credit will \nboost America's economy and create good-paying jobs.\n  There are also several provisions expiring that incentivize \nbusinesses to invest in alternative fuel sources. For example, the \ndollar-per-gallon credit for biodiesel and renewable diesel helps move \nus to a cleaner and more energy independent future.\n  These are just a few of the provisions that must be renewed each \nyear. Members on both sides of the aisle worked hard to extend these \nand many other provisions before the end of the year. We must continue \nto work to get these provisions extended so that American businesses \nand families can continue to receive these tax incentives. We must not \nkeep people in limbo. That is one of the very first and highest \npriorities we have when we come back in session in January.\n  I have been working with ranking member Hatch for more than a year \nnow on broad-based, fundamental tax reform. That reform is much needed \nand long overdue. A bedrock principle for reform is to increase the \ncertainty that Americans have in what their tax laws will be from year \nto year. So we will work hard to eliminate temporary provisions that \nare dependent on the whim of Congress at the end of each year for \nrenewal. In the interim, it is time to extend these provisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/17/senate-section/article/S8774-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:02 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

REPORT ON DESIGNATION OF THE HAQQANI NETWORK AS A \n                   FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A report of the Congressional Research Service on \n     relations between the United States and Pakistan states that \n     ``[t]he terrorist network led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his \n     son Sirajuddin, based in the FATA, is commonly identified as \n     the most dangerous of Afghan insurgent groups battling U.S.-\n     led forces in eastern Afghanistan''.\n       (2) The report further states that, in mid-2011, the \n     Haqqanis undertook several high-visibility attacks in \n     Afghanistan. First, a late June assault on the \n     Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul by 8 Haqqani gunmen and \n     suicide bombers left 18 people dead. Then, on September 10, a \n     truck bomb attack on a United States military base by Haqqani \n     fighters in the Wardak province injured 77 United States \n     troops and killed 5 Afghans. A September 13 attack on the \n     United States Embassy compound in Kabul involved an assault \n     that sparked a 20-hour-long gun battle and left 16 Afghans \n     dead, 5 police officers and at least 6 children among them.\n       (3) The report further states that ``U.S. and Afghan \n     officials concluded the Embassy attackers were members of the \n     Haqqani network''.\n       (4) In September 22, 2011, testimony before the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the Senate, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \n     of Staff Admiral Mullen stated that ``[t]he Haqqani network, \n     for one, acts as a veritable arm of Pakistan's Inter-Services \n     Intelligence agency. With ISI support, Haqqani operatives \n     plan and conducted that [September 13] truck bomb attack, as \n     well as the assault on our embassy. We also have credible \n     evidence they were behind the June 28th attack on the \n     Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul and a host of other smaller \n     but effective operations''.\n       (5) In October 27, 2011, testimony before the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, Secretary of \n     State Hillary Clinton stated that ``we are taking action to \n     target the Haqqani leadership on both sides of the border. \n     We're increasing international efforts to squeeze them \n     operationally and financially. We are already working with \n     the Pakistanis to target those who are behind a lot of the \n     attacks against Afghans and Americans. And I made it very \n     clear to the Pakistanis that the attack on our embassy was an \n     outrage and the attack on our forward operating base that \n     injured 77 of our soldiers was a similar outrage.''.\n       (6) At the same hearing, Secretary of State Clinton further \n     stated that ``I think everyone agrees that the Haqqani \n     Network has safe havens inside Pakistan; that those safe \n     havens give them a place to plan and direct operations that \n     kill Afghans and Americans.''.\n       (7) On November 1, 2011, the United States Government added \n     Haji Mali Kahn to a list of specially designated global \n     terrorists under Executive Order 13224. The Department of \n     State described Khan as ``a Haqqani Network commander'' who \n     has ``overseen hundreds of fighters, and has instructed his \n     subordinates to conduct terrorist acts.'' The designation \n     continued, ``Mali Khan has provided support and logistics to \n     the Haqqani Network, and has been involved in the planning \n     and execution of attacks in Afghanistan against civilians, \n     coalition forces, and Afghan police''. According to Jason \n     Blazakis, the chief of the Terrorist Designations Unit of the \n     Department of State, Khan also has links to al-Qaeda.\n       (8) Five other top Haqqani Network leaders have been placed \n     on the list of specially designated global terrorists under \n     Executive Order 13224 since 2008, and three of them have been \n     so placed in the last year. Sirajuddin Haqqani, the overall \n     leader of the Haqqani Network as well as the leader of the \n     Taliban's Mira shah Regional Military Shura, was designated \n     by the Secretary of State as a terrorist in March 2008, and \n     in March 2009, the Secretary of State put out a bounty of \n     $5,000,000 for information leading to his capture. The other \n     four individuals so designated are Nasiruddin Haqqani, Khalil \n     al Rahman Haqqani, Badruddin Haqqani, and Mullah Sangeen \n     Zadran.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) Report required.--Not later than 30 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this\n\n[[Page S8782]]\n\n     Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress--\n       (A) a detailed report on whether the Haqqani Network meets \n     the criteria for designation as a foreign terrorist \n     organization as set forth in section 219 of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189); and\n       (B) if the Secretary determines that the Haqqani Network \n     does not meet the criteria set forth under such section 219, \n     a detailed justification as to which criteria have not been \n     met.\n       (2) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n       (3) Appropriate committees of congress defined.--In this \n     subsection, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (A) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, and the Select Committee on Intelligence \n     of the Senate; and\n       (B) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs, and the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the House of Representatives.\n       (c) Construction.--Nothing in this Act may be construed to \n     infringe upon the sovereignty of Pakistan to combat militant \n     or terrorist groups operating inside the boundaries of \n     Pakistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/17/senate-section/article/S8782-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              JAMES M.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 351) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 351\n\n       Whereas on December 18, 1971, Public Law 92-203 (43 U.S.C. \n     1601 et seq.) was enacted to settle long-standing issues of \n     Alaska Native aboriginal land claims;\n       Whereas the pioneering work of Alaska Native leaders has \n     created a lasting legacy of professional and personal \n     success;\n       Whereas Alaska Native people have prospered from their own \n     initiative and innovative approaches to fostering economic \n     development through self-determination;\n       Whereas Alaska Natives have produced a significant number \n     of educated Alaska Natives who now serve in positions of \n     leadership in the State of Alaska and beyond;\n       Whereas Alaska Native people have risen to the challenge of \n     independently and productively managing their aboriginal \n     land, which has fostered sustainable businesses and created \n     employment opportunities for the people of the United States, \n     both across the country and globally;\n       Whereas Alaska Native people continue to serve in positions \n     of leadership in the State of Alaska and beyond;\n       Whereas the dedication and enthusiasm of the next \n     generation of Alaska Native leaders honors the previous \n     generation of Alaska Native leaders who worked diligently to \n     achieve the most significant Native land settlement in the \n     history of the United States;\n       Whereas the next generation of Alaska Native people will \n     continue to make positive changes in the world around them \n     through acquired leadership skills, cultural advocacy, and \n     community engagement;\n       Whereas the people of the United States have reason to \n     commemorate the economic and political contributions of \n     Alaska Native people; and\n       Whereas the people of the United States have reason to \n     honor the tremendous educational, social, political, \n     economic, and cultural achievements of the Alaska Native \n     people over the past 40 years: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes December 18, 2011, as the 40th anniversary \n     of the original enactment of the Alaska Native Claims \n     Settlement Act (Public Law 92-203; 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.);\n       (2) recognizes the significant educational, economic, \n     political, and cultural contributions of the Alaska Native \n     people over the past 40 years; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to \n     participate in activities that show support for the success \n     of the Native people and tribes of the State of Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/17/senate-section/article/S8782-6", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8782-S8783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 440 AND H.R. 3012\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I understand cloture has been filed on \nthe motion to proceed to the PIPA legislation. As one of the bipartisan \ngroup of Senators who strongly objects to proceeding to this bill, I \nbelieve it is important to begin to outline the very real dangers that \nare posed by the bill.\n  The primary architects of the Internet and our leading cyber security \nexperts have made it clear this legislation will undermine the key \ntechnologies that prevent fraud and protect consumers on the Internet.\n  Our Nation's leading first amendment scholars have made it clear that \nthis bill poses a serious threat to speech and civil liberties for all \nwho use the Internet, and our Nation's leading technology employers \nwarn that this bill presents a clear and present danger to innovation \nand job growth in an area that is going to be a major source of new \njobs for this century.\n  Today, along with Senator Moran of Kansas and Senator Cantwell of \nWashington, I have introduced the OPEN Act. We believe this is a \nreasonable and bipartisan alternative to the PIPA bill and to the \nlegislation that is before the other body, and we hope the Senate will \ntake the time to consider alternatives before taking action that could \ndeal an enormous body blow to a vital job engine for our economy.\n  Over the past few weeks, more than 1 million Americans have weighed \nin strongly in opposition to this legislation. Therefore, I will be \nworking with colleagues on both sides of the aisle over the next month \nto explain the basis for this widespread concern, and I intend to \nfollow through on a commitment that I made more than 1 year ago to \nfilibuster this bill when the Senate returns in January.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
