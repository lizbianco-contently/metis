Madam President, as the country watches, we continue to \nwork toward a bipartisan, bicameral agreement to keep the country \nrunning. Let me update the Senate on where we stand.\n  I want everyone to know how things looked from the beginning, but \nalso let's talk about how they look right now from the negotiating \ntable. Much of the criticism in this process has come from people who \nare not even sitting at the negotiating table. I am, and so is Speaker \nBoehner. I am glad he has returned to the conversation. It is obvious \nhe has a difficult situation on his hands, and I do not envy him in \nthat regard. He is getting a lot of pressure from the tea party folks \nto dig in his heels even if it hurts and destroys the recovery we have \ngoing now.\n  What is worse, the country does not care much about the tea party. \nThere is a new CNN poll out today that says this very directly. Let's \nput it this way: The people who care about the tea party are a very \nsmall number--who care about them positively. Those who think about \nthem negatively is very high, more than 50 percent. And that does not \nmean 50 percent favor the tea party. It does not. Fifty percent of the \nAmerican people do not want anything to do with the tea party. Only a \nsmall percentage identify with the tea party. The interesting thing and \nI think the important thing to the country is that the tea party's \nunpopularity continues to grow because the American people see how \nunreasonable they are.\n  Let me reiterate my hope that the Republican leadership recognizes \nthey cannot continue to be pulled to the\n\n[[Page S1946]]\n\nright by the radical, unrealistic, unreasonable--I repeat, radical--and \nunpopular faction, the tea party. I have always said that once the \neconomy gets better, they are going to fade out fairly quickly. It is \ngetting better, and they are fading out. If people want to move the \ncountry forward, they cannot let the tea party call the shots.\n  Our proposal still stands. It is a number the Republicans were for \nbefore they were against it. We got that number by relying on reality, \nnot ideology. I repeat, we know the answer lies in the middle. Neither \nparty can pass a budget without the other party. We have already proven \nthat. Neither Chamber can send it to the President without the other \nChamber.\n  I look forward to getting this done so we can avoid the many terrible \nconsequences that come with a shutdown. We do not want that to happen, \nand if it is up to us on this side of the aisle, it will not happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S1946-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, later this morning, the President is \nexpected to outline his vision for improving our Nation's energy \nsecurity. But, as we frequently have seen with this administration, \nwhat it says and what it does are often two very different things. So \nthis morning I would like to discuss some of the things the \nadministration has actually done when it comes to energy, and then I \nwould like to propose some things Republicans would do differently.\n  It should go without saying that Americans are ready for action on \nthis issue. With average gas prices approaching $4 a gallon in most \nparts of the country, growing uncertainty and unrest in the Middle \nEast, and a jobs crisis here at home, Americans want the President to \noutline a serious plan today which will make us less dependent, not \nmore, on foreign sources of oil and which stimulates job creation here. \nUnfortunately, what they have gotten instead are more of the same \nhalfhearted proposals Democrats have trotted out every other time \nAmericans get squeezed at the pump. Instead of facing the problem of \nhigher energy prices head-on, Democrats are once again paying \nlipservice to those concerns with fake solutions that only aim to \ndistract people from what they are really up to.\n  It is my hope that the President changes that tune today, but I am \nnot holding my breath because we have seen how this plays out many \ntimes before. Tell a Democrat in Washington that gas prices are too \nhigh, and as if on cue they will throw together a speech or a press \nconference to suggest that we open an underground oil reserve that was \ncreated to deal with calamities, not market pressures; they will take \nyou on a tour of some alternative car plant that promises to have one \nof its $100,000 prototypes to market 25 years down the road or they \nwill quietly release some report to the media about how energy \ncompanies really are not working hard enough to extract oil, while \nschizophrenically claiming American reserves are minuscule and that \nmore production is not the solution.\n  This last item is a perennial favorite of our friends on the other \nside. The idea here is to somehow blame energy companies for not \nproducing enough energy on their own. What Democrats don't mention, \nhowever, is that a drilling lease is nothing more than an agreement \nwith the government that a company has a right to explore for oil and \ngas in a certain area, not a guarantee that they will find it. They \nnever see fit to mention that most of the area that could be leased is \noff limits thanks to the redtape factory Democrats operate here in \nWashington. Honestly, are we supposed to believe that the same \nadministration that declared a blanket moratorium on all offshore \ndrilling off the gulf coast, which chased away rigs and jobs to other \ncountries, and which established new regulations that make getting a \nnew drilling permit virtually impossible, now believes that energy \ncompanies aren't drilling enough?\n  This doesn't even pass the laugh test, but it does suggest that \nDemocrats don't even believe their own arguments about decreased \nproduction not affecting price. It is my hope that the President \nacknowledges as much today--that when you shut down drilling, higher \nprices and fewer jobs are sure to follow.\n  The truth is we could use a lot more honesty on this whole issue from \nDemocrats. Despite what some on the other side might say, Republicans \nare as eager as Democrats to develop alternative sources of energy. But \neverybody knows it will take years, if not decades, to get to the point \nwhere they will be economically viable and widely used. The President's \ntarget is decades from now. But Americans should be able to expect \naction now, and all they get from Democrats is a pretty picture of some \nfar-off future we have been hearing about for decades, and not a word \nabout the things Democrats are doing to make it harder to find and use \nenergy we already have right here.\n  Initial news reports about the President's speech today mention that \nthe administration is determined to derive 80 percent of U.S. energy \nfrom clean energy sources in the year 2035. I am sure we could generate \na great deal of bipartisan support for much of what the President will \ncall for, assuming it doesn't involve Federal mandates. But what does \nany of this have to do with the crisis at hand--the crisis right now? \nThe guy who is trying to make ends meet wants to know what you are \ngoing to do for him today, not 24 years from now. But, of course, the \nadministration doesn't have anything to say to that guy because the \nadministration's energy policy isn't aimed at him. If it were, then the \nadministration would be locking down domestic energy sources. It \nwouldn't be looking to pass new regulations through the EPA that will \nimpose a national energy tax on every business, large and small. It \nwouldn't be telling our allies in Brazil that while it is great that \nthey found oil off their coast, those who want to search for oil off \nour coast and on our mainland can't. In other words, it is great the \nBrazilians are drilling offshore but not so good that we are. It \nwouldn't be telling job creators in the energy industry to look \nelsewhere.\n  In his remarks today, the President is also expected to call for \ndecreasing imports of foreign oil. Yet last week he told Brazilians \nthat he hopes America becomes a major customer of Brazilian oil. Well, \nwhich is it? Which is it, Mr. President? Clearly, on this issue, the \nPresident is telling people what he thinks they want to hear.\n  Over the past 2 years, the administration has undertaken what can \nonly be described as a war on American energy. It has canceled dozens \nof drilling leases, it has declared a moratorium on drilling off the \ngulf coast, it has increased permit fees, and it has prolonged public \ncomment periods. In short, it has done about everything it can to keep \nour energy sector from growing. As a result, thousands of U.S. workers \nhave lost their jobs as companies have been forced to look elsewhere \nfor a better business climate.\n  Consider this: Three of the areas we could tap in Alaska are thought \nto hold enough oil to replace our crude imports from the Persian Gulf \nfor nearly 65 years. So the problem isn't that we need to look \nelsewhere for our energy. The problem is that Democrats don't want us \nto use the energy we have. It is enough to make you wonder whether \nanybody in the White House has driven by a gas station lately.\n  No, the crisis we face is immediate and it requires immediate action, \nand that is why Republicans have come up with two concrete proposals \nthat will have a positive practical effect--two things we can do to \ngive Americans relief, job creators a reason to hire, and make all of \nus less dependent on foreign sources of oil.\n  First, let's increase American energy production by cutting the \nredtape and opening areas that the administration has either \ntemporarily blocked, stalled, or closed off to production.\n  Let's block any new regulations that will drive up production costs \nfor energy, including the administration's proposed new EPA regulations \non carbon emissions.\n  The first proposal is guaranteed--guaranteed--to create jobs by \nunlocking our energy resources. The second has been described as one of \nthe\n\n[[Page S1947]]\n\nbest proposals for growth and job creation to make it onto the Senate \ndocket in years. Let's be clear: The alternatives being offered by the \nother side are nothing more than a face-saving exercise aimed at \nallowing Senators who aren't serious about this issue to mislead their \nconstituents into believing they are.\n  But the American people have put up with distractions and face-saving \nexercises long enough. They have put up with near double-digit \nunemployment long enough. They have heard enough about the costly big \ngovernment proposals Democrats envision for the future. And frankly, \nthey have had it. It is time to address the problems right in front of \nus. It is time for the President to put forth a serious plan. When it \ncomes to energy, these problems are obvious. So are the answers. It is \ntime for lawmakers to come together and do what we know is right.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S1947-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I want to share some thoughts this \nmorning and to report to our colleagues on the analysis done by the \nCongressional Budget Office of the President's budget he has submitted \nto us and asked that we adopt.\n  The budget has been roundly criticized as in no way getting us off \nthis unsustainable path, and allowing the country to continue to head \ntoward a financial abyss. Expert after expert, witness after witness \nbefore the Budget Committee--on which I am the ranking Republican \nMember--has testified to the danger we face and the need for us to take \naction. The Congressional Budget Office, in sum, concludes that the \nvery insufficient reforms contained in the President's budget are more \ninsufficient than the President has said, when properly analyzed. It is \na very firm and severe rebuke to the President and his team of analysts \nwho presented it to us. It is not good.\n  I believe it is probably the most erroneous budget ever submitted to \nCongress, in changing the numbers by $2.3 trillion in debt. In other \nwords, the Congressional Budget Office says the budget submitted by the \nPresident, which was supposed to add to the debt some $13 trillion or \nso, is actually going to add $2 trillion more to the debt over 10 \nyears, more than doubling the national debt. This is a very serious \nmatter.\n  The budget presentation to the Congress continues a policy by this \nadministration to minimize the danger of the debt crisis we face. It \nhas been a sophisticated, long-term, continuous effort to not only say \nthat cuts are too severe, too extreme--as the talking points go--and \nthat, indeed, this President has things under control; that the debt \ncrisis is not real, and we don't have to take firm action. The \nPresident does not look people in the eye and explain the true \nsituation we are facing.\n  Indeed, this is the rhetoric they have used. The President has used \nthis language; Jack Lew, his Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, has used this language. They claim the budget they submitted \ncalls on us to ``live within our means.'' His budget causes us to live \nwithin our means. They also have used this phrase, more than once: ``It \nonly spends money that we have each year.'' Also they say that their \nbudget ``does not add more to the debt.'' At a press conference about \nthis, the press secretary to the White House was asked: Do you stand by \nthese statements? What did he say? Absolutely. And when Budget Director \nLew came before the Budget Committee, and I asked him about it, he \nstands by these statements. He didn't acknowledge they are in any way \nin error.\n  If we are going to have reform in America, if we are going to do \nsomething about the debt crisis this Nation faces, we have to be honest \nwith one another. We have to deal honestly with the grave challenges we \nface. We can't be in denial. We can't continue to say we are living \nwithin our means and that we are not going to add more to our debt.\n  Why do I say that? Well, the President's own budget said the deficits \nwould surge, would continue to be out there every single year, with the \nlowest single deficit in 10 years, according to his budget, to be $600 \nbillion and going up in the outyears to almost $800 billion.\n  What does CBO say about all of this? This is what they told us after \nthey analyzed the President's budget. Let me explain what happens. The \nPresident submits a budget to the Congress. We have our own \nCongressional Budget Office, and they analyze what the President \nproposes. They then give us a report on it and say what it means, if \nadopted; how it would impact our economy, how it would impact our debt, \nhow it would impact the financing of our government. So what does CBO \nsay? It says the President's debt-doubling budget adds more to the debt \nthan the President claims. The score reveals the President's budget \nnever once produces a deficit of less than $748 billion, and climbs to \na deficit in the tenth year of $1.2 trillion--one thousand two hundred \nbillion dollars.\n  I have been saying the lowest budget was $600 billion because that is \nwhat the President's own numbers said in the document he sent to us, \nbut CBO says no. The CBO Director and his team, for the most part, were \nin place when the Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress. They \nare a nonpartisan group that tries to give honest numbers and do honest \nwork. They are certainly not a Republican organization. They say the \nactual number was not going to be a $600 billion low annual deficit but \nthat the lowest deficit would be $748 billion, increasing to $1.2 \ntrillion.\n  You see, this is why the experts say we are on an unsustainable path. \nWe cannot continue. How much is $1.2 trillion? Well, the highest \ndeficit President Bush ever had was $450 billion, I believe, give or \ntake. That was way too high, and he was roundly criticized for that. \nBut this is three times that in the tenth year. This year, we are going \nto have a $1.6 trillion, $1.5 trillion deficit. In this fiscal year we \nwill have, for the third consecutive time, a trillion dollar deficit. \nThese are deficits the likes of which the Nation has never seen before \nand cannot sustain. It puts us on a path to financial instability and \ndanger. It is a path we must get off. We can do so, but it is going to \ntake some will. We are going to have to do some of the same things our \ncities and counties are doing.\n\n  Also, the CBO said that, using gimmicks, the President's budget \nconcealed a total of $2.3 trillion in deficit spending and $1.7 \ntrillion in increases of gross debt for the country. The debt to GDP \nreaches 116 percent in the 10th year.\n  Let's talk about that. Why is that important? Professors Rogoff and \nReinhart, who testified before our committee, have written a very \nsignificant and highly regarded book. Their book, ``This Time It's \nDifferent,'' says that from a study of sovereign nations all over the \nworld, when their debt reaches 100 percent of GDP, the economy is \npulled down. It has a depressing effect on their economy. The economy \nwill grow on average about 1 percent less than it would have grown \notherwise, which is huge.\n  When you are talking about economic growth of 2, 3, 4 percent, to \nhave a 1-percent reduction is a major drain on our economic growth, and \ngrowth is so critical for job creation and actually tax revenue to fund \nour government and get us out of the debt we are in. You cannot borrow \nyour way out of debt. The deeper you get into debt, the more it pulls \ndown the vitality and growth potential of your economy. We have to get \noff this path.\n  CBO says in the 10th year it will be 116. Senator Conrad, the \nDemocratic chairman of the Budget Committee, is very worried about this \nnumber. He\n\n[[Page S1948]]\n\nhad a chart about it at our hearing recently. He showed that this year \nfor the first time we will go over 100 percent of GDP in national debt. \nIt is about 5 percent now, and we will go over 100 percent and will \nstay over it under the President's budget. Experts tell me this is \nunsustainable. Something bad will happen to us.\n  In addition, when Secretary of Treasury Geithner appeared before our \ncommittee, he acknowledged the Rogoff and Reinhart analysis. He \nacknowledged that this high level of debt will weaken the growth in our \neconomy, and he added this: This level of debt creates a greater \npotential for an economic kickback, an economic catastrophe; another \nrecession could occur as a result of these high debts.\n  CBO analysis reveals a number of other things that are disturbing \nbecause they are so plainly false, so plainly gimmicky, and so plainly \ndesigned to mislead the American people about the true nature of this \nbudget that it, again, raises credibility questions about the White \nHouse and how they are explaining the situation we are in to the \nAmerican people. They seem to be denying we are in a crisis.\n  For example, this budget submitted by the White House assumes there \nwill be $315 billion for what we refer to as the doc fix in the final 8 \nyears of this 10-year budget. But there is no source of income for \nthat. They do not propose a tax increase. They do not propose any \nincome that would be there. The CBO says: You cannot just assume money \nis going to appear when there is no source for this money. It is a \nmanipulation of the numbers to try to hide the fact that there are no \nmoneys available to pay the doctors the kind of income they need to \ncontinue to treat Medicare patients. If we do not do something, \nphysicians will have their pay cut 20-percent-plus for treating \nMedicare patients. That is not healthy. It cannot be sustained. \nPhysicians will not work with another 20 percent cut. They get paid \nless for Medicare than any other source of work they do unless it is \nthe Federal Medicaid Program. CBO called them on it and said: No, you \ncannot score income when you show no source of that income.\n  What about transportation? There is a major increase proposed for \nspending on transportation next year, and their budget just assumes \nthere will be a $328 billion income surge for transportation. It is \ncalled a transportation tax, but we are told it will not be a gas tax. \nI have referred to it as the ``not-gas-tax tax'' because all we know \nabout this tax is they say it will not be a gas tax. They are talking \nabout a $328 billion tax increase of some kind but no proposal where it \nwould be, how it would be imposed, whether Congress would ever vote for \nit or not. They are not likely to vote for it, I have to tell you. CBO \nsays that is phantom money. You need a better plan than that because \notherwise your budget is just smoke and mirrors on that subject.\n  Remember, when we borrow money, we pay interest. The interest we paid \nlast year was $200 billion. As the debt goes up and increases, although \ninterest rates are very low now, they are going to increase some. \nAccording to CBO's analysis, with the debt more than doubling in the \nnext 10 years under the budget the President has submitted to us, the \nannual interest is over $900 billion. That is about one-fourth of what \nthe entire government spends today. We spend about $3.8 trillion. This \nis almost $1 trillion in interest in 1 year. Frankly, I think CBO's \nestimate of what the interest rates are going to be on our debt are \nprobably low.\n  It is this kind of debt, where your debt is over 100 percent GDP, \nthat puts you in a position where you could have a debt crisis kicking \nus back into another recession.\n  What we have to have--from the President and from our Democratic \nleadership here in the Senate--is an honest evaluation of where we are. \nThe President needs to look the American people in the eye and say: We \nare not on a course that we can sustain. Federal Reserve Chairman \nBernanke told us in January that we are on an unsustainable path. We \nhave to get off it. About these numbers that project out here for 10 \nyears, the doubling of the debt, Mr. Bernanke said: We are not going to \nget there because we will have a debt crisis before we get there, and \nthere will be much, much harder times getting our finances in order \nthan if we act today to get them in order. He said we wouldn't get \nthere with these projections; they are too severe, too damaging to our \neconomy.\n  Madam President, what time is left on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican side has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If some of my colleagues appear, I will be glad to \nyield the floor, but I will share a few more thoughts.\n  The President's budget does some other gimmicky things. He claims he \nhas a 5-year freeze on nondefense discretionary spending. He told the \nAmerican people that in the State of the Union Address. We have looked \nat those numbers, and it appears pretty clear that there is a 5-percent \nincrease in the discretionary spending next year. How do they \naccomplish that? They reclassify all discretionary transportation \nfunding as mandatory spending and say it is not discretionary. They \njust declare it is mandatory spending, and they say they have reduced \ndiscretionary spending by $7 billion. What kind of hokum is that? This \nis not worthy of the President of the United States and the Office of \nManagement and Budget, coming here with a gimmick like that--just \nredefine discretionary spending and say it is there and say: I have a \nfreeze in discretionary spending.\n  What else did they do? They hide another $9 billion in the reverse of \nthat, in one-time mandatory savings. Actually, they use it in the \ndiscretionary account, but they do not count it as increased spending. \nThat is $9 billion. And the President's proposed spending levels for \nnext year will be even further out of whack as a freeze because this \nCongress is going to reduce the spending this year, hopefully by the \nfull $61 billion the House has asked that we reduce it.\n  You say: Mr. Sessions, this is all partisan bickering. But it is not \npartisan bickering. We have bipartisan recognition in this Senate from \nSenator after Senator, Democrats as well as Republicans, who understand \nwe are on an unsustainable course, and they know we need to get off \nthis course. But I have to be critical about the President because he \nis not telling the American people the severity of the challenge we \nhave and he is not proposing a plan that will actually fix it, but \nactually he is proposing a plan that will make it worse. This is a \ncrisis. We have to confront this problem.\n  The President is going to have to move from denial to reality, to the \nreal world, and help us develop a plan that contains spending in \nAmerica just like is happening all over this country. Governor Cuomo is \ntalking about substantial reductions in spending in New York, as is \nGovernor Christie in New Jersey and Governor Brown in California.\n  I just saw my friend John McMillan, the head of agriculture and \nindustry in the State of Alabama. He has 200 employees. He said they \nare going to have to reduce 60. That is almost one-third of the \nemployees of his department. Do you think the department of agriculture \nand the industries of Alabama will cease to exist? I don't think so. I \nbet Mr. McMillan will figure out some way to perform most of the duties \nin his office. But he doesn't have the money, and when you don't have \nthe money, you have to make tough decisions.\n  The American people understand this. When they don't have money, they \ndon't spend. If they spend when they don't have money, they know they \nare taking a risk and they know it can't continue long. But this \nCongress does not get it. We are in a denial mode. We think we can just \ncontinue to spend forever, and we have the majority leader in the \nSenate whining about losing money for a cowboy poetry festival in \nNevada. Give me a break. When you don't have money, you have to make \ndecisions. That is just the plain fact.\n  What about next year's budget that the President proposes? The \neducation budget next year is proposed to get an 11-percent increase \nover the past 2 years, which have had surging increases. Indeed, most \nAmericans probably do not know that in this time of record deficits, \nover $1 trillion deficits, the last 3 years, the discretionary \naccounts--nondefense discretionary spending--increased 24 percent. And\n\n[[Page S1949]]\n\nnext year? They want another 11 percent for education, another 9.5 \npercent for the Energy Department, another huge increase for \ntransportation--the base, I believe, is over 10 percent but, including \nthe phantom revenue, they will see around a 60 percent increase.\n  Under the President's request, the State Department is demanding and \nexpecting to get over a 10-percent increase in spending. And inflation \nis 2 percent or less? How can we do this? The American people know this \nis not realistic. They know it is dangerous, and they want us to do \nsomething about it.\n  Frankly, I think that had something to do with the elections last \nfall. I think the American people were sending a message to a blind \nCongress that they expected us to do better on spending. Are we getting \nthe message? We are proposing huge increases in spending next year, \nfive times the rate of inflation in America, and we claim that is \nsomehow frugal and living within our means. When the lowest single \ndeficit over the next 10 years is projected to be $740-plus billion, \nthat is unacceptable.\n  We have to be careful about what we say about our economy. We have to \nkeep our economy moving forward. It is struggling. It is moving. We are \nhaving some good growth. We want to see that growth continue and \nexpand.\n  The job situation is not good. We need to have at least 150,000 to \n200,000 new jobs a month to stay level. That is about where we have \nbeen, 150,000 or 200,000 jobs. That is basically keeping us level. We \nneed more job growth than that. It is better having some jobs being \nadded than none, I acknowledge that, but it is not as strong as we need \nit to be.\n  One reason we are not having growth, as Professors Rogoff and \nReinhart have told us, is the debt pulling down our economy. It is \nputting a cloud over our economy. The whole world is watching the \nUnited States. Are we going to go off the cliff or will this Congress \nrise up and put us on a path to sound fiscal policy that creates \nconfidence in our financial situation; creates investment, growth, and \njobs. That is the road we need to be on. It will be a tougher road. We \nwill have to make some hard decisions about spending and which programs \nare going to get money and which ones aren't. Maybe all of them will \nhave to take some sort of cut, but we can do that. We will get the \ncountry on the right track, and America is not going to fall into the \nocean if we make some reductions in spending.\n  I will just point out that it is difficult to do that when we are in \na political world, according to the New York Times, where anybody who \nproposes to reduce spending is called an extremist. Senator Schumer \nstarted that. He got caught on a phone call saying we should use the \nword ``extremist.'' Cut $61 billion out of $3,800 billion in \nexpenditures; that is what the House has sent over here to us, a \nproposal that we reduce spending, under the continuing resolution, by \nSeptember 30, by $61 billion out of a total of $3,800 billion the \nFederal Government spends.\n  This is extreme, we are told, and the government is going to sink \ninto the ocean, and we cannot survive with these kind of reductions. So \nthey had a meeting. They all were right on message, according to the \nNew York Times. ``We are urging Mr. Boehner to abandon the extreme \nright wing,'' said Mrs. Boxer, urging the House to compromise on the \nscale of spending cuts and to drop proposed amendments that would deny \nfunding for Planned Parenthood.\n  Another Senator said, referring to the House Republicans as ``right \nwing extremist friends''--he is a real nice Senator. He did not want to \nbe too harsh, so he called them ``right wing extremist friends.'' That \nis better than not calling them friends, I suppose.\n  Another Senator decried Mr. Boehner as ``giving in to the extremes of \nhis party.'' Another closed by speaking of the ``relatively small group \nof ideologues who are an anchor dragging down the budget-negotiating \nprocess.''\n  Give me a break. $61 billion. If we cannot do that, what does the \nworld think about us? Did we really get a message from this election? \nDid we really understand that we are challenged now; that this is our \ntime in history to face up to the facts that we are on an unsustainable \nfiscal course that will lead us, as Mr. Bernanke said, to economic \ndisaster long before these projections come to a conclusion?\n  We cannot continue on this course. We have to get off this course. We \nowe it to every working American not to put this country back into \nanother recession. The truth is, we can do these reductions in \nspending. This government is not going to sink into the ocean. We are \ngoing to continue to serve the American people. If we do it, we will \nget on the right path, and this economy can continue to grow knowing \nthat we have gotten our fiscal house in order.\n  It is not that hard. I urge my colleagues to do so. Let's not give up \non the $61 billion total reduction in spending the House has asked us \nto meet. Let's do it, and let's be proud of it. Let's know then that we \nhave done something that will amount to a real change in the debt \ntrajectory we are on.\n  We have calculated it. My budget staff has looked at the numbers. A \n$61 billion reduction in baseline spending--which is what they are \nproposing--over 10 years will save $860 billion. It will reduce the \ndebt of America by almost $1 trillion. We need to do more of those \nkinds of things in the months ahead. If we do so, we can change the \ntrajectory we are on.\n  So I urge my colleagues, do not leave here talking about splitting \nthe baby and just seeing how little we can reduce spending. Let's go on \nand accept the House number. Let's embrace it. Let's make a decision to \nget our finances in order just like cities and counties and families \nare doing all over the country.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to say a few words about the \ndebate over the budget that is currently taking place here in \nWashington.\n  I wish to express a viewpoint that I think is shared by the vast \nmajority of the people in our country. That is, No. 1, I think we all \nrecognize the deficit of $1.6 trillion is an enormously serious \nproblem, as is the case with a $14 trillion national debt. I think most \nAmericans and virtually everybody in Congress understands this is an \nissue we have to deal with. However, at a time when this country is in \nthe midst of severe recession; when real unemployment--not official \nunemployment--is close to 16 percent; when poverty in America is \nincreasing and when we have the highest rate of childhood poverty of \nany major country on Earth; at a time when 50 million Americans have no \nhealth insurance at all and we are losing about 45,000 Americans every \nyear because they don't get access to a doctor; at a time when many of \nour people are working longer hours for lower wages, I think what most \nAmericans are saying is: Yes, we have to deal with the deficit, but we \nhave to deal with it in a way that is fair and in a way that requires \nshared sacrifice.\n  It is absolutely wrong to be talking about balancing the budget and \ndeficit reduction simply on the backs of working people, the middle \nclass, low-income people, the sick, the elderly, the\n\n[[Page S1950]]\n\nmost vulnerable people in this country. That is morally wrong and \neconomically unwise. What we must be talking about is shared sacrifice \nwhere all segments of our society are participating in the effort to \nbalance the budget and reduce our deficit.\n  While the middle class in this country is disappearing and while \npoverty is increasing, there is another reality this Senate must \naddress, and that is that the people on top are doing phenomenally \nwell. Many of my colleagues have seen articles which talk about \ncorporate profits today being at all-time highs. The middle class is \ncollapsing, poverty is increasing, and corporate profits are at an all-\ntime high. Today, the wealthiest people in our country are doing \nphenomenally well. Our friends on Wall Street, who helped cause the \nrecession we are in through their greed and their recklessness and \nillegal behavior, are now earning more money than they have ever earned \nbefore. Three out of the four largest banks today, before we bailed \nthem out because they were too big to fail, are even bigger. So the \nguys on Wall Street are making more money than they did before we \nbailed them out, corporate profits are at record-breaking levels, and \nthe wealthiest people in this country are doing phenomenally well.\n  In a recent 25-year period, 80 percent of all income went to the top \n1 percent, and we now have a situation where the top 1 percent earn \nabout 23 percent of all income in America more than the bottom 50 \npercent. So that is where we are: corporate profits soaring, wealthiest \npeople doing phenomenally well. Then we have folks who come here and \nsay, Well, we have to balance the budget. We have to move toward \ndeficit reduction. The way we do it is on the backs of those people in \nthe middle class, working class, lower income people who are already \nbeing beaten over the head because of the recession.\n  I would point out that the deficit reduction package passed by our \nRepublican colleagues in the House would cut Head Start by $1.1 \nbillion, throwing over 200,000 little children out of Head Start. There \nis a major childcare crisis in America today. We have to expand Head \nStart. They want to throw 200,000 kids off of Head Start.\n  With 50 million Americans having no health insurance--people can't \nget to a primary health care doctor; they are getting sick when they \nshouldn't be sick; they are ending up in the emergency room; they are \nending up in the hospital--our Republican friends want to cut $1.3 \nbillion from community health centers, denying 11 million patients \naccess to primary health care. They are balancing the budget on the \nbacks of little kids, low-income kids; balancing the budget on the \nbacks of sick people who have no access to a doctor. College education \ncosts are soaring. Middle-class families can't afford it. Our \nRepublican friends want to reduce the Pell grant program--the major \nsource of Federal funding for moderate and low-income families for \nsending their kids to college--by 17 percent, which would mean that \nover 9 million low-income college students would lose some or all of \ntheir Pell grants.\n  The Community Service Block Grant Program would be cut by $405 \nmillion, and that is the program that helps the poorest of the poor get \nby day by day. And on and on it goes.\n  I wish to introduce another aspect into this discussion. Not only \nhave we given huge tax breaks to the richest people in this country, \ndriving up the deficit--and I hear very little discussion about asking \nthem to pay any more to help us toward deficit reduction--we have \nanother scandal out there. Major corporation after major corporation, \nmany of which have powerful lobbyists right here on Capitol Hill, not \nonly pay nothing in taxes but in many cases get a refund from the IRS. \nI wish to list the 10 worst corporate tax avoiders: ExxonMobil, the \nlargest oil company in the world, made $19 billion in profits in 2009. \nExxon not only paid no Federal income taxes, it actually received a \n$156 million rebate from the IRS, according to SEC filings. So instead \nof throwing children off of Head Start or cutting back on community \nhealth centers, maybe--maybe--we want to ask ExxonMobil to actually pay \ntaxes rather than get a refund.\n  Bank of America, No. 2, received a $1.9 billion tax refund from the \nIRS last year. Bank of America received a $1.9 billion tax refund, \nalthough it made $4.4 billion in profits. Maybe they might want to \ncontribute a little bit more before we cut back, as the Republicans \nwant, on the Social Security Administration.\n  Over the past 5 years, while General Electric made $26 billion in \nprofits in the United States, it received a $4.1 billion refund from \nthe IRS.\n  Chevron received a $19 million refund from the IRS last year after it \nmade $10 billion in profits in 2009.\n  If you are a working stiff and making $30,000 to $40,000 a year, you \nare paying taxes, but if you are Chevron and you made $10 billion in \nprofits in 2009, you don't have to pay any taxes; you get a $19 million \nrefund. Yes, let's go after little kids; let's go after the elderly; \nlet's go after the sick; let's go after the most vulnerable; but \napparently in the Senate, we can't ask Chevron to pay taxes.\n  Boeing, which received a $30 billion contract from the Pentagon to \nbuild 179 airborne tankers, got a $124 million refund from the IRS last \nyear. Valero Energy, the 25th largest company in America, with $68 \nbillion in sales last year, received a $157 million tax refund check \nfrom the IRS.\n  Goldman Sachs, our good friends on Wall Street, in 2008 only paid 1.1 \npercent of its income in taxes, even though it earned a profit of $2.3 \nbillion and received almost $800 million from the Federal Reserve and \nU.S. Treasury Department.\n  Citigroup last year made more than $4 billion in profits but paid no \nFederal income taxes.\n  ConocoPhillips, the fifth largest oil company in the United States, \nmade $16 billion in profits from 2007 through 2009 and received $451 \nmillion in tax breaks through the oil and gas manufacturing deductions.\n  Over the past 5 years, Carnival Cruise Lines made more than $11 \nbillion in profits, but its Federal income tax rates dropped during \nthose years to 1.1 percent.\n  So the point is if you go out and you work for a living, you pay 10, \n15 percent of your income in taxes. But if you are on Wall Street, if \nyou are a major oil company and have lobbyists all over this place, not \nonly can you avoid paying any taxes, in many cases you will actually \nget a tax refund from the IRS.\n  What is the point? The point is that at a time when we have a $1.6 \ntrillion deficit, maybe we have to reduce that deficit not simply on \nthe backs of working families, low-income people, children, the sick, \nthe elderly; maybe--maybe--we might want to call for shared sacrifice. \nMaybe ExxonMobil and some of the large oil companies might be asked to \npay something in taxes. Maybe General Electric might be asked to pay \nsomething in taxes. Maybe the wealthiest people in this country might \nbe asked to pay something in taxes.\n  These are serious times for our country and we need serious answers. \nWe need shared sacrifice.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO.

Madam President, I rise this morning to talk about \njobs, the economy, and our Nation's energy.\n  In a few minutes the President will be speaking at Georgetown \nUniversity about energy. I rise today to talk about the President's \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and his efforts to regulate our global \nclimate by taxing, by using a backdoor method called cap and tax, a \nproposal that we will be debating here in the Senate and are debating \ntoday.\n  Folks back home recall the debate about cap and tax. It happened over \nthe last few years. Yet the Environmental Protection Agency is trying \ndo it through a backdoor method. Attempts to pass this massive energy \ntax on to the hard-working families all across the country have failed. \nIt failed in Congress, and it failed because the American public has \nsaid we do not want new energy taxes.\n\n[[Page S1951]]\n\n  Americans don't want to pay more for gasoline at the pump. Yet they \nare experiencing it every day. I saw it this past weekend in Wyoming. \nWeek after week the price at the pump goes up. American families don't \nwant to pay more for electricity to heat their homes and run their \nsmall businesses. Yet the President's Environmental Protection Agency \nis attempting to bypass this Congress and enact their own cap-and-tax \npolicy through regulation.\n  Cap and tax is unacceptable to the American people. It was \nunacceptable 3 years ago, it was unacceptable 2 years ago, it was \nunacceptable last year, and it is still unacceptable today.\n  The EPA may think they know better than the American people. That is \nwhy this EPA must be stopped. There are different ways to stop the \nEPA's ongoing regulations. We have three proposals before us today, but \nonly one is a solution. Of the other amendments, one is a surrender and \nanother is a distraction. The McConnell-Inhofe amendment, the one I \nsupport, is an amendment that will block the EPA's attempt to enact the \nsame cap-and-tax bill that has been defeated time and time again on \nCapitol Hill. That is the solution I will talk about shortly.\n  However, I wish to talk about the amendments I have concern with. One \nis the Baucus amendment. I do not support the Baucus amendment. To me, \nit is an attempt to surrender in the face of the EPA's dramatic \nregulatory overreach. It is the so-called ``agriculture exemption.''\n  When I talk to people in agriculture--the so-called agricultural \nexemption doesn't shield agricultural producers from increased fuel, \nincreased energy, and increased fertilizer costs.\n  The factories, refineries, and powerplants that are the glue that \nholds the farming industry together and allows it to function will be \nhit with significant energy taxes under the Baucus amendment.\n  The aftershock will be felt by American small businesses and farmers \nacross the West and the Midwest.\n  Farmers and small businesses will face higher electricity costs, \nhigher gasoline costs, higher diesel costs, and higher fertilizer \ncosts.\n  Everything from driving a tractor to shipping your produce to market \nwill skyrocket.\n  Farms will close, and the cost of produce at the local grocery store \nwill go up for all Americans.\n  We are not just seeing pain at the pump; people are paying more for \ngas, but they are also paying more for groceries these days. This will \nmake that worse.\n  If you have any doubt about the impact the Baucus amendment will have \non farms, talk to the American Farm Bureau because they oppose this \namendment.\n  Another amendment dealing with the EPA is the Rockefeller amendment. \nIt calls for a partial delay of EPA regulations for 2 years. This is \nnot a delay, it is a distraction. The question is, does it truly delay \nthe regulation of greenhouse gases? Not really. A couple are delayed--\ntwo of six--but four greenhouse gases are not. If that sounds like only \na partial delay, you are correct, it is only partial.\n  Does the Rockefeller amendment put in safeguards to ensure the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency abides by the 2-year partial delay? No, \nit doesn't. The Rockefeller amendment does nothing to stop the EPA from \nstalling construction permits during the 2 years.\n  The Rockefeller amendment does nothing to prevent EPA from \nretroactively requiring costly mandates on small businesses, \npowerplants, and manufacturing facilities. It also does not prevent \nclimate change nuisance suits, which are filed in court by groups \nopposed to fossil fuel development.\n  It seems to me the Rockefeller amendment only delays job growth, \nwhile giving a green light to EPA to proceed with regulations that will \nbe costly to American families and to our American economy.\n  For those of us looking to protect jobs across the country and \nrestore Congress's authority to determine our own energy future, this \ntype of amendment can only be described as a partial delay. It is a \ndistraction.\n  We don't need a surrender or a distraction; what we need is a \nsolution.\n  The solution is the McConnell-Inhofe amendment. This amendment \nrestores the Clean Air Act to its true meaning and congressional \nintent. Let me get back to that. This amendment restores the Clean Air \nAct to its true meaning and congressional intent.\n  The McConnell-Inhofe amendment blocks EPA's attempt to enact cap and \ntax. They are trying to do it in a backdoor route with cap and tax. But \nthe McConnell amendment blocks EPA's attempt to enact cap and tax by \nblocking EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean \nAir Act, by repealing the EPA's endangerment finding that says carbon \ndioxide is a threat to public health, by repealing the tailoring rule \nthat says EPA can arbitrarily pick and choose which businesses they \nwant to target, and also by applying it immediately to all greenhouse \ngases.\n  This is the amendment we must pass to rein in EPA and to protect \njobs. This is the amendment that has been endorsed by the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the American Farm Bureau, and \nAmericans for Prosperity. The list of supporters of this amendment is \nextensive.\n  We need to get serious about America's energy future. Congress needs \nthe time to get this policy right. We need to make America's energy as \nclean as we can, as fast as we can, and do it without raising energy \nprices or hurting American families and jobs.\n  The McConnell-Inhofe amendment is the right solution.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in reaction to President \nObama's speech this week outlining what he believes to be in our \nNation's interest in Libya. Last week, while working in Nevada, many of \nmy constituents asked what my thoughts were on the military action we \nhave taken in Libya. My answer to them was simply that I did not \nbelieve the President had outlined a vital U.S.-American interest in \nour engagement in Libya, and that the United States cannot afford to be \nthe police force of the world.\n  This week, with the President's address to the Nation, I had hoped I \nwould hear something to change my mind or, better yet, something that \nwould instill confidence about the President's decision, but, \nunfortunately, this address provided the American people with many more \nquestions than answers. President Obama left me wondering why any vital \nU.S.-American interest in Libya would justify military action.\n  He said refugees would stream into Tunisia and Egypt, but we often \naid refugees without F-15s. He said we needed to preserve the writ of \nthe United Nations Security Council, but he did not explain why the \nsafety of our men and women in uniform should ever be put at the \nservice of that body. He said we needed to show dictators across the \nregion that they cannot use violence to cling to power, but if \nPresident Obama's policy fails to get rid of Qadhafi, that is exactly \nthe lesson they will learn.\n  The President left me wondering about the definition of ``military \nsuccess.'' He said our military mission is limited, but how do we know \nwhen we have hit our limit? Is it when Qadhafi poses no threat to \ncivilians? Is it when all of Qadhafi's thugs are gone, or is it when \nQadhafi steps down?\n  This week's address from President Obama makes it clear that we may \nbe headed for another decade-long military operation in the Middle \nEast. Our service men and women cannot afford to be engaged in another \nMiddle East dispute; they are stretched thin enough as it is.\n  This weekend, Secretary of Defense Gates said, when asked about \nwhether Libya is in our vital interest:\n\n       No, I don't think [Libya] is a vital interest for the \n     United States. . . .\n\n  So what are we doing? I understand the President may sincerely want \nto\n\n[[Page S1952]]\n\nsave lives in Libya, but our country cannot afford to be the police \nforce for the rest of the world. We did not step in when there was \ngenocide in Darfur. As a matter of fact, there is a story today which I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From www.reuters.com, Mar. 29, 2011]\n\n              Darfuris Feel Betrayed by Libya No-Fly Zone\n\n                          (By Opheera McDoom)\n\n       Khartoum.--People in Darfur watching how quickly a no-fly \n     zone was imposed on Libya by the United States and its allies \n     said they felt betrayed because U.S. President Barack Obama \n     had broken his promise to protect them in the same way from \n     government attacks.\n       The government in Khartoum is still defying a U.N. Security \n     Council resolution by bombing rebels in Darfur.\n       While Darfur was a foreign policy priority for Obama during \n     his election campaign, the festering conflict has fallen into \n     oblivion since his election.\n       Sudan's President Omar Hassan al-Bashir is wanted by the \n     International Criminal Court for genocide and war crimes in \n     Darfur, where the United Nations estimates at least 300,000 \n     people have died in a humanitarian crisis sparked by a brutal \n     counter-insurgency campaign that began in 2003.\n       A prominent Darfuri leader said a no-fly zone would protect \n     civilians in the isolated region.\n       ``Right now--forget in the past--right now what is \n     happening in Darfur is worse than in Libya,'' said Barouda \n     Sandal of the opposition Popular Congress Party. ``The air \n     force is bombing civilians and thousands are fleeing.''\n       Peacekeepers from the joint U.N.-African Union force this \n     week confirmed aerial bombardments in areas they visited and \n     said more than 70,000 people had fled fighting in the past \n     few months alone, swelling miserable camps already housing \n     more than two million people seeking refuge from the \n     fighting.\n\n\n                              NO-FLY ZONE\n\n       During his 2008 presidential campaign, Obama backed a no-\n     fly zone in Sudan's west and tougher U.S. sanctions on \n     Khartoum. But once in the White House, his special envoy \n     eased the embargo and promised to remove Sudan from the list \n     of state sponsors of terror.\n       Washington was the first capital to label Darfur's conflict \n     genocide, infuriating Khartoum, which blames Western media \n     for exaggerating a conflict it describes as tribal. It says \n     10,000 people have died in the violence.\n       But quick U.S. intervention in Libya on humanitarian \n     grounds has provoked debate as to what is the standard for \n     intervention in foreign conflicts.\n       ``The swiftness of the international community's response \n     to Colonel Gaddafi's bloody repression of the Libyan uprising \n     has surprised no one more than the diplomats involved,'' \n     journalist Rebecca Tinsley wrote in the Huffington Post.\n       ``At the same time it has left survivors of state-sponsored \n     massacres in Darfur, Rwanda . . . bewildered by our double \n     standards.''\n       The U.S. embassy in Sudan said Washington remained engaged \n     in Darfur, giving aid and supporting the peacekeeping \n     mission.\n       ``It is not inconsistent for the United States to play \n     different roles in each vital international effort,'' it said \n     in a written statement.\n       Many Darfuris believe the quick military intervention in \n     Libya was because of its oil, rather than for humanitarian \n     reasons.\n       ``We are astonished that over a few weeks about 1,000 \n     Libyans have been killed and they went in, but in Darfur they \n     killed hundreds of thousands yet no one comes. And Darfuris \n     are feeling very bad about this,'' said Ibrahim el-Helu, a \n     commander from the Sudan Liberation Movement, a Darfur rebel \n     group.\n       ``Hundreds of Darfuris are calling me, saying let them come \n     and drill for oil here if it means they will come and protect \n     us too,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The headline reads:\n\n       Darfuries feel betrayed by Libya no-fly zone.\n\n  We didn't step in in Darfur. We also didn't help the people of \nRwanda. The last time we did try to police a situation such as this was \nin Somalia, and we all know how that ended.\n  That is probably why we haven't intervened in the Ivory Coast, even \nthough there are more than 1 million people who have fled their homes \nand hundreds of thousands have crossed into neighboring countries.\n  Other nations such as France wanted to take the lead on addressing \nthe Libyan situation. I believe we should have allowed them to do so. \nThe President's address made it clear that our military action in Libya \nis less about humanitarianism and more about realizing a \nmultilateralist fantasy.\n  While Secretary Clinton has continued to refer to S. Res. 85 as the \nSenate's endorsement of the President's establishment of a no-fly zone, \nI would like to point out to the American people that this talking \npoint is misleading. This is what she said:\n\n       The U.S. Senate called for a no-fly zone in a resolution \n     that it passed, I think, on March the 1st, and that mission \n     is on the brink of having been accomplished. And there was a \n     lot of congressional support to do something.\n\n  This Senate resolution received the same amount of consideration that \na bill to name a post office has. This legislation was hotlined. There \nwas no debate allowed, no legislative language provided to consider. \nThere was no vote. S. Res. 85 described a no-fly zone as a possible \ncourse of action for the U.N. Security Council's consideration. It did \nnot instruct the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations to take action, \nlet alone authorize a military operation. Using the hotline process for \nthis resolution as a congressional endorsement for the President's \npolicy is simply not an adequate use of Congress's role in authorizing \nmilitary action. The administration unilaterally developed, planned, \nand executed its no-fly zone policy. The President consulted with the \nUnited Nations, he consulted with NATO, he consulted with the Arab \nLeague, but he did not consult with the body that is mandated under the \nConstitution: the U.S. Congress. There was no congressional approval or \noversight of this military commitment.\n  The Senate resolution simply does not authorize or endorse the use of \nforce. It urges a multilateral body to consider a no-fly zone as a \npossible course of action. This is not the legal equivalent of an \nauthorization to use force. This is not the political equivalent of \nthat authorization. So what is it?\n  I believe it is a disrespectful checking of the box for congressional \napproval by the administration's unilateral action. As Secretary Gates \nhas stated, there is not a vital interest for our Nation in Libya, \nwhich means now that we are engaged there, the United States is at risk \nof mission creep and the possibility of a ``take two'' of what happened \nin Somalia.\n  Before our military intervention, U.S. interests in Libya were \nminimal. Our intervention has overinflated our interests in Libya's \ncivil war. If Qadhafi stays in power--and many believe he will--and \ncontinues to fire on innocent civilians, demands for U.S. military \ncapabilities will go up. This sounds strikingly similar to what \nhappened in Somalia. Furthermore, this engagement has explicitly \nannounced our support for the rebel cause. Yet we don't even know who \nor what these rebels are or what their ideology is. President Obama's \nmilitary strategy risks damaging our already shaky credibility in this \nunstable region of the world. Even with complete military success, \nPresident Obama's policy may appear to fail because he has disconnected \nmilitary means--a no-fly zone--from his strategic ends--Qadhafi's \nremoval.\n  The Obama administration has confused our priorities in the Middle \nEast. Operations in Libya divert our focus from unstable situations in \nSyria, Yemen, and Iran, all of which are more important for U.S. \ninterests. Operations in Libya muddle our interests and undermine our \nability to lead across the region. If turmoil in Libya calls for a no-\nfly zone, are we prepared to make the same commitments in Syria and \nIran, where we have far greater strategic interests? If not, what kind \nof message does this send to reformers in those countries?\n  Last year, when there was an uprising in Iran, the President \nbasically said: Hands off. It is not in our interest. We can't do \nanything about it. What kind of a message does that send?\n  Some have argued that oil is the underlying reason for our engagement \nin Libya. Whether this is the case or not, the perception is there. \nInstead of lessening our dependence on dangerous foreign oil, this \nadministration has steadfastly refused to allow the United States to \ntap into its own oil reserves.\n  In Alaska alone there are three places that would supply the United \nStates with 65 years' worth of what we import from the Persian Gulf.\n  Unfortunately, as strongly as I believe in renewable energy, it is \ngoing to take us 30 to 40 years for renewable energy infrastructure to \nbe up and running enough to start contributing significantly to our \nNation's energy supply, which is why we need to act to get\n\n[[Page S1953]]\n\nmore oil, natural gas, and other types of American fossil fuels into \nour energy supply today.\n  I would argue that there is a vital U.S.-American interest to harvest \nour own energy or we risk engaging in a military conflict every time \nthose in an unstable Middle East cannot get along.\n  This is absolutely a critical debate. There are legitimate \ndifferences on both sides of the debate, but this is a debate that \nCongress should be willing to have: whether the President should have \nconsulted and whether this is in our vital U.S.-American interest to go \nforward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor again today to once \nmore honor another great Federal employee.\n  I know the Presiding Officer and I, as well as some of our \ncolleagues, recognize that in the State of New Mexico and the \nCommonwealth of Virginia and here in Washington, there are countless \nFederal employees who do great things in terms of public service and \ndon't often get the recognition they deserve.\n  As we debate the balance of this year's budget and think about the \nincredible issues in front of us in terms of our debt and deficit--\nissues that have to be confronted--we also sometimes have to remember \nthat our actions or our failure to act has enormous consequences on the \npeople who defend our country, protect our homeland, or make sure the \nbasic operations of government work. It could be making sure our \nFederal parks are open or making sure the folks here in Washington who \nare Federal police are on the job. Sometimes our failure to agree or \nour failure to come together on particularly the predictability of the \nbalance of this fiscal year has an effect on their lives.\n  That is not the subject of my purpose of rising today, but I do think \nit is important to bear that in mind as I continue the tradition that \nwas started by Senator Kaufman last year of coming to the floor on a \nregular basis to honor Federal employees.\n  Time and again, I have seen how the skills and dedication of Federal \nworkers have yielded groundbreaking benefits for our country. Today, I \nwish to highlight a Federal worker who is at the forefront of modern \ntechnology.\n  Joshua Bienfang is a physicist at the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology. He created a new method of transmitting encrypted \nmessages in a 100-percent secure way by using quantum physics. I know \nthe Presiding Officer is an expert in quantum physics. I, \nunfortunately, am not. But since there are so many business operations \nin the great State of New Mexico, I know he is very familiar with these \nsubjects, but I still have a great deal to learn. My understanding is \nthat in practical terms, this means that message interceptors will be \nunable to capture sensitive information--critically important to \nprotecting the homeland.\n  Prior to Mr. Bienfang's breakthrough, quantum cryptography was \nthought to be a largely experimental means of transmission. But he was \nable to both secure messages and speed up their delivery. In fact, this \ntechnology has set world speed records in the quantum cryptographic \nfield. I know the Presiding Officer probably knows what those speed \nrecords are. I don't know. His background in quantum physics makes him \nunderstand that, but I think it is a very remarkable achievement.\n  Without a doubt, Mr. Bienfang's discovery will be greatly important \nto our national security as well as commerce and equally important to \nthe privacy of medical records. His work also demonstrates the \ndiversity of our Federal workforce. While we may have our fair share of \nbureaucrats, there are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of \nscientists and researchers doing cutting-edge work within the Federal \nGovernment and applying their intellect to benefit the American people.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Joshua Bienfang \nas well as those at the National Institute of Standard and Technology \non their success, which will no doubt aid Americans in the years to \ncome.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I come to the floor as a physician who practiced \nmedicine in Wyoming for a quarter of a century as an orthopaedic \nsurgeon, taking care of families across the State, and to present a \nphysician's second opinion on what has happened with the health care \nlaw people are dealing with. As Nancy Pelosi said 1 year ago: ``First \nwe have to pass it before you get to find out what's in it.''\n  The American people are finding out what is in it and, frankly, they \nare not happy with it. They don't like it, they don't want to live with \nit, and they don't want to live under it.\n  One year ago, when we started this discussion, what we heard and what \nI believed as a physician was that what people are looking for is the \ncare they need, from a doctor they want, at a cost they can afford.\n  This 2,700-page bill that is costing trillions of dollars doesn't \ndeliver that at all. To me, it is a bill that makes it harder to create \njobs. It increases the cost of care, eliminates choice, raises taxes, \nis locking 16 million Americans into a broken Medicaid system, and is \ntaking $500 billion from our seniors--not to help take care of Medicare \nand solve that problem but to start a whole new government entitlement \nprogram.\n  I was visiting with one of my colleagues, Dr. Kris Keggi, an \northopedic surgeon whom I trained under in my residency program. Just \nthe impact on\n\n[[Page S1954]]\n\nseniors alone who need hip and knee replacements--we know when we take \nthat kind of money away from Medicare, it doesn't make it easier for \nseniors to get the care they need.\n  Two courts have ruled--one in Virginia and one in Florida--that this \nhealth care law and the mandate that everybody in the country must buy \nor obtain government-approved health insurance is unconstitutional. The \nStates are at an impasse in knowing what to do. How do they react? What \nwill the Supreme Court decide? What kind of resources must the States \ncommit?\n  That is why I am delighted to be joined on the floor by Senator \nHutchison from Texas. I think she has the right answer. She has \nintroduced, as an amendment to the bill we are discussing on the floor, \nthe Save our States Act. It is an amendment to suspend implementing \nthese health care reform measures until the lawsuits have been settled \nand we actually get a clear understanding.\n  I believe this law is unconstitutional. I ask my colleague--and I \nnote there are quite a few Senators who have cosponsored this \nlegislation--if she would perhaps share, as part of a second opinion, \nher thoughts on what the States have to live under now and what rights \nand opportunities the States should have.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I certainly appreciate what Dr./\nSenator Barrasso, from Wyoming, does for us on a regular basis. As one \nof the few physicians in our body--he is one of the two--he tells us \nthe things that are happening in this health care reform bill that are \nhurting our health care system, hurting the quality of health care in \nour country, at a time when we need to assure senior citizens that \nMedicare cuts will not take effect. We certainly want our small \nbusinesses to hire people rather than stop at 50 because then they are \ngoing to start getting fined for not giving the government-prescribed \nhealth care that is in the health care reform act that was passed last \nyear.\n  What I am doing in my amendment, as one of those pending in the bill \nbefore us, is saying: Stop. We have now had two Federal courts--one \nfrom Virginia, one from Florida--that have said this law is \nunconstitutional. Yet the administration is continuing to implement the \nlaw, even though it has certainly now been called into question.\n  I am most affected by the number of States that are having to do the \nsame thing. Most of our State legislatures are in session right now. \nEvery one of them--actually, I think approximately 44 States out of \n50--has a budget shortfall. Yet our States are having to spend hundreds \nof millions of dollars to implement a law that may be declared \nunconstitutional.\n  Some States have said we are not going to implement it. But if they \nsay that, then they are going to be in jeopardy when they are not \nprepared, if the law is constitutional, and they will be paying late \nfees and fines for not implementing during this kind of time when we \nare in limbo. Some States are saying we are going to implement, but we \nhave a budget shortfall and we would like not to be required to \nimplement a law that may be void and we are spending millions of \ndollars when we need that money for education or Medicaid, frankly.\n  My amendment says we will stop any further implementation of this law \nuntil we know the final opinion has been rendered by the Supreme Court \nof the United States regarding whether the law is valid. That is it. It \nis simple and clear. We will let every State know they have a level \nplaying field, that they do not have to spend the hundreds of millions \nof dollars now being spent on implementation, unless we know the \nSupreme Court has said the law is valid.\n  I have 36 cosponsors of my amendment, including the Senator from \nWyoming, who is one of our two physicians in the Senate. I think we \nwill have a large support because I am getting letters from \norganizations.\n  I got a letter from a group that has been formed to say we need to \nstart over on this health care reform bill. These are people who \nrepresent the employers of America that want to be able to give their \nemployees the health care coverage they can afford right now. It may \nnot be the government-prescribed health care, but many are trying to do \nit.\n  The groups that have signed this letter supporting my amendment to \nsay stop implementation now are: The Associated Builders and \nContractors, the Associated General Contractors, the Electrical \nContractors, the Foodservice Distributors Association, the \nInternational Franchises Association, the National Association of \nManufacturers, the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, the \nNational Retail Federation, the Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nCouncil, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Independent Women's Voice, \nand the 60 Plus Association.\n  Those are the groups that are saying let's stop the upheaval this has \ncaused in our country and wait and see what the Supreme Court says \nbefore we have the outlays of millions of dollars.\n  Most certainly, small businesses are not increasing employment \nbecause they are so concerned about the implications of the health care \nreform bill. Let me give the Senator from Wyoming an example from my \nhome State of Texas, in Corpus Christi. A small business there has 34 \nemployees. The cheapest option they have for their health insurance \nrenewal is 44 percent more than their insurance just last year. They \nhave just days to decide whether they can continue to offer their \nemployees health insurance. This is in anticipation of the health care \nreform bill going into effect and causing these employers to have to \nmeet these new mandates.\n  The insurance companies are already ratcheting up their insurance \npremiums in anticipation of this law. This is one of the key reasons we \nneed to stop the implementation, until we know if this law is valid, so \nour businesses will have the freedom to provide affordable health care \ncoverage to their employees.\n  I thank the Senator from Wyoming for coming in with his second \nopinion because we know he has unique experience in working with our \nhealth care system. I wish to make sure we don't do what the \nphysicians' motto is--which is do no harm--when we haven't thought it \nthrough and don't have all the ramifications. First, do no harm. That \nis their motto. It is simple and clear.\n  I think we need to stop implementing this bill until the Supreme \nCourt has ruled on its constitutionality.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, to follow up on that, I am so pleased to \nbe an original cosponsor of the Save our States Act.\n  States are very concerned. As I heard my colleague from Texas say, 44 \nStates are in the red right now. When we hear the complaints from \nGovernors of both parties--they are all having to live under this law--\nthey have great concerns. Some States, as my colleague notes, have \nactually applied for waivers so they don't have to live under the \nconstraints of the law. The State of Maine has been given a waiver, \n2\\1/2\\ million Americans have been given waivers by the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. Many of those are union workers who actually \nsupported the law. When they found out what the law was going to cost--\nas in the example the Senator has given from Corpus Christi--they said: \nWe can't live under this.\n  To be forced to put out this expense and pay for it at a time of huge \nfinancial challenges for our States, it seems that the Save our States \nAct is a rational, logical, commonsense way to deal with this.\n  I will be home in Wyoming this weekend, very likely at a health fair, \nvisiting with people from the communities. Health care fairs are ways \nto get low-cost health screenings. We know early prevention and early \ndetection of problems are ways to keep down the cost of health care. \nThose are measures that work. We need to repeal and replace this health \ncare law with things that are commonsense solutions that work. Of \ncourse, we can make it legal to allow people to buy insurance across \nState lines, give people individual incentives to stay healthy, allow \npeople who buy individual health insurance to get the same tax breaks \nas big companies, and deal with the lawsuit abuse doctors will tell us \nimpacts the way they practice and raises the cost of care.\n  There are so many things we need to do. That is why I come to the \nfloor again with a doctor's second opinion on the health care law, \nsaying it is time\n\n[[Page S1955]]\n\nto repeal and replace this health care law and replace it with \nsomething that works for the American people. This law we have passed \nand is now on the books is one I believe is unconstitutional and one \nthat the Save our States Act will help our States deal with. This is a \nway that I think will help the health care of Americans who are \nstruggling at this time to deal with the onerous requirements they see \ncoming at them under the President's new health care law.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S1955-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I appreciate everyone's cooperation in \ntrying to help us move the SBIR bill through the Senate this week. It \nis a very important bill. Hopefully, we can get back on that bill \nofficially this afternoon as the leaders are negotiating about the \namendments that are pending or those amendments filed against the bill. \nI see, at this time, the Senator from Maryland who is on the floor and \nwants to speak for just 1 minute about the bill and then Senator Boxer \ncame down to speak about an amendment. Senator Vitter is also here, and \nI know he would like to be recognized in just a few minutes as well. \nThen we will alternate back and forth through morning business. There \nis no consent agreement at this point, but we will try to be fair to \nthe Members, to move back and forth through the afternoon until 3 \no'clock.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if she will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator would go after Senator Cardin.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wanted to clarify that.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Then Senator Vitter, if that is OK.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Because I have a pressing event after, I wanted be sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I wish to go back to the SBIR bill itself \nand compliment Senator Landrieu, the chairman, and Senator Snowe, the \nranking Republican member. This bill is an important one. I think it is \nimportant we get back to it and that we deal with amendments relevant \nto this legislation and move it forward. We have been on this bill for \na period of time. It is time to move on. I urge my colleagues, let's \ntake up the amendments that are relevant to the legislation and move it \nforward.\n  This is bipartisan legislation, passed out of committee by an \noverwhelming vote of Democrats and Republicans. It is a bill that will \nhelp create jobs in our community. We are talking about how America, as \nthe President said, can outeducate, outinnovate and outbuild our \ncompetitors. We have to outinnovate. The SBIR bill makes it easier for \nsmall companies to innovate for America, to help this Nation grow, to \nhelp our economy grow. It is about jobs and innovation.\n  The SBIR Program provides funds for small-tech firms to innovate and \ngrow and create jobs and for America to continue to lead the world in \ninnovation. That is what this bill is about. It provides predictability \nso if you are going to go into a business, you know the program is \ngoing to be here to give the permanency of reauthorization. It provides \na greater share of the pie for our smaller companies. Why? Because that \nis where we are going to get the job growth in America and that is \nwhere innovation is going to come from.\n  This is commonsense legislation we need to move forward. I know \neverybody has their particular amendment they want to get on that is \nnot related at all to this bill. Let's do our small businesses a favor, \nlet's do the American economy a favor, let's do something that can help \nnot only create jobs but move America forward in innovation and let's \nget this bill moving for the sake of our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I need to tell the American people and my \ncolleagues who have not been following this important debate on a very \ngood bill, I am so grateful to the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu, for this bill. Unfortunately, there has been an amendment \nthat was attached to this bill on the very first day which would stop \nthe Environmental Protection Agency forever from enforcing the Clean \nAir Act as it relates to carbon pollution.\n  This is a first of a kind. It has never been done. It is essentially \na repeal of the Clean Air Act as it involves one particular pollutant, \ncarbon, which has been found to be an endangerment to our people. The \nEPA did not wake up one day and say: We think carbon is dangerous. No; \nthe scientists in both the Bush administration and Obama administration \nfound out carbon is a dangerous pollutant, dangerous to the health of \nour families. So EPA, in what is I think a very solid way, has started \nto prepare to regulate carbon. They have done it in a way that has said \nthey are not going after farms, they are not going after small \nbusiness, they are going after the biggest polluters in the country.\n  Guess what. The friends of those polluters, right in this Senate \nChamber, have decided--and they already did it in the House, the new \nRepublican majority--they are going to stop EPA in its tracks. That is \nwhy I will ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a very \ngood letter from the American Lung Association, the American Public \nHealth Association, the Trust for America's Health, the Physicians for \nSocial Responsibility, and Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. I \nask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 30, 2011.\n       Dear Senator: Our organizations have written to you \n     recently on legislation impacting the Clean Air Act. Today we \n     write to express our opposition to the amendments that will \n     come before the full U.S. Senate in the very near future.\n       We oppose:\n       1. Amendment No. 183 by Senator McConnell;\n       2. Amendment No. 215 by Senator Rockefeller;\n       3. Amendment No. 236 by Senator Baucus; and,\n       4. Amendment No. 265 by Senator Stabenow\n       By blocking the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) \n     authority to update clean air standards, each of the above \n     amendments, in its own way, will weaken the Clean Air Act.\n       If passed by Congress, these amendments would interfere \n     with EPA's ability to implement the Clean Air Act; a law that \n     protects public health and reduces health care costs for all \n     by preventing thousands of adverse health outcomes, \n     including: cancer, asthma attacks, heart attacks, strokes, \n     emergency department visits, hospitalizations and premature \n     deaths.\n       Additionally, the public strongly opposes Congress blocking \n     EPA's efforts to implement the Clean Air Act. A recent \n     bipartisan survey, which was conducted for the American Lung \n     Association by the Republican firm Ayres, McHenry & \n     Associates and the Democratic polling firm Greenberg Quinlan \n     Rosner Research, indicates the overwhelming view of voters:\n       69 percent think the EPA should update Clean Air Act \n     standards with stricter limits on air pollution;\n       64 percent feel that Congress should not stop the EPA from \n     updating carbon dioxide emission standards;\n       69 percent believe that EPA scientists, rather than \n     Congress, should set pollution standards.\n       The above amendments would strip away sensible Clean Air \n     Act protections that safeguard Americans and their families \n     from air pollution. We strongly urge the Senate to support \n     the continued implementation of this vital law.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles Connor,\n       President and Chief Executive Officer, American Lung \n     Association.\n\n[[Page S1956]]\n\n     Georges C. Benjamin, MD, FACP, FACEP (E),\n       Executive Director, American Public Health Association.\n     Dean E. Schraufnagel MD,\n       President, American Thoracic Society.\n     Bill McLin,\n       President and CEO, Asthma and Allergy Foundation of \n     America.\n     Peter Wilk, MD,\n       Executive Director, Physicians for Social Responsibility.\n     Jeffrey Levi, PhD,\n       Executive Director, Trust for America's Health.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. They say we ``strongly oppose Congress blocking EPA's \neffort to implement the Clean Air Act.'' That is one of the things they \nsay in the letter.\n  Then, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record--by the \nway, these are new letters, yesterday one of them--a letter from \nBusiness for Innovative Climate + Energy Policy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Business for Innovative Climate\n\n\n                                              + Energy Policy,\n\n                                                   March 28, 2011.\n     Re: Business Support for EPA's authority to regulate GHG \n         emissions\n\n       Dear Senate Majority Leader Reid and Senate Minority Leader \n     McConnell: We are writing as major U.S. businesses to urge \n     you to oppose all amendments or other measures that would \n     block, delay or curtail EPA's ability to take action on the \n     regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.\n       For nearly two years, our coalition, Business for \n     Innovative Climate and Energy Policy (BICEP), has worked with \n     Members of Congress toward passage of comprehensive climate \n     and energy legislation, because we believe it is critical to \n     the health of our businesses and essential for job creation \n     and innovation in the United States.\n       It is important to underscore that we have always believed \n     strongly that Congress should lead on setting climate and \n     energy policy for the United States. However, in lieu of \n     Congress's ability to pass a comprehensive bill, EPA's \n     legitimate authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions \n     should not be constrained at this time.\n       We urge you and your Senate colleagues to remain focused on \n     the vital task of passing a comprehensive climate and energy \n     bill that will create jobs, reduce harmful emissions, \n     encourage clean energy development and enhance national \n     security.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Anne L. Kelly,\n                                                  Director, BICEP.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. The letter says ``Business Support for EPA's authority to \nregulate greenhouse gas emissions.'' It is a letter from Anne Kelly, \nwho is director of this organization. She writes:\n\n       We are writing as major U.S. businesses to urge you to \n     oppose all amendments or other measures that would block, \n     delay or curtail EPA's ability to take action on the \n     regulation of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n  It is not business friendly. It is friendly, these terrible \namendments, to the biggest polluters in America who today took out a \nfull-page ad. I guess they can afford $20,000--maybe it is 50, I don't \nknow what it costs--for a whole page, saying: ``Stopping EPA's job-\nkilling greenhouse gas regulation.''\n  Of course, who are they? The Industrial Minerals Association, the \nNational Mining Association, the National Petrochemical & Refiners \nAssociation, Petroleum Marketers Association of America, Society of \nChemical Manufacturers, et cetera, et cetera.\n  I guess the question for us as a body is, Whom do we stand with, the \nbiggest polluters in America or the American people, 69 percent of whom \nsaid in a bipartisan poll: ``EPA should update Clean Air Act standards \nwith stricter air pollution limits.''\n  This group in this body, for whatever reason--and I respect their \nreasons, I just strongly disagree with them--are saying: Stop EPA, \nstop. Mr. President, 68 percent believe Congress should not stop EPA \nfrom enforcing Clean Air Act standards.\n  That is what these amendments do. I say show me one other thing \nbesides we all love our mothers that would get 68 percent of the \nAmerican people in a bipartisan vote.\n  Mr. President, 69 percent believe ``EPA scientists, not Congress, \nshould set pollution standards.'' But we have Senators playing \nscientist, putting on their white coats, deciding what EPA should do, \nwhen it ought to be based on science. What is the science telling us? \nThat it is dangerous to breathe in air pollution with lots of carbon in \nit.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have another letter printed in the Record \nfrom 1Sky, Center For Biological Diversity, Clean Air Task Force, Clean \nWater Action, Conservation Law Foundation, Defenders of Wildlife--I \ncan't even take the time to read them all--Interfaith Power and Light, \nLeague of Women Voters, NRDC, Safe Climate Campaign, Sierra Club, Union \nof Concerned Scientists, Republicans for Environmental Protection--I \nlove that one--Voices for Progress, World Wildlife Fund. I ask \nunanimous consent that be printed in the Record. It is dated March 30 \nof this year.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 30, 2011.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the millions of members, \n     activists, and supporters our organizations represent, we \n     urge you to oppose all amendments to S. 493, the SBIR/STTR \n     Reauthorization Act of 2011, that would block the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ability to protect \n     public health, including Senator McConnell's amendment \n     (#183), Senator Rockefeller's amendment (#215), Senator \n     Baucus's Amendment (#236), and Senator Stabenow's amendment \n     (#265). Each of these amendments will stop the work underway \n     to clean-up health-threatening carbon dioxide pollution, \n     putting families across the country at risk and stifling \n     investment in a clean energy economy.\n       For 40 years, the EPA has protected our health and for 40 \n     years the Clean Air Act has been reducing dozens of different \n     air pollutants--all while contributing to America's economic \n     prosperity. These amendments would block the EPA's authority \n     to do this critical job, giving big polluters a free pass to \n     spew carbon dioxide and other pollution without limit. \n     Stopping the EPA from doing its job now means more Americans \n     will suffer ill health, not fewer; more clean energy jobs \n     will be outsourced overseas, and fewer American jobs will be \n     created here at home.\n       Time and again, some in industry have made dire claims in \n     order to avoid taking responsibility for polluting our air. \n     And time and again, the industry predictions have proven \n     false. In fact, between 1970 and 1990 the Clean Air Act \n     returned $42 in benefits for every dollar spent. And for \n     every dollar spent cleaning up our air from 1990 to 2020, \n     Americans are expected to receive 30 dollars in economic \n     benefits. The Clean Air Act is a clear financial winner.\n       Medical professionals and public health organizations agree \n     that carbon dioxide pollution is a serious public health \n     issue. Compromising the work of the EPA means more Americans \n     will suffer the impacts of severe asthma attacks, more \n     children will end up in hospitals attached to respirators, \n     and more seniors lives will be put at risk from heat waves \n     and severe weather.\n       Once again, we urge you to oppose all amendments to S. 493 \n     that would block the Environmental Protection Agency's \n     ability to protect public health. By doing so, you will stand \n     up for our health, our economy, and our environment. The \n     American people deserve the cleaner air, better health, and \n     saved lives that are made possible by the Clean Air Act.\n           Sincerely,\n       1Sky, Center for Biological Diversity, Clean Air Task \n     Force, Clean Water Action, Conservation Law Foundation, \n     Defenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense \n     Fund, Environment America, Friends Committee on National \n     Legislation.\n       Friends of the Earth, Interfaith Power & Light, League of \n     Women Voters of the United States, Natural Resources Defense \n     Council, Republicans for Environmental Protection, Safe \n     Climate Campaign, Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, \n     US Climate Action Network, Voces Verdes, Voices for Progress, \n     World Wildlife Fund.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. It says:\n\n       For 40 years the EPA has protected our health and for 40 \n     years the Clean Air Act has been reducing dozens of different \n     pollutants--all while contributing to America's economic \n     prosperity.\n\n  Every single time we try to rein in pollution, special interests say: \nNo, no, no, a thousand times no. We will stop growth. We will stop \njobs. We will kill the economy. It is awful, awful, awful.\n  Let me give one economic fact: If you can't breathe, you can't work.\n  Here is a picture of a little girl suffering, struggling. I urge my \ncolleagues who support Senator McConnell to look at this. They are not \nhere, but maybe on TV they will. Look at this picture. Is that what we \nwant for her future?\n  We have another picture of a little boy. This is what is happening in \nthis country because of the polluters who will not clean up their mess. \nHere is another beautiful child. We all love children. How many \nspeeches have we had on this floor--we love children, children are our \nfuture, we will fight for our children. Do we want their future to look \nlike this, breathing\n\n[[Page S1957]]\n\nthrough a device? Come on. This is clear.\n  You go to any school. I defy my colleagues, try this. Go to any \nschool in your State and say: By the way, how many of you have asthma? \nYou will see the little hands go up. Then you say: How many of you know \nsomeone with asthma? You will see half the class raise their hands. Yet \nwhat are we doing on this beautiful bill--that Senator Landrieu, I \nknow, wants to have cleaned up? She doesn't want these amendments on \nit. Regardless of how she may feel or I may feel, we both agree we \nshould not have these amendments on it, but so be it. We have to vote \nthese amendments down because we are responsible for these kids. All \nour side is saying is very simple: The Clean Air Act has worked.\n  If I went up to you and I said: If you know something worked \nperfectly well, would you mess with it? Would you change it?\n  No. Why would you, if it is working well?\n  So let's take a look at how well the Clean Air Act is working. I know \nhow strong the belief of the Presiding Officer is on this subject. \nLet's take a look at this.\n  In 2010, the Clean Air Act prevented 160,000 cases of premature \ndeaths. By 2020, that number is projected to rise to 230,000 cases of \npremature death. So if we stay on course and we fool around with the \nClean Air Act--as my Republican friends have already done in the House \nand I pray to God they do not succeed--we are going to see more deaths \nin 2020.\n  In 2010, the Clean Air Act prevented 1.7 million fewer asthma \nattacks. I showed you the picture of those children. Why do we want to \nmess with that? The Clean Air Act prevented 10,000 acute heart attacks. \nYou read the stories: So-and-so went out on a heavy, bad air day, took \na little jog, and collapsed.\n  I have to tell you, we have a success story to tell about what the \nClean Air Act is doing. I will show a chart of what happened in Los \nAngeles. A lot of you go to my beautiful State. I know the chairman of \nthe committee said she was just there, and it was a terrific visit to \nmy State. We have a magnificent State. But there were times when you \nwent to Los Angeles that you saw the air. That is not a good thing. \nWhen you see the air, that is a bad thing. The air was thick. People \nwere told on many mornings: Do not go out unless you must. The air is \nso dangerous.\n  The Clean Air Act passed. Guess what. In 2010, we have had no \nmornings like that--none. We went from 166 days a year of health \nadvisories in southern California to none in 2010. I have to say, if \nyou show me any other law that has had this record of success, I will \nsmile and be happy. We went from 166 days a year of smog advisories to \nnone because of the Clean Air Act. I have already told you, we have \nsaved lives, saved asthma attacks. We have done it all. Yet there are \npeople in this Chamber who want to either postpone enforcing the Clean \nAir Act as it relates to carbon or want to stop it forever, which is \nthe McConnell amendment and the worst amendment of them all, if I had \nto rate them.\n  I have a couple other charts to share with you and then I will close. \nThe McConnell amendment, which is the worst of all amendments--none of \nthem are good--they all interfere with the Environmental Protection \nAgency, which is supported, the EPA, by 69 percent of the people.\n  But the McConnell amendment is a disaster. It is the same as the \nUpton amendment, the Upton bill in the House, and the Inhofe bill in \nthe Senate. The McConnell amendment--what does it do? It says that \nforever more, the EPA cannot do anything to regulate carbon pollution \nregardless of how dangerous it is, regardless of what the scientists \ntell us, regardless of what the physicians tell us, regardless of what \nthe people tell us through the polls, regardless of what our \ncommunities tell us, what our States tell us, what our mayors tell us. \nForever more, they are repealing the Clean Air Act as it relates to \ncarbon pollution. Rather extreme. Outrageous. We have to beat it. We \nmust beat it. It is so bad. It goes against the Supreme Court decision. \nBy the way, there will be lawsuits up the wazoo if it ever becomes law, \nand it will not, I pray.\n  The Supreme Court said that if we find--scientists--that carbon \npollution is dangerous, we have to regulate it. Guess what. The \nscientists found that carbon pollution is dangerous. They made an \nendangerment finding. The EPA is ready to act, I think in a judicious \nway. They are very mindful. They are not going after farms, they are \nnot going after small businesses. That is not good enough for these \nspecial interests who took out this huge ad today standing against--it \nis a beautiful ad. It looks almost environmental, green. This is not \ngreen; it is dirty--dirty air. That is what this ad stands for--dirty \nair.\n  A lot of people did not want me to come back here because they knew I \nwould come here and tell the truth about this. But I am here, and I am \ngoing to tell the truth every day in every way because I love my \ngrandkids and I love everybody's grandkids. As far as I am concerned, \nthat is why I am here--not to protect the rich polluters who make \nbillions of dollars a year. They can clean up their act. We proved it. \nWe proved it. We have said we do not want kids struggling for air, and \nwe said we can do this right. We proved it. We not only proved we can \nclean up the air, we not only proved we can save lives, we not only \nproved we can save asthma attacks, we proved we can grow this economy.\n  I am going to close now and let my friend from Louisiana have the \nfloor, but I have to close with this. There is a lot of talk about how \nthis is bad for business. But the fact is, every time the polluters get \nup and say: Do not pass any more Clean Air Act amendments, it is going \nto be bad for jobs. We found out that cleaning up the environment \nactually creates jobs. Not only does it create jobs, it creates new \ntechnologies. Not only does it create new technologies, but those \ntechnologies are exported to the world. And I will have printed in the \nRecord the number of jobs that have been created as we moved to clean \nup the air.\n  So the reason I am here--and I think it is quite a spirited \ndiscussion I am having with all of you--is because we are facing four \nbad amendments--four, count them, the worst being McConnell--all of \nwhich would either slow down the EPA or stop the EPA.\n  By the way, the McConnell amendment is so terrible that it even says \nEPA can no longer have anything to do with tailpipe emissions of cars, \nwhich is such an important part of the dirty air we are facing.\n  In closing, according to information from the Institute of Clean Air \nCompanies--those are American companies that oppose these big polluting \ncompanies--from 1999 to 2001, the number of boilermakers in the United \nStates increased by 6,700--a 35-percent increase--even though we said: \nYou have to clean up the air.\n  The Department of Commerce shows that the U.S. environmental \ntechnology industry generated $300 billion in revenues, supported 1.7 \nmillion jobs. The air pollution control sector produced $18 billion in \nrevenue. Small and medium-sized companies make up 99 percent of the \nprivate sector firms in this sector of the economy.\n  So here is what you have. You have these huge, multibillion-dollar \npolluters who can afford to take one-page ads, full-page ads in the \nWashington Post. They want to continue polluting the air, and they \ndon't want to clean it up. And you have a whole other group of \nbusinesses that have written to us and said: Please let the EPA do its \nwork. It saves lives, it saves our children, and it creates many jobs--\nnew jobs, clean jobs, good jobs.\n  If we go down the path of the McConnell amendment and these other \namendments, we are ceding our leadership in environmental clean tech to \nChina. That is the last thing we want to do. They are already \nsurpassing us in solar production, and we created it.\n  So the bill before us is a fine bill. I hope, if we have to vote for \nthese amendments, and they do come up as part of this agreement as we \nmove forward, we will not pass any of them and we will allow the people \nto have their way. Sixty-nine percent of them say: Let the EPA do its \njob.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin).

Mr. President, since President Obama took office, the \nprice\n\n[[Page S1958]]\n\nof a gallon of gasoline at the pump has risen 96 percent--96 percent, \nfrom $1.83 to now $3.60, with absolutely no end in sight. Meanwhile, \nand not coincidentally, the President has virtually shut down the Gulf \nof Mexico, he has canceled numerous energy lease sales, he has refused \nto act on stalled onshore permits, he has dramatically increased \nenvironmental regulations, and he has begun regulating CO2 \nby administrative fiat. All of that has helped get us to where we are.\n  Today, President Obama went to Georgetown University, and at least he \nhas begun focusing on and addressing the energy situation. I guess I \ngive him points for that. He went to Georgetown today and delivered a \nspeech which he called a Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future. But, \nlike a lot of Presidential speeches, this is great-sounding rah-rah, \nnice title but pretty disappointing, from my point of view, on \nsubstance.\n  First of all, let's talk about the whole premise of the speech, a \nBlueprint for a Secure Energy Future. I was hopeful, on hearing about \nthe plan for this speech, that we would be seeing an unveiling of a \nreal energy policy, including moving in the right direction in terms of \ndomestic production, utilizing our domestic energy resources. \nUnfortunately, this is more of the same. In fact, the President admits \nfreely that this is absolutely more of the same. He says:\n\n       Today, my administration is releasing a Blueprint for a \n     Secure Energy Future that outlines the comprehensive national \n     energy policy we have pushed since the day I took office.\n\n  So this is simply a restatement of the last years of policy, in my \nopinion, clearly failed, clearly counterproductive policy that has \nhelped get us to $3.60 at the pump and climbing.\n  When you look even more at the substance of the speech, it is more \ndisappointing. The whole speech is about 51 paragraphs. Of those 51 \nparagraphs, I looked to see how many are about tapping our domestic \ntraditional energy resources. Well, 6 paragraphs of 51--just a little \nover 10 percent. Four paragraphs were about domestic oil production, \nand two were about domestic natural gas production. And even those two \nwere mostly about possibly increasing regulation on the production of \nnatural gas from shale, making it more difficult, not accessing more of \nour domestic energy resources.\n  What is the picture on domestic oil production, those four \nparagraphs? Well, the President says:\n\n       To keep reducing that reliance on imports, my \n     administration is encouraging offshore oil exploration and \n     production.\n\n  Really? That is a news headline to my constituents in the gulf coast \nbecause every day we live a far different reality. We live the reality \nof an administration that has moved in the opposite direction, making \ndomestic oil and gas production far more difficult, not easier.\n  Since the tragedy of the BP disaster, we have only had 7 deepwater \nexploratory permits issued--7 issued--compared to a comparable period \nbefore the disaster of 68, so about 10 percent. That is encouraging \noffshore oil and gas exploration and production? I don't think so. \nSince that disaster, the working rotary rigs in the gulf have fallen \ndramatically, from about 55 to 25. It has been cut by more than half. \nThat is encouraging offshore oil exploration and production? I don't \nthink so.\n  We need to change the policy that is virtually shutting down the gulf \nand stopping domestic energy production. Seven deepwater exploratory \npermits is not adequate. Seven, as I said, is roughly 10 percent of the \nrate that existed before. Of course we need to make changes, and we \nhave. Of course we need to learn the lessons of the Deepwater Horizon \nexplosion, and we have. But, again, seven is roughly 10 percent of the \nprevious rate.\n  We need to do far better, and if we are going to really encourage \nthat domestic production, what about production in Alaska's Beaufort \nSea? EPA is sitting on those permits, not issuing those permits. As a \nresult, Shell Oil announced that it is abandoning efforts to produce \nanything there. Is that what the President is talking about, \nencouraging oil exploration and production?\n  What about the lease sales he canceled? President Obama canceled the \nwestern lease sale that was scheduled. He canceled that in May of 2010. \nIf you are serious, are you going to reverse that decision? Also, in \nMay of 2010, the President canceled the planned Virginia lease sale. \nUnfortunately, in this speech, he did not reverse that policy. He is \ncontinuing that cancellation.\n  What about the cancellation of offshore tracts in Alaska's Cook \nInlet? The President canceled that in March of this year, this month. \nUnfortunately, in this speech, he did not reverse that policy.\n  Withdrawn leases. The President's Department of the Interior has \nwithdrawn 77 lease sales in Utah that were planned. They withdrew those \nin 2009. No reversal on that policy. Is that encouraging oil \nexploration and production?\n  So time and again the President has actually worked in the opposite \ndirection--shutting down domestic production, making it more difficult, \nnot, as he said in his speech today, ``encouraging oil exploration and \nproduction.''\n  We need a new energy policy, not a restated policy, not the same-old \nsame-old from the last 2 years. We need a policy that does many things, \nincluding harnessing and accessing our enormous abundance of energy \nresources in this country.\n  You know, we Americans are not used to thinking of ourselves as \nenergy-rich, but we are. And nonpartisan, nonbiased sources such as the \nCongressional Research Service say we are the most energy-rich country \nin the world bar none. The only country coming close to us is Russia in \nterms of our vast array and amount of domestic energy resources. We are \nout of the habit of thinking of ourselves that way for a simple reason: \nThe Congress and this President in particular have taken 95 percent of \nthose abundant resources and put them off limits under Federal law. No \nother energy-rich country does anything like that. We continue to do it \neven with the price at the pump rising so dramatically.\n  We need to stop that. We need to access our own richness, our own \nresources to take care of ourselves. And that is a big part of the \nenergy plan we need, which, unfortunately, was not part of the \nPresident's Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future unveiled today, \nrestated today, at Georgetown.\n  Many colleagues will join me tomorrow in introducing a bill that lays \nout that new energy vision to unlock the enormous potential we have \nhere at home. The bill is called 3-D: The Domestic Jobs, Domestic \nEnergy and Deficit Reduction Act of 2011. I am honored to be joined by \nbetween 20 and 30 colleagues--the list is still growing--who will \nformally introduce that act tomorrow. This is legislation aimed at our \ndomestic energy resources, unshackling that potential, letting us get \naccess to that enormous potential for domestic energy and, with it, \ngreat U.S. jobs, jobs right here in this country, and deficit \nreduction. So many of the primary challenges we face find their nexus \nin energy. Again, energy independence, self-reliance we need now more \nthan ever, particularly with the unrest in the Middle East.\n  Secondly, jobs. We say we are trying to do everything we can to come \nout of this tough recession, but we are not, because the U.S. energy \nsector has the potential for enormous job growth. Again, we have taken \na large percentage of those resources, 95 percent, and put it off \nlimits.\n  With deficit reduction, along with producing more domestic energy, \nwould come tremendous revenue to the Federal Government. After the \npersonal income tax, this is the top source of Federal revenue--\nroyalties on domestic energy production--second only to the personal \nincome tax. Again, why don't we solve all of these problems--energy \nindependence, U.S. jobs, and deficit reduction--by fully and \naggressively developing our U.S. domestic energy sector?\n  Specifically, the 3-D bill would do six primary things. First, it \nmandates Outer Continental Shelf lease sales, directing the Interior \nDepartment to conduct a lease sale in each Outer Continental Shelf \nplanning area for which there is a commercial interest. It would also \nconsider the 2010-2015 planning area complete.\n  Secondly, it would open ANWR to energy production. This is a vast \nsource of potential energy production, job creation, and deficit \nreduction, again, that we have put off limits through congressional and \nPresidential action.\n  Third, it would require action on stalled onshore permits, things \nsuch as\n\n[[Page S1959]]\n\nthe leases that Interior withdrew in 2009 in Utah, things such as EPA \ninaction, actually withdrawing a CWA permit for the Spruce No. 1 mine \nin West Virginia, the State Department sitting on the permit issue in \nterms of the Keystone XL pipeline project, the EPA not issuing permits \nfor Shell Oil operations in offshore Alaska. It would direct action in \nall of those areas.\n  Fourth, it would properly limit timeframes for environmental and \njudicial review. It would not change any of those review standards. It \nwould only change the law so that those reviews could not go on ad \ninfinitum. It would streamline the process and properly and reasonably \nlimit those timeframes.\n  Fifth, it would block regulation of CO2 by administrative \nfiat. We will have a vote soon on that issue. I am hopeful it will be a \nmajority vote in favor of this opinion to block that regulation by \nadministrative fiat that I espouse. This is also included in the 3-D \nbill.\n  Sixth, we would actually create an alternative energy trust fund from \n25 percent of the new revenue produced from ANWR. It would capture 25 \npercent of that brandnew revenue for alternative energy development, \nresearch, and production. That would be positive as well.\n  This is the sort of domestic energy focus we need. This is the \nmovement toward real energy security as well as job creation and \ndeficit reduction that I would have hoped the President would have at \nleast hinted at at Georgetown today. But he did not. His speech was the \nsame old same old, explicitly restating what he has been doing for the \nlast 2 years.\n  I urge all colleagues to join in this effort and to join in similar \nefforts. Americans face tough times. It is not being made any easier by \nthe price at the pump going up. Again, since President Obama took \noffice, that price has risen 96 percent, from $1.83 per gallon to $3.60 \nper gallon, and there is no end in sight. We need to access our own \nresources. We need to put Americans to work. We need to reduce our \ndeficit with that extra new revenue. We can do it all by accessing U.S. \ndomestic energy resources more fully, not putting 95 percent of those \nresources off limits, off the table by either Presidential fiat or \ncongressional action.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join us in this effort, to join \nsimilar efforts to give Americans real relief at the pump, to increase \nour energy independence, to lower the deficit, and to produce good \nAmerican jobs.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the benefit of all Senators, we have \nbeen trying in the last 24 hours or more to work our way through the \namendments to get to a vote on this most important bill we are dealing \nwith, the small business innovation bill, a bill that has already \ncreated thousands of jobs around the country. It is an extremely \nimportant bill. We need to reauthorize this bill. It is a very small \namount of money. It generates a lot of jobs. But we have been stuck.\n  I think we have had a breakthrough that we can at least, hopefully, \nwork toward conclusion of this extremely difficult matter. I have \nspoken with one Senator who had a concern about an issue that has \nactually been held up--it is a Republican amendment held up by a \nRepublican--not allowing us to have a vote on it. I think we have \nworked our way through that. Now the floor staff is trying to come up \nwith a consent agreement that would work toward having a vote develop \nthe will of the Senate on the 1099, the tax reporting requirement. \nAlso, there are a number of amendments people wish to have votes on \ndealing with EPA standards. I think we are at a place where we can \nperhaps set up some votes.\n  With the difficulty of all the things we have today, including a \nbriefing by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs on Libya, I think realistically we will \nnot have any votes this afternoon. Tomorrow morning we have the funeral \nin New York for Geraldine Ferraro. We will work very hard to set up a \nseries of votes for tomorrow afternoon. It could be a significant \nnumber of votes. It could be 10 votes or so tomorrow afternoon, and if \nit has to spill over into Friday, we will have to do that. At least I \nthink we can get the voting done tomorrow. With a little bit of good \nfortune, we can work with the few problems we still have outstanding \nand move forward with Senator Landrieu's bill on which she and Senator \nSnowe have worked hard.\n  I hope this let's Senators know what we are doing. Even though it \nseems like nothing, there has been a lot of work that has gone into \nthis. It is fair to say we will have no more votes today, and we will \ntry to get something set up for tomorrow afternoon.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, often I come to the Senate floor to talk \nabout alternative energy. Most of the time it is about biofuels. \nSometimes it is about wind, because I am the author of the wind energy \ntax credit. Sometimes it is to speak about it. Hardly ever do I come to \nthe floor to talk about it in regard to the attempt to amend a certain \nbill on the floor. I come for that purpose now, and I come to express \nmy strong opposition to amendment No. 220 filed at the desk by Senator \nCoburn.\n  I don't find any fault with the issue Senator Coburn raises, only \nwhen it is raised. I sense from some of his arguments and press \nreleases that it is raised to bring up the issue of energy and what \nenergy should be subsidized or not subsidized, or whether any energy \nought to be subsidized, and also maybe to point out some things that \nare wrong with the Tax Code. I can't find any fault with any of those \nmotives. I only find fault, let's say, in the sense that it is being \nbrought up to show that there are some things wrong with the Tax Code \nand the Tax Code ought to be reformed.\n  Yes, if anybody said the Tax Code was a perfect piece of work, you \nmight think: Well, you have been in Washington too long or you don't \nexercise good judgment or you are not in the real world. So I think it \nis perfectly legitimate to bring up issues about the Tax Code, but in \nthe sense of reform of the Tax Code, not as an isolated amendment to \nsome other bill, for the simple reason that if you do that, with the \ncomplexity of our Tax Code--reforming it in that way--every Senator \nattempting to do that would be growing a long gray beard for the years \nit would take to do it piecemeal. Hopefully, we can get it done \nsometime in the context of tax reform and tax simplification, or flat \ntax or fair tax, and also with the corporation tax.\n  As to the motive for bringing up subsidies for energy, it is a \nperfectly legitimate subject to bring up, but it ought to be brought up \nin the context of a national energy policy. I believe Senator Coburn is \nlike me. He feels if you are going to have a growing economy, you have \nto have a growth in the use of energy, except for possible \nconservation. If you are going to do more for more people, you are \ngoing to have to have an increase in the use of energy. So it is in \nthat vein that I state my opposition to the Coburn amendment.\n  Senator Coburn's amendment would raise the tax on domestic energy \nproduction by repealing an incentive for the use of homegrown renewable \nethanol. I am astonished, given our current situation, that there are \nsome who would prefer less domestic energy production. With conflicts \nin the Middle East and crude oil over $100 a barrel, we should be on \nthe same side.\n  I have always considered myself on the same side as Senator Coburn on \nenergy issues. We should all be on the side of more domestically \nproduced energy, and that would be nuclear, it could be alternative \nenergy, and it\n\n[[Page S1960]]\n\nwould be drill here and drill now. The tremendous cost of America's \ndependence on foreign oil has never been more clear than when you have \nthe conflicts and the revolutions going on in oil-producing regions of \nthe world--now in the Middle East and northern Africa.\n  So we have this threat, and in light of that threat, we should have \nan energy policy that says ``all of the above.'' You don't pick and \nchoose. I support drilling here and drilling now. I support renewable \nenergy. I support conservation, both what might be mandated by public \npolicy as well as personal conservation. I think people who know me \nknow I have a reputation for conservation for several reasons--maybe \nenergy conservation, but also it leaves more money in your pocket. I \nalso support nuclear energy. So I believe it is very counterproductive \nfor Senators from big oil country to single out energy that comes from \nAmerican agriculture--renewable energy, homegrown energy, not imported. \nI didn't pick this fight. I support energy from all sources. I support \ntraditional oil and gas, and more of it, from here. I held 21 meetings \nin 20 different counties Monday through Thursday during the last \nrecess, and there wasn't a single person at one of them who didn't say: \nHow come we aren't making more use of our own energy? They didn't say: \nWe import $730 million a day of oil, but I told them, and it emphasized \ntheir point.\n  Why ship $730 million every day overseas to parts of the world where \nthey use the money to train terrorists to kill us? And, of course, \nAmerican taxpayers--American taxpayers--with tax incentives have been \nsupporting oil and gas for over 100 years. So the attack on homegrown \nenergy is remarkable, isn't it? We shouldn't be fighting each other \nover domestic energy sources. We should be fighting OPEC and foreign \ndictators and oil sheiks who hold our economy hostage. You see it right \nnow, because of the anxiety about what is going on in Libya, and \nraising the price of gasoline 75 or 80 cents.\n  The author of the amendment has argued that the production of clean \nhomegrown ethanol is fiscally irresponsible. It is important to \nremember that the incentive exists to help producers of ethanol to \ncompete with the oil industry or, as you so often hear in this town, we \nhave to have a level playing field. Remember that the oil industry has \nbeen well supported by the Federal Treasury for more than a century. \nOil was discovered in 1859. I don't know how many years later it was \nthat there were tax incentives for the production of oil, but it has \nbeen a long time.\n  President Obama, in his budget request for 2012, has advocated \nrepealing a dozen or so subsidies to big oil. He has argued that a \ncentury-old industry no longer needs tax breaks. With oil prices at \n$100 a barrel, and record profits being made, some could certainly \nquestion why this industry needs any taxpayer subsidy at all. President \nObama's proposal would repeal $44 billion in oil and gas subsidies over \na 10-year period of time.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues of a debate we had last summer on an \namendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Senator \nSanders. The amendment he offered would have, among other things, \nrepealed about $35 billion of tax subsidies enjoyed by the oil and gas \nindustry. Opponents of the Sanders amendment argued that repealing the \noil and gas subsidies would reduce domestic energy production and drive \nup our dependence on foreign oil. Well, we don't want to do that, do \nwe? Opponents also argued it would cost U.S. jobs. We also argued it \nwould increase prices at the pump for consumers--something you don't \nwant to do when you are in a recession. I tend to agree with these \narguments in regard to the help that the Federal Treasury gives to oil \ncompanies. All of my Republican colleagues, and more than one-third of \nthe Democrats, did as well. But a repeal of the ethanol tax incentive \nis a tax increase as well that will surely be passed on to the American \nconsumer--no different for ethanol in your gas tank than gasoline in \nyour gas tank. If you take subsidies off of oil, it raises the price of \ngasoline. If you take the incentives off of ethanol, it raises the \nprice of ethanol.\n  I know that removing incentives for oil and gas will have the same \nimpact as removing incentives for ethanol. We will get less \ndomestically produced ethanol, it will cost U.S. jobs, it will increase \nour dependence upon foreign oil, and it will increase the price at the \npump for the American consumer. We are already dependent upon foreign \nsources for more than 60 percent of our oil needs. Why do my colleagues \nat this time want to increase our foreign energy dependence when we can \nproduce it right here at home--clean burning, environmentally good?\n  I wish to ask my colleagues who voted against repealing oil and gas \nsubsidies but who support repealing incentives for renewable fuels why \nthey have this inconsistency? Where are the amendments from fiscal \nconservatives and deficit hawks to repeal the oil and gas subsidies? \nThe fact is it is intellectually inconsistent to say that increasing \ntaxes on ethanol is justified but that it is irresponsible to do the \nvery same thing on oil and gas production. If tax incentives lead to \nmore domestic energy production and good-paying jobs, why are only \nincentives for oil and gas so important in accomplishing that goal?\n  It is even more ridiculous to claim that the 30-year-old ethanol \nindustry is mature and, thus, no longer needs the support of the \ntaxpayers, while the century-old oil industry still receives $35 \nbillion in taxpayer support. Regardless, I don't believe we should be \nraising taxes on any type of energy production or on any individual, \nparticularly during a weak economy.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma insists that because renewable fuel is \nrequired to be used, then somehow it doesn't need an incentive. But \nwith oil prices at $100 a barrel, oil companies are doing everything \nthey can to extract more oil from the ground. There isn't a mandate to \nuse oil, but it has a 100-year monopoly on our transportation \ninfrastructure, so essentially it is a mandate.\n  When there is little competition to oil, and it is enormously \nprofitable--and we will see those reports next week--wouldn't the \nsponsor argue that the necessary incentives exist to produce it without \nadditional taxpayer support, if we wanted to be consistent? Oil \nessentially does have a mandate, as I just said. The economics of oil \nproduction are clearly in favor of the producer, not the consumer. Why \ndo they need taxpayer support?\n  It is also important to understand the hidden cost of our dependence \nupon foreign oil. We had a peer-reviewed paper published in 2010 \nconcluding that--and let me say parenthetically, before I quote, the \nleeway is somewhere between $27 billion and $130 billion:\n\n       $27 to $138 billion is spent annually by the U.S. military \n     for protection of Middle Eastern maritime oil transit routes \n     and oil infrastructure, with an average of $84 billion a \n     year.\n\n  This is $84 billion in American Treasury spent on the defense of \nshipping lanes to quench our thirst for foreign oil. It is not \nreflected in the price at the pump. It is a hidden cost and the hidden \ncost is paid by the very same people who support the military, our \nNavy, the American taxpayers.\n\n  Milton Copulos, an adviser to President Ronald Reagan and a veteran \nof the Heritage Foundation, testified before Congress in 2006 on this \nvery issue. He testified that the hidden cost of imported oil is \nequivalent to adding $8.35 to the price of a gallon of gasoline from \nthe Persian Gulf. There is no hidden U.S. military cost attributed to \nhomegrown ethanol.\n  Do you understand that? You don't have to have the Navy of the United \nStates keeping shipping lanes open for the ethanol that you burn in \nyour car. No subsidy of $8.35 a gallon for ethanol such as there is for \noil, according to the Heritage Foundation.\n  Let's have a debate on ethanol, but let's debate it in the context of \na comprehensive energy plan. This debate should include the subsidies \nfor all energy production. We do not pick out one versus others. What \nis unique about the subsidy for ethanol? We also have subsidies for \ngrain and for biodiesel. When is that going to come up? We had a \nsubsidy for wind energy--I know it because I got that legislated 18 \nyears ago--and a subsidy for solar, subsidy for biomass, subsidy for \ngeothermal, subsidy for nuclear energy. Why just ethanol at this point?\n  But I said at the beginning, talking about energy subsidies--oil, \nalternative\n\n[[Page S1961]]\n\nenergy, nuclear energy, conservation--is legitimate. But don't pick one \nout. What are we going to do about all the rest of them? Are we going \nto take a subsidy a day? Take wind tomorrow? Take solar the next day? \nThere is a context in which to do this. We all say we need a national \nenergy policy. These subsidies have to be discussed in the context of a \nnational energy policy. Nearly every type of energy gets some market-\ndistorting subsidy from the Federal Government. We can say that is not \nright. But do we want alternative energy or don't we want alternative \nenergy? Do we want renewable energy or don't we want renewable energy? \nDo you think we would have an ethanol industry today if there had not \nbeen a tax incentive a long time ago? No.\n  What about all the people who say we should not be using corn or \ngrain, a food product, for fuel, we ought to be eating it? They say we \nought to use corn stover, wood chips, switchgrass, other things that \nhave cellulose in them and get our ethanol from that. I agree 100 \npercent. But how in the heck do we think we would ever get to producing \nethanol out of corn stover and wood chips and switchgrass, et cetera, \nif we had not had 30 years of engineering to make ethanol out of \ngrain--which we did not do very efficiently 30 years ago but now we do \nmuch more efficiently today. We have to have the first generation for \nthe second generation.\n  I say an honest energy policy and debate should include ethanol. It \nshould include subsidies for oil, natural gas, nuclear, hydropower, \nwind, solar, biomass. How do you think we would ever get hydropower in \nthe West if the taxpayers had not paid for the Hoover Dam? It is \nhypocritical to put our economic and national security at risk by \ntargeting ethanol while disregarding the subsidies for all other energy \nsources.\n  Do you know the debate about alternative energy is a debate about our \nnational security because, for this country, the No. 1 responsibility \nof the Federal Government is our national defense and just think how \nweak our national defense is when we have to depend upon oil coming \nfrom the volatile Middle East, where there is revolution going on right \nnow. Wouldn't it be better for it to be domestic crude? Why do you \nsuppose the Defense Department, and even our whole aviation industry \nright now, is putting some money into research to develop alternative \nenergies, including the stuff we call renewable and even things we do \nnot know much about yet? Ethanol from algae is an example. Because our \nmilitary leaders know we should not be dependent on it.\n  Just think of the retired generals and admirals out here speaking \neveryday of why we need alternative energy and speaking very highly of \nethanol. I say it is hypocritical because it has something to do with \nour national security and we do take an oath to uphold that \nConstitution and the national security is our No. 1 responsibility. We \nknow State governments and local governments cannot protect us from \nforeign intervention, people who want to kill us. Only the Federal \nGovernment is qualified and has the power to do it, the constitutional \npower--but also to bring the resources together to get the job done.\n  Repealing the ethanol tax incentive will raise taxes on producers, \nblenders, and ultimately consumers of renewable fuel. This amendment is \na gas tax increase of over 5 cents a gallon at the pump. I don't see \nthe logic of arguing for a gas tax increase when we have so many \nAmericans unemployed and underemployed, struggling just to barely make \nit from day to day. I know we all agree we cannot and should not allow \njob-killing tax hikes during this time of economic recession and, more \nimportant, that recession is going to stay as long as there is some \neconomic uncertainty. Debates such as this--should we be importing more \noil--lend themselves to that uncertainty. Unfortunately, those Members \nwho have called for ending the ethanol incentive have directly \ncontradicted this pledge of not having tax hikes because a lapse in the \ncredit will raise taxes, will cost over 100,000 U.S. jobs at a time of \nnear 9 percent unemployment and increase our dependence upon foreign \noil.\n  There is a taxpayer watchdog group called Americans for Tax Reform. \nThey consider repeal of this incentive to be a great big tax increase. \nAmericans for Tax Reform states: ``Repealing the ethanol credit is a \ncorporate income tax increase.''\n  I agree. Now is not the time to impose a gas tax hike on the American \npeople. Now is not the time to send pink slips to ethanol-related jobs. \nEthanol currently accounts for 10 percent of our transportation fuel. A \nstudy concluded that the ethanol industry contributed $8.4 billion to \nthe Federal Treasury in 2009, $3.4 billion more than the ethanol \nincentive. Today, the industry supports 400,000 jobs. That is why I \nsupport a homegrown renewable fuels industry.\n  I conclude by asking my colleagues: If we allowed the tax incentives \nto lapse, from where would we import an additional 10 percent of our \noil? Because there is a policy in this Congress, don't drill in the \nUnited States, import it. The President was in Brazil, last week I \nbelieve it was, saying: President of Brazil, you ought to drill off the \nshore of Brazil because we want to import oil from you. At the very \nsame time we are slow at issuing permits so we can drill our own oil \noff our own shores, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Where are we going to go? Are we going to go to the Middle Eastern \noil sheiks? Send even more billions of dollars over there to give them \nmoney to train terrorists to kill us or do we want to get it from Hugo \nChavez, who every day is saying something about how he hates America? \nHe is taking the side of Qadhafi right this very day, against the \nrevolutionaries of that country, the very people we are trying to help \nbring a better life to and stop genocide. I don't think we want to go \nto the Middle East for 10 percent more of our energy in our cars or to \nHugo Chavez. I prefer, instead, that we support our renewable fuel \nproducers based right here at home, rather than send our workers a pink \nslip. I would prefer to decrease our dependence on Hugo Chavez, not \nincrease that dependence on him, and I certainly do not support raising \nthe tax on gasoline during this weak economy.\n  Let me say something I said at the beginning and then I am going to \nyield the floor; that is, there is a context to talk about this. There \nis nothing illegitimate about anybody bringing up any tax incentive \nanytime they want to or any law that is on the books because they ought \nto be reviewed from time to time. But when it comes to energy policy at \na time of $4 gas, at a time of anxiety about what is going on in Libya, \nat a time when we all know that people in this country want a national \nenergy policy, it ought to be talked about in the context of energy \nlegislation. We should talk about subsidy as a generic subject, not \njust picking out ethanol or any other one, just like some people here \nwould like to pick out the subsidy for oil and end it--such as the \nPresident has suggested in his budget. We want to do it in the context \nof a national energy policy and a subsidy that is a subsidy to oil, to \nall renewable energies--and there are a dozen of them, I bet--to \nconservation, and to nuclear energy.\n  Let's emphasize nuclear energy. When we are talking about a subsidy, \ndo we think we would have a single nuclear plant in the United States \nif 60 years ago the Federal Government, this Congress, hadn't passed \nthe Price-Anderson Act to set up Federal support for it, indirect or \ndirect, whatever it was. It took that to get it going. We had to \nreinstitute that in 2005 or we still wouldn't be considering any \nnuclear plants.\n  We do it in the context of a national energy policy. We do it in the \ncontext of subsidies on all sorts of energy, not just one of them. If \nwe are doing it for tax reform purposes, then it has to be done in the \ncontext of overall tax reform because, as I said, we start on this \nlittle tax incentive today and that little tax incentive tomorrow and \nthat little tax incentive the next day and we will be here until as \nlong as Methuselah lived, in order to get it all done.\n  I hope there will be some consideration of this in a generic way, not \nin the specific way of this amendment. That is why I do not support the \namendment at this time, but I want people to know I do not abhor the \nidea of talking about the ethanol tax credit or any other tax credit, \nexcept I want to talk about energy tax credits all together.\n\n[[Page S1962]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, we are engaged in a third war at a time \nwhen our country is struggling under an enormous debt, at a time when \nwe are engaged in two wars. Historically, our country has fought war by \nasking for congressional authority. This was true in Iraq. This was \ntrue in Afghanistan. The President came to Congress, and there was a \nvote on use of force prior to him engaging in force.\n  Some say: Well, this is no big deal; the President should be able to \nfight war whenever he wants to fight war. I beg to differ, and our \nFounding Fathers begged to differ. Madison said that the Constitution \nsupposes what history demonstrates, that the executive is the branch \nmost prone to war and most interested in it. Therefore, the \nConstitution has, with studied care, invested the power to declare war \nin the Congress.\n  I think this is an incredibly important debate. When we talk about \nsending our young men and women into harm's way, into another war, the \nfact that we would have a President send us to war without any debate--\nyour people's representatives have had absolutely no debate, and we are \nnow involved in a third war.\n  The language of my resolution is not unfamiliar to many. The language \nof this resolution is the President's words.\n  In 2007, Barack Obama said:\n\n       The President does not have power under the Constitution to \n     unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation that \n     does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the \n     nation.\n\n  This was very clear, what the President said. I agree with what \nCandidate Barack Obama said. We should not go to war without \ncongressional authority. These are the checks and balances that give \nyou a say, that give the people of America a say through their \nrepresentatives. This allows us to say when we go to war through our \nCongress, not through one individual but through 535 individuals whom \nyou elect.\n  I think the decision to go to war is such an important one that we \nshould not leave it up to one person. Our Founding Fathers agreed with \nthis.\n  In the 1970s, after Vietnam, we voted on something called the War \nPowers Act. We did give the President the right to go to war in certain \ncircumstances. These circumstances were, one, if Congress had declared \nwar; two, if Congress had authorized the use of military force, or \nthree, if there was imminent danger to our country. I think all of us \nrecognize that. If we were in imminent danger of attack, we would allow \nthe President some latitude, but we would expect very quickly for him \nto come to Congress and ask for permission.\n  In this instance, even the Secretary of Defense has said that Libya \nis not in our national interest. There is no threat to our national \nsecurity. Yet we are now involved in a third war. We have already spent \n$600 million in the first 3 days of this war. There has been no \nconstitutional authority given to the President to be committing troops \nto this war.\n  This is such an important constitutional principle that, while I am \nnew here in the Senate, I am appalled that the Senate has abdicated its \nresponsibility, that the Senate has chosen not to act and to allow this \npower to gravitate to the President. I think that the precedent of \nallowing a President to continue to act or to initiate war without \ncongressional review, without congressional votes, without the \nrepresentatives of the people having any say, is a real problem.\n  There was an article this morning in the Washington Times by GEN Mark \nKimmitt. In that, he says that there is a climate of cognitive \ndissonance surrounding the discussion as the military objectives seem \ndetached from U.S. policy.\n\n       The lack of connectivity between the use of force and \n     campaign objectives, the subordination of the military to a \n     nondecisive purpose, turns decades of policy on the use of \n     force on its head.\n\n  This is from General Kimmitt this morning:\n\n       Vital national interests are not threatened. . . . Nor have \n     sanctions failed or diplomacy been exhausted. . . . We are \n     putting the lives of our troops at risk in a nondecisive role \n     for a mission that does not meet the threshold of a vital or \n     national interest.\n\n  General Kimmitt goes on further:\n\n       For a military carrying the burden of three wars on its \n     back for the foreseeable future, a policy of more frequent \n     intervention and suboptimal use of force as an instrument of \n     diplomacy is a mistake.\n\n  I come from a State--Kentucky--that has two military bases. I see our \nyoung men and women going to war, and I worry about their families and \nthemselves engaged in two wars. Some of these young men and woman have \nbeen going to war for 10 years now. And the President now is going to \nengage us in a third war without any consultation, without any voting \nin Congress, and without any congressional authority.\n\n[[Page S1963]]\n\n  I believe this is a very serious breach of our Constitution. It is \nsomething we should not let happen lightly. It is something that we \nshould object strenuously to and that we should force a debate on in \nthis body. Many debates historically have happened here, many important \ndebates. And what is happening now is we are abdicating our duty and \nallowing this to be made unilaterally by one individual. I think it is \na mistake, I think it is a travesty, and I think it should end.\n  There have been some questions about who these people are whom we \nwill be supporting in this new war. I think there is no question that \nQadhafi is a tyrant, an autocrat, and someone whom freedom-loving \npeople would despise. However, do we know who the rebels are?\n  During the 1980s, we supported the Freedom Fighters in Afghanistan. \nDo you know who turned out to be the leader of the Freedom Fighters, or \none of the leaders? Osama bin Laden--now our mortal enemy--was \nreceiving money from the United States and support from the United \nStates for over a decade. In fact, the State Department's stated goal \nin Afghanistan during the 1980s was ``radical jihad.'' We were in favor \nof radical jihad because we thought the Islamic radicals hated the \nRussians worse than us. They did until they got rid of the Russians, \nand now they hate us as much or more.\n  I think we have to be very careful in going to war. I told my \nconstituents when I ran for office that the most important vote I would \never take would be on sending their men and women, the boys and girls, \nthe young men and women in my State or anywhere else in the United \nStates, to war. To me, it is amazing--amazing--that we would do this so \nlightly without any consideration by this august body, send our young \nmen and women to war without any congressional approval.\n  There have been some reports in the media about possible ties of al-\nQaida to the rebels. This morning in the Washington Post, a former \nleader of Libya's al-Qaida affiliate said he thinks freelance jihadists \nhave joined the rebel forces. A NATO commander said that some of al-\nQaida and Hezbollah forces are fighting Qadhafi forces. Former jihadist \nNoman Ben Otman estimates there are 1,000 jihadists in Libya. These are \nthe rebels.\n  We have to ask ourselves, when Qadhafi is gone, who will take his \nplace? A 2007 West Point study showed that 19 percent of foreign al-\nQaida fighters in Afghanistan hailed from Libya. Libya has been \nsupplying the second leading amount of jihadists to the war in \nAfghanistan. Interestingly, where do these fighters go? Do the fighters \ncome back to Libya to haunt us? When Qadhafi is gone, will we now have \nan al-Qaida-supported government in Libya?\n  But I think most important are not the practical aspects of going to \nwar, it is that we didn't follow the Constitution in going to war, and \nwe should have. The Constitution says very clearly that the power to \ndeclare war is the power that was given to Congress and not to the \nPresident. James Madison in the Federalist Papers was very explicit \nthat this was a power given to Congress and not to the President.\n  The President's own words are incredibly important here. The \nhypocrisy is amazing. In 2007, the President said:\n\n       The President does not have the power under the \n     Constitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a \n     situation that does not involve stopping an actual or \n     imminent threat to the nation.\n\n  Yet here we have a President cavalierly taking us to war. He seems to \nhave had a lot of time to talk to people. He talked to the Arab League. \nThey had time to get together and vote on it. He talked to the U.N. \nThey had time to get together and vote on it. But he had utter \ndisregard and contempt for the most important body in the United States \nthat represents the people--the U.S. Congress. Utter contempt. He has \ngone to NATO. He has gone to our allies. He has gone to the U.N. He has \ngone to the Arab League. But he has not had one single minute of debate \nin Congress.\n  To add insult to injury, he chose to go to war while in Brazil, while \nCongress was not even in session. This really should not be the way we \noperate as a constitutional republic.\n  I am saddened that no one here seems to stand up and say: Why in the \nworld would we let a President take us to war without any debate? Why \nin the world, when we are involved in two wars, would we get involved \nwith a third war without having a debate in Congress?\n  This, to me, is a remarkable and really tragic set of events. I hope \nthat the Congress and the Senate in particular will see fit to pass \nthis motion which sends the bill back to committee with specific \ninstructions. The specific instructions are the President's words, and \nI will be more than interested to see whether his supporters here in \nthe Senate will support the candidate Barack Obama or now the \nhypocritical version that has become our President.\n  I think this is an important question beyond any question we will \naddress in this year. Our fiscal problems are really a tragic problem \nwe face now, but this really pales in comparison, to usurp the power of \nwar, to take that power upon himself unilaterally without any debate in \nCongress.\n  I urge the passage of this motion to commit to the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in response to the Senator from \nKentucky, I would like to say that he is new to the Senate. I do not \nquestion his sincerity when it comes to the enforcement of our \nConstitution. I share his feelings about the responsibility of Congress \nunder that Constitution to declare war. I have held previous Presidents \nof both political parties to that standard and believe that this \nPresident should be held to that standard as well. I may regret some of \nhis characterizations of our President, but I will not go into that at \nthis moment. I will say the following:\n  Let's make the record clear about how we got into this situation and \nwhy we got into the situation, which the President said the other \nnight. This was not a matter of waiting until Congress came back from \nits vacation; it was a matter of innocent people being killed in Libya.\n  It was no mistake what Qadhafi was going to do. He said pointblank: I \nam going to Benghazi. I am going house to house and room to room and \nkill people, my own people.\n  It should not come as any surprise because he has a history of that, \nnot only killing his own people but killing those innocent passengers \non Pan Am 103. He is a ruthless, bloody dictator, so much so that the \nArab League of Nations broke precedent and called for Libya to be \nsuspended as long as Qadhafi was in charge. His own Arab League of \nNations suspended him. They then turned to the United Nations and said: \nPlease stop him from killing his own people.\n  Mr. PAUL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. When I finish my statement, I will be happy to yield.\n  They then said: Go to the United Nations and create the authority, an \ninternational authority to stop him. This was done.\n  It was in the midst of all this that the President was leaving for \nSouth America and Congress was leaving for a 1-week scheduled recess. \nThat is a fact. On the Friday, which is now about 10 days ago, before \nwe left, the President had a conference call and invited all members of \nthe leadership, Democratic and Republican, House and Senate, to listen \nto a briefing from the Situation Room about the exact military \nsituation we faced and invited questions and comments from all Members \nof Congress who were part of that conversation. I was part of that \nconversation. I listened to it carefully. It became clear to me that \nthe President had laid down certain conditions to U.S. involvement.\n  No. 1, the President said: No American ground troops.\n  No. 2, the President said: This is a war of short duration as far as \nthe United States is concerned; in his words, ``days,'' not weeks, and \nhe went on to say that the United States would use its unique \ncapabilities to help those allies of the United States who wanted to \nstop Qadhafi's killing. He used the phrase ``unique capabilities'' \nseveral times in that conversation.\n  I wasn't sure what he meant. I learned later in press reports. The \nUnited States used technology on the initial air invasion for the no-\nfly zone that stopped the radar of the Libyans so our planes and the \nplanes of our allies could travel across Libya and stop their planes \nand tanks without danger. So that was the commitment made by the \nPresident.\n  What does the law say? The law passed by Congress over the veto of\n\n[[Page S1964]]\n\nPresident Nixon, the War Powers Act, requires the President to notify \nCongress when he initiates this form of military action. Did he do it? \nHe did. As a matter of fact, the President submitted a notification to \nCongress within 48 hours of the initiation of these operations \nconsistent with the War Powers Resolution. So to argue that the \nPresident is circumventing Congress is not factual. He did exactly what \nthe law requires him to do.\n  If this President were planning a full-scale invasion such as we had \nin Kuwait under President George Herbert Walker Bush, with a long \nperiod of buildup--I insisted, and President Bush complied with, a \nrequest to come to Congress for authorization. He did it. Credit should \nbe given to President Bush. But it was a different circumstance.\n  What the Senator from Kentucky is suggesting is that President Obama \nshould have waited until he could summon Congress back into session--\nhow many days would that be--waited until Congress deliberated and \nvoted before he took emergency action to protect our allies' planes and \nour planes, to stop Qadhafi from killing people. I am all in favor of \nconstitutional powers, but I believe there are moments when a President \nhas to have the authority to exercise that kind of military decision \nwhen he believes it is in the best interest of the United States.\n  I don't think it is hypocritical. I am sorry that word was used. I \nthink what the President has said is that he is trying to redefine the \nrole of the United States in the world, standing up for our values, \nfighting for peace, trying to stop the carnage in Libya, without \ncommitting tens of thousands of American soldiers for years at a time. \nI happen to think that is a worthy foreign policy goal. I also believe \nthe ball is now in the court of Congress. It now is up to the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee to \ndecide if they want to have hearings on this Libyan action, whether or \nnot we take action in response to the President's filing this notice \nunder the War Powers Resolution. But to argue that the President has \njust ignored the Constitution or ignored the law ignores the facts. The \nPresident filed the notification required by law under the War Powers \nAct. Now the ball is in our court. Are we going to move forward? Will \nwe have hearings? Will we take action? It is up to Congress now. I \nsincerely believe there should be hearings. I hope this matter is over \nbefore we even have the requirement or necessity to have such hearings. \nBut at this moment in time, as I see it, the President has complied \nwith the law.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Kentucky for a question.\n  Mr. PAUL. On December 7, 1941, we were attacked and the President \ndeclared war. We had a session within 24 hours. On 9/11, we were \nattacked by people coming from Afghanistan. We met within 3 days and \nhad a use of force authorization. I think there is a problem with sort \nof saying it is OK to declare that the President can go to war after he \nhas already done it.\n  In Afghanistan and Iraq, with all the complaints from many people on \nthe different wars in which we are involved, President Bush did come to \nask for the authorization of force. We have had 2 to 3 weeks of this \nissue. They had time to go to the U.N. They had time to go to the Arab \nLeague. They had time to go to everyone. I think the Senator from \nIllinois should be as insulted as I am that they never came to \nCongress.\n  The War Powers Act has specific criteria that allows the President to \nuse force: a declared war, when he has use of authorization, or when we \nare in imminent danger. Which one of those meets the War Powers Act \nwith regard to Libya?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is correct in his statement that not only \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush but also President George W. Bush \ncame to Congress and broke precedent. That had not happened in Korea or \nVietnam. We went back to what I considered to be the constitutional \nstandard. Congress deliberated on those wars and voted.\n  I will tell the Senator from Kentucky, since he is my friend and is \nnew here, it is one of the most compelling votes he will ever cast. I \nhope he never faces it. But if he does, it is one of the votes that \nwill keep him up at night trying to think what is best for America and \nwhat is best for the young men and women who may lose their lives in \nthe process.\n  In fairness to both Presidents Bush, they did come to Congress. The \nlead-up to the invasion of Iraq went on for weeks if not months. The \nsame thing was true for Afghanistan. Remember, in the situation with \nAfghanistan, after 9/11, we were here in this building when it \nhappened. We knew what 9/11 was about, and we responded accordingly.\n  The Senator from Kentucky has the right to express his point of view \nand debate it on the Senate floor and the right to pursue the War \nPowers Act which gives Congress the authority for hearings and a \ndecision. What I disagree with the Senator from Kentucky about is the \ncharacterization that the President did not follow the law. He did \nnotify Congress. The circumstances moved so quickly with human life \nhanging in the balance, the President made that decision and now stands \nwith the American people making a judgment as to whether it was the \nproper decision to make.\n  At this point I would like to yield the floor to the Senator from \nKansas for the purpose of debate only, with the understanding that when \nhe has completed his debate, I will suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. PAUL. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Fine.\n  Mr. PAUL. I know the word ``hypocritical'' is a strong word. I don't \nuse it lightly. But the words we are using in this resolution that we \nwill get a chance to vote on are the words from the President. The \nPresident said: The President does not have power under the \nConstitution to unilaterally authorize a military attack in a situation \nthat does not involve stopping an actual or imminent threat to the \nNation.\n  How does the Senator from Illinois square that with his actions?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That was the question raised by the President in his \naddress to the American people the night before last, as to whether it \nis in the best interest of the United States to step forward with our \nunique capability--in this case, our air power, as well as our \ntechnology--to protect innocent human life. There are some who will \nargue that he should not have done it, and we should have just waited \nto see if Qadhafi would keep his word to kill all these innocent \npeople. I think the President made the right, humane decision.\n  Had we made a fraction of that decision in Rwanda, it might have \nspared tens of thousands of people from dying. The same thing might \nhave happened in Darfur. I think the Presidents who were in power at \nthat time both personally regret the fact that we didn't do anything as \nthose genocides unfolded. President Obama did not want that to occur on \nhis watch and thought the United States, in a limited military \ncommitment, could help spare innocent people in Libya from this \ncarnage.\n  We can debate as to whether that is appropriate, and I am sure we \nwill. I know the Senator from Kentucky has his own beliefs on the \nsubject.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Moran, be \nrecognized to speak in debate only and that following his remarks, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                          Financial Challenges\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for \naccommodating my ability to speak on the Senate floor this afternoon on \nwhat I consider to be a very significant and important topic.\n  Our country is facing significant financial difficulties. In the \ncoming weeks, the United States will reach its $14.29 trillion limit \nfor borrowing. Unfortunately, this is the 11th time in the past decade \nthat Congress will vote on whether to allow the country to take on even \nmore debt. These financial challenges we face, if left unchecked, will \nhave a disastrous impact upon our country today and upon citizens in \nthe future.\n  For way too long members of both political parties have ignored this \ngrowing fiscal crisis and have allowed\n\n[[Page S1965]]\n\nour country to live well beyond its means. Delaying difficult decisions \nand simply increasing the debt ceiling once again should not be an \noption. The time to correct our failures is now.\n  Officials from the Obama administration warn that the failure of \nCongress to raise the legal debt limit would risk default. But the \nbigger economic threat that confronts our country is the consequences \nof allowing our country's pattern of spending and borrowing to continue \nwithout a serious plan to reduce that debt. Our out-of-control debt is \nslowing our economic growth and threatening the prosperity of future \ngenerations who will have to pay for our irresponsibility.\n  In the next three decades our debt very well could grow to more than \nthree times the size of our entire economy. This level of government \nspending is unsustainable and cannot continue. Our Congress is engaged \nin a serious and significant debate now about a continuing resolution. \nThat resolution is the result of the failure of the past Congress to \npass a budget and appropriations bills to fill in the blanks of that \nbudget. In fact, we are now dealing with the next 6 months of spending, \nthe end of the fiscal year which ends September 30 of this year. We are \nhaving an argument about the magnitude of the reductions of spending to \ninclude in the final 6 months of this continuing resolution.\n  I certainly wish to participate in the debate. I admit it is an \nimportant issue, but there is more significant issues yet to come. \nWhile it is important how we resolve the next 6 months, it is even more \nimportant we adopt a budget for the next fiscal year, 2012; that we \nreturn to regular order and have an appropriations process in which we \ncan determine levels of spending within that budget, establish our \npriorities, eliminate programs, decrease spending where appropriate, \nand move this country to a balanced budget.\n  In addition to a CR for the next 6 months and to next year's budget \nand appropriations process, there is looming the more serious \nconsequences of so-called mandatory spending which comprise 56 percent \nof our entire budget. We have to get beyond the CR debate of today and \nget to the spending problems of 2012 and beyond and to the issue of so-\ncalled mandatory spending that consumes our budget and drives up debt \nnow and in the future.\n  We need to be responsible and quickly resolve the spending bill for \nthis year and move on to these issues that will determine the future of \nour country, especially the economic future for citizens today and into \nthe future.\n  The President ought to consider in his budget--but he didn't--the \nrecommendations of his National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and \nReform. We have seen, once again, the failure of the budget as proposed \nby this President to include any of those provisions that his own \ncommission recommended in getting us out of our financial difficulty.\n  It seems to me that often, at least throughout my lifetime, we have \nheard the discussion here in Washington, DC--I, as an American citizen, \nas an observer of the politics and the policies of our Nation's \ncapital, have heard year in and year out about the need to reduce \nspending, to balance the books, to quit spending so much money, to be \nmore fiscally responsible. Our fiscal house has to be put in order. \nThose are words I have heard throughout my entire adult life, and yet I \nam fearful they have once again just become words.\n  We do not have the luxury of those words meaning nothing this time \naround. I would suggest there are those who may observe the proceedings \nof this Congress this year and say: Once again, there is a political \ndebate going on. It is rhetoric between Republicans and Democrats. It \nis a battle between the House and the Senate, between the Congress and \nthe President, without recognizing this debate has serious consequences \nto the American people today and into the future.\n  As I said earlier, spending beyond our means is no longer an option, \nand the failure of us to address these issues in a responsible manner \nmeans the standard of living American citizens enjoy today will be \ndiminished. It means a lower standard of living for every American \nfamily. It means an increase in interest rates. It means a return of \ninflation. It means an increase in our imbalance of payments. It means \nour trade balance is exacerbated. It means we may follow the path of \nother countries in the world today that have failed to address these \nissues, and we will see the circumstances that many countries find \nthemselves in, in which their credit ratings have diminished and their \ninterest rates have risen.\n  If we fail to respond, if we fail to act as we should, if we let one \nmore time this issue to pass for somebody else to solve because it is \nso difficult, we will reduce the opportunities the next generation of \nAmericans has to pursue the American dream.\n  This is not an academic or a political party discussion. It is not a \nphilosophical debate. It has true economic consequences to every \nAmerican. We are not immune from the laws of economics that face every \ncountry, and by the failure to get our financial house in order and \nborrowing under control, interest rates will rise, our creditors may \ndecide we are no longer creditworthy, and we will suffer the same \nconsequence that countries in our world today are suffering that \nfollowed this path.\n  This is the most expected economic crisis in our lifetime, perhaps in \nthe history of our country. We know what is going to happen if we do \nnot act, and we would be acting so immorally and without responsibility \nshould we look the other way because the politics of this issue are too \ndifficult.\n  Americans deserve, are entitled to leadership in Washington, DC, to \nconfront these problems and not to push them off to the next generation \nof Americans, and I am sorry to say that, in my view, to date the \nPresident has provided little leadership on what I consider to be this \nmost important issue of my generation.\n  My interest in public service and politics is one that has lots of \nbeginnings, but what has me committed to public service today is a \nbelief that I and people in my generation--in fact, every American \ncitizen--have the responsibility to pass on to the next generation of \nAmericans the ability to pursue the American dream. Our failure to act \ntoday, our failure--to simply raise the debt ceiling one more time--\nmeans we will have abdicated our responsibilities and the burdens will \nfall to those who follow us. We will have lacked the morality and the \ncourage necessary to do right.\n  Earlier this week, I informed the President, in correspondence to \nPresident Obama on March 22, with these words:\n\n       Americans are looking for leadership in Washington to \n     confront the problems of today, not push them off on future \n     generations. To date, [Mr. President,] you have provided \n     little or no leadership on what I believe to be the most \n     important issue facing our nation--our national debt. With no \n     indication that your willingness to lead will change, I \n     [write] to inform you [, Mr. President,] I will vote ``no'' \n     on your request to raise the debt ceiling.\n\n  I do that because I believe in the absence of serious and significant \nspending reductions, in the absence of serious and significant reform \nin the budget and spending process, in the absence of a constitutional \namendment that restricts our ability to spend money we do not have, in \nthe absence of statutory guidelines that tell us we cannot spend and \nborrow ad infinitum, that our country's future is in grave danger. I do \nthis with a sense of responsibility to Americans today and a sense of \nresponsibility for Americans to come.\n  I ask the President to provide that leadership, to address the issues \nof not only this continuing resolution and next year's spending level \nand the so-called mandatory spending, but also to help us create an \neconomy in which growth can occur, in which business men and women make \ndecisions to employ new workers, and that the American people have the \nopportunity, when they sit around the dining room table and discuss \ntheir future, to know they have the chance to keep the job they have or \nto find a job they do not have.\n  That will require the leadership of President Obama and Republicans \nand Democrats in the House and Senate. In the absence of any indication \nthat leadership is going to be provided, and that we are going to be \nserious in addressing our problems of today, and resolving them for the \nfuture, I will vote ``no'' on extending the debt limit.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, as we continue to debate important \nsmall business legislation, I rise\n\n[[Page S1966]]\n\ntoday to discuss an amendment to further support investment and job \ncreation in U.S. companies.\n  In particular, my amendment would bolster our domestic manufacturing \nindustry, which has historically been the engine of growth for the \nAmerican economy. The manufacturing economy has been especially \nimportant in the industrial Northeast, including my State of Rhode \nIsland. From the Old Slater Mill in Pawtucket--one of the first water-\npowered textile mills in the nation--to modern submarine production at \nQuonset Point, the manufacturing sector has always been central to our \neconomy.\n  Sadly, as American companies have faced rising production costs and \nincreased--and often unfair--competition from foreign firms, U.S. \nproduction has plummeted. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, \nthe number of manufacturing jobs declined by almost a third over the \npast decade from 17.2 million in 2000 to 11.7 million in 2010. This \ndecline has been felt most sharply in old manufacturing centers like \nRhode Island. In Rhode Island, the loss of manufacturing jobs over the \npast decade has topped 44 percent. The decline of the manufacturing \nsector is a primary reason why Rhode Island has had greater difficulty \nthan most states in recovering from the recent recession.\n  Over and over, I have travelled around Rhode Island to meet with \nlocal manufacturers, listening to their frustrations and discussing \nideas to help their businesses grow. During these visits I have heard \none theme over and over again: unfair foreign competition is killing \ndomestic industries. One Pawtucket manufacturer told me that they \nrecently lost eight percent of their business to a Chinese competitor. \nIt is clear to me that if we want to keep manufacturing jobs in Rhode \nIsland, we need to level the playing field with foreign competitors.\n  My amendment would remove one incentive to move jobs offshore and \nhelp to make competition fairer for companies struggling to keep their \nfactory doors open here in the United States. Based on the Offshoring \nPrevention Act, cosponsored by Senators Leahy, Sanders, Boxer, Durbin, \nBrown of Ohio, Harkin, Johnson, and Levin, my amendment would end a \ncostly tax incentive that rewards companies for shipping jobs overseas. \nUnder current law, an American company that manufactures goods in Rhode \nIsland or in the Presiding Officer's State must pay Federal income \ntaxes on profits in the year that the profits are earned. But if that \nsame company moves its factory to another country, however, it is \npermitted to defer the payment of income taxes, and declare them in a \nyear that is more advantageous--for example, one in which the company \nhas offsetting losses.\n  It makes no sense that our Tax Code allows companies to delay paying \nincome taxes on profits made through overseas subsidiaries, and my bill \nwill put a stop to this practice for profits earned on manufactured \ngoods exported to the United States. To put it simply, we should not \nreward companies for eliminating American jobs.\n  In addition to ending an incentive to ship jobs overseas, my \namendment would reduce the Federal deficit by $19.5 billion over the \nnext decade. At a time when Republicans are promoting painful cuts to \npopular Federal programs to save similar amounts, these are savings we \ncannot afford to pass up. If we are going to be serious and fair about \ndeficit reduction, we need to look at these corporate loopholes and \ngiveaways, not just at cuts to Head Start, NPR, and Planned Parenthood.\n  I hope that my colleagues will show their support for American jobs \nand for deficit reduction by supporting my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if I could begin in the spirit of \nmorning business, I am here to talk about the importance of passing the \nreauthorization of the Small Business Innovation Research Program. I \nthink it is important because our future economic prosperity depends on \nwhether this country can continue to be a leader in science and \ninnovation. We can't compete with India and China for those low-wage \nmanufacturing jobs. That is not the future of America. Our future is to \nbe the global leader in science and technology. America makes the best, \nmost innovative products and services, and that ingenuity and \nexcellence is our chief economic strength as a nation.\n  As a former small business owner, I know it is business and not \ngovernment that creates jobs, but I also know government has a critical \nrole to play in fostering a positive business climate. I believe there \nare a few things we need to do to unleash the innovative spirit that is \nso alive and well throughout this country, and particularly in my home \nState of New Hampshire.\n  To maintain the creative dominance that has allowed us to lead the \nworld in innovation, we do need to enact a long-term reauthorization of \nthe Small Business Innovation Research Program, or the SBIR Program.\n  SBIR is not just a typical grant program. Under the SBIR Program a \nsmall business is able to compete for research that Federal agencies \nneed to accomplish their missions--agencies such as the Department of \nDefense. Small businesses employ about one-third of America's \nscientists and engineers and produce more patents than large businesses \nand universities. Yet small business receives only about 4 percent of \nFederal research and development dollars. SBIR ensures that small \nbusiness gets a tiny fraction of existing Federal research dollars.\n  In the last few months, as we have been talking about the SBIR \nProgram in the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee on which I \nserve, I have had the chance to visit a number of New Hampshire \ncompanies that are doing cutting-edge research and are growing their \nbusinesses because of the SBIR Program. This research has allowed them \nto develop new products and customers and to hire new workers. I wish \nto talk specifically about one of those companies because they have \nsuch a great story. It is a company called Airex, and it is in \nSomersworth, NH. Their story shows just how the SBIR Program encourages \ninnovation and creates jobs.\n  When I visited Airex, I had a chance to see some of the impressive \ntechnologies the company has developed. Airex specializes in \nelectromagnetic motors and components. As they explained to me, their \nmotors don't go round and round, they go back and forth. Its employees \ndesign and produce everything from motors used to make Apple's iPad, to \ngyroscopic coils that are used to stabilize the artillery system on \nAbrams tanks. So they produce a wide divergence of products.\n  In the past decade Airex has more than doubled its revenues and its \nworkforce largely because of the products it developed with the support \nof the SBIR Program. Jim Sedgewick, who is the President of Airex, told \nme SBIR was critically important for the development of the products \nthat enabled the company to add several good-paying jobs in New \nHampshire.\n\n[[Page S1967]]\n\n  For example, Airex was able to compete for and win a grant to do \nresearch for the Air Force on materials needed for strategic missile \ndefense. In order to conduct the research Airex had to develop a new \nelectromagnetic motor. Since the motor that Airex developed had \ntremendous commercial potential, Airex secured a patent. Now that motor \nis used in the production process for the Apple iPad and, as my \ncolleagues can imagine, sales for that motor have increased \ndramatically in recent years as the iPad has become so popular.\n  The same is true for several other products Airex developed with the \nhelp of SBIR. Airex products continue to be in high demand not just in \nAmerica but across the world. Exports now account for 30 percent of \nAirex's revenues, so they are a great story on the export front too. \nAirex told me its biggest export products are the ones that were \ndeveloped with the support of the SBIR Program.\n  If we are going to out-compete and out-innovate the rest of the \nworld, we need to encourage the kind of innovation that has made Airex \nso successful. SBIR was integral to making Airex's success a reality. \nThat is why SBIR must continue to be an important part of our strategy \nfor staying competitive in the 21st century.\n  Airex is just one of many New Hampshire small businesses that have \nsuccessfully competed for SBIR funding in the 28 years the program has \nbeen in existence. All across New Hampshire small businesses that \notherwise wouldn't be able to compete for Federal R funding have won \ncompetitive grants to advance technology and science and create good \njobs. In just the last 2 years New Hampshire firms have won 80 SBIR \nawards. In fact, despite its small size, although it is a little bigger \nthan Delaware, as the Presiding Officer knows, New Hampshire is ranked \n22nd in the Nation for total grants awarded through the Department of \nDefense since SBIR began.\n  So I know the Presiding Officer knows we need to focus on smart ways \nto create jobs and stay competitive. We all know small firms are where \nthe jobs are created in the United States, and we know the future of \nthe American economy rests with innovation. The SBIR Program must be \none important part of our overall strategy to encourage the innovation \nthat will keep the American economy strong through the 21st century.\n  So I am pleased to be here to support SBIR, and I encourage all of \nour colleagues to join me in supporting this important program.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN.

Mr. President, I am coming to the floor because we have \nnot seen much action on the floor on this bill. We are hung up over the \nright of Senators to offer amendments, but the Senate works best when \nwe have a free and open process of offering amendments. One of the \namendments in particular that I was going to offer on the blending \nrequirements for ethanol I now plan, at this time, not to offer. I have \nmade that known to the majority leader but have still not been able to \nget an agreement to offer other amendments.\n  Our country is in a pickle. I have $20 billion worth of cuts that the \nvast majority of the Members of the Senate would vote for. Yet I can't \nget those amendments up because people don't want to take the difficult \nvotes. I understand that. Senator Reid has been more than gracious in \nworking with me. I understand his problem, but the problems are a lot \nbigger than the problems of the Senate. The problems facing our country \nare tremendous. They are not only tremendous, they are also urgent.\n  Here we have a small business bill, where we are trying to create \njobs, and one of the ways we create jobs is making sure we are not \nsending money out of here that doesn't create jobs. So I come to the \nfloor somewhat worried about our process and not critical of Senator \nReid in any way. I wouldn't have his job. Being the majority leader is \nthe toughest job in Washington. But it is somewhat worrisome, and yet \namusing, that we will not take a vote to eliminate unemployment \npayments to millionaires. That is amazing to me. We can save $20 \nmillion starting tomorrow by not cutting unemployment checks to people \nwho make $1 million a year through their investments but who are \nunemployed. I mean, $20 million. We could do that.\n  We could put a garnishee on the $1 billion owed by Senate employees \nand Federal employees in back taxes, where it has already been \nadjudicated they haven't paid, but we can't get an amendment up to do \nthat. Isn't that strange?\n  Here we are, running $1.67 trillion deficit, and yet we can't go \nabout solving our problems $1 billion at a time to help get rid of \nthat. We can't have the right to offer an amendment to that effect.\n  How about the fact the GAO, 3 weeks ago, issued a report on \nduplication, and, according to my calculations, there is at least $100 \nbillion in savings in that. I have an amendment that would save us $5 \nbillion over the rest of this year on the easiest part of the \nelimination to carry out. I can't get that amendment up. We can't vote \non it. We can't do the things that will start getting us out of our \nproblems. Even though I have withdrawn the amendment on ethanol that is \nso controversial, I still can't get my amendments called up.\n  Covered bridges--$8.5 million. It is a good thing to do, if we had \nthe money. But we shouldn't be spending $8.5 million right now on old \nbridges that are of historical significance, because we are borrowing \nthe money to do it.\n  I have an amendment to identify and disclose every Federal program, \none of the things the GAO report said would be very helpful to them to \nhave--if every department would give, every year, a list of all their \nprograms. There is only one government agency that does that today, and \nit is the Department of Education. The rest of them don't know all \ntheir programs. Isn't that interesting; they do not even know their \nprograms? Yet we can't get an amendment up that will help us solve some \nof the problems with duplication and inefficiencies.\n  So I come to the floor tonight to ask: What is the deal? This is the \nSenate. We are expected to make tough votes. If Senators want to \ncontinue to pay millionaires unemployment, then vote against the \namendment, but don't keep that amendment from coming to the floor that \nwould save us $20 million. If you think Federal employees shouldn't pay \ntheir back taxes, then vote against it, but we can collect $1 billion--\n$1 billion that we wouldn't have to borrow. Vote against it, but don't \nblock the amendments from coming up.\n  I have an amendment that I understand is controversial. I don't think \nthere is a role anymore for us in funding the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting to the tune of $\\1/2\\ billion a year. You may not like it, \nyou may not agree with me but vote against it. Don't say you can't have \nthe amendment. Because what goes around comes around, and we don't want \nto get into the dysfunctional state where because somebody can't have \nan amendment today, somebody else isn't going to have an amendment \nlater. That is what we are going to degrade into, and it will not be \nbecause we would not want to vote on them. So what happens is the \nSenate gets paralyzed.\n  The unfortunate thing is that I have $20 billion worth of cuts we can \nmake. Yet we are not allowed, under Senate tradition, to offer an \namendment, even though, on the most controversial one I have, I have \nsaid: OK. I won't offer it at this time. Still, I can't offer an \namendment. To me, I think that tells the American people what they \nalready know; that we don't care about what the real problems are, we \ncare about the politics.\n  We no longer have the pleasure or the time to worry about political \noutcomes. We need to be worrying about what the outcome is of the \nfuture of\n\n[[Page S1968]]\n\nthis country. When a sitting Senator can't offer $20 billion worth of \ncuts in a $3.7 trillion budget on a bill that is related to business--\nand this $20 billion will be money we will not be competing with \nagainst them for the capital to create jobs in this country--it strikes \nme that we have lost balance; that we need to reright the ship.\n  Everybody in this body wants to vote on the 1099. We know it was a \nmistake. I think there will be very few Senators who will vote against \nthat. There is a controversial amendment--the Inhofe amendment--but \nthis is the Senate. Let's vote on it. Whatever way it turns out, let's \nlet the body do its work, rather than not allowing the body to work. So \nmy hat is off to Senator Reid. He has been cooperative. But we can't \nrun the Senate this way, saying people don't have a right to offer \namendments.\n  I will never forget when I first came to the Senate 7 years ago and I \nhad an objection to an amendment that was offered, another Senator from \nthe other party came and said: You can't do that. This is the \nSenate. We debate amendments. We vote on amendments.\n\n  Somebody on the other side of the aisle defended the process of the \nSenate. The fact is, we are in tough times. We are going to be taking a \nlot of tough votes--if not now, a year from now. But they are going to \nget tougher every year we take them because the writing is on the wall \nfor America in terms of its spending and its debt.\n  If you look at what has happened to interest rates on our T bonds the \nlast 2 days in a row, T bonds are strong, interest rates are going up. \nWhat does that mean to us? Our historical average interest rate on our \ndebt is about 6.07 percent. We paid 1.97 percent last year. For every 1 \npercent that rises, that is $140 billion additional that does not help \nthe first American. We ought to be about getting rid of things that we \ncan get rid of that will survive OK on their own, that are not \nduplicating things we should be duplicating. The Senator from Alaska \nand I put in an amendment on the FAA bill getting rid of old earmarks, \nmoney that is parked. It will save us $1 billion. The fact is, we can \ndo this if we will stand up and do the job we were hired to do. The job \nwe were hired to do is to make the difficult decisions. My hope is that \nthings will break loose and we will revert to the best of the tradition \nof the Senate, which is having real debate about real amendments, \ntaking the tough votes, and defending them on principle. Take the \npolitical calculus out of it. It is not popular for me, in Oklahoma, to \neliminate the blenders' credit on ethanol. We have a lot of corn \nfarmers. But the fact is the very people who get this--British \nPetroleum, Valero, ExxonMobil, Chevron--do not want it. I have a letter \nfrom them saying they don't want the blenders' credit. That is who gets \nit. Only 16 percent of the ethanol is produced by farmer cooperative \nethanol plants; 84 percent is not. It is produced by the big boys and \nthey are saying they don't want it.\n  Why don't we save $5 billion between now and the end of the year, \nbecause we are going to borrow 47 percent of it? Why would we do that \nto our children? So I relented on that. We will have a vote on it. I \nwill have to have a 67-vote threshold to do it but we are going to vote \non it. Senator Reid knows we are eventually going to vote on it. We \nought to be about being grown up and going back to the best traditions \nof the Senate and taking the tough votes. Our country is in tough \ntimes. Families are having tough times. Why would we want to duck \nmaking tough decisions? The only reason we would want to do that is \npolitical. It is so somebody can gain a political advantage rather than \ndo the best, right thing for our country.\n  I call on my colleagues, whoever it is who is objecting to \ncommonsense amendments, who does not want to fulfill their obligation \nto their own constituents by casting a vote, to look at what you are \ndoing to the Senate. There is no reason we should get into this \nconflict--because I can't offer amendments I am eventually not going to \nlet other people offer amendments? Why would we go to the childish \nresolution of this rather than the adult resolution? The adult \nresolution is to give people their votes, vote on them and go down the \nroad and if you don't agree with them, defend it; if you do agree with \nit, vote for it. But don't duck on taking a position. That is belying \nthe oath you have being a Senator.\n  Those who are objecting to cutting $20 billion out of this \ngovernment, out of a $3.6 trillion budget, wake up. You are going to be \ncutting this money in the next 2 years, whether you cut it today or \ntomorrow. It is coming. Let's do it now, because every day we do it \nearlier saves us money. But it also preserves and enhances the future \nfor our kids.\n  I will not harp on this other than to say I am disappointed because \nwe had started this year out pretty well in terms of going to \namendments. The leaders, both leaders, have worked hard to make sure \nthat could happen. Now that we have tough votes people want to revert \nto childish behavior and not honor the reason they were sent here in \nthe first place. Not voting on something is the chicken's way out. It \nis the coward's way out. Voting on something and defending your vote is \nhonorable. You do not have to agree with me but don't say you cannot \nhave an amendment and you cannot have a vote, because I assure you I \nknow the parliamentary procedures to get a vote on every amendment I \nwill ever offer. We will get votes on these amendments. The question \nis, if you are trying to duck, not having to vote on an amendment \nbecause you don't like the political choices, you are going to get a \nvote anyway, so why degrade the Senate into childish behavior because \nyou want to duck a vote? We are not going to duck these votes. We are \ngoing to have them. I promise you, we are going to have every one of \nthese votes eventually. I am talking over a short period of time. Or we \nare not going to do anything. We are going to live up to the tradition \nof the Senate or we are not going to function at all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to engage in a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have a couple of questions for the Senator from \nOklahoma. My understanding is that he seeks to have an amendment \nconsidered that would eliminate the subsidies which are $4 billion?\n  Mr. COBURN. We do not seek to eliminate any subsidies. We seek to \neliminate a blenders' credit that the very people who receive the \ncredit do not want, and it is $4.9 billion between now and the end of \nthe year.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is $4.9 billion and the recipients themselves want it \nreversed?\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes. I have a letter from the refiners. I actually have \nit here and I will introduce it to the Record if we need to, that says \nthey don't want it, they don't need it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So the recipients of this government largesse would want \nit eliminated. What is the basis, if I may ask, of the opposition to \nthe amendment?\n  Mr. COBURN. I think I can clarify it. The opposition is we are doing \nit abruptly rather than over a period of time and not allowing people \nto plan for the elimination of this. Those are the arguments I hear. \nThe fact is, this is just one of a series of things we do for ethanol.\n  I am not going after ethanol. I am going after saving money for our \ncountry that is being spent. We have a mandate that says the country \nhas to buy a specific amount of ethanol. Before we had that mandate, a \nblenders' credit was a smart thing to do if you believed that ethanol \nwas a way to solve our problems. But the fact is, we now have a mandate \nthat they have to produce it. It is going to 15 billion gallons a year. \nI can give you the exact numbers in terms of what we produce. But \nbecause we have a blenders' credit, last year we produced 397 million \ngallons more and we exported it to Europe. So the American people \nsubsidized $200 million worth of ethanol consumption in Europe through \nthese blenders' credits.\n\n[[Page S1969]]\n\n  We are not going after all the other loans, the loan programs, all \nthe other energy grants and everything else. We are not doing any of \nthat. All we are saying is here is a simple thing that is no longer \nneeded; 86 percent of the ethanol production is by majors, not small \nethanol plants. They do not want this money, they do not need this \nmoney to blend ethanol because there is already a mandate there \nrequiring it. I have already withdrawn--I have agreed that we will not \nvote this amendment until after cloture and I will file a motion to \nsuspend the rules and then we will have a 67-vote threshold which we \nwill not win. But the American people are going to lose. The American \npeople are going to lose $4.9 billion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the argument is that maybe we ought to eliminate this \nbut not abruptly, wasn't the message of last November 2 that they \nwanted a lot of things done abruptly?\n  Mr. COBURN. I think the message of the American people is they want \nthe spending cut. They want it cut now. They want us to quit spending \nmoney we don't have on things we don't need, and this is a ideal \nprogram--just like the other portion of it. I have $20 billion worth of \namendments. None of them can come to the floor because there is an \nobjection to having votes on $20 billion worth of cuts.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That was my understanding, that as part of the beginning \nof the new session of Congress, the 112th Congress, there were going to \nbe amendments allowed; that there would be kind of a different \nenvironment where it would not be bringing up a bill, filing cloture \nand shutting out Members from offering amendments. That is apparently \nnot the case?\n  Mr. COBURN. I think it is the case, but to be fair, there is \nbipartisan opposition to this amendment. I understand it. It is from \nthe corn-producing States. They are worried that this might have an \neffect on ethanol production and corn processors. Actually, CBO \nestimates that the maximum impact of this amendment on the price of \ncorn will be less than 35 cents a bushel. Corn is near $7--record high.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Near an all-time high.\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes, so this might have an effect of 35 cents on the \nprice. But let me carry that out for a minute. Corn is the primary feed \nsource for cattle, hogs, chickens--the whole range of the things we \neat. So what we have done, through just this portion of it, is we are \nraising the cost because 40 percent of our corn production this next \nyear is going to go for ethanol.\n  It is not just that we have raised the tax because we have given $5 \nbillion or $6 billion annually in credit to the blenders; we have also \nraised the costs for everybody else's food. But do you know what we \nhave also done? We have increased the cost of our Food Stamp Program \nbecause we have raised the cost of food. So we are paying for it twice. \nIt is not just the fact--it comes back to the point that is this is not \nan attack on the ethanol industry. I actually met with the ethanol \nindustry yesterday in my office. I think Americans ought to be able to \nbuy whatever they want, E-85 or 10 percent--I think they ought to be \nable to buy it. But what they should know is when you go buy a gallon \nof gasoline today, accounting for all the credits and incentives and \neverything else in there, there is $1.78 in your taxes in every gallon \nthat you buy. So when you buy blended ethanol gasoline, you are not \npaying $3.50, you are paying $5.35.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand this amendment has been objected to by some \n``conservative organizations'' that want us not to increase taxes in \nany way, shape, or form, something that has characterized the voting \nrecord of the Senator from Oklahoma and myself. But now you are being \nattacked for being a tax increaser?\n  Mr. COBURN. I would not worry about that so much.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the argument?\n  Mr. COBURN. The argument is they do not agree with the blenders' \ncredit, but if in fact you take it away you need to give somebody else \na tax break. I think the American people know, for us to get out of the \nproblems we are in we are going to have to do a lot on both sides of \nthe balance sheet. One of the ways--we have $1.3 trillion worth of tax \nexpenditures in this country. A large portion of them--not a large \nportion, a significant amount of money is in programs such as this that \nare directing people to do things that they are going to be doing \nanyway and we are paying them to do it. So it is a tax expenditure. It \nis cutting spending is what it is. It is a true credit, so they get it. \nThe more they blend, the more money we pay.\n  So if they blend beyond what the mandate is, they cannot sell it. \nThen we ship it to Europe or wherever else will consume it, but yet we \nare subsidizing. First of all, it hurts our own energy usage because we \nare taking a lot of oil and a lot of water to do it. But we are helping \nthe Europeans with our own subsidy in terms of shipping this over.\n  So I do not care about the debate outside of the Senate. What I care \nabout is that the American people ought to have a shot at saving $4.9 \nbillion through the rest of this year.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And it seems to me that this issue has some complexities \nto it----\n  Mr. COBURN. It does.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That the average citizen would not understand. But I \nthink they understand $4.9 billion and that those savings would accrue \nto them, along with the reduction in inflation and the costs of the \nproducts of corn.\n  So it is a very interesting situation. So when I go back home and \nsome of my constituents are skeptical about whether we are really \nserious about taking on some of the sacred cows--and certainly ethanol \nhas been a sacred cow around here--maybe there is some justification \nfor their skepticism.\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, since we started the blenders' credit, the American \npeople have spent $32 billion on it. And it is fine for us to look for \nalternatives, and I think it is great. I would like for them to convert \ncorn to butanol instead of ethanol because it burns a whole lot better, \nit is more efficient, it does not pollute as much, it burns like \nregular gasoline, and it is not water-soluble, so it can be transported \nlike other petroleum products. I would like to see them go there, and I \nthink they are eventually going to go there.\n  But the fact is, markets work, and we are playing with markets--and \nthe reason we have such an objection to this is because we probably \nhave the votes to win it and they know it. So I have pulled it out.\n  But, more importantly, there is another $15 billion of amendments I \nwould like to offer that are common sense, that a good portion of the \nAmerican would absolutely agree with, and we do not have people who \nwant to have a vote on that. They do not want to stand up and do their \njobs.\n  I will read into the Record a letter from Charles Drevna, president \nof the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association.\n\n       Senator Coburn. NPRA, the National Petrochemical and \n     Refiners Association, writes today in support of your efforts \n     to end the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit through both \n     amendment number 220 to S. 493, the SBIR reauthorization \n     bill, and the bill you recently introduced with Senator \n     Cardin, S. 520. The Association has a long history of \n     opposing mandates and subsidies and this opposition extends \n     to the VEETC. The VEETC is an unnecessary subsidy, \n     particularly given the federal Renewable Fuels Standards \n     requirement to bring 36 billion gallons of biofuel into the \n     fuel supply by 2022.\n\n  So here are the people who are receiving the credit saying they do \nnot want it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, I think the Senator has made a strong point. I just \nwanted to have a clarification, and I hope that perhaps we can also \nstart addressing the issue of sugar subsidies, which I think is \nprobably one of the really great ripoffs in America today, again, \ncausing the cost of any confection or anything that contains sugar to \nrise, and then, of course, the American consumers pay for it, and \npreventing sugar from other countries from coming into this country at \na lower price.\n  Mr. COBURN. You know, the real issue is that we have spent 3 days \nthis week not doing anything on this bill. We have borrowed $12 \nbillion. I have amendments, if we could pass, that would save us $20 \nbillion.\n  Every day that we don't take hard votes is a day we don't fulfill the \nresponsibility given to us, the privilege given to us as U.S. Senators. \nNo matter what your philosophy, the fact is we ought to be taking hard \nvotes, and people who don't want to do that, their constituency ought \nto ask the question: Why are you there? Why are you afraid to defend \nwhat you believe to be\n\n[[Page S1970]]\n\nright rather than disallow somebody else to make a point and a position \nwith an amendment?\n  The Senator didn't hear my speech prior to coming in----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I was watching.\n  Mr. COBURN. These are the worst tendencies of the Senate. I want us \nto go back to the best tradition. I am not always going to be right, \nand I certainly hardly ever win, but the fact is, the issues in front \nof this country are so great that we don't have time for this anymore. \nAnd every day we do not work on this small business job-creation bill \nbecause people do not want to take tough votes is a day we are not \nfulfilling the obligations we have as Senators.\n  Mr. McCAIN. But if you believe in our great Nation and the democracy \nand the representative government that it is, over time, you will \nsucceed. It requires tenacity. I do not think the Senator will be \nelected Mr. Congeniality this year again, either, but I appreciate his \nefforts on this issue and many others. I look forward to continuing to \njoin him in the fight and following his leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S1970-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PIKEVILLE COLLEGE BEARS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

This March 22, \nthe Pikeville College Bears men's basketball team triumphed over the \nWest Virginia Mountain State University Cougars in overtime, 83 to 76, \nto win the school's first NAIA men's basketball championship.\n  It has been a thrilling season for the Bears, who finish the year \nwith a school-best 30-7 record. They tied for third place in the Mid-\nSouth Conference and entered the tournament unseeded and with something \nto prove. They certainly did that, becoming the first unseeded team in \ntournament history to defeat five seeded teams on the way to the \nchampionship.\n  The Bears beat defending national champ Oklahoma Baptist, defending \nnational runner-up Azusa Pacific, and top-seeded Robert Morris to get \nto the semifinals. Facing No. 3-seed Martin Methodist College in the \nsemifinals, the Bears clawed their way out of a 15-point deficit to win \nby 11 points.\n  Then it all came down to the final game, played in Municipal \nAuditorium in Kansas City, MO, against the Cougars from West Virginia. \nThe Bears trailed for most of the way, but by the end of the night it \nwas ``My Old Kentucky Home'' being played as the Bears cut down the \nnets.\n  Trevor Setty of Maysville, KY, tied a career high for scoring in the \ngame with 32 points, grabbed 17 rebounds and was named the tournament's \nMost Valuable Player. And Head Coach Kelly Wells was named NAIA \nNational Coach of the Year.\n  The students and faculty of Pikeville College and the people of \nPikeville, eastern Kentucky, and the whole Commonwealth couldn't be \nprouder of this winning team. They represent the very best of what the \nBluegrass State has to offer, and we are honored for them to represent \nus to basketball fans from across the Nation.

FERRARO\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. On March 26, 2011, after 12 years of battling multiple \nmyeloma, our country lost one of history's political trailblazers, the \nHonorable Geraldine Anne Ferraro. Ferraro served as a Congresswoman for \nthe 9th District of New York from 1979-1985. At a time when less than \ntwo dozen women served in Congress, Geraldine Ferraro was a consistent \nvoice for equality and unrelenting advocate for women's rights.\n  In 1984--64 years after passage of the 19th amendment granted women \nthe right to vote--Ferraro made history as the first female Vice \nPresidential candidate from a major U.S. political party, running \nalongside Walter Mondale. I vividly remember her words as I watched her \nspeak during the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco, \n``If we can do this, we can do anything.'' Millions of women and girls \nwatched that speech, inspired by the fact that a woman was one step \naway from holding the second highest office in America. Although the \nMondale-Ferraro ticket did not win the White House, Ferraro's words, \nleadership and courageous spirit would forever change the way women \nwere viewed in American politics. Her candidacy had successfully \nshattered the glass ceiling for the office of the Vice Presidency. Two \ndecades later, a Congresswoman from the same city where Ferraro \naccepted the Vice Presidential nomination would go on to become the \nfirst female Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. \nGeraldine Ferraro's journey to the precipice of the Vice Presidency \nhelped pave the way for Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi's historic \nachievement. In addition, her nomination would help pave the way for \nHillary Clinton's historic bid for the Democratic Presidential \nnomination.\n  Geraldine Ferraro will always be remembered for her passion and \ndedication to women's issues. The daughter of Italian immigrants, \nFerraro began her career as a prosecutor for New York City focusing on \nsex crimes, child abuse, and domestic violence. Ferraro carried that \npassion with her to the U.S. House of Representatives, quickly becoming \na leader among her congressional colleagues. During her three terms as \na Congresswoman, she served on a number of committees including: the \nSelect Committee on Aging, the Public Works and Transportation \nCommittee and eventually the House Budget Committee.\n  In addition to her work in Congress, Ferraro remained a devoted wife \nand loving mother to three children. After leaving public office, she \nremained in the field of public policy serving as a fellow at the John \nF. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University's Institute of \nPolitics from 1988-1992 and as a U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations \nCommission on Human Rights during the Clinton administration from 1993-\n1996. She also authored three autobiographical books about her \npolitical career. She once again entered the\n\n[[Page S1971]]\n\nworld of politics in 2008, serving on Hillary Rodham Clinton's \nPresidential campaign.\n  The life and accomplishments of Geraldine Ferraro opened the doors of \nAmerican politics and the hearts and minds of thousands of women \nseeking to make a difference. She was an inspiration to me and \nthousands of women considering the challenge of a future in politics \nand government. Our country will always be grateful for her leadership. \nShe will surely be remembered for her unique leadership, and her belief \nthat, ``America is the land where dreams can come true for all of us.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S1971-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                1-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF HEALTH REFORM LAW\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, as we pass the 1-year \nanniversary since health care reform was signed into law, I rise to \nrecognize how much it has benefitted thousands in my State. South \nDakotans now have a fair shake when it comes to buying health coverage \nand increased protections from some of the worst abuses of the health \ninsurance industry.\n  I have heard from far too many who thought they were protected by \ntheir health insurance, only to find they faced arbitrary annual or \nlifetime limits on benefits. Some were even dropped entirely from their \ncoverage when they needed it the most. Health reform has already put an \nend to these practices, and is giving hard-working Americans the \nsecurity of reliable coverage.\n  Commonsense changes that had been supported by Republicans and \nDemocrats in Congress for years are also now in effect. Children are no \nlonger at risk for being denied coverage due to a preexisting condition \nlike asthma or diabetes. Young adults are now able to stay on their \nparent's health care plan until age 26, extending coverage as many \ntransition from education to the workforce.\n  Over 129,000 South Dakota seniors are already seeing improvements to \nMedicare, including eliminated copayments for preventive care like \nimmunizations and annual wellness visits. Last year over 11,945 \nMedicare beneficiaries in our State reached the gap in prescription \ndrug coverage, known as the donut hole, and received a one-time $250 \nrebate to help pay for prescriptions. These beneficiaries will continue \nto receive deep discounts until the donut hole is completely closed in \nthe years ahead.\n  Health reform also expands Medicare beneficiaries' access to care by \nproviding a 10-percent Medicare bonus payment for primary care \nproviders and for general surgeons practicing in health professional \nshortage areas. It also puts in place important changes to our health \ncare delivery system to ensure we are paying for the quality of patient \ncare and health outcomes, rather than quantity of tests and procedures \nperformed.\n  Not only has this law benefited South Dakotans, but these \nimprovements have taken place without harming our economic recovery. \nSince the President signed the Affordable Care Act into law a year ago, \nthe economy has grown at an average rate of 2.7 percent, and nearly 1.4 \nmillion private sector jobs have been created.\n  As Congress looks for ways to get our deficit in line, the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that reform \nwill reduce the deficit by a total of $210 billion over the next 10 \nyears and by more than $1 trillion over the next 20 years.\n  We must be realistic about this law in that it cannot fix all the \nproblems with our health care delivery system overnight.

Mr. President, the Navajo Code Talkers were \na small group of marines who contributed to the American victory in the \nPacific during World War II. Their language and their bravery made \nvictory possible and helped save Allied soldiers' lives.\n  These Navajo warriors have one less man among their ranks today. My \nhome State of New Mexico and the Navajo Nation lost a great man on \nFebruary 28, 2011, when Joe Antonio Silversmith passed away at the age \nof 86. I would like to take a few moments to honor Mr. Silversmith's \nmemory and his service to our country.\n  In 1943, as a young man of only 18, Mr. Silversmith heeded the call \nof duty and enlisted in the 297th Marine Platoon. He served in the \nSouth Pacific until 1946.\n  Mr. Silversmith and the 45,000 other Native Americans who enlisted to \nserve our country in World War II had only been recognized as citizens \nof the United States for 17 years when World War II began. \nApproximately 400 of these men, including Mr. Silversmith, served as \nCode Talkers--turning their native language into a powerful code, \nunbreakable by the Japanese.\n  In 2001, Mr. Silversmith finally received the recognition he deserved \nfor his heroic World War II service when he and his fellow Code Talkers \nreceived the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  For Mr. Silversmith, his service to others did not end with his \nmilitary career. A man of strong personal faith, he eventually became a \nfull-time minister after returning to New Mexico.\n  For those who knew him, Mr. Silversmith's devotion to his flocks--\ndemonstrated through his dedication to his congregation and, more \nliterally, his love of herding of sheep--will be remembered fondly.\n  A man of courage, a hero to his family and the American people, and a \nrole model to young Navajos, Mr. Silversmith stood up for his ideals. \nHe encouraged those he knew to pursue their dreams, but to never forget \ntheir roots.\n  We owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. Silversmith, his fellow Code \nTalkers, and all those who have sacrificed in service to our country. \nLet's honor Mr. Silversmith by heeding his advice to keep our roots \nclose to our hearts while striving to achieve our own lofty goals for \nthe widest influence of good.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S1971-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1971-S1972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               100TH ANNIVERSARY OF WESTMINSTER, COLORADO\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of the city of Westminster that lies along Colorado's Front \nRange. The city of Westminster will observe this significant milestone \non April 4, 2011.\n  Westminster is the seventh most populous city in the State of \nColorado. It has had a rich history since the first homesteaders \narrived in 1870, shortly after the discovery of gold in the South \nPlatte River Valley. The Land Act of 1862 encouraged many settlers to \nmake Colorado their home instead of heading on to California.\n  The population of the town gradually increased over several decades, \nand by 1910, public services such as water access were needed to \nsupport the community. The village of Harris, named after C.J. Harris, \nwas incorporated as the town of Westminster, CO, on April 4, 1911, by a \ncitizen vote of 29 in favor and 6 opposed. The town was named for \nWestminster University, which was built in the 1890s on Crown Point.\n  The town of Westminster continued to grow and soon became the center \nfor some of the largest apple and cherry orchards in the country. \nNorthwest of Denver, Westminster remained a quiet rural town until the \n1950s when the Colorado State Highway Department constructed the \nDenver-Boulder Turnpike, bisecting Westminster and contributing to the \ntown's growth.\n  A 21-member charter Westminster convention was elected to draft and \nreview a new charter, which was approved by voters in January of 1958.\n  Providing a safe and adequate water supply has been at the forefront \nof Westminster's growth since incorporation. The town took a proactive \napproach to dealing with the community's rapid growth by creating the \nGrowth Management Plan in 1977 that called for allocating service \ncommitments as a method to manage water and other key resources.\n  Westminster has balanced growth with the establishment of an open \nspace program. In 1986, the town sought\n\n[[Page S1972]]\n\nto implement this approach and preserve and protect natural areas and \nbeautiful vistas that contribute to the unique character of the city. \nToday, 32 percent of its land is open space and green space and the \ntown has created more than 83 miles of multi-use trails.\n  Westminster's first 100 years are rich in history with monumental \nmilestones that have made it the community it is today. I want to \ncongratulate the city of Westminster as it celebrates its centennial \nanniversary. I look forward to helping Westminster continue to thrive \nas it sets out to make history in the next 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S1972-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               40TH ANNIVERSARY OF OGLALA LAKOTA COLLEGE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I wish to speak \ntoday to honor the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Oglala \nLakota College. In a society where education has been the cornerstone \nfor generations, the Oglala Lakota College has been providing students \nwith a high quality education in Indian Country for decades. Graduates \nhave gone on to be extraordinary community and professional leaders \nworking to improve the lives of all those around them.\n  The Oglala Lakota College, headquartered in Kyle, SD, first opened \nits doors in 1971 with the goal of bringing hope to the people on the \nPine Ridge Indian Reservation--home of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. This \nsmall college was a great risk when it began, as it was one of the \nfirst tribally owned and operated colleges in the United States, but \nthe founders believed in the importance of bringing education to Indian \ncountry. Although the name of the school has changed, throughout the \nyears the idea that the benefit of higher education is of vital \nimportance to the community has stayed constant. Since its inception, \nthe Oglala Lakota College has expanded course offerings to establish \nonline courses and satellite classes, providing easier accessibility to \nstudents.\n  From the very beginning, the Oglala Lakota College faced challenges: \nThe faculty and students worked and studied in old building basements, \nworked around kitchen tables, and used old trailers as makeshift \nclassrooms. The college finally moved to a group of government surplus \nbuildings. Despite an environment ill-suited for education, the \nstudents and professors triumphed under the challenging circumstances, \nand today provide hope for the future of the students.\n  In 1991, after years of educators striving to provide an education in \na difficult learning environment, the school began a 10-year capital \ncampaign to construct new buildings for the students.\n  In 2005 and 2009, the Oglala Lakota College received grants from the \nLabor, Health Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee \nto assist funding recruitment, curriculum development, and program \ninfrastructure for the nursing degree offered by the Oglala Lakota \nCollege. More than 40 percent of graduates work at Indian Health \nServices hospitals, making the Oglala Lakota College the primary tribal \ncollege producer of health care providers for the Indian Health \nService. In addition, in the past decade, Oglala Lakota College has \nreceived several grants to improve the learning environment on its \ncampuses.\n  The Oglala Lakota College has grown considerably since starting as a \nsmall community college. Today it is a thriving campus offering \nbaccalaureate degrees--including a master's degree in Lakota \nleadership. Under the guidance of my good friend, President Tom \nShortbull, the Oglala Lakota College increased its enrollment to 1,400 \nstudents, a record number of students focusing on their goal to further \ntheir education.\n  I congratulate the great legacy and triumphs over adversity of the \nOglala Lakota College on the occasion of its 40th anniversary and \ncommend the work and commitment, past and present, of the \nadministrators, faculty, alumni and students. I wish them well in the \nupcoming year of observances and celebrations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S1972-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1972-S1973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING JUDGE M. BLANE MICHAEL\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \na West Virginian who was an exacting and thoughtful judge, a committed \nfather, and a treasured friend. Blane Michael, a Federal judge for the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, passed away over the \nweekend.\n  There are some people whose lives transcend biographies and are so \nrichly varied and important that trying to capture their essence in a \nfew brief remarks is impossible. Blane Michael was that kind of person. \nAnd although I am unlikely to do his life justice with these short \nremarks, I felt it was important for the Senate to hear about this \ngreat individual.\n  Honest and humble to his core, Blane committed himself to public \nservice. Born February 17, 1943, in Charleston, SC, he grew up on a \npastoral farm in Grant County, WV--a quiet spot tucked away in the \nmountains of the State that he left for the first time when he went to \nlaw school.\n  A 1965 graduate of West Virginia University and a 1968 graduate of \nNew York University School of Law, Blane worked for a time at a New \nYork law firm, and then as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern \nDistrict of New York. But like many young people who have left our \nState to pursue education, employment or other opportunities, he heard \nthe call to return home and give back to his State, and the people who \nhelped form his foundation for public service.\n  In 1972, he returned to West Virginia with his glorious wife Mary \nAnne, who grew up in Shinnston, WV. After working as a special \nassistant U.S. attorney for the Northern District of West Virginia and \nlater opening a private practice, his path first crossed mine--and my \nlife is forever better because of it.\n  From 1977 to 1980, Blane served as special counsel during my first \nterm as Governor of West Virginia. He was a young lawyer at the time, \nin his early thirties, but he was intelligent, ethical, and \nextraordinarily hardworking. Most importantly, he understood the \nimportance of using his legal skills in service to, and for the \nbetterment of, his fellow citizens. During those years, I came to know \nquickly that his sight was transfixed on the common good--and for that \nreason, his judgment and wisdom were something I valued immensely and \nsought out often, well beyond my years as Governor.\n  In 1981, Blane returned to private practice where he continued to \nsolidify his reputation as a skilled lawyer and a person of \nintellectual and moral depth. I was fortunate during that time that he \nwas willing to serve as manager for two of my campaigns for United \nStates Senate. Always true to his work ethic, he continued to maintain \na full-time legal practice while performing campaign duties during his \nlunch breaks and on the weekends.\n  He was nominated by President Bill Clinton for a seat on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on August 6, 1993, and was \nconfirmed by the Senate on September 30, 1993. As an appeals court \njudge, he later said that he was lucky to have the one job he had \nwanted from the time he was a young attorney.\n  During his 17 years on the Federal bench, he was a formidable \npresence whose record of service speaks to who he was as a person--\ntough when he had to be, and always fair and honest. With a moral and \nintellectual compass set hard for justice, Blane was a brilliant judge \nwho never took for granted the power and the responsibility of deciding \nthe cases that impacted people's lives. Time and again, he spoke for \nthose without a voice and protected the rights that we as Americans \nhold so dear.\n  He artfully interwove the complexity of the law with the practical \nresults of his decisions always taking cases at their face value. And, \nwhen the issue required it, Blane acted as a counterweight to some of \nthe most conservative judges in the country--judges who also would come \nto respect and admire him and, on certain cases that called for \nrighting serious wrongs, join him.\n  Blane Michael's death is a tremendous loss to our Nation, our State, \nand anyone whose life he touched. For me, his was the kind of deep, \neasy companionship that helps sustain you and remains with you always.\n  His contributions were immense, his dedication to justice and doing \nwhat is right was unmatched, and for that, he will be sorely missed. My \nprayers are\n\n[[Page S1973]]\n\nwith his wife Mary Anne and their daughter Cora; and my lasting \nthoughts are with my dearest and closely held friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S1973-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING WILLIE JONES\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nattention of the Senate today the noble service of a great American \nfrom the State of Alabama. It is with sadness that I speak about Willie \nJones, the director of the Cleveland Avenue YMCA, who passed away \nsuddenly last week in Montgomery, AL. Willie was 55 years of age.\n  Willie was a true leader in the Montgomery community. As a teenager, \nhe began working with the Cleveland Avenue YMCA as an aquatic \ninstructor. He worked his way up to senior vice-president of the \norganization in Montgomery. Make no mistake, the Montgomery YMCA is one \nof the greatest ``Y's'' in the country and has been for many years.\n  He served on the Montgomery Housing Authority Board of Directors and \nthe Montgomery County Recreation Commission. He was a man of deep \nreligious faith, being active with the Mount Zion African Methodist \nEpiscopal Zion Church. This faith, I believe, was the key factor in his \npositive outlook on life and his love for his fellow man.\n  Willie Jones loved people and they loved him. His constant motive was \nto help others and the primary vehicle for his life of service was the \n``Y.'' Few people were better known in Montgomery--from the poor young \nperson needing a chance to the city's top executives and political \nleaders. They all knew him, admired him, and loved him.\n  For more than 40 years, Willie devoted his life to public service, \nleaving a positive imprint on the lives of countless Alabama youths.\n  I know how valuable the programs he worked so hard for have been for \nthe young people of Montgomery. Time and time again, lives have been \ndirected on a course to success as a result of the personal \nrelationships and care demonstrated by Willie and his team.\n  It was a tremendous joy seeing Willie work with kids. He gave them \nopportunities at the YMCA, instilling in them a sense of hope and the \nknowledge that they could make a difference, both in their own lives \nand in the lives of others.\n  Willie was often quoted as saying ``This isn't about Willie Jones; \nit's about the kids at the YMCA.'' Indeed he was an inspiration.\n  I had the great privilege to know Willie personally. He visited my \noffice here in Washington many times over the years. I witnessed Willie \nin action--he was a man with a giant heart, and it showed on the \nexpressions of folks who would light up when he entered a room.\n  Willie touched the lives of so many, and he will be sorely missed. \nMary and I extend our deepest sympathies to his wife, the Jones family, \nand to the Montgomery community. He was too young to leave us. There \nwas more to do. But, his life was full and complete. He fulfilled his \nmission with purity and purpose, in accord with the will of his Lord. \nHis life honored his Maker. Would that we all could live so well. May \nhis life be an example for those of us who continue to serve in public \noffice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S1973-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING DON MARKWELL\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it is appropriate that we take a \nmoment to honor the man who was heard on the airwaves in Montgomery, \nAL, for decades. A friend and longtime radio host, Don Markwell, passed \naway last Friday. Don was born in Island, KY, and began his career in \nradio as a disc jockey for WNES AM in 1956. He and his family moved to \nMontgomery in the late 1950s. Don created Alabama's very first talk \nshow on WCOV in 1959.\n  In 1967, Don Markwell began the program he would later become famous \nfor, ``Viewpoint.'' Talk radio was a new concept in the 1960s, and Don \nhad the foresight to see its potential and popularity.\n  Some people criticize the talk show format and the hosts. But it is \nan open forum. People could call Don and disagree, but they better be \nprepared. Listeners knew the drill. They filter the honest and \ndishonest, the fair and unfair. Indeed, talk radio is the modern day \ntown hall.\n  I was delighted to be Don's guest on numerous occasions. He never had \na problem asking the tough questions--something I very much admired in \nhim and try to emulate. For some years, I took to calling him ``Dean \nDon,'' dubbing him the dean of talk show hosts. He was that indeed. No \none in Alabama and few, if any elsewhere, had such a record--he liked \nthat, I think.\n  When I first ran for office, attorney general of Alabama in 1994, Don \nwas aware of many problems associated with my incumbent opponent. He \nbrought those issues out, gave me and my record a chance to become \nknown by his Montgomery audience. Don offered my opponent a chance to \nappear, but he declined. Radio talk shows provide lesser known and \nlesser funded candidates a chance to be known by the public. I know my \ntalk show appearances, as a little known challenger, helped voters to \nknow about my position on the issues.\n  Don spent more than half a century working in the radio industry, 30 \nof those years hosting ``Viewpoint'' and never lacking in enthusiasm \nand controversy. He was fearless and principled.\n  His persona was libertarian. He was not happy with Republicans or \nDemocrats. His problem with Republicans was that he expected more of \nthem. He could spot a phony a mile--or 1,000 miles--away. Sometimes he \nspotted phonies that weren't phonies, but that was not often. June of \n2006, Don celebrated 50 years in broadcasting. In 2008, he retired from \nWACV-AM 1170 and said goodbye to the radio world. When Dan Morris took \nover Don Markwell's time slot on WACV, Dan kept the name ``Viewpoint'' \nand has continued Don's tradition of covering local and national issues \nduring drive time.\n  As anyone in Montgomery, AL, will tell you, Don is a legend and a \npioneer in talk radio. His accomplishments and outstanding service to \nboth the broadcasting industry and the public are surely worthy of \ncommendation. And what a voice--rich and deep--it was instantly \nrecognizable.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to Nell and the Markwell family in \ntheir time of grief. I, like many others, am grateful to have called \nDon a friend, and he will be dearly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S1973-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1973-S1974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING CHARLES F. JAMES\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President my home State of New \nMexico lost a great man on March 13, 2011.\n  Charlie F. James, a World War II veteran and survivor of the Bataan \nDeath March, passed away at the age of 89. He was the last survivor of \nthe Bataan Death March living in Eddy County and I would like to take a \nmoment to honor his memory.\n  Mr. James enlisted in the National Guard while still a young man in \nhigh school and was called to active duty service in January 1941, less \nthan a year after graduating and just 3 days after getting married.\n  In September, Mr. James and the rest of 2nd Battalion/F-Battery were \nshipped off to Manila in the Philippines. The Japanese attack on the \nPhilippines in December of 1941, mere hours after Pearl Harbor, led to \n4 months of intense combat with very little in the way of supplies. His \nunit only had one functioning 37mm anti-aircraft gun left when allied \ntroops at Bataan were ordered to surrender in April 1942.\n  While those 4 months of fighting were difficult for Mr. James and his \nfellow soldiers, the next 3\\1/2\\ years were even more horrific. Mr. \nJames survived the Bataan Death March to then face ghastly conditions \nin Japanese prisons, and forced labor in Japan.\n  Mr. James was liberated on September 2, 1945, and honorably \ndischarged. He was the recipient of many awards for his service, \nincluding a Purple Heart and Bronze Star. Mr. James became a member of \nnumerous veterans groups and he maintained close relationships with \nmany of his comrades, including many who were held as prisoners of war.\n  After being discharged, Mr. James returned to New Mexico and to the \ntwo loves in his life: his wife, Lucille, and ranching. Having grown up \nin Carlsbad, his passion for his cattle ran deep in his roots. Those \nwho knew Mr. James\n\n[[Page S1974]]\n\nhold many fond memories of him surrounded by his land and tending to \nhis cattle.\n  Let us honor this man who was the last of a generation, one of an \never dwindling number of men who gave up years of their youth to \nprotect our Nation, and thank Mr. James for his bravery, patriotism, \nand service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S1974-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S1974-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S1974-3", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:28 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 839.

Pueblo Day''; \n     to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                   House Joint Resolution No. 11-1005\n\n       Whereas, the U.S.S. Pueblo was originally launched as a \n     United States Army cargo ship in 1944 but was transferred to \n     the United States Navy and renamed the U.S.S. Pueblo in 1966; \n     and\n       Whereas, the U.S.S. Pueblo was named for the city of \n     Pueblo, Colorado, and the county of Pueblo, Colorado, and was \n     the third ship in the naval fleet to bear the name Pueblo; \n     and\n       Whereas, after leaving Japan in early January 1968 on an \n     intelligence mission, the U.S.S. Pueblo was attacked by the \n     North Korean military on January 23, 1968; and\n       Whereas, according to United States Naval authorities and \n     the crew of the U.S.S. Pueblo, the ship was in international \n     waters at the time of the attack; and\n       Whereas, one crew member of the U.S.S. Pueblo was killed \n     during the attack, and eighty crew members and two civilian \n     oceanographers were captured and held for eleven months by \n     the North Korean government; and\n       Whereas, this year marks the forty-third anniversary of \n     North Korea's attack on the U.S.S. Pueblo and her crew; and\n       Whereas, the U.S.S. Pueblo is still in commission in the \n     United States Navy, but continues to be held by the North \n     Korean government and is currently a museum in Pyongyang, \n     North Korea; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-\n     eighth General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein:\n       (1) That we, the members of the General Assembly, recognize \n     the bravery and sacrifice of the crew of the U.S.S.

Pueblo \n     bears the name of a city and a county in Colorado, and, \n     therefore, the citizens of Colorado should be aware of the \n     incident that occurred with the U.S.S. Pueblo forty-three \n     years ago; and\n       (3) That we hereby designate January 23 each year as \n     ``U.S.S. Pueblo Day'' as a day to remember and honor the \n     brave crew of the U.S.S. Pueblo; be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Resolution be sent to \n     President Barack Obama, Governor John W.

Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation of \ngreat importance to my state, the Native Hawaiian Government \nReorganization Act of 2011. This bill would ensure parity in federal \npolicy as it relates to the Native Hawaiian people. It would put them \non equal footing with American Indians and Alaska Natives. I have \nsponsored this common-sense legislation since the 106th Congress.\n  Last December, I spoke here on the Senate floor to reaffirm my \ncommitment to enact this legislation. I made it clear then to my \ncolleagues and my constituents that I would be reintroducing this \nlegislation in the 112th Congress. I am moving forward with the \nlegislation that was reported out of the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs in the 111th Congress.\n  Throughout my Senate career, I have been a member of the Committee on \nIndian Affairs. I have worked diligently with my colleagues on the \nCommittee to champion legislation to improve conditions for our Native \ncommunities across the United States. At the beginning of the 112th \nCongress, I became the Chairman of this Committee. I look forward to \nworking on the many pressing issues for American Indians, Alaska \nNatives, and Native Hawaiians. Reconciliation between the United States \nand the Native Hawaiian people will be a top priority.\n  In 1993, I sponsored a measure commonly known as the Apology \nResolution. This resolution was signed into law by President Bill \nClinton. It outlined the history--prior to--and following the overthrow \nof the Kingdom of Hawaii, including the involvement in the overthrow by \nagents of the United States. In the resolution, the United States \napologized for its involvement--and acknowledged the ramifications of \nthe overthrow. It committed to support reconciliation efforts between \nthe United States and the Native Hawaiian people.\n  However, additional Congressional action is needed.\n  My legislation allows us to take the necessary next step in the \nreconciliation process. The bill does three things. First, it \nauthorizes an office in the Department of the Interior to serve as a \nliaison between Native Hawaiians and the United States. Second, it \nforms an interagency task force chaired by the Departments of Justice \nand Interior, and composed of officials from federal agencies that \nadminister programs and services impacting Native Hawaiians. Third, it \nauthorizes a process for the reorganization of the Native Hawaiian \ngovernment for the purposes of a federally-recognized government-to-\ngovernment relationship. Once the Native Hawaiian government is \nrecognized, an inclusive democratic negotiations process representing \nboth Native Hawaiians and non-Native Hawaiians would be established. \nThere are many checks and balances in this process. Any agreements \nreached would still require the legislative approval of the State and \nFederal governments.\n  Opponents have spread misinformation about the bill. Let me be clear \non some things that this bill does not do. My bill will not allow for \ngaming. It does not allow for Hawaii to secede from the United States. \nIt does not allow for private land to be taken. It does not create a \nreservation in Hawaii.\n  What this bill does do is allow the people of Hawaii to come together \nand address issues arising from the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii \nmore than 118 years ago.\n\n[[Page S1979]]\n\n  It is time to move forward with this legislation. To date, there have \nbeen a total of 12 Congressional hearings, including 5 joint hearings \nin Hawaii held by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and the House \nNatural Resources Committee. Our colleagues in the House have passed \nversions of this bill three times. We, however, have never had the \nopportunity to openly debate this bill on its merits in the Senate. We \nhave a strong bill that is supported by Native communities across the \nUnited States, by the State of Hawaii, and by the Obama Administration.\n  Last week, I met with officials and community leaders in the state of \nHawaii to share my intention to reintroduce this legislation. I \nreceived widespread support. This support was not surprising. A poll \nconducted by the Honolulu Advertiser in May of last year reported that \n66 percent of the people of Hawaii support Federal recognition for \nNative Hawaiians. And 82 percent of Native Hawaiians polled support \nFederal recognition.\n  My efforts have the support of the National Congress of American \nIndians, the Alaska Federation of Natives, and groups throughout the \nNative Hawaiian community including the Association of Hawaiian Civic \nClubs, the Native Hawaiian Bar Association, the Council for Native \nHawaiian Advancement, and two state agencies which represent the \ninterests of the Native Hawaiian people, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs \nand the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands. I have also received support \nfrom national organizations such as the American Bar Association, and \nfrom President Obama, the Department of Justice, and the Department of \nInterior.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to stand with me and support this \nlegislation. I welcome any of my colleagues with concerns to speak with \nme so I can explain how important this bill is for the people of \nHawaii. The people of Hawaii have waited for far too long. America has \na history of righting past wrongs. The United States has federally \nrecognized government-to-government relationships with 565 tribes \nacross our country. It is time to extend this policy to the Native \nHawaiians.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 675\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native Hawaiian Government \n     Reorganization Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Constitution vests Congress with the authority to \n     address the conditions of the indigenous, native people of \n     the United States and the Supreme Court has held that under \n     the Indian Commerce, Treaty, Supremacy, and Property Clauses, \n     and the War Powers, Congress may exercise that power to \n     rationally promote the welfare of the native peoples of the \n     United States so long as the native people are a ``distinctly \n     native community'';\n       (2) Native Hawaiians, the native people of the Hawaiian \n     archipelago that is now part of the United States, are 1 of \n     the indigenous, native peoples of the United States, and the \n     Native Hawaiian people are a distinctly native community;\n       (3) the United States has a special political and legal \n     relationship with, and has long enacted legislation to \n     promote the welfare of, the native peoples of the United \n     States, including the Native Hawaiian people;\n       (4) under the authority of the Constitution, the United \n     States concluded a number of treaties with the Kingdom of \n     Hawaii, and from 1826 until 1893, the United States--\n       (A) recognized the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hawaii as \n     a nation;\n       (B) accorded full diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of \n     Hawaii; and\n       (C) entered into treaties and conventions of peace, \n     friendship and commerce with the Kingdom of Hawaii to govern \n     trade, commerce, and navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, \n     and 1887;\n       (5) pursuant to the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 \n     Stat. 108, chapter 42), the United States set aside \n     approximately 203,500 acres of land in trust to better \n     address the conditions of Native Hawaiians in the Federal \n     territory that later became the State of Hawaii and in \n     enacting the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920, Congress \n     acknowledged the Native Hawaiian people as a native people of \n     the United States, as evidenced by the Committee Report, \n     which notes that Congress relied on the Indian affairs power \n     and the War Powers, including the power to make peace;\n       (6) by setting aside 203,500 acres of land in trust for \n     Native Hawaiian homesteads and farms, the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920, assists the members of the Native \n     Hawaiian community in maintaining distinctly native \n     communities throughout the State of Hawaii;\n       (7) approximately 9,800 Native Hawaiian families reside on \n     the Hawaiian Home Lands, and approximately 25,000 Native \n     Hawaiians who are eligible to reside on the Hawaiian Home \n     Lands are on a waiting list to receive assignments of \n     Hawaiian Home Lands;\n       (8)(A) in 1959, as part of the compact with the United \n     States admitting Hawaii into the Union, Congress delegated \n     the authority and responsibility to administer the Hawaiian \n     Homes Commission Act, 1920, lands in trust for Native \n     Hawaiians and established a new public trust (commonly known \n     as the ``ceded lands trust''), for 5 purposes, 1 of which is \n     the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, and \n     Congress thereby reaffirmed its recognition of the Native \n     Hawaiians as a distinctly native community with a direct \n     lineal and historical succession to the aboriginal, \n     indigenous people of Hawaii;\n       (B) the public trust consists of lands, including submerged \n     lands, natural resources, and the revenues derived from the \n     lands; and\n       (C) the assets of this public trust have never been \n     completely inventoried or segregated;\n       (9) Native Hawaiians have continuously sought access to the \n     ceded lands in order to establish and maintain native \n     settlements and distinct native communities throughout the \n     State;\n       (10) the Hawaiian Home Lands and other ceded lands provide \n     important native land reserves and resources for the Native \n     Hawaiian community to maintain the practice of Native \n     Hawaiian culture, language, and traditions, and for the \n     continuity, survival, and economic self-sufficiency of the \n     Native Hawaiian people as a distinctly native political \n     community;\n       (11) Native Hawaiians continue to maintain other distinctly \n     native areas in Hawaii, including native lands that date back \n     to the ali`i and kuleana lands reserved under the Kingdom of \n     Hawaii;\n       (12) through the Sovereign Council of Hawaiian Homelands \n     Assembly, Native Hawaiian civic associations, charitable \n     trusts established by the Native Hawaiian ali`i, nonprofit \n     native service providers and other community associations, \n     the Native Hawaiian people have actively maintained native \n     traditions and customary usages throughout the Native \n     Hawaiian community and the Federal and State courts have \n     continuously recognized the right of the Native Hawaiian \n     people to engage in certain customary practices and usages on \n     public lands;\n       (13) on November 23, 1993, Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. \n     1510) (commonly known as the ``Apology Resolution'') was \n     enacted into law, extending an apology on behalf of the \n     United States to the native people of Hawaii for the United \n     States' role in the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (14) the Apology Resolution acknowledges that the overthrow \n     of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active \n     participation of agents and citizens of the United States, \n     and further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people \n     never directly relinquished to the United States their claims \n     to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national \n     lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a \n     plebiscite or referendum;\n       (15)(A) the Apology Resolution expresses the commitment of \n     Congress and the President--\n       (i) to acknowledge the ramifications of the overthrow of \n     the Kingdom of Hawaii; and\n       (ii) to support reconciliation efforts between the United \n     States and Native Hawaiians;\n       (B) Congress established the Office of Hawaiian Relations \n     within the Department of the Interior with 1 of its purposes \n     being to consult with Native Hawaiians on the reconciliation \n     process; and\n       (C) the United States has the duty to reconcile and \n     reaffirm its friendship with the Native Hawaiian people \n     because, among other things, the United States Minister and \n     United States naval forces participated in the overthrow of \n     the Kingdom of Hawaii;\n       (16)(A) despite the overthrow of the Government of the \n     Kingdom of Hawaii, Native Hawaiians have continued to \n     maintain their separate identity as a single distinctly \n     native political community through cultural, social, and \n     political institutions, and to give expression to their \n     rights as native people to self-determination, self-\n     governance, and economic self-sufficiency; and\n       (B) there is clear continuity between the aboriginal, \n     indigenous, native people of the Kingdom of Hawaii and their \n     successors, the Native Hawaiian people today;\n       (17) Native Hawaiians have also given expression to their \n     rights as native people to self-determination, self-\n     governance, and economic self-sufficiency--\n       (A) through the provision of governmental services to \n     Native Hawaiians, including the provision of--\n       (i) health care services;\n       (ii) educational programs;\n       (iii) employment and training programs;\n       (iv) economic development assistance programs;\n       (v) children's services;\n       (vi) conservation programs;\n       (vii) fish and wildlife protection;\n       (viii) agricultural programs;\n       (ix) native language immersion programs;\n\n[[Page S1980]]\n\n       (x) native language immersion schools from kindergarten \n     through high school;\n       (xi) college and master's degree programs in native \n     language immersion instruction; and\n       (xii) traditional justice programs; and\n       (B) by continuing their efforts to enhance Native Hawaiian \n     self-determination and local control;\n       (18) Native Hawaiian people are actively engaged in Native \n     Hawaiian cultural practices, traditional agricultural \n     methods, fishing and subsistence practices, maintenance of \n     cultural use areas and sacred sites, protection of burial \n     sites, and the exercise of their traditional rights to gather \n     medicinal plants and herbs, and food sources;\n       (19) the Native Hawaiian people wish to preserve, develop, \n     and transmit to future generations of Native Hawaiians their \n     lands and Native Hawaiian political and cultural identity in \n     accordance with their traditions, beliefs, customs and \n     practices, language, and social and political institutions, \n     to control and manage their own lands, including ceded lands, \n     and to achieve greater self-determination over their own \n     affairs;\n       (20) this Act provides a process within the framework of \n     Federal law for the Native Hawaiian people to exercise their \n     inherent rights as a distinct, indigenous, native community \n     to reorganize a single unified Native Hawaiian governing \n     entity for the purpose of giving expression to their rights \n     as a native people to self-determination and self-governance;\n       (21) Congress--\n       (A) has declared that the United States has a special \n     political and legal relationship for the welfare of the \n     native peoples of the United States, including Native \n     Hawaiians;\n       (B) has identified Native Hawaiians as an indigenous, \n     distinctly native people of the United States within the \n     scope of its authority under the Constitution, and has \n     enacted scores of statutes on their behalf; and\n       (C) has delegated broad authority to the State of Hawaii to \n     administer some of the United States' responsibilities as \n     they relate to the Native Hawaiian people and their lands;\n       (22) the United States has recognized and reaffirmed the \n     special political and legal relationship with the Native \n     Hawaiian people through the enactment of the Act entitled, \n     ``An Act to provide for the admission of the State of Hawaii \n     into the Union'', approved March 18, 1959 (Public Law 86-3; \n     73 Stat. 4), by--\n       (A) ceding to the State of Hawaii title to the public lands \n     formerly held by the United States, and mandating that those \n     lands be held as a public trust for 5 purposes, 1 of which is \n     for the betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians; and\n       (B) transferring the United States responsibility for the \n     administration of the Hawaiian Home Lands to the State of \n     Hawaii, but retaining the exclusive right of the United \n     States to consent to any actions affecting the lands included \n     in the trust and any amendments to the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108, chapter 42), that are \n     enacted by the legislature of the State of Hawaii affecting \n     the beneficiaries under the Act;\n       (23) the United States has continually recognized and \n     reaffirmed that--\n       (A) Native Hawaiians have a direct genealogical, cultural, \n     historic, and land-based connection to their forebears, the \n     aboriginal, indigenous, native people who exercised original \n     sovereignty over the Hawaiian Islands;\n       (B) Native Hawaiians have never relinquished their claims \n     to sovereignty or their sovereign lands;\n       (C) the United States extends services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their unique status as the native people of a \n     prior-sovereign nation with whom the United States has a \n     special political and legal relationship; and\n       (D) the special relationship of American Indians, Alaska \n     Natives, and Native Hawaiians to the United States arises out \n     of their status as aboriginal, indigenous, native people of \n     the United States;

A bill to amend the Act of June 18, 1934, to reaffirm the \nauthority of the Secretary of the Interior to take land into trust for \nIndian tribes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a technical \namendment to the Act of June 18, 1934, the Indian Reorganization Act.\n  Trust land is essential to a tribe's ability to exercise their \ninherent sovereignty. It allows Tribal Nations to protect their \nhistoric, cultural and religious ties to the lands where their \nancestors lived. Trust lands are also vital to tribal economic \ndevelopment and self-government as tribes provide a wide range of \ngovernmental services to their members including, running schools, \ncommunity centers, health clinics, law enforcement and numerous other \nsocial and governmental services.\n  Federal Indian policy regarding tribal lands has not always been \nfavorable to the Tribal governments and individuals. The General \nAllotment Act of 1887 led to land losses of more than 100 million acres \nof tribal homelands. Those land losses had a devastating effect on the \ntribal communities, institutions and economies that relied on their \nhomelands. Seeking to address the consequences of that ill-advised \npolicy, Congress enacted the Indian Reorganization Act in 1934.\n  This act was intended to reverse the prior federal policy of \nallotment. By passing the Indian Reorganization Act, Congress \nrecognized that a land base was essential for the economic advancement \nand self-support of Indian communities. The IRA allowed tribes to \nrestore their homelands and to rehabilitate their economies and \ncommunities. Restoration of land to tribal ownership was central to the \noverall purposes of the Indian Reorganization Act.\n  Unfortunately, a recent Supreme Court decision has brought \nuncertainty to 75 years interpretation regarding trust land acquisition \nunder the Indian Reorganization Act. On February 24, 2009, the Supreme \nCourt issued its decision in the Carcieri v. Salazar case. In that \ndecision the Supreme Court held that the Secretary of the Interior \nexceeded his authority in taking land into trust for a tribe that was \nnot under Federal jurisdiction at the time the Indian Reorganization \nAct was enacted in 1934. The Supreme Court decided that the act only \napplied to tribes who were ``under federal jurisdiction'' when it was \npassed in 1934.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is necessary to clarify the \ncontinuing authority of the Secretary of the Interior, under the Indian \nReorganization Act of 1934, to take land into trust for all Indian \ntribes that are federally recognized on the date the land is placed \ninto trust. The legislation also ratifies the prior trust acquisitions \nof the Secretary, who for the past 75 years has been exercising his \nauthority to take lands into trust, as intended by the Indian \nReorganization Act.\n  Inaction by Congress on the Carcieri decision will create two classes \nof tribes--those who are considered ``under federal jurisdiction'' and \ncan have lands taken into trust and those who cannot. Creating two \nclasses of tribes is unacceptable and runs counter to federal Indian \npolicy, the Indian Reorganization Act, and subsequent Congressional \nActs intended to ensure that all tribes are treated equally and have \nthe same sovereign rights. The decision will also significantly impact \nplanned development projects on Indian trust lands, such as housing, \nschools, community, and health centers, and result in a loss of jobs in \nan already challenging economic environment.\n  I want to thank Senators Conrad, Franken, Inouye, Johnson, Kerry, \nTester and Udall for their support on this critical legislation. My \ncosponsors are well aware of the negative impact this decision has \nalready had, and would continue to have on our Native American \ncommunities. Affected tribes deserve our timely consideration of this \nbill. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 676\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MODIFICATION OF DEFINITION.\n\n       (a) Modification.--\n       (1) In general.--The first sentence of section 19 of the \n     Act of June 18, 1934 (commonly known as the ``Indian \n     Reorganization Act'') (25 U.S.C. 479), is amended--\n       (A) by striking ``The term'' and inserting ``Effective \n     beginning on June 18, 1934, the term''; and\n       (B) by striking ``any recognized Indian tribe now under \n     Federal jurisdiction'' and inserting ``any federally \n     recognized Indian tribe''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendments made by paragraph (1) \n     shall take effect as if included in the Act of June 18, 1934 \n     (commonly known as the ``Indian Reorganization Act'') (25 \n     U.S.C. 479), on the date of enactment of that Act.\n       (b) Ratification and Confirmation of Prior Actions.--Any \n     action taken by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the \n     Act of June 18, 1934, (commonly known as the ``Indian \n     Reorganization Act'') (25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.) for any Indian \n     tribe that was federally recognized on the date of that \n     action is ratified and confirmed, to the extent that the \n     action is challenged based on the question of whether the \n     Indian tribe was federally recognized or under Federal \n     jurisdiction on June 18, 1934, as if the action had, by prior \n     act of Congress, been specifically authorized and directed.\n       (c) Effect on Other Laws.--\n       (1) In general.--Nothing in this Act or the amendments made \n     by this Act affects--\n       (A) the application or effect of any Federal law other than \n     the Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.) (as amended \n     by subsection (a)); or\n       (B) any limitation on the authority of the Secretary of the \n     Interior under any Federal law or regulation other than the \n     Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.) (as so amended).\n       (2) References in other laws.--An express reference to the \n     Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C. 461 et seq.) contained in any \n     other\n\n[[Page S1985]]\n\n     Federal law shall be considered to be a reference to that Act \n     as amended by subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Coons):\n  S. 678. A bill to increase the penalties for economic espionage; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the ability of American companies to out \ninnovate and better compete with their global competitors is more \nimportant today than ever. Yet, the FBI estimates that U.S. companies \nlose billions of dollars each year to criminals who steal their trade \nsecrets--their innovative ideas, formulas, designs and other \nproprietary information. For example, last year, a Chinese national \nworking for an American automobile manufacturer was convicted of \nstealing trade secrets for a Chinese competitor. His actions were \nestimated to cost the American company between $50 and $100 million.\n  That is why I rise today with Senators Whitehouse and Coons to \nintroduce the Economic Espionage Penalty Enhancement Act of 2011. This \nbill is simple and straightforward--it increases the maximum penalties \nfor stealing a trade secret to benefit a foreign company. The measures \nin this bill were recommended to Congress by the U.S. Intellectual \nProperty Enforcement Coordinator, in conjunction with the Departments \nof Commerce, Homeland Security, Justice and State, and the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative. The Economic Espionage Act Penalty Enhancement Act, \nwhile a modest bill, is intended to be a starting point for a larger \ndiscussion about the implementation of the Economic Espionage Act, EEA, \nand whether additional updates and improvements are needed in light of \nthe global economy and advances in technology.\n  In 1996, Congress enacted the EEA, making it a federal crime to steal \na trade secret. Nearly fifteen years later, trade secret theft and \neconomic espionage continue to pose a threat to U.S. companies to the \ntune of billions of dollars a year. As we reexamine the law, we will be \nlooking at how we can help prosecutors bring more of these criminals to \njustice and companies better protect their trade secrets. Among the \nissues we will look at are whether additional protections are needed \nfor trade secrets as part of EEA prosecutions, whether whistleblower \nprotections should be added, and whether we need a federal civil \nprivate right of action.\n  Businesses spend every resource at their disposal to develop \nproprietary economic information including their customer lists, \npricing schedules, business agreements, and manufacturing processes, to \nname a few. This information is literally a business's lifeblood. \nStealing it can be the death knell for a company. The chief executive \nof GM recently said that industrial espionage is a major threat to the \ncompany and that he worries about it ``every day.'' But these thefts \nhave a much greater impact beyond the American company that falls \nvictim to an economic spy. The economic strength, competitiveness, and \nsecurity of our country rely upon the ability of industry to compete \nwithout unfair interference from foreign governments and from their own \ndomestic competitors. Without freedom from economic sabotage, our \ncompanies lose their hard-earned advantages and their competitive edge.\n  This problem is not new, but it has grown and evolved in the fifteen \nyears since the Economic Espionage Act became law. U.S. corporations \nface intense competition at home and abroad. As much as 80 percent of \nthe assets of today's companies are intangible trade secrets. They must \nbe able to protect their trade secrets to remain competitive and keep \nour economy strong. Advances in technology make the protection of trade \nsecrets more difficult and more critical than ever. Trade secrets can \nsimply be downloaded from a company's computer, uploaded to the \nInternet, and transferred anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes. \nWithin a matter of days, a U.S. corporation can lose complete control \nover its trade secrets. Unfortunately, we have many examples of the \nrisk and harm posed by economic espionage. In 2009, a Chinese-born \nengineer who had been employed by a leading aerospace company was \nconvicted of economic espionage and sentenced to fifteen years in \nprison for collecting sensitive information about the U.S. space \nshuttle that he intended to share with the Chinese government. Prior to \nhis sentencing, the district court judge said that although we do not \nknow how much information he shared with China, we do know that he hurt \nnot only his former employer but also the national security of the \nUnited States.\n  Domestic economic espionage, known as industrial espionage, can be \njust as threatening to American companies. For example, just this month \na former computer programmer for a Wall Street bank was sentenced to \neight years in prison for stealing secret code used in the bank's \nvaluable high-frequency trading system. The trading system earned the \nbank $300 million in 2009 alone. He took a job at a startup company \nthat was planning to directly compete with the Wall Street bank, and \ngave that company the stolen code.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin a disgruntled employee of a company \nthat manufactures aftermarket airplane parts was prosecuted under the \neconomic espionage statute and sentenced to thirty months in prison for \nattempting to sell trade secrets to competitors. The trade secret--\ndetails and measurements of particular airplane parts--took years and \nhundreds of thousands of dollars for the manufacturer to create, test \nand gain Federal Aviation Administration approval. Fortunately, the \nperpetrator was caught before he sold the trade secrets, but had he \nbeen successful the manufacturer would likely have been forced out of \nbusiness.\n  The examples above illustrate the seriousness of these crimes. The \nlegislation that we introduce today will increase the maximum sentence \nfor economic espionage from 15 years to 20 years and to direct the \nSentencing Commission to consider increasing the penalty range for \ntheft of trade secrets and economic espionage. This is a first step in \nour efforts to do more to stem the flow of valuable business \ninformation out of our country. We must definitively punish anyone who \nsteals information from American companies. Over the coming months, \nthis measure will provide a framework for our discussions about how we \ncan do more to solve this problem. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on this critical problem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 678\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reduce the number of executive positions subject to \nSenate confirmation; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the Senator from New York and I are on \nthe Senate floor today to introduce\n\n[[Page S1986]]\n\nlegislation that will help make the Senate a more effective place to \ndeal with the big issues facing our country, such as the debt, our \nnational defense, and other issues.\n  This is the result of discussions we have had over the last several \nmonths with many Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle. It \nbegan with some reforms in Senate rules, which included eliminating the \nso-called secret hold and doing other steps. It is the culmination of \nwork by a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle--including \nSenator Lieberman; Senator Collins; the leaders, Senator Reid and \nSenator McConnell, when they were whips; Senator Schumer and I; and \nothers. We had bipartisan breakfasts on these reforms a couple years \nago, and it came down to the questions: How many confirmations should \nthe Senate have? How many confirmations are enough confirmations? Is it \nin the public interest to allow a new President, whether Democratic or \nRepublican, to staff the government promptly? And is it in the public \ninterest to get rid of this syndrome that is established in Washington, \nwhich I call ``innocent until nominated,'' where we invite a \ndistinguished person to come in and run that person through a gauntlet \nthat makes him or her out to be a criminal for making some mistake in \nthe process of being confirmed?\n  We have worked together, and we have come up with legislation that \nSenator Schumer is introducing on behalf of both of us--on behalf of \nthe leaders, Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, and on behalf of \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Collins.\n  This legislation would answer the question, how many confirmations \nare enough confirmations, by reducing or streamlining the nomination \nprocess for about 450 nominees--out of a total of about 1,400 \nnominations. Over 1,000 Senate confirmed nominations will remain \nunchanged. Just to put that into perspective, that is still more \nconfirmations than existed when President Clinton was President of the \nUnited States. It is almost four times as many confirmations as existed \nwhen President Kennedy was President of the United States. In other \nwords, like many things in government, the number of confirmations has \ngrown over time.\n  We have ended up confirming people we have no business confirming--\npeople who are public relations officers, people who are financial \ninformation people--and we have made it difficult for the government to \nbe staffed.\n  Is it in our interest, and the citizens', to staff the government \npromptly? Yes, I think it is. We have created this phenomenon where \nAdministrations are slow to get staffed up. For example, when President \nObama came in, Secretary Geithner, the Treasury Secretary, was sitting \nover at Treasury almost home alone during the middle of the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. According to news accounts, he \ndid not have much help. The key vacant positions in Treasury were \nAssistant Secretary for Tax Policy, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nTax Policy, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Analysis, Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for Tax, Trade, and Tariff Policy, and a variety of \nothers. That situation was not helping any of us. Whether we agreed \nwith President Obama or Secretary Geithner or not, after an election a \nPresident should be able to promptly staff the government, and we in \nthe Senate should have procedures to give us a chance to review those \nnominees and offer our advice and consent and confirm or reject those \nnominees in a reasonable period of time.\n  If we are spending our time dealing with junior officials or PR \nofficers, we are spending less time dealing with the Assistant \nSecretary for Tax Policy, on whom we should be focusing a lot of time, \nand to whom we should be asking a lot of questions.\n  Then, there is this business of what I call ``innocent until \nnominated''--all of us know this exists. It really exists by sloppiness \non our part, both in the legislative branch and the executive branch. \nIf you are asked to serve in the Federal Government--and I know this \nbecause I was asked by the first President Bush--you fill out forms. \nWell, there are many forms. There are many forms in the executive \nbranch. They have different definitions; for example, the definition of \n``income.'' If you were to carelessly fill out the same definition of \n``income'' on one form as another form, you might have been incorrect \non one of the forms, and then someone might say you were telling a lie \nand were not fit to serve. That has been called by others, including \nme, as being ``innocent until nominated.''\n  I remember when Ron Kirk, the former mayor of Dallas, was nominated \nby President Obama to be the Trade Representative. There was some issue \nabout whether he had properly reported a speech fee he gave to charity. \nWhat difference did it make in terms of his overall fitness to serve? \nIt held him up. It embarrassed him. It was not relevant to the inquiry.\n  So the legislation we have will do the following: It proposes \neliminating the need for Senate confirmation or streamlining over 450 \npositions. About 200 of these nominations will be eliminated as Senate \nconfirmations. These are the ones the Senate does not need to spend \ntime on. The other half will come directly to the desk. Then, unless an \nindividual Senator says: Send it on to committee to go through the \nregular order, it will be expedited. That still leaves us with 1,000 \nSenate confirmations that we can have--1,000 hostages we can take. That \nis more hostages than we could take under Bill Clinton. That is almost \nfour times as many hostages than the Senate could take under President \nKennedy. That ought to be plenty of hostages for any Senator to make \nhis or her point if that is what we seek to do.\n  Second, the legislation would set up a process whereby an executive \nbranch working group would review the various forms that nominees are \nexpected to fill out, and try to have a single smart form in the \nexecutive branch. The working group will consult with committees of \nCongress. It might make sense to see if we can do the same thing with \nour forms, and make it possible that we can get all the information we \nwant without unnecessarily subjecting nominees to harassment or \ntrickery just because they are not wise enough to fill out different \nforms with different definitions.\n  I think this is a substantial step forward. It may not sound like \nmuch to those watching the Senate, but let me just say that both of our \nleaders, Reid and McConnell, have said they tried this and could not \nget it done. Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins have tried, and they \ncould not get it done. I worked with Senator Lieberman 2 years ago and \nwe could not get it done.\n  What has happened this time is a result of the discussion we had \nearlier in the year about making the Senate a more effective place to \nwork--with the full support of the leaders, Reid and McConnell; with \nthe full support of Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins; and with the \ngood work of Senator Schumer. We have come up with a consensus piece of \nlegislation which has broad bipartisan support from both sides of the \naisle, including chairmen and ranking members of the committees you \nwould think might be the first ones to object. This legislation would \nstill leave the Senate with the prerogatives it ought to have in terms \nof reviewing Presidential nominees and separates out those who take our \ntime away from the more important things we ought to be doing.\n  I thank the Senator from New York for the way he has worked on this \nissue. He has been constructive and direct and helpful. I thank the \nleaders for their support. I hope the committees will rapidly consider \nthe legislation Senator Schumer is introducing on our behalf, and I \nhope it will show we can take another small step in making the Senate a \nmore effective place to work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na document entitled ``List of Presidential Appointments No Longer \nRequiring Senate Confirmation''--there are about 200 of those--and a \ndocument entitled ``Privileged Nominations.'' Those are the ones that \nwill be expedited, unless a single Senator decides he or she wants to \nhave this nominee sent to committee, and that is about another 240.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     List of Presidential Appointments No Longer Requiring Senate \n                              Confirmation\n\n       Agriculture (11): Assistant Secretary for Congressional \n     Relations, Department of Agriculture;

I thank the Presiding Officer, and I notice that the \nSenator from New York is also on the Senate floor. I thank him for his \nwork on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from \nTennessee. He has been a great partner in this effort. In fact, I would \nsay it was his impetus that brought us here. He had thought about this \nlong and hard and worked on it previously. As usual, it has been a \npleasure to work with Senator Alexander on the Rules Committee or \nanywhere else, and I thank him for spearheading this effort.\n  I also want to thank the two leaders, Senator Reid, of course, my \nfriend--and I am so proud to work under his leadership--and Senator \nMcConnell. I have to say this: Senator McConnell and I have our \ndifferences, but on all of these issues of moving the Senate forward he \nhas been operating in good faith, and his support of this legislation \nhas allowed us to get here.\n  Also, the committee chair, Senator Lieberman, as well as Ranking \nMember\n\n[[Page S1988]]\n\nCollins, have been equal partners in this legislation, and it will go \nthrough their committee.\n  Finally, I thank all the committee chairs. They have been very \nunderstanding of the need to do this. Obviously, committee chairs might \nsay: I want to have before my committee every single person, but \nultimately they have realized it slows down the Senate.\n  While we are introducing the legislation today, a number of committee \nchairs on our side--probably with the consent of their ranking \nmembers--have come to me and said there might be other positions they \nwant to add to the list. That would be a good idea. We have tried to be \ncareful. We do not want to step on any toes or prerogatives. In the \npast, when this legislation was attempted, people said: Well, just, I \ndon't want this one; I don't want that one. So we were fairly minimal. \nIt will have a real effect on the Senate. It is close to one-third of \nthe appointments. But there may be different committees that say: I \ndon't need to approve this. In my committee, the committee on which I \nam the chair, the committee on which I am the ranking member, we do not \nneed to approve these five or six more. Add them to your list.\n  We would hope our committee chairs would do that before the bill is \nconsidered because it will be considered by Senator Lieberman's \ncommittee, and there they could make such additions.\n  So let me say this about the process: One of the most important \nduties of the Senate is the constitutional advice-and-consent power. We \nwere careful to balance this interest with the importance of making the \nconfirmation process more efficient--not only for the benefit of the \nSenate but as well for the benefit of the administration, its agencies, \nand, as Senator Alexander so aptly pointed out, for those individuals \nwho are nominated as well.\n  The Senate was designed to be a thoughtful and deliberative body, but \nthe confirmation process has often become dangerously close to being \ngridlocked. The American public is harmed when we are not able to get \nqualified people confirmed to positions in a timely manner. All of the \npositions covered in this proposal tend to be noncontroversial and more \nclosely resemble appointments that are currently made without Senate \napproval.\n  This legislation consists of a stand-alone bill, the Presidential \nAppointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act, and a resolution. Senator \nAlexander touched on the stand-alone bill, which will eliminate from \nSenate confirmation over 200 executive nomination positions and nearly \n3,000 additional officer corps positions. The resolution will create a \nstanding order that will streamline approval of almost 250 part-time \nboard members.\n  We intend to move both of these pieces together in an effort to \nreform this process. Together, these two pieces will remove or \nstreamline, as I mentioned, nearly one-third of currently confirmable \nSenate appointments.\n  The act will remove the need for confirmation for several categories \nof positions, including legislative and public affairs positions, chief \nfinancial officers, information technology administrators, internal \nmanagement and administrative positions, and deputies or non-policy-\nrelated assistant secretaries who report to individuals who are Senate-\nconfirmed. Removing these positions from Senate confirmation will allow \na new administration to be set up with more efficiency and speed, thus \nmaking government work better for the people.\n  In addition, we have removed thousands of positions from the Public \nHealth Service officers corps and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration officer corps in the process. They are noncontroversial, \nand their removal will help prevent the possibility of further \ngridlock.\n  This act will also create a working group--because this is a work in \nprogress, and Senator Alexander has been working on it longer than I \nhave or most of us in this body--that will provide recommendations on \nthe process to further streamline the appointment and confirmation \nprocess. The group will make recommendations to the President and the \nSenate about streamlining the paperwork process for nominees by \ncreating a single, searchable, electronic ``smart form'' and will also \nconduct a review of the current background investigation requirements.\n  Senators Lieberman and Collins held a hearing on the confirmations \nprocess last month in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, which will have jurisdiction over this piece of the package. \nThe hearing was extremely helpful to our working group efforts and \nfurther highlighted the fact that our system of dealing with executive \nnominations needs reform.\n  The resolution piece of the package will create a streamlined process \nfor part-time positions on boards or commissions. A majority of these \nboards require political balance--a certain number of Democrats and a \ncertain number of Republicans. We are doing this rather than \neliminating Senate consideration in its entirety in order to ensure \nthat these politically balanced boards remain bipartisan. This was \nactually a recommendation, I believe, by Senator McConnell, and I think \nit is an apt one.\n  The resolution creates a standing order that will provide for an \nexpedited process for this class of ``privileged nominations'' by \ncreating new pages on the Executive Calendar. When the Senate receives \na nomination from the President, it will be placed on a new section on \nthe Executive Calendar called ``Privileged Nomination--Information \nRequested'' while the nominee submits paperwork to the committee of \njurisdiction. When the chair of that committee certifies that all \ncommittee questionnaires have been received from the nominee, the \nnomination will be placed on the ``Privileged Nomination--Information \nReceived'' section of the Executive Calendar.\n  As Senator Alexander mentioned, after 10 session days, the nomination \nis placed on the full Executive Calendar and will await action by the \nfull Senate, with the presumption that these positions will be passed \nby unanimous consent. So any single Senator can object, although we \ndoubt in almost every case that any will.\n  From the beginning of the process until the expiration of 10 session \ndays, any Member can request on his or her own behalf or on behalf of \nany identified Member that the nomination be referred to committee. We \nthink that incorporating this safeguard is in line with our elimination \nof secret holds earlier this year.\n  The presumption for these part-time positions is, as I said, that \nthey will be approved by unanimous consent and not be held up as part \nof other battles or leverage or whatever else.\n  This resolution would come before the Rules Committee, which Senator \nAlexander and I lead, and we hope to take action on it very soon. We \nare confident this package will eliminate many of the delays in the \ncurrent confirmation process. These delays are very detrimental to the \nefficient operation of government and to the efforts to recruit the \nmost qualified people to these Federal jobs.\n  The package we propose today is the first step in protecting the \nAmerican people's interests in having a newly elected President move \nquickly and efficiently to set up a government.\n  Before I yield the floor, I note that the Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Udall, in his impetus to reform the Senate, can claim some credit \nfor this move as well.\n  We are introducing this bipartisan legislation--Senator Alexander and \nmyself, along with Senators Reid, McConnell, Collins, Lieberman, and I \nthink about eight or nine other cosponsors as well--this afternoon.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation \noffered by Senators Schumer and Alexander to streamline the nomination \nprocess so incoming Presidents can get their teams in place more \nquickly and put them to work doing the people's business.\n  On August 5, 1789, the Senate took up and confirmed 102 executive \nnominations that had been sent up by President Washington just 2 days \nearlier--rejecting only one nominee.\n  Our first President, in a letter to the Senate, complained about the \none he didn't get. If the Senate ever doubted the fitness of one of his \nnominees it should--and I quote ``communicate that circumstance to me, \nand thereby avail yourselves of the information which led me to make \nthem and which I would with pleasure lay before you.''\n\n[[Page S1989]]\n\n  Modern Presidents of both parties would sigh over this bit of history \nbecause nowadays the process by which a person is selected, vetted, \nnominated, and then considered and confirmed by the Senate has become--\nin the words of one scholar--``nasty and brutish, without being \nshort.''\n  One hundred days into President Obama's administration, only 14 \npercent of the Senate-confirmed positions in his administration had \nbeen filled. After 18 months, 25 percent of these positions were still \nvacant. This is not an aberration or anomaly. The timetables for \nputting in place a leadership team across the government has been \npretty much the same each of the last three times there has been a \nchange of occupant in the White House.\n  We have known about this problem a long time, but failed to act.\n  In 2001, the then Governmental Affairs Committee under former \nChairman Fred Thompson, held hearings titled the State of the \nPresidential Appointment Process and recommended legislation, which did \nnot pass.\n  In 2003, a bipartisan commission headed by Paul Volker recommended \nways to speed up the nominations process. That got nowhere.\n  In 2004, the 9-11 Commission said the delays in getting a new \ngovernment up and running actually pose a threat to our national \nsecurity and in its report it also recommended ways to speed up the \nprocess.\n  Well after years of talk, it may be that we now finally have \nbipartisan support for change, although as the saying goes: ``It ain't \nover til it's over.''\n  In January, Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell \nestablished a working group on executive nominations and appointed \nSenators Schumer and Alexander--chairman and ranking member, \nrespectively, of the Rules Committee--to lead it.\n  Senator Collins and I--as chairman and ranking member of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee--have been part of this \nworking group and the bill being introduced today has my full support.\n  In fact, we held a hearing earlier this month on the need for \nnomination reform and the numbers showed just how compelling the case \nfor reform is.\n  A study by the Congressional Research Service says that delay occurs \nnot so much at the Cabinet level positions. Presidents Reagan, George \nW. Bush, Clinton, and Obama all were able to get the vast majority of \ntheir nominees for Cabinet Secretaries in place on or shortly after \nInauguration Day.\n  Where the delay is most pronounced, according to CRS, is in the sub-\ncabinet level positions. Under President Reagan, nominees averaged 114 \ndays from the President's election to final confirmation. Under \nClinton, George W. Bush, and Obama those numbers jumped to 185, 198, \nand 195 respectively.\n  Part of the problem is that the number of positions requiring \nconfirmation has grown over time.\n  When President Reagan took office, he had 295 key policy positions \nrequiring confirmation. By the time President Obama was inaugurated, \nthat number had grown to 422 key positions, plus another nearly 800 \nlesser positions that also required Senate confirmation.\n  These numbers do not include foreign service officers, or public \nhealth officials who also require Senate confirmation.\n  The legislation Senators Schumer and Alexander are introducing \nrecommends eliminating Senate confirmation for approximately 200 \npresidential appointments to positions in the Executive Branch, \nincluding for legislative and public affairs positions, chief \ninformation officers, and internal management positions at or below the \nAssistant Secretary level.\n  This will free the Senate to concentrate on the more important \npolicy-making nominees.\n  The bill also calls for a working group to simplify, standardize and \ncentralize the forms and documentation required by both the White House \nand Senate so a nominee isn't burdened with duplicative paperwork and \ninformation requests.\n  Senators Schumer and Alexander are also introducing a standing order \nthis morning that would streamline the confirmation process for \napproximately 200 other Presidential appointments that receive Senate \nconfirmation. Under the standing order, some nominees to part-time \nboards and commissions could have their nominations expedited by being \nheld at the desk for a certain number of days and then placed directly \nonto the Executive Calendar rather than being referred to a Senate \ncommittee. I would also like to express my support for the standing \norder.\n  In the past, nominations reform legislation has stalled because of \nthe perceived fears of some of our colleagues, particularly committee \nchairs and ranking members, that they would be giving up some of their \njurisdiction and authority. But the simple truth is that some of these \nnominations shouldn't require Senate confirmation and, frankly, take up \nvaluable time that should be used for more important work.\n  Nothing in the legislation we offer today will weaken in any way the \nSenate's important Constitutional role of ``advice and consent'' or our \ndelicate system of checks and balances.\n  But if we don't fix what is broken in this system, I fear we risk \ndiscouraging some of our nation's most talented individuals from \naccepting nominations, thus leaving important positions unfilled.\n  If I may end with a little history, as Governeur Morris, one of the \narchitects of the Constitution, said when speaking in favor of the \n``advice and consent'' clause: ``As the President was to nominate, \nthere would be responsibility. As the Senate was to concur, there would \nbe security.''\n  Those founding principals will be unaffected by the kinds of modest \nchanges this bill calls for, and I believe and hope we can get it done \nthis year.\n  I call on my fellow chairmen, ranking members, and colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to work with us on addressing this challenge so the \nnext new administration, regardless of party, can recruit the best \ncandidates and then put them to work quickly addressing the many \nchallenges our Nation faces.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Presidential \nAppointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act of 2011, as well as the \nSenate resolution to create an expedited confirmation process for some \npart-time boards and commissions.\n  I want to commend Senators Schumer and Alexander for their work on \nthis issue and to express my appreciation for all the members of the \nnomination reform working group--Senators Reid, McConnell, and \nLieberman. I was pleased to be a part of what has truly been a \nbipartisan effort.\n  The Constitution, in the Appointments Clause, makes the appointment \nof senior Federal executive officers a joint responsibility of the \nPresident and the Senate. The President determines who, in his view, is \nthe best qualified to serve in the most senior and critical positions \nacross the executive branch of our Government. It also requires that \nwe, the Senate, exercise our independent judgment and experience to \ndetermine if nominees have the necessary qualifications and character \nto serve our Nation in these important positions of public trust.\n  The confirmation process must be thorough enough for the Senate to \nfulfill its Constitutional duty, but it should not be so onerous as to \ndeter qualified people from public service.\n  National security reasons also compel attention to this problem. The \nNational Journal has noted that ``[p]eriods of political transition \nare, by their very nature, chaotic'' and that ``terrorists strike when \nthey believe governments will be caught off guard.''\n  Both the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and the attacks on \nSeptember 11th, 2001, occurred within eight months of a change in \npresidential administrations. And in March 2004, just three days before \nSpain's national elections, al Qaeda-linked terrorists bombed Madrid \ncommuter trains.\n  The 9/11 Commission found that ``[a]t the sub-cabinet level, there \nwere significant delays in the confirmation of key officials, \nparticularly at the Department of Defense,'' in 2001. It was not until \nsix months after President Bush took office that he had his national \nsecurity team in place.\n  Countless studies have been written and many experts have opined on \nhow to improve the nomination and confirmation process--from the \nBrownlow Commission in 1937 to the 9/11 Commission in 2004.\n\n[[Page S1990]]\n\n  This is also an issue that the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs has been working to address for a long time. For \nexample, in 2001, when Senator Fred Thompson chaired the Committee, we \nheld two hearings focusing on the state of the Presidential appointment \nprocess. As a result of these hearings, the Committee reported out \nlegislation to address concerns that were raised. A few of the \nprovisions of this bill would later be included in the Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.\n  But more work remains to be done. On March 2nd of this year, the \nCommittee held another hearing to review the nomination process. The \nwitnesses echoed the concerns that have been raised over the years by \nthe many commissions and that still remain unaddressed.\n  Based upon our review, there are a few areas in particular where \nimprovements should be made. The first is to reduce the sheer number of \npositions subject to Senate confirmation.\n  In this regard, the National Commission on the Public Service, \ncommonly known as the Volcker Commission, gathered some very \nilluminating statistics. When President Kennedy came to office, he had \n286 positions to fill with the titles of Secretary, Deputy Secretary, \nUnder Secretary, Assistant Secretary, and Administrator. By the end of \nthe Clinton Administration, there were 914 positions with these titles.\n  Today, according to the Congressional Research Service, CRS, there \nare more than 1,200 positions appointed by the President that require \nthe advice and consent of the Senate.\n  The large number of positions requiring confirmation leads to long \ndelays in selecting, vetting, and nominating these appointees. \nConsequently, administrations can go for months without key officials \nin many agencies. And when political appointees are finally in place, \ntheir median tenure is only about two and a half years.\n  A second area ripe for reform is to develop a consistent, common form \nfor the nominees to complete in order to streamline the process, save \ntime, and increase accuracy. This also would reduce the cost and burden \non nominees.\n  The White House, Office of Government Ethics, and the Senate need to \nwork together to reconcile the various questions that are asked of \nnominees. Currently, nominees will often find themselves repeating \nvariations of, or even the exact same, response over and over.\n  In this regard, I believe Clay Johnson, the former head of \nPresidential Personnel from 2001 to 2003, made an excellent point. He \nnoted that there is a thick file in the White House ``with every \npossible piece of relevant information on that person and yet none of \nthat is made available to the Senate.''\n  A consistent, common form, which a nominee can respond to online, \nwould help to facilitate the flow of information so the Senate can \nbegin its review of the nomination earlier.\n  Finally, the executive branch also needs to review its own role and \nresponsibilities in the process.\n  Specifically, the White House should review its background \ninvestigation requirements. The extent of the investigation should be \ntailored to the position. A person nominated to a non-national \nsecurity-related position should not have to undergo the same detailed \nFBI background investigation as a nominee to a national security-\nrelated position, such as the Secretary of Homeland Security. In \naddition, the process should make some allowance for people who already \nhave undergone the FBI full-field investigation for a different Senate-\nconfirmed position. Reform of this process would help speed up the \nreview of nominees and aid in the task of recruiting talented people \nfor public service.\n  It also is the White House's responsibility to ensure that the Office \nof Presidential Personnel has the appropriate staffing level to meet \nthe demands of a new administration.\n  As Mr. Johnson noted at our March 2nd hearing, ``[a] new \nadministration has never had the capacity in the first six months to \nnominate persons for more than 250 cabinet and subcabinet positions, \nlet alone 400 positions, which government reform individuals and groups \nsuggest a new administration should be able to do.''\n  If these areas can be reformed, substantial time will be saved, and \nkey leadership posts at our federal agencies will not be vacant for \nnearly as long.\n  Now, during this mid-term period, two years away from a Presidential \nelection, we have the opportunity to streamline the executive branch \nnominations process. This can help ensure that the next presidential \ntransition will be as smooth as possible, thwarting the terrorists' \nbelief that they will be able to ``catch us off guard.''\n  The Schumer-Alexander bill and Senate Resolution go a long way to \naddressing the concerns that I have highlighted.\n  The bill will make more than 200 positions direct Presidential \nAppointments that would no longer require Senate confirmation. Many of \nthese positions have little or no policy role, such as the Assistant \nSecretary for Legislative Affairs at the Department of Commerce, or are \ninternal management or administrative positions, such as chief \nfinancial officers or assistant secretaries for public affairs.\n  By not requiring Senate confirmation, it will allow these positions \nbe filled at a much faster pace and free up Senate resources to focus \non more significant nominees.\n  The Senate resolution proposes that more than 240 positions on part-\ntime boards or commissions go through a new ``expedited'' confirmation \nprocess. These positions will still require the nominee to respond to \nall committee questionnaires and still provide for the opportunity for \ncloser scrutiny of the nominee, if warranted.\n  This retains the authority of the Senate over these positions, but \nstreamlines the process, lessening the burden on the Senate for \nroutine, non-controversial nominations and providing for a faster road \nto confirmation as well.\n  While we must deliver on our duty to provide advice and consent, \nreforms are needed to improve the effective operation of government. We \nall want the most qualified people to serve the President and the \nNation. We should, therefore, ensure that the process is not \nunnecessarily burdensome and that key leadership posts do not go \nunfilled for long stretches of time. Most of all, we need to reform the \nprocess so that good people, whose talents and energy we need, do not \nbecome so discouraged that they give up their goal of serving the \npublic.\n  I am pleased to join Senators Schumer and Alexander as a cosponsor of \nthis legislation and the Senate resolution, both of which will help us \nattract well-qualified people to public service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Stabenow, \n        Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Shaheen, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Begich, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, and Ms. Ayotte).\n  S. 680. A bill to authorize the Administrator of General Services to \nconvey a parcel of real property in the District of Columbia to provide \nfor the establishment of a National Women's History Museum; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the National Women's \nHistory Museum Act of 2011, a bill that would clear the way to locate a \nlong-overdue historical and educational resource in our nation's \ncapital city. I appreciate the co-sponsorship today from 16 of my \ncolleagues: Senators Mikulski, Boxer, Hutchison, Murray, Snowe, \nLandrieu, Stabenow, Cantwell, Murkowski, Shaheen, Gillibrand, \nLieberman, Akaka, Pryor, Merkley, and Begich.\n  American women have made invaluable contributions to our country in \nsuch diverse fields as government, business, medicine, law, literature, \nsports, entertainment, the arts, and the military. A museum recognizing \nthe contributions of American women is long overdue.\n  A Presidential commission on commemorating women in American history \nconcluded that, ``Efforts to implement an appropriate celebration of \nwomen's history in the next millennium should include the designation \nof a focal point for women's history in our Nation's capital.''\n\n[[Page S1991]]\n\n  That report was issued in 1999. Over a decade later, although \nCongress has made commendable provisions for the National Museum for \nAfrican American History and Culture, the National Law Enforcement \nMuseum, and the National Museum of the American Indian, there is still \nno institution in the capital region dedicated to women's roles in our \ncountry's history.\n  It is important to note that taxpayers will not shoulder the funding \nof this project. The proposed legislation calls for no new federal \nprogram and no new claims on the budget. The bill would simply direct \nthe General Services Administration to negotiate and enter into an \noccupancy agreement with the National Women's History Museum, Inc. to \nestablish a museum on a tract of land near the Smithsonian Museums \nlocated at 12th Street, SW., and Independence Avenue, SW.\n  In fact, the Museum would be putting dollars in the federal \ngovernment's pocket in order to occupy this space because the \ntransaction would be at a fair-market value for the land. This bill \nwould be a win-win for the taxpayers and the Museum.\n  The National Women's History Museum is a non-profit, non-partisan, \neducational institution based in the District of Columbia. Its mission \nis to research and present the historic contributions that women have \nmade to all aspects of human endeavor, and to present the contributions \nthat women have made to the nation in their various roles in family, \nthe economy, and society.\n  This museum would help ensure that future generations understand what \nwe owe to the many generations of American women who have helped build, \nsustain, and advance our society. They deserve a building to present \nthe stories of pioneering women like abolitionist Harriet Tubman, \nfounder of the Girl Scouts Juliette Gordon Low, Supreme Court Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor, and astronaut Sally Ride.\n  That women's roll of honor would also include a legendary predecessor \nin the Senate seat I now hold: the late Senator Margaret Chase Smith, \nthe first woman nominated for President of the United States by a major \npolitical party, and the first woman elected to both houses of \nCongress. Senator Smith began representing Maine in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in 1940, won election to the Senate in 1948, and \nenjoyed bipartisan respect over her long career for her independence, \nintegrity, wisdom, and courage. She remains my role model and, through \nthe example of her public service, an exemplar of the virtues that \nwould be honored in the National Women's History Museum.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their past support of this effort, \nand urge them to renew that support for this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 681.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 681\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to improve hurricane preparedness by establishing the \nNational Hurricane Research Initiative, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation on a subject that is never far from the minds of citizens \nin my home State of Florida, folks along the Gulf Coast, or on the \nAtlantic seaboard: the threat of hurricanes, and the devastation that \nthese storms leave in their wake. This threat is ever nearer as we \napproach the 2011 hurricane season.\n  Hurricane damage is certainly not new to Florida. On September 1926, \nthe Great Miami Hurricane was a harbinger of things to come. Two years \nlater, a category four hurricane caused Lake Okeechobee to flood its \nbanks killing 2500 out of South Florida's 50,000 residents. In August \n1992, Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida causing an estimated $26 \nbillion in damage to the United States. And we all when in August of \n2005, Hurricane Katrina ripped through New Orleans and the Gulf Coast \nregion, causing more than $91 billion in economic losses, forcing more \nthan 770,000 people from their homes, and killing an estimated 1833 \npeople.\n  According to the Insurance Information Institute, insurance companies \nhad estimated losses of $40.6 billion on 1.7 million claims in 6 States \nfrom Hurricane Katrina, the largest loss in the history of insurance. \nInsured losses are predicted to double every decade as development \nalong the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts increases.\n  The sheer magnitude of this loss is staggering and underscores the \nneed for increased funding for hurricane research and improved \nforecasting. But hurricanes do not just affect those living along the \ncoasts. These extreme events have national consequences with increased \nfuel prices and severe inland flooding.\n  U.S. Census data indicates that more than 35 million people live in \nareas that are most vulnerable to hurricanes. Emergency managers need \nto know exactly where a hurricane will strike and how hard it will \nstrike before they can issue an evacuation warning.\n  Improvements in track and intensity forecasts will translate into \nbetter preparedness for coastal and inland communities, saving lives \nand reducing devastating impacts.\n  The impacts felt in the wake of Hurricane Katrina--despite a good \nmeteorological forecast of the hurricane--emphasize the need for \nadditional research and development in these areas.\n  I am committed to the protection of life and property. Hurricanes \npose a serious threat to the Nation, and losses are growing. So today I \nam introducing the National Hurricane Research Initiative. This bill \ncalls for prudent investments that will protect lives and prevent \neconomic devastation, reducing our vulnerability to hurricanes.\n  The National Hurricane Research Initiative will dramatically expand \nthe scope of fundamental research on hurricanes, including enhanced \ndata collection and analysis in critical research areas, and the \ntranslation of research results into improved forecasts and planning. \nSpecifically, the National Hurricane Research Initiative will improve \nour understanding and prediction of hurricanes and other tropical \ncyclones, including, storm tracking and prediction, storm surge \nmodeling, and inland flood modeling. This research will expand our \nunderstanding of the impacts of hurricanes on and response of society \nand help us to develop infrastructure that is resilient to the forces \nassociated with hurricanes.\n  We never know when the next big storm will hit. This type of research \nis urgently needed, and that research needs to be well coordinated. I \nlook forward to working with Chairman Rockefeller and the members of \nthe Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 692\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 117\n\n       Whereas social work is a profession of hope, grounded in \n     practical problem-solving expertise;\n       Whereas social workers are positive change agents who \n     dedicate their careers to helping people transform their \n     lives and improving environments to make that transformation \n     possible;\n       Whereas more than 640,000 trained social work professionals \n     in the United States work tirelessly to provide resources and \n     guidance that support social functioning in agencies, \n     hospitals, hospices, schools, universities, legislatures, \n     private practices, corporations, and the military;\n       Whereas social workers have education and experience to \n     guide individuals, families, and communities through complex \n     issues and choices;\n       Whereas social workers stand up for others to make sure \n     that everyone has access to the\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\n     same basic rights, protections, and opportunities;\n       Whereas social workers have been an important force behind \n     several significant social movements in the United States;\n       Whereas social workers are on the frontlines, responding to \n     such human needs as homelessness, poverty, family breakups, \n     mental illness, physical and mental disability, substance \n     abuse, domestic violence, and many other issues;\n       Whereas Professional Social Work Month and World Social \n     Work Day, which is March 15, 2011, build awareness of the \n     role that professional social workers play in the community \n     and the wide range of contributions social workers make \n     throughout their careers; and\n       Whereas the 2011 Professional Social Work Month theme, \n     ``Social Workers Change Futures'', showcases the expertise \n     and dedication of professional social workers in helping to \n     improve lives: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of Professional Social \n     Work Month and World Social Work Day;\n       (2) acknowledges the diligent efforts of individuals and \n     groups who promote the importance of social work and observe \n     Professional Social Work Month and World Social Work Day;\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to engage in \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities to promote further \n     awareness of the life-changing role which social workers \n     play; and\n       (4) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the \n     millions of caring individuals who have chosen to serve their \n     communities through social work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S1995-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 118--DESIGNATING APRIL 2011 AS ``NATIONAL 9-1-1 \n                           EDUCATION MONTH''\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself and Mr. Burr) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 118\n\n       Whereas 9-1-1 is nationally recognized as the number to \n     call in an emergency to receive immediate help from police, \n     fire, emergency medical services, or other appropriate \n     emergency response entities;\n       Whereas in 1967, the President's Commission on Law \n     Enforcement and Administration of Justice recommended that \n     ``a single number should be established'' nationwide for \n     reporting emergency situations, and other Federal Government \n     agencies and various governmental officials also supported \n     and encouraged the recommendation;\n       Whereas in 1968 the American Telephone and Telegraph \n     Company (AT) announced that it would establish the digits \n     9-1-1 as the emergency code throughout the United States;\n       Whereas 9-1-1 was designated by Congress as the national \n     emergency call number under the Wireless Communications and \n     Public Safety Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-81);\n       Whereas section 102 of the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 (47 \n     U.S.C. 942 note) declared an enhanced 9-1-1 system to be ``a \n     high national priority'' and part of ``our Nation's homeland \n     security and public safety'';\n       Whereas it is important that policy makers at all levels of \n     government understand the importance of 9-1-1, how the system \n     works today, and the steps that are needed to modernize the \n     9-1-1 system;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is the connection between the \n     public and the emergency response system in the United States \n     and is often the first place emergencies of all magnitudes \n     are reported, making 9-1-1 a significant homeland security \n     asset;\n       Whereas more than 6,000 9-1-1 public safety answering \n     points serve more than 3,000 counties and parishes throughout \n     the United States;\n       Whereas dispatchers at public safety answering points \n     answer more than 200,000,000 9-1-1 calls each year in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas a growing number of 9-1-1 calls are made using \n     wireless and Internet Protocol-based communications services;\n       Whereas a growing segment of the population, including the \n     deaf, hard of hearing, deaf-blind, and individuals with \n     speech disabilities are increasingly communicating with \n     nontraditional text, video, and instant messaging \n     communications services and expect those services to be able \n     to connect directly to 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the growth and variety of means of communication, \n     including mobile and Internet Protocol-based systems, impose \n     challenges for accessing 9-1-1 and implementing an enhanced \n     9-1-1 system and require increased education and awareness \n     about the capabilities of different means of communication;\n       Whereas the ability to communicate through voice, text, \n     data, and video conferencing provides an opportunity for the \n     Nation's 9-1-1 system to adopt next generation applications \n     and services, greatly enhancing the capabilities of 9-1-1 \n     services;\n       Whereas numerous other ``N-1-1'' and 800 number services \n     exist for non-emergency situations, including 2-1-1, 3-1-1, \n     5-1-1, 7-1-1, 8-1-1, poison control centers, and mental \n     health hotlines, and the public needs to be educated about \n     when to use such services in addition to, or instead of, 9-1-\n     1;\n       Whereas international visitors and immigrants make up an \n     increasing percentage of the population of the United States \n     each year, and visitors and immigrants may have limited \n     knowledge of our emergency calling system;\n       Whereas people of all ages use 9-1-1 and it is critical to \n     educate people on the proper use of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas senior citizens are at high risk for needing to \n     call 9-1-1 and many senior citizens are learning to use new \n     technology;\n       Whereas thousands of 9-1-1 calls are made each year by \n     children who are properly trained in the use of 9-1-1, which \n     saves lives and underscores the critical importance of \n     training children about 9-1-1 early in life;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is often misused, such as through \n     the placement of prank and non-emergency calls;\n       Whereas misuse of the 9-1-1 system results in costly and \n     inefficient use of 9-1-1 and emergency response resources, \n     and such misuse needs to be reduced;\n       Whereas parents, teachers, and caregivers must be educated \n     about 9-1-1 in order to play an active role in 9-1-1 \n     education for children;\n       Whereas there are many avenues for 9-1-1 public education, \n     including safety fairs, school presentations, libraries, \n     churches, businesses, public safety answering point tours or \n     open houses, civic organizations, and senior citizen centers;\n       Whereas parents, teachers, and the National Parent Teacher \n     Association contribute significantly to the goal of educating \n     children about the importance of 9-1-1 through targeted \n     outreach efforts to public and private schools;\n       Whereas the United States should strive to host at least 1 \n     annual educational event regarding the proper use of 9-1-1 in \n     every school in the Nation;\n       Whereas the people of the United States deserve the best \n     education regarding the use of 9-1-1; and\n       Whereas programs to promote proper use of 9-1-1 during \n     ``National 9-1-1 Education Month'' may include--\n       (1) public awareness events, such as conferences and media \n     outreach;\n       (2) training activities for businesses, parents, teachers, \n     school administrators, and other caregivers;\n       (3) educational events in schools and other appropriate \n     venues; and\n       (4) production and distribution of information about the 9-\n     1-1 system, designed to educate people of all ages on the \n     importance and proper use of 9-1-1: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2011 as ``National 9-1-1 Education \n     Month''; and\n       (2) urges Government officials, parents, teachers, school \n     administrators, caregivers, businesses, nonprofit \n     organizations, and the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National 9-1-1 Education Month'' with appropriate \n     ceremonies, training events, and activities.\n\n

Res. 112\n\n       Whereas the Pennsylvania State IFC/Panhellenic Dance \n     Marathon (referred to in this preamble as ``THON'') is the \n     largest student-run philanthropy in the world, with 700 \n     dancers, more than 300 supporting organizations, and more \n     than 15,000 volunteers involved in the annual event;\n       Whereas student volunteers at the Pennsylvania State \n     University annually collect money and dance for 46 hours \n     straight at the Bryce Jordan Center for THON, bringing energy \n     and excitement to campus for a mission to conquer cancer and \n     awareness about the disease to thousands of individuals;\n       Whereas all THON activities support the mission of the Four \n     Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital, \n     which provides financial and emotional support to pediatric \n     cancer patients and their families and funds cancer research;\n       Whereas each year, THON is the single largest donor to the \n     Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State Hershey Children's Hospital, \n     having raised more than $69,000,000 since 1977, when the 2 \n     organizations first became affiliated;\n       Whereas in 2011, THON set a new fundraising record of \n     $9,563,016.09, besting the previous record of $7,838,054.36, \n     which was set in 2010;\n       Whereas THON has helped more than 2,000 families through \n     the Four Diamonds Fund, is currently helping to build a new \n     Pediatric Cancer Pavilion at Penn State Hershey Children's \n     Hospital, and has helped support pediatric cancer research \n     that has caused some pediatric cancer survival rates to \n     increase to nearly 90 percent; and\n       Whereas THON has inspired similar events and organizations \n     across the United States, including at high schools and \n     institutions of higher education, and continues to encourage \n     students across the United States to volunteer and stay \n     involved in great charitable causes in their community: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the Pennsylvania State University IFC/\n     Panhellenic Dance Marathon (``THON'') on its continued \n     success in support of the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State \n     Hershey Children's Hospital; and\n       (2) commends the Pennsylvania State University students, \n     volunteers, and supporting organizations for their hard work \n     putting together another recordbreaking THON.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/30/senate-section/article/S2000-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL 9-1-1 EDUCATION MONTH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 118.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements relating to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 118) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 118\n\n       Whereas 9-1-1 is nationally recognized as the number to \n     call in an emergency to receive immediate help from police, \n     fire, emergency medical services, or other appropriate \n     emergency response entities;\n       Whereas in 1967, the President's Commission on Law \n     Enforcement and Administration of Justice recommended that \n     ``a single number should be established'' nationwide for \n     reporting emergency situations, and other Federal Government \n     agencies and various governmental officials also supported \n     and encouraged the recommendation;\n       Whereas in 1968 the American Telephone and Telegraph \n     Company (AT) announced that it would establish the digits \n     9-1-1 as the emergency code throughout the United States;\n       Whereas 9-1-1 was designated by Congress as the national \n     emergency call number under the Wireless Communications and \n     Public Safety Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-81);\n       Whereas section 102 of the ENHANCE 911 Act of 2004 (47 \n     U.S.C. 942 note) declared an enhanced 9-1-1 system to be ``a \n     high national priority'' and part of ``our Nation's homeland \n     security and public safety'';\n       Whereas it is important that policy makers at all levels of \n     government understand the importance of 9-1-1, how the system \n     works today, and the steps that are needed to modernize the \n     9-1-1 system;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is the connection between the \n     public and the emergency response system in the United States \n     and is often the first place emergencies of all magnitudes \n     are reported, making 9-1-1 a significant homeland security \n     asset;\n       Whereas more than 6,000 9-1-1 public safety answering \n     points serve more than 3,000 counties and parishes throughout \n     the United States;\n       Whereas dispatchers at public safety answering points \n     answer more than 200,000,000 9-1-1 calls each year in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas a growing number of 9-1-1 calls are made using \n     wireless and Internet Protocol-based communications services;\n       Whereas a growing segment of the population, including the \n     deaf, hard of hearing, deaf-blind, and individuals with \n     speech disabilities are increasingly communicating with \n     nontraditional text, video, and instant messaging \n     communications services and expect those services to be able \n     to connect directly to 9-1-1;\n       Whereas the growth and variety of means of communication, \n     including mobile and Internet Protocol-based systems, impose \n     challenges for accessing 9-1-1 and implementing an enhanced \n     9-1-1 system and require increased education and awareness \n     about the capabilities of different means of communication;\n       Whereas the ability to communicate through voice, text, \n     data, and video conferencing provides an opportunity for the \n     Nation's 9-1-1 system to adopt next generation applications \n     and services, greatly enhancing the capabilities of 9-1-1 \n     services;\n       Whereas numerous other ``N-1-1'' and 800 number services \n     exist for non-emergency situations, including 2-1-1, 3-1-1, \n     5-1-1, 7-1-1, 8-1-1, poison control centers, and mental \n     health hotlines, and the public needs to be educated about \n     when to use such services in addition to, or instead of, 9-1-\n     1;\n       Whereas international visitors and immigrants make up an \n     increasing percentage of the population of the United States \n     each year, and visitors and immigrants may have limited \n     knowledge of our emergency calling system;\n       Whereas people of all ages use 9-1-1 and it is critical to \n     educate people on the proper use of 9-1-1;\n       Whereas senior citizens are at high risk for needing to \n     call 9-1-1 and many senior citizens are learning to use new \n     technology;\n       Whereas thousands of 9-1-1 calls are made each year by \n     children who are properly trained in the use of 9-1-1, which \n     saves lives and underscores the critical importance of \n     training children about 9-1-1 early in life;\n       Whereas the 9-1-1 system is often misused, such as through \n     the placement of prank and non-emergency calls;\n       Whereas misuse of the 9-1-1 system results in costly and \n     inefficient use of 9-1-1 and emergency response resources, \n     and such misuse needs to be reduced;\n       Whereas parents, teachers, and caregivers must be educated \n     about 9-1-1 in order to play an active role in 9-1-1 \n     education for children;\n       Whereas there are many avenues for 9-1-1 public education, \n     including safety fairs, school presentations, libraries, \n     churches, businesses, public safety answering point tours or \n     open houses, civic organizations, and senior citizen centers;\n       Whereas parents, teachers, and the National Parent Teacher \n     Association contribute significantly to the goal of educating \n     children about the importance of 9-1-1 through targeted \n     outreach efforts to public and private schools;\n       Whereas the United States should strive to host at least 1 \n     annual educational event regarding the proper use of 9-1-1 in \n     every school in the Nation;\n       Whereas the people of the United States deserve the best \n     education regarding the use of 9-1-1; and\n       Whereas programs to promote proper use of 9-1-1 during \n     ``National 9-1-1 Education Month'' may include--\n       (1) public awareness events, such as conferences and media \n     outreach;\n       (2) training activities for businesses, parents, teachers, \n     school administrators, and other caregivers;\n       (3) educational events in schools and other appropriate \n     venues; and\n       (4) production and distribution of information about the 9-\n     1-1 system, designed to educate people of all ages on the \n     importance and proper use of 9-1-1: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2011 as ``National 9-1-1 Education \n     Month''; and\n       (2) urges Government officials, parents, teachers, school \n     administrators, caregivers, businesses, nonprofit \n     organizations, and the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National 9-1-1 Education Month'' with appropriate \n     ceremonies, training events, and activities.\n\n
