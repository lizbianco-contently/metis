Mr. President, earlier today, President Obama showed \nthe American people just how he intends to spend their tax dollars, and \nhow much more intends to borrow, to fund his vision of the future. And \nit is a huge disappointment to those in both parties who were hoping \nthe President would take this opportunity to address the grave and \nimminent fiscal crises we face. The President's budget is the clearest \nsign yet he simply does not take our fiscal problems seriously.\n  It is a patronizing plan that says to the American people that their \nconcerns are not his concerns.\n  It is a plan that says fulfilling the President's vision of a future \nof trains and windmills is more important than a balanced checkbook.\n  It is a plan that asks our children to pay for an imaginary vision of \nthe future that may or may not come about by adding trillions to a debt \nthat will be very real to them indeed.\n  The President's budget comes in at close to a thousand pages. The \npeople who voted for a new direction in November have a five-word \nresponse: We don't have the money.\n  We don't have the money.\n  Americans have been asking a crucial question as we approached this \ndebate: how do we get back to balance, how do we get to a place where \nWashington spends less than it takes in. And the simple fact about this \nbudget is that the President and all his advisers couldn't come up with \na single year in the next 10 where we do that.\n  That is the key question in this debate, but it is the one question \nthat the President and all of his advisers don't seem to have been the \nleast bit interested in.\n  The White House wants us to engage in a debate this week about \npercentage cuts at this or that agency, about milti-year projections \nand CBO scores. It all misses the point. The real point is this: We are \nbroke. We don't have the money.\n\n[[Page S652]]\n\n  Look: there is a time to experiment with high-flown plans and to test \ntheories. But we have to balance the checkbook first. We have to be \nable to afford it. The American people get that. This administration \ndoesn't seem to.\n  After 2 years of failed stimulus programs and Democrats in Washington \ncompeting to outspend each other, we just can't afford to do all the \nthings the administration wants.\n  The President has said he wants us to win the future. But this budget \nabdicates the future. It spends too much, taxes too much, and borrows \ntoo much. It says that the President does not have the will or the \nability to do what we need to do with the money that we have. But that \nis precisely what the Americans are demanding that we do.\n  Americans reject the idea that they have to live with another $13 \ntrillion in debt to fund the President's or anyone else's vision of the \nfuture.\n  This budget was an opportunity for the President to lead. He punted. \nIt only pretends to do the things people want. And the reaction we have \nseen from across the political spectrum so far today suggests that \nnobody is buying it.\n  The President may be determined to keep spending levels at the \ncurrent high levels--high levels he put in place--in the hope that \npeople will get used to them. But he has clearly misread a public that \nhas had enough.\n  We must live within our means. We must begin to do the difficult but \nnecessary work of reining in a government that has grown beyond our \nability to pay for it. We must acknowledge the mistakes of the past 2 \nyears and work to correct them.\n  The stimulus failed. This budget says ``Do it again.''\n  The President has already added more than $3 trillion to the debt as \nwe lost another 3 million jobs. This budget says let's add more debt \nand see if we get a different result.\n  The President had an opportunity to cut domestic spending from the 25 \npercent he has increased it since he came into office. Instead, he \nlocked it in place.\n  He had an opportunity to start to pay down the tremendous burden of \ndebt that he has added over the past 2 years. He wants to increase it \ninstead.\n  He had an opportunity to work with Republicans on reforming long-term \nentitlements such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. He took a \npass.\n  This is a status quo budget at a time when serious action is needed.\n  This is business as usual at a time when bold, creative solutions are \nneeded.\n  This is not an I-got-the-message budget. It is unserious, and it is \nirresponsible.\n  We need to look for ways to preserve what is good that does not put \nus on path to bankruptcy. That was the challenge of this budget. The \nadministration failed the test.\n  After years of overspending by both parties, it is time to make tough \nchoices, just as any family does when times are tough, even among very \ngood things. We have to cut even from programs that are good, as \ndifficult as it is, recognizing that the values we are fighting for in \nthis debate are more fundamental than the survival of any one program. \nWe need to face that fact that we do not have the money. It is not an \nAmerican value to borrow from others to pay for programs we do not need \nand cannot afford. And it is not an American value to put off tough \ndecisions because we refuse to say no to things we want.\n  If there is any good news in this debate, it is that we are finally \nbeginning to talk about how much to cut in this town instead of how \nmuch to spend. But we are going to need more people to join the fight. \nWe will need Democrats to join us. Above all, we need a President who \ngets it. And this President clearly does not get it yet.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 3 years ago today, a mentally disturbed \ngunman walked into a campus lecture hall at Northern Illinois \nUniversity in DeKalb and shot 22 students, killing 5 of them.\n  John Peters, the president of Northern Illinois University, the \nstudents, families, faculty, and employees pulled together after that \ntragedy, and I joined them at an observance with then Senator and now \nPresident Obama to acknowledge the grief they all felt and we shared. I \nam proud to report that the Northern Illinois University community is \nstronger and more resilient today than ever.\n  In the aftermath of the shooting, we asked a lot of questions about \nwhat led to it. Naturally, there were so many innocent victims. We \nasked what we could have done to prevent it. Three years later, we are \nstill trying to make sense of it.\n  Some believe that nothing can be done if a disturbed person is \ndetermined to commit an act of violence. But I believe something can be \ndone.\n  For a long time, we have overlooked a very obvious and very \ncompelling fact. Many young people do not demonstrate serious mental \nillness until they have left their home and high school and go off to \ncollege. We have overlooked the mental health of students on campuses.\n  Many mental illnesses manifest in this period when young people leave \nthe security of home, regular medical care, and the support of a \nnetwork of family and friends.\n  A friend of our family, a young man, went to the same university over \n30 years ago. Gary was a peculiar kind of his own type of person in \nhigh school. But within 30 days at the university, living in a college \ndorm, certain mental illnesses we were not even aware of manifested \nthemselves and he suffered from schizophrenia the rest of his short \nlife. It manifested itself at that campus.\n  It is easier for a young person's problems to go unnoticed when they \nare away from parents, old friends, and the high school community. \nSometimes they get worse. People do not even notice.\n  The consequences of not detecting or addressing mental health needs \namong students are very real. Forty-five percent of college students \nreport having felt so depressed it was difficult to function. Ten \npercent even contemplated suicide.\n  But while the needs for mental health services on campuses are \nrising, colleges are facing financial pressures of their own and are \nhaving trouble meeting the demand. A recent survey of college \ncounseling centers indicates the average ratio of professional staff to \nstudents is 1 to 1,952, and at 4-year public universities it is 1 to \nevery 2,600 students. It is little wonder that many young people with \nthese problems go unnoticed.\n  Shortly after the tragedy at Northern Illinois University, I wrote a \nbill called the Mental Health on Campus Improvement Act to help schools \nmeet the needs of their students. The bill would provide resources for \ncolleges and universities to improve their mental health services and \nwould call for the development of a public nationwide campaign to \neducate campus communities about mental health. We know troubled \nstudents who receive appropriate counseling and support can succeed in \ncollege and life. These services make an impact. Students who seek help \nare six time less likely to kill themselves.\n  By providing critical resources to colleges, the Mental Health on \nCampus Improvement Act would ensure that more young people receive the \nhelp they need before facing a crisis.\n  The main elements of this bill were included in a proposal to \nreauthorize the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act last year. I will \ncontinue to work on this legislation to get it enacted so we can give \ncolleges the help they need to identify and treat students with mental \nhealth issues.\n\n[[Page S653]]\n\n  We also know from Northern Illinois University, as well as from the \ntragedies at Virginia Tech and Tucson, that we need to fill the gaps in \nthe Federal gun background check system.\n  No one is proposing to take guns away from responsible American \nhunters and law-abiding citizens. The Supreme Court has made it clear \nthat individuals have a right to own guns. I respect that decision. But \nthe Court has also said that the second amendment is ``not a right to \nkeep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for \nwhatever purpose.''\n  For years, laws on the books have prohibited those with histories of \nserious mental illness and substance abuse from buying guns. State \nagencies and Federal agencies need to work more closely together to \nmake sure the background check system is fully updated with this \ncritical information.\n  Today is a time for our country to remember the lives and mourn the \nloss at Northern Illinois University of five promising young Americans \nwhose life stories were cruelly cut short 3 years ago. But as we look \nback, we must also--as they say at Northern; their slogan--move \n``Forward, Together Forward'' in the true Northern Illinois University \nspirit.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, my cochair, Senator Hutchison, is on \nthe floor, and I know she wishes to speak.\n  It occurs to me we are back on the Federal aviation bill. We have \nbeen on this bill for several years. There is an interesting sort of \ndilemma which has developed. If one listens to the conversation on the \nfloor and around in the hallways, everything has to do with slots--how \nmany flights in and out of National Airport, what are we going to do \nabout the west coast, Seattle, and all the rest of them. Actually, that \nis a very small part of the overall bill, reflecting on the overall \nhealth and progress of the Federal Aviation Administration, compared to \nthings such as NextGen, the new air traffic control system entirely, \nand a variety of other things which are already in the bill which the \nSenate passed last year 93 to nothing. So I am losing my patience a \nlittle bit with slots.\n  Kay Bailey Hutchison and I agree on most things in our work, and we \nhave an amendment. Other people seem to be going back and forth--they \nare amenable, then they are not amenable--and we are running out of \ntime. I think the leader, with that in mind, is going to ask for \ncloture on this to sort of force everybody's hand.\n  What I am really suggesting is that those who are working on slots \ntry to come to an agreement during the course of the rest of this day \nbecause I think we are talking only about that, and perhaps a little \nbit of tomorrow morning. Then I think the Senate just kind of--and I \nknow the leader on our side--has to do the bill. We have been debating \nthese slots for 6\\1/2\\ months this year. We did it for a whole bunch of \nmonths last year. Progress is made, progress is unmade; people agree, \npeople don't agree. Senator Hutchison and I are getting a little bit \nfrustrated by that. We think we have a good amendment, but let's see.\n  So we have some pending amendments. I am hopeful we will be able to \nwork through them this evening and the remainder of the week. I think \nwe have made reasonable progress on some matters, but on the question \nof the bill itself and the substance of the bill and those amendments \nwhich are germane to the substance of the bill, I think we have made a \nlot of progress. A lot of that progress actually comes from last year \non our unanimous vote to approve this issue. So I believe we can and \nmust finish this bill this week. I think my cochair agrees with me on \nthat. If not, we risk further extensions of the FAA and a less stable \nagency.\n  Again, I would point out that I think we are on our 18th extension of \nthis massive bill keep all of our planes in the air and everybody at \nwork and includes safety and all kinds of things. We need a very swift \nresolution. So I urge the Senate to promptly move forward on the \npassage of the FAA reauthorization act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am fully in support of what the \nchairman has said. We have been on this bill now for over a week of \nactual Senate time. It is an important bill for our country because we \nare trying to set in place the next generation of air traffic control. \nAmerica has over 50 percent of the air traffic in the world. We need to \nbe the leader of the next generation of\n\n[[Page S654]]\n\nair traffic control systems. We are trying to transfer from the ground-\nbased radar system to a satellite-based system. It will be more \nefficient. It will open many more opportunities for airspace. We need \nto be able to move forward so that more planes can use the airspace we \nhave. Yet we are finding a reluctance to vote on amendments. There are \nseveral amendments that are pending. We need to have votes on those \namendments. There are safety measures; there are consumer protection \nmeasures in this bill.\n  The chairman and I have worked together on making progress because we \nboth want to pass this bill. It is a good bill. The sticking point is \nthe slots at Reagan National Airport. Honestly, the chairman's staff \nand my staff have worked with all of the affected airlines and States \nand constituents to try to come to a fair opening of Washington \nNational Airport to people who live west of St. Louis, MO. Basically, \nwest of St. Louis, there are very few straight flights from Washington \nNational. Most of them have to stop. So we are trying to gradually add \nto the capabilities for people who live out West to come into \nWashington National Airport, but we are also trying to keep the people \nwho live around the airport from having undue noise or undue traffic or \ncongestion at the airport. So we are trying to come up with a fair \nsystem. But, to be honest, the sides are not giving. There is a western \nSenator position. There is a Virginia Senator position. There is a far-\nAlaska, far-west position. And nobody is giving an inch. Well, it is \nkind of hard to negotiate when you keep putting things out there, which \nthe chairman and I are doing, and we get no response but ``I want \neverything my way.'' Well, ``everything my way'' is not going to work.\n  We are facing a deadline now where possibly we won't be able to get a \nvote. I think that would be very bad for the western half of the United \nStates because I think they are being unfairly kept out of access to \nthe convenience of the airport to the Capitol and to downtown \nWashington. So I hope the sides will meet and come together with \nsomething that accommodates all of the needs and concerns, and I hope \nwe can pass this bill this week. I think both the majority leader and \nthe Republican leader are in support of the bill going forward. So we \nneed to get our amendments up, get them voted on, and let's try to make \nprogress.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, let me add to what my distinguished \ncolleague said. People who are working on slot amendments should \nremember that in the bill that was passed and therefore the pending \nlegislation, S. 233, there are no slot amendments. So they have to be \nunder the discipline of understanding that slot amendments at this \npoint are nongermane, and that will change as circumstances change in \nthe next day or they won't.\n  At this point, with the indulgence of Senator Hutchison, I know \nSenator Murkowski from Alaska is going to give a speech, with whom I \nknow I am going to fully agree.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the chairman and \nthe ranking member on the Commerce Committee. I know they have been \nworking diligently throughout this process not only with this \nparticular reauthorization, but they have been great leaders on this \nissue over the years, and I appreciate that. We are working on some \ndifficult issues, some contentious issues, including the issue of the \nslots which the chairman just discussed. It is one that is critically \nimportant to a person such as myself who represents the farthest of the \nWest, along with Hawaii, so we look at how we are able to gain access \nthrough our airways and to travel. So the issues in front of us are \nincredibly important, but I don't want to speak to the issue of the \nperimeter slots today.\n  I wish to address an amendment that was raised exactly a week ago by \nmy colleague from Arizona, and this is regarding the importance of the \nEssential Air Service to my State of Alaska. I think the Members of \nthis body have heard very often not only from myself but from Senator \nBegich and, prior to the two of us, the Alaskan Senators who for years \nstood on this floor and said: Alaska is different.\n  When we are talking about the Essential Air Service and what it \nallows and what it provides, I repeat, Alaska is different. It is \nunique from anywhere in the lower 48, and the necessity to maintain the \nEssential Air Service is yet one more example.\n  It was last week that the Senator from Arizona referred to a figure \nfrom the FAA that stated ``99.95 percent of all Americans live within \n120 miles of a public airport that has more than 10,000 takeoffs and \nlandings annually.'' That statement clearly does not refer to Alaska.\n  When the Essential Air Service was created in 1978, after the airline \nindustry was deregulated, Congress correctly determined that air \ncarriers that supported our rural locations would need a financial \nsubsidy to ensure their passengers could receive not only a price but \nquantity of flights and quality of service that was necessary to \nprovide for effective transportation and movement of goods.\n  At the creation of the EAS Program, nearly every community in the \nState of Alaska was affected by the deregulation of the airlines \nindustry. There were about 130 communities that were put on that list \nin 1978. Today we have 44 communities in Alaska that are receiving EAS.\n  Let me tell you some things about Alaska that do make it unique, and \nwhen we refer to Essential Air Service one can see that title is \nactually a very apt description of what is provided in my State.\n  I have a map of the State of Alaska. The red lines that look like \nlittle arteries represent our road system. We have just short of 11,000 \nmiles of a road system in the State of Alaska. I said that seems like a \nlot of roads. To put it in context, California has 2.3 million miles of \nroads.\n  Our road system is one--if you look at it--that is up and down. We do \nnot have much in southeastern Alaska. We do not have a thing along the \nAleutian chain. We do not have anything in the southwestern and \nnorthern part of Alaska. We have just a few roads around the Seward \nPeninsula. Eighty percent of communities in the State of Alaska are not \nconnected by a road. How do you get there? If you happen to be in the \nsoutheast, you get there by boat.\n  The bottom line is we fly. This is not a luxury; this is a necessity. \nWe have to fly. We are the most flown State in the country. About 80 \npercent of our communities are nonaccessible by road while in the rest \nof the country, if you want to get in your car, if you have an \nemergency, you need to get to the hospital, you hop in and drive. If \nyou want to go for a spring break, you get in your car and drive 4 or 5 \nhours and you are at the beach. If you want to get somewhere--\nanywhere--you pretty much have an opportunity to do so.\n  We do not have that opportunity in Alaska. Given what we face with a \nlimited road system--the weather and terrain issues--we in the State of \nAlaska treat airplanes or helicopters like most Americans would treat \ntheir minivan. Aircraft in Alaska are not just a nice thing to have. \nThey are a lifeline for survival, for subsistence, for travel, for \nrecreation. They are truly an essential part of our everyday lives.\n  The city administrator of Atka--Atka is all the way at the end of the \nAleutian Islands--the city administrator of Atka, Julie Dirks, sent a \nletter to the Alaska delegation explaining how the loss of EAS \nsubsidies would negatively impact the city of Atka and other rural \ncommunities in the State. In the letter, she writes:\n\n       Loss of this program would be devastating to remote rural \n     communities such as Atka and others in our region. Atka is \n     not on a road system connecting the communities to other \n     places nor is there any type of marine ferry service \n     connecting Atka to other islands or mainland Alaska.\n\n  Even though there is a lot of water out there, you cannot get there \nby boat.\n\n       Air transportation presently is the only method available \n     providing access in and out of Atka. Costs of service are \n     already high even with the subsidy. Without the subsidy \n     service would be too expensive or even non-existent.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed the letter from the city \nadministrator of Atka.\n\n[[Page S655]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 February 7, 2011.\n     Re Essential Air Service Program.\n\n     Alaska Delegation,\n     Senator Mark Begich,\n     Senator Lisa Murkowski,\n     Congressman Don Young,\n     Washington, DC.\n       It is my understanding Senator John McCain has introduced \n     legislation to the FAA Reauthorization Bill that, if passed, \n     would repeal the Essential Air Services Program. I am writing \n     on behalf of the remote Aleutian community of Atka, Alaska to \n     protest the elimination of the program.\n       Without the federal government subsidy provided by the \n     Essential Air Service program remote communities in Alaska \n     like Atka are unlikely to have any air service at all and \n     could cease to exist. Regular scheduled transportation \n     service is important to the sustainability of the community \n     and to support economic activity of the local seafood \n     processing plant owned jointly by local residents and the \n     regional CDQ organization.\n       Loss of this program would be devastating to remote rural \n     communities such as Atka and others in our region. Atka is \n     not on a road system connecting the communities to other \n     places nor is there any type of marine ferry service \n     connecting Atka to other islands or mainland Alaska. Air \n     transportation presently is the only method available \n     providing access in and out of Atka. Costs of service are \n     already high even with the subsidy. Without the subsidy \n     service would be too expensive or even non-existent.\n       Your efforts to keep this important program funded will be \n     appreciated by Atka residents.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Julie Dirks,\n                                               City Administrator.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have 44 communities in the State of \nAlaska that receive an EAS subsidy. Thirty eight of those communities \nare not connected in any way to this road system so they are forced to \nuse air travel as their primary means of travel. Then one has to say: \nOK, that means you have six that are on a road. Why can't they use the \nroad? Why do we have to provide EAS for these six communities?\n  Let's look at some of these communities. McCarthy does not have any \nroad maintenance during the winter months. Pretty much between October \nand April we are looking at a situation where this community is shut \noff. That means no mail. That means no emergency services. That means \nno ability to get food supplies. They basically have to wait it out \nuntil the road thaws in the spring. If we do not have air service in a \ncommunity such as McCarthy, even though there is technically a road, \nfor about 7 months they are without.\n  Another of the communities, Gulkana, is on a two-lane paved road, but \nit is over 210 miles to the nearest medium-hub airport. The other four \ncommunities, which are Circle, Central, Minto, and Manley Hot Springs, \nare all located on two-lane gravel roads. They require driving \ndistances of at least 125 miles to the nearest hub airport.\n  Again, we need to remember what kind of roads they are driving on. \nThis is not like jumping on to I-95 or I-10. These are, for the most \npart, single-lane roads during most of the year. They are snow covered, \nwith limited visibility. They have tough temperatures they are dealing \nwith in the interior. It is pretty dark during this time of year. It is \nnot a road about which one says: Let's drive to town.\n  It has been noted by some of the opponents of the Essential Air \nService Program that the spending in Alaska is just out of whack, that \nit is too much. Let's look at the facts as they relate to Alaska.\n  There are currently 153 communities that are receiving subsidies, \naccording to the USDOT. The Department of Transportation says there are \n44 communities in Alaska and 109 communities combined for the lower 48, \nHawaii, and Puerto Rico. Critics say it looks as if Alaska has almost \nhalf as many EAS communities as the rest of the United States.\n  OK, that may be true. We will grant that. But what they ignore, what \nthey forget is how we compare in Alaska in conjunction with the rest of \nthe country. I know people get tired of looking at these maps about how \nbig we are. The fact is, we do not make this up. We do not just \nsuperimpose Alaska on a map of the country and say: Isn't this a nice \nshape? We put it on the map of the lower 48 States to show the size. We \nare not that little State that is down in the water next to Hawaii or \noff California, despite some of the maps that are still out there on \npeople's walls. We are this big.\n  We have over 47,000 miles of shoreline, going all the way out to the \nAleutians and coming all the way up--47,000 miles, more than all of the \nother 49 States combined. We cover an area of over 586,000 miles. We go \nfrom California to Florida, beyond the Great Lakes and into Canada.\n  The comment was made that if I want to go from Adak, which is one of \nthe EAS communities, to Anchorage, which is the largest city in our \nState, it is a $1,400 round-trip airfare--with EAS subsidies, I might \nadd. But it is almost 1,200 miles. That just gets you from Adak into \nAnchorage. It does not get you down to the rest of the lower 48.\n  Put that in context and that is like going from Kansas City to Boston \nwhere, I might add, their round-trip airfare is $571. It helps to put \nthings in context when people are saying that Alaska is getting too \nmuch of a share of this program. Monetarily, Alaska gets about $12.6 \nmillion in EAS subsidies. The rest of the Nation gets over $163 million \nin EAS subsidies. In Alaska, we have over 700 registered airports, \n1,200 airstrips, and over 10,000 registered aircraft.\n  When we look at how our 44 communities that receive the subsidies \nreceive less than 10 percent of the subsidies of the lower 48, to \nsuggest somehow they are getting something that is not equitable, \nagain, is important to put into context. There are no roads to most of \nthese communities.\n  It was commented by my colleague from Arizona that there was a 2009 \nGAO report on the Essential Air Service Program. It was indicated that \nthe GAO thought the Essential Air Service Program might have outlived \nits usefulness. But there is a section of that report that was left \nout. I think it is important to note that the writers of that report \nstated:\n\n       [The] review focuses on communities within the continental \n     United States that have received EAS subsidized service. We \n     focused our review on these communities because the \n     requirements for communities in Alaska are different than for \n     communities in other States, and airports outside the \n     contiguous States are not representative of the program in \n     the rest of the country.\n\n  It is critically important that we look to what that full GAO report \nsaid and how it recognized that the circumstances in Alaska are \nentirely different and are not representative of what we see in the \nlower 48.\n  When we look to that GAO report, we need to put that into context \nagain. Another thing that must be kept in mind when we are talking \nabout Essential Air Service is that--what we are all talking about on \nthe Senate floor--is jobs, what is going on with jobs. The number of \njobs that would be lost, the economic impact that would result from the \nrepeal of this program in Alaska would be consequential.\n  Aviation in our State provides $3.5 billion to the economy. It \nrepresents 8 percent of the gross State product. It is the fifth \nlargest employer in the State, employing about 10 percent of our total \nworkforce. And it is not just the jobs that would be lost, these folks \nwho handle and sort the mail, load the packages into the aircraft would \nlikely lose their jobs. The commercial fishermen, the workers at the \nfish processing plants would be impacted. Emergency medical \nprofessionals, the tourist industry, recreational professionals--they \nwould all feel the negative impact of the repeal of EAS in Alaska. All \nof these vital industries and services are connected to the everyday \nAlaskan by one common thread, and that is aviation.\n  Many of us look forward to the wild fresh salmon that comes out of \nthe Copper River in May. That comes from a community in Prince William \nSound, Cordova. Mr. President, 2,200 people live there. They receive \nEssential Air Service. The fact that they are able to fly into this \ncommunity that does not have access to a road allows those fishermen to \nreceive a price for their product that maintains and sustains them. The \nrepeal of EAS means hundreds of my constituents would be forced to \npurchase expensive airline tickets just so they would have access to \nthe most basic and yet very essential things.\n  Kodiak Island is the recipient of a lot of our EAS communities. \nIsland Air is an airline that services these 12 communities. Eleven of \nthese communities\n\n[[Page S656]]\n\nare served by float planes because there is no runway. So we don't even \nhave the basic runway. You are flying in on a seaplane. Two of the \ncommunities Island Air supports are Karluk and Alitak. Round-trip \nairfare from Karluk to Kodiak, which is sitting right in here, is $254 \na person, to Alitak it is $346 a person. Flights to these locations \noccur only three times a week. So if you are going to fly into Kodiak, \nyou have to assume you are going to have a couple nights of hotel \ncosts--lodging expenses--so this brings the price of your trip to about \nover $500. But if the EAS Program is repealed, the cost per person to \nget to these locations jumps to over $1,800, and that is just to get \nfrom the little village to Kodiak. This is not getting you to \nAnchorage, where you can get medical services. It is not getting you to \nwhere you can get to the shopping you and your family might need. These \nexpenses are also just for the airfare and not for the lodging. It \ndoesn't allow for the purchase of supplies, mail, tourism or any of the \nother activities that members and visitors to these communities might \nengage in. So I think it is fair to say if we repeal EAS, Island Air \nwill no longer be able to serve these communities. They would be forced \nto lay off their employees. But you don't have service to these areas.\n\n  I can't speak for every location in the United States that receives \nfunding from EAS and tell you how each would be impacted by the McCain \namendment, but I can say, without any reservation, that this amendment \nwould create an economic and a transportation disaster for Alaska, \nincluding the loss of jobs, livelihoods, and would potentially impact \nhealth and medical situations. The complete elimination of the EAS \nProgram could destabilize many of our rural communities, could \nnegatively impact the integrity of Alaska's interconnected aviation \nsystem, and severely reduce air services to essential parts of the \nState. EAS has been and will continue to be a critical and instrumental \ncomponent of Alaska's aviation transportation system network, while \nproviding important jobs and allowing necessary and critical access to \nrural and isolated communities within our State and across the Nation.\n  I have consumed the time I was allotted this morning, but I cannot \nrepeat enough, I cannot reiterate enough the importance of a program \nsuch as Essential Air Service to a remote and rural State such as \nAlaska. It truly is essential. When this amendment comes before the \nbody, I would urge defeat of the McCain amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am only going to comment for a \nminute, but what the Senator from Alaska has just said is completely \ntrue. It also points out the overall philosophical question of what are \nwe doing with this bill: Are we going to pass it or fight over all \nthese slots? I am for passing the bill and leaving slots for conference \nor whatever, unless we can work something out. Nobody wants to agree. \nEverybody thinks they have the leverage. Maybe they do, maybe they do \nnot. But in the meantime, this bill, which has been languishing for all \nthese months, in fact, solves one of the problems of Alaska in its \nentirety because of the NextGen system, which I have been talking \nabout--and which I could talk about more but not today--which is a \nglobal satellite network. It will provide the safety and capacity that \nis needed for safe flight in tricky weather, where weather changes very \nquickly, and, in fact, it is now in place in Alaska.\n  So that doesn't, in any way, take away from the Essential Air Service \nproblems which the Senator from Alaska is talking about. I totally \nagree with her on that. But it just shows that if we hold up this bill \nand make ourselves slaves to working out slots agreements, which \nprobably can't be worked out on this floor--maybe they can, I hope so, \nbut I doubt it--we are depriving her State and others--but hers in \nparticular since hers is a test State which has this system in place \nbecause of the changing weather, because of the unpredictability of \nvirtually everything when you are flying. It is in effect there and in \nfour other States. We are trying to get it to all States. This will \nchange the whole future of aviation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                         The President's Budget\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, the President released his budget \nfor fiscal year 2012. If this is his idea of a Valentine's gift to \nAmerica and to the American people, he has an odd way of showing his \naffection. It is the equivalent of taking your fiancee to dinner, \nasking her to marry you, and then leaving her to take care of the \ncheck, your maxed out credit cards, your underwater mortgage, and the \nbill for the ring.\n  This budget is, quite simply, an abdication of adult responsibility, \nand it is a particular abdication of the responsibility of the \nPresident of the United States, who takes an oath to protect and defend \nour Constitution. Our economy is dealing with the hangover from the \n2008 economic collapse, the greatest fiscal crisis I have seen and that \nwe have seen in several generations. Our recovery has been sluggish, \nand it is not being helped by this administration's regulatory overload \nand ObamaCare, which is set to kill 800,000 jobs.\n  We can already see a still larger crisis approaching. This is nothing \nshort of an existential challenge. Continued deficits and accumulated \ndebt are a genuine threat to individual liberty, continued prosperity, \nand national security. Absent immediate action--and let me stress this \nneeds to be immediate action--we face a future where our union is not \nmore perfect and where government will stand in the way of enterprising \nbusinesses and citizens whose only wish is the opportunity to thrive. \nYet the President's response to this impending disaster is to vote \npresent. His response is to pass the buck.\n  With due respect, the budget released today is a sorry joke. I would \nhate to be the White House staffers forced to spin this budget as a \nstep in the right direction. The United States is demanding a \n``Churchill'' on the issue of deficits and debt, but the administration \nhas delivered us a ``Chamberlain.''\n  Let me break this down. The administration is going to reduce the \ndeficit by $1.1 trillion over 10 years. That sounds like a mighty big \nnumber, and I am sure the White House has some consultants who have \ntold them the American people can be duped into thinking this \nrepresents meaningful deficit reduction or change. Let me be clear. \nThis is not meaningful deficit reduction. The administration wants to \nreduce the deficit by $1.1 trillion over 10 years. What does the \nadministration project the deficit to be for this fiscal year--$1.65 \ntrillion. At 10.9 percent of the gross domestic product, this is the \nlargest deficit as a share of the economy since World War II. \nUnbelievable.\n  But it is consistent with the way Democrats have behaved since taking \nover Washington. In 2010, the deficit was $1.3 trillion and in 2009 \n$1.4 trillion. So let us put this in perspective. The administration is \nout there touting today its fiscal responsibility. Yet its 10-year \ntotal deficit reduction is smaller than this year's deficit.\n  The President's much touted 5-year freeze on discretionary spending, \nwhich will save $400 billion, is smaller than the Congressional Budget \nOffice's recent upward revision of the 2011 deficit. Spinning this \nbudget as the fiscally responsible thing to do betrays a profound lack \nof respect for the intelligence of the American citizens.\n  This budget contains $53 billion for construction of high-speed rail \nin Florida, California, and several other States. If there is a bigger \ngovernment boondoggle out there, I am not aware of it. But the Vice \nPresident, in promoting this spending spree, tells Americans they need \nto get a grip. With due respect, the American people's grip on the \nsituation is fine. They understand something that apparently has eluded \nthe best and brightest over on Pennsylvania Avenue--we are out of \nmoney.\n  The well that has been financing the New Deal, and the New Frontier, \nand the Great Society, and the stimulus, and ObamaCare has finally run \ndry. It is past time that we stop playing politics with the deficit and \ndebt and make the tough choices necessary to put America's finances \nback on solid ground. Yet there is no effort in this budget to take \ncare of our long-term fiscal problems--none at all.\n\n[[Page S657]]\n\n  Not even the Washington Post is able to spin this one. This is a $3.7 \ntrillion budget. What is the future of our deficit and debt? This is \nwhat the Post had to say. After next year, the deficit will begin to \nfall, ``settling around $600 billion a year through 2018, when it would \nonce again begin to climb as a growing number of retirees tapped into \nSocial Security and Medicare.''\n  The new normal under this budget is one of permanent budget deficits, \nlong after President Obama has returned to private life. He will be out \nworking on his Presidential library while Americans are left holding \nthe bag for his big spending policies. He may not want to admit it, but \nthe most fitting volume for his Presidential library might be ``The \nRoad to Serfdom.''\n  How exactly does the administration propose to pay for Social \nSecurity and Medicare and national defense under this budget? The \nbottom line: It doesn't. This budget amounts to gross negligence. Even \nthe progressive blogger, Ezra Klein, concludes that when reading this \nbudget, it is almost like the fiscal commission never happened.\n  Remember that? The President's fiscal commission? It issued a report \nrecommending over $4 trillion in cuts, including adjustments to \nentitlements. It offered controversial but appropriately bold proposals \nto get our Nation back on track. The President and his team looked at \nthose proposals and bravely decided to leave this problem to the next \nadministration and future generations.\n  Clearly, I am not a fan. But there is one useful item to consider in \nthis budget. It is what progressives might call a teachable moment.\n  To achieve these paltry deficit reduction numbers, the administration \nhad to resort to massive tax increases.\n  As the Post concludes, the tax hikes in this bill will be around $1.6 \ntrillion over 10 years.\n  Here is the point that people need to be reminded of.\n  Even with possibly more than $1.6 trillion in job killing tax \nincreases in this budget, it still comes nowhere close to reining in \nour deficits and debt.\n  For years we have heard Democrats say that if the rich people and \nbusinesses paid their fair share in taxes, we could balance the budget \nand reduce the debt.\n  Well, they sure tested it out in this budget.\n  They soak the so-called rich and American business with a fire hose, \nand yet we are still facing trillions in debt and hundreds of billions \nin deficits.\n  After the much maligned Bush tax cuts expire and undermine small \nbusiness job creation, according to the President's own numbers we will \nstill have to borrow an additional $7.2 trillion through 2021 to pay \nthe bills that are coming due from the Obama administration's spending \npolicies.\n  This budget should be a turning point in our debate about deficit and \ndebt reduction.\n  Tax increases simply cannot get us there.\n  Unfortunately, the message that tax increases lead to deficit \nreduction is the Democrats' good word.\n  Over the past decade, I have participated in many discussions about \nspending and tax policy.\n  As my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, has noted, Democrats \nbasically have two talking points.\n  First, all of the good fiscal history of the 1990s was derived from \nthe partisan tax increase bill of 1993.\n  And second, all of the bad fiscal history taking place within the \npast 10 years is owing to the bipartisan tax relief plans originally \nenacted during the last administration and continued under the present \nadministration.\n  The Democrats' platform does have the virtue of simplicity: higher \ntaxes--good; lower taxes--bad.\n  This record needs to be corrected. Regular viewers of C-SPAN 2 have \nprobably heard others on my side do so before.\n  But it bears repeating, particularly in light of today's budget, that \nhigher taxes will not right our fiscal ship.\n  The myth that higher taxes lead to lower deficits is a persistent \none.\n  This is the mainstream account of the Clinton tax hikes.\n  According to this theory, the positive fiscal history of the 1990s \nresulted from the 1993 tax increases.\n  It is a simple enough argument.\n  According to the other side, by raising taxes and taking more money \nout of the economy, the government successfully reduced the deficit.\n  Yet, as you can see from this chart, the Clinton administration's own \nOffice of Management and Budget concluded that the 1993 tax increase \naccounted for only 13 percent of deficit reduction between 1990 and \n2000.\n  As a percentage of deficit reduction, the 1993 tax increase ranks \nbehind other factors such as defense cuts--and interest savings.\n  The message here is simple.\n  Tax increases did not drive deficit reduction.\n  It may seem counterintuitive, but raising taxes does not necessarily \nmean that revenues collected by the government, as a percentage of GDP, \nwill increase.\n  Consider this chart, which compares changes in Federal revenues as a \npercentage of GDP for two key 4-year periods. Each of these 4-year \nperiods was preceded by a major tax policy change.\n  The first 4-year period occurred after the 1993 tax increase was \nenacted.\n  The second 4-year period occurred after the Jobs and Growth Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2003 was enacted.\n  The Jobs and Growth Reconciliation Act was the second of the major \ntax relief bills enacted during the last administration. It featured \nreductions on tax rates of capital gains and dividends.\n  Let's take a look at the first of those 4-year periods in each case.\n  One year after the 1993 hike, we do see increased revenues.\n  One year after the 2003 tax cut, revenues drop.\n  But take a look at the second through fourth years following the \nadoption of each bill.\n  You will see that the trend of the first year reverses itself in the \nsecond year after the tax hike.\n  As the policies in both bills had time to take effect, the revenue \npatterns are clear. The positive change in revenue was generally \ngreater after the tax cut bill than it was after the tax increase bill.\n  There is no doubt that our deficits are a serious issue. They \nthreaten the future of our Nation. It is irresponsible, however, to say \nthat our dire fiscal situation is the result of the government not \nextracting enough money from the people who actually earn it.\n  The President's budget, with its massive new tax increases and \npermanent deficits, demonstrates yet again that our problem is \nspending.\n  Our budget deficits are being driven by spending.\n  Spending has not grown arithmetically.\n  Spending has not grown geometrically.\n  Spending has grown exponentially.\n  Over the past few years, while Democrats exercised complete control \nover Washington, non-defense discretionary spending has grown by 24 \npercent. As I have said before, that figure does not even include the \nbloated stimulus bill, enacted in early 2009.\n  Yet these deficits continue to grow in spite of increased revenues.\n  On January 26, CBO published its Budget and Economic Outlook for \nFiscal Years 2011 through 2021. I am going to quote from that report. \nBy CB0's estimates, Federal revenues in 2011 will be $123 billion--or 6 \npercent--more than total revenues recorded two years ago, in 2009.\n  This increase in Federal revenues for 2011 includes the net effect \nfrom a 1-year across-the-board reduction in payroll taxes.\n  The important fact here is that revenues have increased over the past \n2 years, and the deficit has still increased. Our deficit and debt \nproblems are not being driven by tax relief.\n  Despite this evidence, many of my friends on the other side still see \nraising taxes as the best and only solution.\n  They want to fund out-of-control spending by taking even more money \nfrom the people who actually earn it.\n  Proponents of this approach know that the confiscation of what has \nbeen lawfully earned can be a hard sell.\n  That is the reason they resort to clever rhetoric, telling us that \npaying taxes is inherently patriotic.\n  Or we hear talking points about some people not paying their fair \nshare.\n  These sound bites might sound good to the base, but they are not \ngrounded in reality.\n  CBO has published a booklet entitled ``The Long-Term Budget \nOutlook.'' In\n\n[[Page S658]]\n\nits most recent version CBO confirmed that Federal revenues have \nfluctuated between 15 percent and 21 percent of GDP over the past 40 \nyears, averaging about 18 percent.\n  Because of the recession, revenues dipped to around 15 percent \nrecently. But that should not deceive us into thinking taxes are \nabnormally low. Using current-law assumptions, CBO projected revenues \nto reach 23 percent of GDP by 2035.\n  Arguably, those current-law assumptions are unrealistic, since they \nassumed the bipartisan tax relief enacted in 2001 and 2003 would expire \nalong with relief from the alternative minimum tax, at the end of last \nyear.\n  Yet CBO evaluated an alternative, more realistic, fiscal scenario. In \nthat scenario, CBO assumed that most of the tax relief enacted in 2001 \nand 2003 would be extended through 2020. It still assumed that tax \nrelief would expire for so-called high-income taxpayers. But CBO did \nanticipate that AMT relief would continue, along with other deviations \nfrom current law.\n  Even using this alternative fiscal scenario, CBO found that revenues \nas a percentage of GDP would increase to just over 19 percent in 2020 \nand stay at that level for several years.\n  That is to say, in this scenario, the level of taxation would still \nbe above the 40-year historical average of about 18 percent of GDP.\n  I want to briefly return to the January CBO analysis that I referred \nto earlier.\n  That analysis, which assumes that most of the components of the tax \npackage enacted at the end of 2010 will continue to be extended, along \nwith the modified estate and gift provisions also in that same \nlegislation, calculates that annual government revenues will steadily \nincrease going forward, but will still average about 18 percent of GDP \nthrough 2021.\n  I have spent the past few minutes discussing CBO projections of \nvarious policy scenarios.\n  I am sure this presentation has made for some very gripping \ntelevision.\n  But the point I am trying to convey is a critical one.\n  The fiscal reality is that taxes are not abnormally low.\n  Continuing current tax policy yields Federal revenues at about the \nhistorical average of GDP for the past 40 years.\n  Increasing taxes on anyone, even so called high-earners, will push \ngovernment revenues above the 40 years' historical average, as a \npercentage of GDP.\n  I know there are many who would still support raising taxes above \nthis historical level.\n  The President made clear today that he certainly does.\n  But it is important to heed the words of the CBO before we raise \ntaxes.\n  In its Long-Term Budget Outlook, CBO had this to say about a scenario \nwhere the bipartisan tax relief of 2001 and 2003 expired, along with \nAMT relief.\n  According to CBO:\n\n       Marginal tax rates on income from labor and capital would \n     rise considerably under the extended-baseline scenario. The \n     increase in the marginal tax rate on labor would reduce \n     people's incentive to work, and the increase in the marginal \n     tax rate on capital would reduce their incentive to save.\n\n  The basic point I am making is that tax hikes are not like finding a \npot of gold at the end of a rainbow. That money comes from somewhere, \nand there will be consequences to redistributing it.\n  Moreover, as we saw in the budget released today, even spiking taxes \nby over $1.6 trillion will not help us to balance our books.\n  Abnormally high spending drove the deficits of the past. It is \ndriving the deficits of today. And it will drive the deficits of the \nfuture.\n  Some folks, in response to the question of whether the President is \ntriangulating after the drubbing Democrats took in November, have \nanswered no. He's just being himself.\n  You can say that again. He supported big government as a community \norganizer. He supported it as a Senator, on this floor and in \ncommittees.\n  He supported it as a presidential candidate, and he supports it \ntoday.\n  But the stakes are higher now.\n  He is the Nation's chief executive, and ultimately the President is \nresponsible for guiding our Nation through the treacherous waters of an \nimpending fiscal crisis. These are not easy shoals to navigate yet the \nstatesman cannot shirk his duty.\n  As Senator Henry Clay once put it, ``I would rather be right than be \nPresident.''\n  Some things are bigger than the next election, and getting our \ndeficits under control is one of those things.\n  The American people know that President Obama's budget is not right.\n  The present administration is spending almost 25 percent of our GDP, \nhistorically high except during and shortly after World War II. The \nlast time we had that kind of expenditure was in 1950. That is why I am \nso strongly for a balanced budget constitutional amendment. I wish we \ndid not have to go to that, but I don't see any other way we will get \nspending under control because I think Congress has been \ninstitutionally incapable of bringing down spending.\n  One reason is that with the help of the mainstream media, Members of \nCongress actually believe they will be kept in office by spending, and \nup to now that has been pretty true. But the American people are \nstarting to wake up, they are starting to realize that, as sincere as \nmy colleagues are on the other side, their economic policies are \ncorrupt--maybe ``corrupt'' is too strong word, but it is wrong, \ndefinitely wrong.\n  We know the American people are not going to stop demanding real \nleadership on this issue. I feel badly because I know I personally like \nthe President. There is no question about it. I showed him great \nfriendship when he was here. I have shown him friendship since he was \nelected.\n  We all know that in order to resolve these problems we have to get \nentitlements under control. As good as some here in Congress are, we \ncan't do it without Presidential leadership. We just can't.\n  I have a suggestion for the President. He would go down in history as \none of the truly great Presidents if he would work with us, work \ntogether, bringing bipartisan people together and work to resolve these \nconflicts. You cannot do it with just 15 percent of the budget and you \ncannot do it with just tax increases. You cannot do it with an ever-\nexpanding Federal Government. You cannot do it with an ever-expanding \nset of Federal employees. You cannot do it with ever-expanding \nregulations--although some of them are important. All of these things \nmay be important, but you can't do it with those concepts. The only way \nyou can do it is to get in and take the whole budget and work with both \nsides and see what we can do to bring people together and see if we \nhave the courage to resolve these problems, not only for today but for \nour kids and grandkids, and, in my case, great-grandkids as well, \nhereafter.\n  I don't want the President to fail, but I have to point these things \nout. Let's face it, he is getting some very poor advice. Even when he \nwants to come to the center he gets rapped hard on the knuckles by the \nfar left of his party, most of whom are far left, as least those here \non the floor.\n  There are very few moderates on the Democratic side. I found most of \nthe people who are moderates are moderate when their vote doesn't \ncount. I think if you go back and look at the record you will find that \nto be true. The vast majority of our friends on the other side believe \nwe should keep spending, keep taxing, and that will keep them in power. \nBut all the power in the world doesn't count if we are wrecking the \ngreatest country in the world.\n  I think our side has to wake up a little bit, too. We can't just do \nit with tax cuts either. On the other hand, I would rather have tax \ncuts that spur on the economy and create small business jobs than \ncontinue to spend us into oblivion.\n  Nevertheless, we are all going to have to work together if we are \never to get this problem solved. The only way I know to solve it is \nthrough Presidential leadership combined with courage on the part of \nMembers of Congress.\n  But what they are pursuing with this budget is pathetic. There are so \nmany budgetary gimmicks in this bill that it is plain pathetic. I will \nrepeat what I said earlier; that is, the little over a trillion \ndollars, $1.1 trillion, in deficit reduction this budget will achieve \nover 10 years is barely $100 billion a year.\n\n[[Page S659]]\n\nThe total proposed deficit reduction is not even as much as our deficit \nfor this year alone. During those 10 years, there will be hundreds of \nbillions, if not trillions, of dollars of additional deficits until we \nreach a point, in about 2022, where we will be around $22 trillion in \ndebt.\n  I do not know about you, Mr. President, or anybody else in this \nChamber, but I think it is time for us to start standing up. I think it \nis time for the President to lead. I think the Democrats who have \ncontrol of the bureaucracy ought to start working with us on to get \nthat bureaucracy trimmed down. Let's consider the one aspect of \nconstitutional politics that has worked; that is, allowing 50 States to \nparticipate, and through 50 State laboratories we can pick and choose \nthe things that work best. Had we done that with health care, we would \nnot be in the mess health care is today, and the oblivion it is headed \nfor.\n  We cannot fix this deficit problem with tax increases. Frankly, my \nexperience has been that tax increases do not work. What does work is \ngiving the small business sector incentives, real incentives, not \n``investments'' but real incentives to keep creating the 70 percent of \njobs that only the small business sector can do.\n  If we increase those taxes, we are going to be in a mess. I can tell \nyou, the budgeteers at OMB and CBO, as sincere and dedicated as they \nmay be--I like Mr. Lew very much, and I think Mr. Elmendorf is a very \nfine budgeteer and economist--are always low in their estimates of \ndeficits. It could be much worse than what we know right now. I hope we \nwill have the guts, I hope the President will have the guts to lead, \nand I hope we would have the guts to follow that lead, and hopefully \nturn this ship of state around.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I want to talk on Essential Air Service, \nbut I do want to make a couple of comments after hearing my colleague \nfrom the other side talk about the budget. I want to assure him, there \nare some moderates over here who understand the value and the managing \nof the budget. If someone comes from Alaska, you know we support gun \nrights, oil and gas drilling, we support a lot of things as Democrats \nthat the Senator may not be aware of.\n  But the other thing is, leadership is about all of us working \ntogether. I look for the President's budget, but that does not mean we \nare going to sit here and wait for him to make all of the decisions. We \nhave a responsibility here. I know last year, I sat here and voted for \nthe Sessions-McCaskill amendment that would have reduced some of the \nspending, controlled some of the spending. We could not get all of the \nvotes on the other side to make it happen.\n  I supported every dime that came back from the TARP repayment to go \nto pay off the deficit, which now we are close to 80 percent or better \nof that money coming back, maybe as much as 90 percent. I supported the \nGregg and Wyden legislation, a bipartisan effort to deal with tax \nreform to get corporate rates from the second highest in the world back \nto about midstream; lowering the six individual rates down to three \nrates; making it simplified so people can fill out their taxes on one \nform, and getting rid of a bunch of loopholes.\n  It is the combination of all of us that will create leadership. It is \nnot one person; it is not one President. It is Republicans and \nDemocrats and Independents sitting on the floor making tough decisions, \nnot a bunch of political speeches. Let me end there and get to the \ntopic I wanted to talk about. At some point I will come down here and \ntalk about the budget as it is rolled out. I know on the Budget \nCommittee we will have plenty of presentations on that.\n  I came down here to talk about Essential Air Service. I want to thank \nChairman Rockefeller and Senator Hutchison for their leadership on this \nvery important bill. They have worked tirelessly to pass this bill in \nthe 111th Congress, and they are again putting in long hours on it this \nyear.\n  The bill before the Senate is an incredibly important piece of \nlegislation. The FAA bill is about creating jobs. It puts Americans to \nwork rebuilding our Nation's deteriorating airport infrastructure. It \nmodernizes our air traffic control system to reduce congestion in the \nskies, and it makes our Nation's air space safer and more efficient.\n  There are so many important reasons why we should succeed in passing \nthis legislation, which passed the Senate 93 to 0 last year. Even in a \nyear that was marked with contentious and partisan battles, this FAA \nbill was truly a bipartisan piece of legislation, and this can largely \nbe credited to the hard work of Chairman Rockefeller, Senator \nHutchison, and their staffs.\n  This bill has been delayed far too long. We are currently on the 17th \nshort-term extension since the last comprehensive FAA bill expired in \n2007. We owe it to the American people to help reduce airport delays, \nput Americans back to work, and provide the 21st century air space our \nNation needs to facilitate commerce and compete in a world economy.\n  This bill is especially important for States such as mine. Aviation \nis the lifeblood of Alaska. It is truly our highway in the sky. We have \nsix times more pilots and 16 times more planes per capita than the rest \nof the country. In Alaska small planes are the equivalent of minivans \nin the lower 48. They are how Alaskans get around.\n  I wish to talk briefly about the Essential Air Service Program, which \nis vital to my constituents. My friend from Arizona has introduced an \namendment which would repeal the Essential Air Service Program. I truly \nhave grave concerns for what this would mean, not only for my rural \nAlaskans but for rural Americans as a whole.\n  The Essential Air Service Program originated at the same time as \nairline deregulation in 1978. When airline deregulation passed, it gave \nairlines almost total freedom to determine which markets to serve \ndomestically and what fares to charge for that service. This is not a \nbad thing. Some good things came out of airline deregulation. It \nfostered competition among airlines. It brought down ticket prices for \nmany air routes between large urban centers.\n  But when Congress passed airline deregulation, it also recognized \nthat something needed to be done to protect rural communities. They \nwere not the most profitable routes for air carriers, so the idea was \nto maintain a minimum level of service. That is where the Essential Air \nService Program came in. The program provided modest subsidies to air \ncarriers to provide service to communities that would have otherwise \nlost all air service through deregulation. Since 1978, the Essential \nAir Service Program has successfully guaranteed small communities that \nwere served by certified air carriers before deregulation that this \nwould maintain a minimum level of scheduled air service. The program \nhas been a vital link for rural America.\n  There are very real consequences to eliminating this program for my \nconstituents, especially in the 44 communities served by the EAS \nProgram. Let me show you this poster. This poster shows Alaska's \nlimited road infrastructure. Eighty-two percent of Alaska's communities \nare not on the road system and rely on aviation as a primary means of \ntransportation, for goods, people, mail. It all has to come by \naircraft. Let me not confuse those who are watching. We did not \noversize the State of Alaska. Alaska does not sit down here by \nCalifornia or in a little box somewhere. This is actually the size of \nAlaska in comparison to the lower 48.\n  The red lines show the road network. You can imagine the road network \nthat would be shown in the lower 48. But this is all of the road \nnetwork we have. So for the rest of the State it is by air or boat. \nPeople in communities face some of the highest costs of living in the \ncountry. Rural Alaskans cannot drive to a Safeway when they need \nsomething. There are no roads, and there are no Safeways. If you \neliminate the EAS Program, it is going to drive these prices even \nhigher in rural Alaska.\n  Gary Williams, from the village of Kake, sent me a letter about what \nthe McCain amendment would mean for his community. By the way, the EAS \nensures Kake receives at least three weekly flights from a small Cessna \n208 aircraft during the winter. Again, this is not a jetliner. Maybe in \nAlaska we think a Cessna 208 is a jetliner, but that is a very small \nplane.\n\n[[Page S660]]\n\n  Gary Williams in Kake says:\n\n       I frankly cannot imagine being without service. It would \n     isolate and cripple us on many levels.\n\n  In addition to eliminating the only source of transportation for many \ncommunities, Senator McCain's amendment would actually put people out \nof work. It would hurt small businesses in Alaska and across this \ncountry. It is truly a job-killing amendment.\n  I wish to read from a letter my office received from the owner of \nPenAir. PenAir is a family-owned business, started in 1955 by a young \n19-year-old teenager named Orin Seybert. When Orin started his business \nin 1955, he had a two-seat Taylorcraft and a four-seat Piper Tri-Pacer. \nOrin is a great example of the pioneering spirit that embodies Alaska. \nOver the years Orin grew the business into a successful regional air \ncarrier, serving communities throughout rural Alaska. PenAir is now run \nby Orin's son Danny. This is a letter from Danny Seybert, the president \nof PenAir:\n\n       For many of these communities, PenAir is the only scheduled \n     passenger air service link to the rest of the world.\n\n  He goes on to say if the McCain amendment is passed, it:\n\n     would have a devastating effect on many remote communities in \n     Alaska, on many air carriers who provide those communities \n     with air transportation services, and on Alaska's economy.\n\n  Here is an e-mail my office received from the Copper Valley Air \nService. Copper Valley flies two EAS routes serving the communities of \nMcCarthy and May Creek. The e-mails read:\n\n       If this amendment is approved, it will put Copper Valley \n     Air Service out of business. It will cost eight jobs. This \n     cannot pass.\n\n  This is an e-mail from Bruce Phillips, the chief pilot of Wings of \nAlaska: Repealing EAS would ``not only diminish jobs and raise costs, \nbut also potentially abolish air service to some communities entirely. \nVillages in Southeast Alaska have no roads and limited, if any, ferry \nservice making air service a lifeline. This is how they receive \neverything from medication to mail to groceries as well as how they \ntravel for medical, personal and business.''\n  I have got a stack of these letters that my office has received in \nthe past few days from communities that would lose air service if the \nMcCain amendment is adopted, from individuals in the communities who \nare terrified about what this would mean for the price of goods in \ntheir communities, from those worried about the cost of air travel if \nthey get sick and they need to seek medical attention at a hospital, \nand from small air carriers worried that they will either have to lay \noff employees or go under altogether.\n  I ask unanimous consent that some of these letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Norton Sound Health Corporation,\n\n                                       Nome, AK, February 2, 2011.\n     Senator Mark Begich,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Begich: We are extremely concerned and worried \n     by Senator McCain's efforts to repeal EAS in Alaska. We know \n     that these efforts will more than double ticket prices within \n     rural Alaska. Just for our Materials Management department \n     alone we spent over $46,000 in freight from October 2009 to \n     October 2010. Norton Sound Health Corporations expenditures \n     for freight, company-wide exceed $250,000 for that same time \n     period.\n       We are asking you to please speak against the repeal of EAS \n     in Alaska. People in rural Alaska will be terribly affected \n     by the repeal if it passes. Recruitment and retention for \n     medical professional staff is dependent on our ability to fly \n     staff and household goods to our region. If passed, the \n     repeal will more than double the costs of transporting goods, \n     patients, critical service workers and will have an \n     insurmountable affect on an already challenged economic \n     situation in rural Alaska.\n       At Norton Sound Health Corporation we rely completely on \n     travel to provide critical patient access to and from our \n     villages. Air transport is the only way to bring patients \n     into Nome, our regional hub, and to Anchorage, when needed, \n     for appointments. We rely entirely on the Essential Air \n     Services for keeping the cost of transporting medicine and \n     supplies to an already exorbitant minimum.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Carol J. Piscoya,\n     President/CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              NANA Regional Corporation, Inc.,\n\n                                                 February 2, 2011.\n     Hon. Mark Begich,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Begich: I am writing you to express NANA \n     Regional Corporation's (NANA) opposition to Senate Amendment \n     4 to S. 223, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air \n     Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement Act, \n     which proposes elimination of the Essential Air Service (EAS) \n     program. Dismantling the EAS program will create an \n     unreasonable burden on rural Alaskans; further increasing the \n     already high cost of living, further limiting rural \n     residents' access to basic services, and potentially \n     increasing rural Alaska's already high rate of unemployment.\n       As you know, the majority of communities in Alaska are not \n     connected by any road system. Many of these communities are \n     surrounded by lands that are federally protected from basic \n     roadway transportation infrastructure or located in areas \n     where building bridges is not economically feasible. Weather \n     also limits transportation to many of these areas of the \n     state.\n       Air transportation is the only year-round means of \n     accessing most rural Alaska communities. Air freight brings \n     essentials supplies like food, home heating fuel, \n     transportation fuel, construction materials, vehicles, \n     medical supplies and other goods and services to our \n     villages. Even with EAS in place, the cost of air \n     transportation affects all aspects of rural Alaskans' lives, \n     affecting the consumer price of most goods. Transportation \n     costs dramatically affect the cost of living in Kotzebue, the \n     NANA region's hub village, where the cost of living is 61 \n     percent higher than Anchorage, Alaska's most urban city \n     located on a road system.\n       In addition to living costs, the cost of air transportation \n     affects rural Alaskans' ability to access basic services that \n     are available to urban Americans or Americans connected to a \n     road system. Air transportation is often the only access that \n     rural Alaskan's have to critical medical care that cannot be \n     supplied locally. Public safety is also affected by access to \n     air transportation. Many communities do not have local public \n     safety officers and, in the event of an incident, public \n     safety officers have to be flown into communities.\n       The EAS program exists to ensure rural communities have \n     access to air transportation services despite the fact that \n     they have a limited number of passengers to offer certain air \n     carriers. As you know, 45 communities in Alaska receive \n     financial support from the EAS program and with most of these \n     areas receiving guaranteed service, even if it is not \n     subsidized, because of the EAS program.\n       The EAS program has a profound economic affect on our \n     region and all of rural Alaska, creating reliable air service \n     and making air transportation affordable for most rural \n     Alaskans. Eliminating this essential program would create \n     further barriers to the success of the most rural reaches of \n     our state. Organizations in Alaska, including NANA, are \n     working hard to create viable rural economies. Eradicating \n     the EAS program would strike a significant blow to the \n     progress these organizations have been able to make.\n       It is important for citizens of the United States to have \n     reasonable access to the rest of the country. EAS guarantees \n     Alaskans, who are citizens of this great nation, the same \n     access afforded to Americans who live in areas of the country \n     where the federal government has spent trillions of dollars \n     to develop surface transportation alternatives. Preserving \n     the EAS program will ensure that our rural Alaska communities \n     are not forgotten as Congress and the federal government work \n     to improve our national economy. NANA supports the EAS \n     program and it is our hope that SA 4 to S. 223 will be \n     defeated.\n           Taikuu,\n                                                  Marie N. Greene,\n     President/CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Calista Corporation,\n\n                                  Anchorage, AK, February 1, 2011.\n     Re SB 223 Repealing Essential Air Service.\n\n     Senator Mark Begich,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Honorable Senator Begich: Senator McCain has introduced \n     amendments to bill S. 223, to modernize the air traffic \n     control system, improve safety, reliability, availability of \n     air transportation in the United States, provide air traffic \n     control modernization, reauthorize Federal Aviation \n     Administration, and repeal Essential Air Service subsidy \n     program (EAS). We strongly oppose any actions to repeal the \n     EAS program for the eligible communities for which it was \n     intended for.\n       The essential in EAS is just that: ``Essential'' to the \n     access, survival, and economy of isolated and rural \n     communities throughout America, as well as Alaska which do \n     not have alternatives:\n       The EAS program was intended for--and has successfully \n     kept--scheduled air service to those cities and rural Alaskan \n     communities that were served at the time of deregulation, \n     and, which would otherwise lose or have lost ALL air service \n     after the airline deregulation of 1978, and in any \n     anticipated subsequent and more recently poor market \n     conditions.\n       EAS ensures small communities served by air carriers before \n     the deregulation, can maintain minimal service to retain \n     their\n\n[[Page S661]]\n\n     link to the national air transportation system. It guarantees \n     air service even during: low passenger volumes; low \n     profitability to air carriers; less than ideal operating \n     conditions (great distances and remote areas, weather, and \n     mountainous terrain); and periods where air carriers will \n     simply leave for better, easier, and more profitable market \n     areas.\n       EAS provides and maintains stability to the National \n     Aviation Transportation System and network in America, by \n     ensuring the system is not overly modified or changed \n     suddenly, again simply due to carrier profitability in some \n     communities or areas at the expense of those smaller and less \n     profitable markets.\n       EAS keeps ticket prices to MANY smaller rural communities \n     down. As an example, even with EAS subsidies, ticket costs to \n     some communities can be over $1,100, such as Adak, Alaska, \n     and other cities ranging in population from 35,000 to a few \n     hundred. Nearly every community in Southeast Alaska depends \n     on EAS to receive jet and even any scheduled air service in \n     that area. Without EAS, ticket prices would more than DOUBLE \n     costs of air travel to RURAL communities throughout Alaska; \n     as well as in many cities throughout the U.S.\n       In Alaska, EAS provides funding subsidies to 44 of 300+ \n     communities, with 38 of those relying on aircraft as the \n     primary access and transport mode because there is NO other \n     transportation access alternative--they are completely \n     isolated from any roads.\n       The EAS program provides an average $285,559 community \n     subsidy in Alaska, as compared to the average subsidy in \n     other U.S. communities of $1,495,505. Other U.S. communities \n     actually have roads and other transportation mode options and \n     backup.\n       Unlike most parts of the U.S. with a long history of \n     infrastructure building and access to well established \n     National Transportation System roads, highways, railroads, \n     buses, ferries, and airports; Alaska is a new state and the \n     only state in the union where a majority (82 percent) of our \n     300+ remote communities are inaccessible and unlikely (due to \n     being largely or entirely surrounded by Federal wilderness, \n     preserves, park, and restricted lands) to ever become \n     accessible by roads! This problem was realized during the \n     original drafting, debates, and establishment of the EAS \n     program. Airports and airways in Alaska have had to by \n     necessity, had to serve as `highways' in order to provide \n     reliable, scheduled air service that would become essential \n     to the health, safety, economy, and literally survival of \n     people living in our state. We have 8 times the enplanements \n     and 39 times the freight per capita compared to the rest of \n     the U.S.; and aviation provides 1 in 10 jobs and is the 5th \n     largest employer in Alaska.\n       Even the smallest of air carriers often provides a full or \n     part time job in most communities they serve assisting with \n     schedules, passengers, and cargo; while, each runway and \n     airport also has an employee to maintain and operate the \n     smallest of facilities. Airport, carrier, and related service \n     positions provide critical jobs that help support the economy \n     and rural communities.\n       A better solution (rather than repeal an entire important \n     program such as EAS), would be updating the criteria utilized \n     for EAS eligibility; as well as, including consideration of \n     what nearby airports, carriers', and modes of transportation \n     communities have for access options to receive EAS program \n     funds.\n       In summary, complete elimination of EAS could destabilize \n     some small communities, would have an extremely negative \n     impact on the integrity of Alaska's interconnected aviation \n     system, and seriously reduce air service. EAS has been and \n     will continue to be critical for the aviation transportation \n     system network, provides important jobs, and enables access \n     for rural isolated communities across America.\n       Thank you for your attention and consideration to this \n     serious matter. Please do not hesitate to contact us with \n     questions, or if we can assist in defending this essential \n     program (907) 644-6309.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Christine Klein, AAE,\n     Executive Vice President & COO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Organized Village of Kake,\n\n                                       Kake, AK, February 1, 2011.\n     Re Essential Air Service to Rural Alaska.\n\n     Senator Mark Begich,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Begich: Our office received word late this \n     afternoon that was released by the Alaska Air Carriers \n     Association, reporting that a bill (or amendment to a bill) \n     is being introduced in the Senate for the repeal of the \n     Essential Air Service program. This program serves rural \n     areas throughout the U.S., including many areas in Alaska. \n     Further, we understand that you will be speaking tomorrow \n     against this bill; thus, we are providing this letter in the \n     hope that it can assist your efforts, and we are confident \n     similar efforts from Senator Murkowski and Congressman Young.\n       As fellow Alaskans, we all know the need to retain the \n     Essential Air Service program for our rural areas. Loss of \n     the program would be crippling to the many rural communities \n     that rely on it--its title so accurately describes its \n     function--it is ``essential'' to the health & welfare, \n     economy, education, and the list goes on and on. All of these \n     communities are an integral part of the fabric of Alaska and \n     we cannot let them be unjustly harmed, which would surely \n     occur if a necessity as basic as transportation is crippled.\n       Each community has a story, with many similar needs around \n     the State, and ample justification to retain the Essential \n     Air Service Program. Allow me to briefly share our situation, \n     with the hope that it can assist in the defense of this \n     important and essential program. The community of Kake is \n     located on an island in Southeast Alaska and is without road \n     access to other communities. We are extremely reliant on safe \n     and effective air service for basic transportation to/from \n     other cities for health care, business, education, pleasure, \n     etc.--essentially any goods or services that require a \n     transportation connection. In addition to passengers and \n     freight, reliable and daily delivery of U.S. mail to/from \n     Kake is critical for both business and personal. The reasons \n     for this necessary service to Kake are based on essential \n     requirements that will allow the community to function and \n     live in today's society--with an adequate number of daily \n     flights absolutely required to meet those needs.\n       Please feel free to contact our office for further \n     information and as always, thank you for your efforts on \n     behalf of our community and others around our great state.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Casimero A. Aceveda,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                       PenAir,\n\n                                  Anchorage, AK, February 1, 2011.\n     Re Essential Air Service in the State of Alaska.\n\n     Hon. Mark Begich,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Begich: I am President and Chief Executive \n     Officer of Peninsula Airways, Inc. (``PenAir''), the largest \n     commuter airline in Alaska with several hundred employees. \n     PenAir provides critical passenger, cargo, and mail services \n     to dozens of remote communities throughout southwestern \n     Alaska, from the Aleutian Islands in the west to Unalakleet \n     in the north, to our base at Anchorage in the east. For many \n     of these remote communities, PenAir is the only scheduled \n     passenger air service link to the rest of the world.\n       It has come to our attention that an amendment has been \n     proposed in the U.S. Senate to eliminate the federal \n     government's Essential Air Service (``EAS'') Program. Such an \n     amendment, if passed, would have a devastating effect on many \n     remote communities in Alaska, on many air carriers who \n     provide those communities with air transportation service, \n     and on Alaska's economy. Accordingly, PenAir respectfully \n     asks that you vigorously oppose any such amendment.\n       The EAS Program was established by the U.S. Congress to \n     ensure that smaller communities would retain a link to the \n     national air transportation system even if federal subsidies \n     were necessary to maintain such service. It is a particularly \n     important program for Alaska because, as you well know, the \n     federal government's ownership of lands in Alaska and the \n     limited access to those lands means that air transportation \n     is the only way to reach most rural communities in Alaska.\n       For its part, PenAir currently provides subsidized \n     essential air service to the remote communities of Akutan, \n     Atka, and Nikolski. Other small and large air carriers \n     provide subsidized air service to dozens of other communities \n     throughout Alaska.\n       Without the EAS Program and corresponding federal \n     subsidies, service to these remote Alaskan communities would \n     simply not be economically viable, and therefore these \n     services--including PenAir's scheduled Atka, Nikolski, and \n     Akutan service--would be discontinued. As a result, the \n     residents and businesses in these communities would lose \n     their only scheduled passenger air transportation service, \n     effectively cutting them off. PenAir would also be compelled \n     to reduce the ranks of its employees and its aircraft fleet \n     as its route network contracted with the discontinuation of \n     these essential air services. And, of course, with the loss \n     of these scheduled passenger air services and the jobs \n     associated with those services, Alaska's economy would suffer \n     greatly as well. In sum, the elimination or repeal of the EAS \n     Program would have devastating effects on the remote EAS \n     communities in Alaska that rely on these services and on the \n     air carriers that serve them.\n       PenAir therefore respectfully asks that you vigorously \n     oppose any such elimination or repeal of the EAS Program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Danny Seybert,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n       To Whom It May Concern: I would like to express my immense \n     concern over Senator McCain's amendment to bill 223 proposing \n     to repeal Essential Air Service. This would not only diminish \n     jobs and raise costs but also potentially abolish air service \n     to some communities entirely. Villages in Southeast Alaska \n     have no roads and limited, if any, ferry service making air \n     service a lifeline. This is how they receive everything from \n     medication to mail to groceries as well as how they travel \n     for medical, personal and business.\n       Air carriers cannot afford to personally subsidize service \n     into small communities whose population is not great enough \n     to support air service. Disruption in air service\n\n[[Page S662]]\n\n     will have deep reaching effects that are far removed from \n     simply loss of airline service, loss of airline service may \n     well affect the viability of some communities that we \n     presently serve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Bruce Phillips,\n     Chief Pilot.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  40-Mile Air,\n\n                                  Fairbanks, AK, February 1, 2011.\n       To Whom It May Concern: We serve two communities under an \n     Essential Air Service contract Then communities are in \n     remote, road less areas of Alaska. These communities, others \n     like them and businesses like ours will be economically \n     devastated if the Essential Air Service contract was to end.\n       Their ability to get essential things, like groceries and \n     medications will become very difficult and cost prohibitive. \n     I believe communities that do not have year round roads \n     should continue to receive Essential Air Service subsidies.\n       Thank you for your time and consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Leif Wilson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Alaska Airlines,\n\n                                    Seattle, WA, February 2, 2011.\n     Hon. Mark Begich,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Senator Begich: We are writing to express our concerns \n     regarding Senator McCain's proposed amendment to the pending \n     FAA reauthorization bill to repeal the Department of \n     Transportation's Essential Air Service program. Given the \n     vital importance of the EAS program to the state of Alaska, \n     we are opposed to any modifications to the program that in \n     any way affect EAS service in the state.\n       The EAS program is part of the critical transportation \n     infrastructure in the state of Alaska. On a statewide basis, \n     the EAS program provides compensation for service by 13 \n     carriers to 47 communities. Quite understandably, no other \n     state has comparable air service needs. Without it, many \n     parts of the state would suffer from lack of connectivity to \n     the larger cities within the state and beyond. Alaska \n     Airlines operates under two EAS agreements in the state of \n     Alaska, one to serve Adak and the other to serve the \n     Southeast Alaska communities of Cordova, Gustavus, Wrangell, \n     Petersburg and Yakutat. Under these agreements, we connect \n     these communities on a single-flight basis to our Anchorage, \n     Juneau and Seattle hubs, providing for both their passenger \n     and cargo needs. It also bears mentioning that, in enacting \n     EAS legislation, Congress recognized the state of Alaska's \n     special needs by providing that the EAS program would \n     uniquely cover cargo as well as passenger service in the \n     state. As you are very much aware, these EAS communities are \n     extremely remote and not accessible by road. Air service is \n     truly ``essential'' for them.\n       Alaska's air service to Adak and these Southeast Alaska \n     communities would simply not be economically feasible without \n     EAS compensation. Alaska Airlines, having provided EAS \n     service to these communities for decades, views its \n     relationship with them as extending well beyond a traditional \n     commercial airline relationship. The company readily \n     acknowledges its special continuing obligation to serve as \n     their vital transportation link to our hubs within the state \n     and beyond. The EAS program is critical to our ability to \n     provide such service.\n       We sincerely appreciate your support for the program and \n     respectfully encourage you to oppose Senator McCain's \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     W.

Mark Begich,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Begich: The Essential Air Services program \n     allows 45 communities in Alaska to be connected to life \n     sustaining services. Alaska is approximately \\1/3\\ of the \n     communities served under EAS contracts, however, expenses to \n     serve these 45 communities are less than 10% of the EAS \n     program.\n       Alaska has the largest aviation system in the US, which \n     includes 700 airports and 1,200 airstrips. Over 10,000 \n     aircraft are registered in the State of Alaska. These \n     aircraft are the backbone of transportation for the State. \n     Alaska is served by 304 certificated carriers, of which over \n     90% employ less than 10 employees.\n       Eighty-two percent of our communities are not accessible by \n     road and rely on air transport for all life sustaining goods \n     and services. Alaska's people travel by air eight times more \n     often per capita than those in rural areas of the Lower 48, \n     and ship 39 times more freight per capita--nearly one ton per \n     person per year.\n       Aviation in Alaska provides $3.5 billion to the State's \n     economy, is eight percent of the Gross State Product, and is \n     the fifth largest employer in the State, employing 10% of our \n     total workforce.\n       Since 1966 the Alaska Air Carriers Association (AACA) has \n     represented the interests of aviation businesses in Alaska. \n     AACA is a statewide organization representing over 150 \n     members. Our members meet the needs of the traveling public \n     and rural Alaskans by providing scheduled commuter travel, \n     on-demand air charter, cargo transport, mail delivery, \n     emergency medical evacuation, flight seeing, pilot training, \n     aircraft maintenance, parts sales, fuel sales, storage, \n     rental, and airline servicing.\n       Please help insure that the viability of communities in \n     Alaska and small businesses struggling to survive are not \n     unfairly swept away or categorized alongside communities on \n     road systems in the Lower 48.\n           Sincerely,\n     C. Joy Journeay,\n       Executive Director.\n     Gerard H. Rock,\n       President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Alaska Federation of Natives,\n\n                                 Anchorage, AK, February 13, 2011.\n     Re AFN Board Resolution 11-04, Supporting the Continued \n         Funding of Essential Air Services per S. 223.\n\n     Hon. Mark Begich,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Begich: On behalf of the Alaska Federation of \n     Natives (AFN), thank you for opposing the proposed McCain \n     amendment repealing Essential Air Services (EAS) as it \n     affects the air transportation services to communities in \n     rural Alaska. EAS is a program that was set in place when the \n     airline industry was deregulated, and it was intended to \n     provide a notice and subsidy when community (that had \n     regularly scheduled service as of 1978) received notice that \n     it would no longer receive regularly scheduled air service.\n       The significance of the EAS program in Alaska is that it \n     provides a vital link that connects, sustains, and maintains \n     our communities in rural Alaska. The communities that depend \n     on EAS would be effectively cut off from the rest of the \n     United States resulting in the cessation or decreased \n     delivery of mail, food, and fuel to most rural parts of the \n     United States, and particularly in rural Alaska, if the \n     McCain Amendment is enacted.\n       The attached AFN Board Resolution 11-04 was passed \n     unanimously by the Board of Directors of AFN in a duly called \n     meeting where a quorum was present. This resolution fully \n     supports your efforts on the floor of the U.S. Senate as the \n     U.S. Senate is considering S. 223. Keep up the good fight!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Julie E. Kitka,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            Resolution 11-04\n\n       Supporting the Continued Funding of Essential Air Service\n\n       Whereas: The U.S. Senate is considering S. 223 to \n     ``modernize the air traffic control system, improve the \n     safety, reliability, and availability of transportation by \n     air in the United States, provide for modernization of the \n     air traffic control system, reauthorize the Federal Aviation \n     Administration, and for other purposes;'' and\n       Whereas: Senator John McCain has proposed an amendment to \n     repeal Essential Air Service (EAS), and its repeal will \n     likely have a negative impact on air transportation and \n     communities in rural Alaska; and\n       Whereas: EAS provides a vital link that connects, sustains, \n     and maintains our communities; and\n       Whereas: Alaska is a vast state, with millions of acres of \n     wilderness and has few transportation options and ground \n     transportation is non-existent to most rural communities; and\n       Whereas: EAS is a program that was set in place when the \n     airline industry was deregulated, and it was intended to \n     provide a notice and subsidy when community (that had \n     regularly scheduled service as of 1978) received notice that \n     it would no longer receive regularly scheduled air service; \n     and\n       Whereas: The communities that depend on EAS would be \n     effectively cut off from the rest of the United States, which \n     would result in the cessation or decreased delivery of mail, \n     food, and fuel to the most rural parts of the United States; \n     and\n       Now therefore be it Resolved by the Board of Directors of \n     the Alaska Federation of Natives, That it conveys its thanks \n     and support to the Alaska Congressional Delegation for its \n     support and effort to maintain the Essential Air Service \n     (EAS) as it now exists and respectfully urges them to \n     continue to oppose any legislation repealing EAS as it \n     applies to Alaska.\n\n     Passed This Day, 10th of February 2011.\n                                                   Julia E. Kitka,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. It is easy to call this wasteful if you do not understand \nthe needs of rural communities. They do not have any other means of \ntransportation. When he introduced the amendment, my friend in Arizona \nsuggested that folks are bypassing Essential Air Service flights to \ndrive to a hub and the hub airports, where they can get cheaper fares \nto more destinations. Consider how that applies in my State. For the \ncommunity of Adak, in the Aleutian Islands, the connection to the \nnearest medium hub is Anchorage. I laugh a little bit, because I want \nto put this truly in perspective. It is almost 1,200 miles.\n\n[[Page S663]]\n\n  So if one wants to, as Senator McCain says, drive to the hub, they \ncan't do that because they are here. In order to get to here, they have \nto go by air or catch a boat, assuming the weather is good. So his \nanalysis that the people are just driving off to these hubs and \ncatching flights that are cheaper is inaccurate. He is unfamiliar, \nobviously, with what is going on in Alaska.\n  To put the number in perspective, it is about the same distance from \nLos Angeles to Houston, except, unlike Los Angeles and Houston, there \nare no roads between these two places.\n  I agree with Senator McCain that we need to do something to address \nour Nation's budget deficit. Before I started this conversation, I made \nsome comments on things I have done, and I will continue to work on \nthat. But I don't believe we should balance the Federal budget on the \nbacks of communities and people facing some of the highest costs of \nliving and the toughest conditions in the country, and that is exactly \nwhat the McCain amendment would do.\n  When Senator McCain introduced this amendment, he cited a July 2009 \nGAO report and suggested that the EAS has outlived its usefulness. I \nhave that very same report. Sometimes when people make speeches, they \nread selectively. I wish to go to page 2 of this report. There, the GAO \nsaid:\n\n       Our review focused on communities within the continental \n     United States--\n\n  We like to refer to them as the lower 48--\n\n     that received EAS subsidized service. We focused our review \n     on these communities because the requirements for communities \n     in Alaska are different than for communities in other states, \n     and airports outside the contiguous states are not \n     representative of the program in the rest of the country.\n\n  I can't speak for Senator McCain's constituents in the four \ncommunities in Arizona that receive Essential Air Service. Maybe the \nfolks of Kingman, Page, Prescott, and Show Low, AZ, who receive EAS \ndon't think it is necessary. I am not sure if Senator McCain has \nchecked with them; maybe that is how they feel. But I can speak for \nrural Alaskans who have contacted my office, who are terrified about \nthis amendment and what it would mean for their community, for their \nway of life, for the very health and well-being of their families. We \nare in the midst of a recovery from an economic collapse. It makes no \nsense to eliminate a valuable program that helps rural America and puts \nsmall business to work.\n  This amendment would take us in the wrong direction. I strongly urge \nmy colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         The President's Budget\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, each year the President presents a budget. \nIt is the beginning of the formal conversation about what next year's \nbudget will be, and each President presents their offering and their \nsuggestion. Then, of course, the House and the Senate have to try to \nreach an agreement as to what the actual budget will be. The President \nsuggests a bottom line in spending, and then the House and the Senate \nmake appropriations decisions within that bottom line.\n  Today, President Obama kicked off this conversation by presenting his \nbudget to America. He presented it at a time when he faces two very \nsignificant challenges: how to create more jobs and less debt. It is a \ntough balancing act because we know that to reduce the debt, we need to \nreduce spending. What the President reminds us is, let's not cut \nspending in areas that are critical for the growth of our economy and \nthe creation of good-paying jobs in America.\n  The unemployment rate is about 9 percent. Mr. President, 13.9 million \nAmericans are out of work. In Illinois, it is 9.3 percent, with 620,000 \npeople actively looking for jobs. Too many people want to work so they \ncan keep a roof over their heads but cannot find a job.\n  At the same time, though, we have a $14 trillion debt. I hope the \nPresiding Officer will forgive me for a little history because I think \nit is worth noting when we talk about the debt of America how we have \nreached the point we are at today.\n  The fact is, 10 years ago--10 years ago--when President William \nJefferson Clinton left office, the debt of America was $5 trillion. The \nPresident said to his successor, President George W. Bush: The budget \nis in surplus as I leave office. We are collecting more money than we \nare spending in Washington, and we project a $120 billion surplus in \nthe next fiscal year. Welcome to Washington, President Bush.\n  Now fast-forward 8 years later--the next transition, from President \nGeorge W. Bush to President Obama. What was the state of play? The \nnational debt was no longer $5 trillion; 8 years later, it was $12 \ntrillion--$12 trillion. President George W. Bush said to President \nObama: Welcome to Washington. I can't give you a surplus, but I can \ngive you a deficit of $1.2 trillion for the next fiscal year.\n  In 8 years, what a massive turn of events. How did we go from a $5 \ntrillion debt to a $12 trillion debt? How did we go from surplus to \ndeep deficit in 8 years? Well, you do it by waging two wars you do not \npay for, being the first President in history to call for tax cuts in \nthe middle of a war, and by creating programs, such as the Medicare \nprescription drug program, that are not paid for. Put those policies \ntogether, and you end up with the sorry state of affairs President \nObama inherited. Now that deficit has gone from $4 trillion to $14 \ntrillion because of the recession he inherited, and we are still \nstruggling to get out from this mountain of debt that was created \nduring the 8 years of the President George W. Bush administration and \ncontinues to this day.\n  So President Obama is trying to strike the right balance: How do you \nresponsibly go after a deficit that calls on us to borrow 40 cents for \nevery $1 we spend and at the same time not kill the economic recovery? \nSo he has tried to parse out those things that he thinks and I agree \nare critical for economic growth: education, innovation, and building \nAmerica's infrastructure. He has done it with this budget and I think \ndone it in a responsible way. He calls for freezing our spending for 5 \nyears, which will save us $400 billion off of the anticipated deficit, \nand he also talks about in the same period of time reducing the amount \nof money for domestic discretionary spending to a level, as a \npercentage of GDP, where it was under President Eisenhower back in the \n1950s. We understand there is more to do, but I think the President \nsets out on a course that is responsible. We will change it--we always \ndo--but I think the goals he has given us are worthy goals.\n  We know we have to act on our fiscal situation. I was appointed by \nthe majority leader to be a member of the President's deficit \ncommission. With Erskine Bowles, a former chief counsel to the \nPresident, and Alan Simpson, our former colleague in the Senate, our \nbipartisan Commission studied it for 10 months and came up with a \nproposal that we should deal with this budget deficit in a sensible \nway.\n  One of the things they suggested and I agreed with is, let's not cut \ntoo soon. If you cut too soon in some areas, you are going to spoil the \nrecovery, you are going to slow down the recovery. You have to make \nsure the investments are there that will help us build jobs.\n  Now, the House Republicans see things differently. They started \ncalling for cuts in spending and then were trumped within their own \nmembership to raise those cuts to a level of about $100 billion. Among \nthe things the House Republicans want to cut are the following: $74 \nmillion from the Small Business Administration at a time when small \nbusinesses are turning to the SBA for loans so they can stay in \nbusiness and hire more people; $1.4 billion from the clean water \nrevolving loan fund that local communities use for basic infrastructure \nso they have good, clean drinking water for the families in their \ncommunities; $600 million in TIGER II grants. These were grants that \nwent directly from Washington to local units of government--no \nmiddleman involved at any State capital--for\n\n[[Page S664]]\n\neconomic development. We need them in my State in communities such as \nPeoria and Moline. They also want to cut $2.5 billion from high-speed \nrail. That is a national project of significance that hires thousands \nof private sector employees who would be out of work if the House \nRepublicans have their way.\n  In education, the House Republicans would cut $1.1 billion from Head \nStart. How many people have to remind us if we don't intervene in the \nlives of small children from families at risk, that those kids, sadly, \nmay end up as poor students or worse. Head Start gives them a chance, \nand it is one of the first programs the Republicans called to cut.\n\n  They propose to cut $700 million from schools across America serving \ndisadvantaged students. They are going to have to lay off 10,000 \nteachers because of this House Republican cut.\n  House Republicans also call for an $845-per-student cut in Pell \ngrants for 8 million college students across America. There is a way \nfor us to make sure Pell grants are well spent, but cutting the \nassistance for these students will discourage some from the training \nand education they need to find a job in the future.\n  House Republicans propose to cut $1.5 billion from grants to States \nfor job training. Again, at a time when we need new skills, when many \npeople have lost a job to which they can never return, cutting this \nmoney could be very tragic.\n  Then, when it comes to research and development, I think the House \nRepublicans have lost their way. They want to cut $300 billion from the \nNational Science Foundation, cutting grants to researchers, teachers, \nand students across America.\n  They want to cut $1 billion from the National Institutes of Health. \nWhat are they thinking, to cut $1 billion in medical research funds \nfrom the National Institutes of Health? If there is ever an area where \nwe cannot lose our edge, not only for the good of humanity but for the \ngood of our own people, it is in medical research. That is one of the \nfirst areas the Republicans turn to, to cut $1 billion; and money from \nthe Office of Science at the Department of Energy, $1.1 billion. That \nis research for innovation in areas such as batteries for electric \nvehicles and other forms of clean energy, and that is clearly the \nfuture. What the Republicans want to cut, sadly, is too much in areas \nthat promise a better future for America. We can do better.\n  Government can't directly create jobs at the pace we need to get this \neconomy moving forward, but we can make the right investments. For \nexample, infrastructure. In Illinois, we need to make sure we invest in \nhigh-speed rail. I am glad our State was chosen. It is going to mean \nmore and more passenger service within our State, fewer cars on the \nhighway, more construction. Ultimately, it is a benefit to the \nenvironment. So high-speed rail is an important infrastructure \ninvestment.\n  Modernizing O'Hare Airport, not just for the flight times so they \nwill be more on time for arrivals and departures, but also for safety--\nthe modernization of O'Hare needs to continue.\n  We need to have safer roads and bridges.\n  We need broadband across Illinois and across America so small towns \nhave the same advantages as big cities.\n  We need to put money into Head Start for education.\n  We can do this. There is waste in this government to be cut. We can \nwork on that together and find it, but let's not eliminate the jobs of \nteachers whom we need so badly or the money for elementary and \nsecondary schools or grants for families and loans to help them put \ntheir kids through college, and worker training. These are things where \nthe President has the right priorities and, sadly, the House \nRepublicans do not. It is a sharp contrast. It is an important debate, \nand it is one we will hear on the floor of the Senate and the House in \nthe weeks ahead.\n  We can reduce our debt. I think the President is right. His budget \nwould reduce projected deficits by $1.1 trillion over the next 10 \nyears. He wants to freeze nonsecurity discretionary spending for 5 \nyears, and I think he has shown leadership in making that proposal. We \nneed to work with him to come up with a bipartisan plan that reaches \nour goal of reducing debt in America while still creating jobs.\n  I went through that exercise with the deficit commission. I didn't \nagree completely with their product, but I thought it was a move in the \nright direction and I joined the bipartisan group of 11 who supported \nit. The fiscal commission report was called the moment of truth, and it \nwas. With funding for the current fiscal year unresolved, with the next \nfiscal year looming, and with the debt ceiling within shouting \ndistance, this is a seminal moment for the fiscal and economic future \nof America.\n  I commend the President for his approach in the fiscal year 2012 \nbudget proposal. Just as America has faced down great challenges \nthroughout our history, we can do this too. We can meet the dual \nchallenges of more jobs and less debt. It takes leadership and \nconstructive activism and realism. Bringing those together, Democrats \nand Republicans can work together to make equally painful but important \npolitical sacrifices. It will take a lot of work, but we can do it if \nwe work together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Davila, of California, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Northern District of California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour \nof debate with respect to the nominations, with the time equally \ndivided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not use all my time. I do want to \nnote that by starting the week considering two of President Obama's \njudicial nominations, the Senate is building on the progress we began \nto make last week. With judicial vacancies in this country remaining \nover 100, nearly half of them judicial emergencies, the Senate's action \non the two outstanding nominees we will consider is much needed. I \nthank the majority leader for scheduling the time. I thank the \nRepublican leader for his cooperation.\n  James Graves of Mississippi is a justice of the Mississippi Supreme \nCourt and has been a judge in Mississippi for 20 years. President Obama \nhas nominated Justice Graves to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on \nthe Fifth Circuit. When he is confirmed, he will be the first African \nAmerican from Mississippi to serve on the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  Edward Davila has been a California State trial judge for 10 years. \nFor 20 years before his service on the bench, he was a deputy public \ndefender and worked in private practice. President Obama nominated \nJudge Davila to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the Northern \nDistrict of California.\n  Both of these nominations were reported unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee this year. Both also had been reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously last year. We have reported them out twice \nunanimously. It is time now to vote on them. They were among the 19 \njudicial nominees we voted out unanimously and were ready to be \nconfirmed by the Senate last year before we adjourned. When there was \nobjection to proceeding last year, the vacancies persisted, the \nPresident had to renominate them and\n\n[[Page S665]]\n\nthe Judiciary committee had to reconsider their nominations. We passed \nthem out unanimously from the committee. I expect the Senate will \nconfirm both tonight and will do so unanimously.\n  Both have the support of their home State Senators. I will begin with \nJustice Graves. Both Senator Cochran and Senator Wicker have worked \nwith the President and me in connection with the nomination of Justice \nGraves. Both have been enthusiastic in their support of Justice Graves. \nThe Governor of Mississippi, Governor Barbour, came up to me a few days \nago at an event and urged me to move forward with the nomination of \nJustice Graves. I told him I have been ready to move forward on this \nnomination since last year. This is an example of a nominee with \nbipartisan support. Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer have worked \nwith the President and with me in connection with the nomination of \nJudge Davila.\n  I hope the votes we had last week and the votes we are having tonight \nsignal the return to regular order that I have been seeking for months. \nNominees who have been voted out unanimously by every Republican and \nevery Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee ought to be brought up \nfor a vote on the Senate floor without unnecessary delays. My \nexperience over the last 37 years is that when you have nominations \nlike these, they almost always also go through unanimously in the full \nSenate. These are two of the eight judicial nominees unanimously \nreported by the Judiciary Committee who are ready for final \nconsideration and final action by the Senate. I hope the other six \njudicial nominations to fill vacancies in Georgia, California, North \nCarolina, and the District of Columbia will all be considered before \nthe President's Day recess.\n  As I indicated before, when these two nominees are confirmed, there \nwill still be 100 Federal judicial vacancies around the country. That \nis too many, and they have persisted for too long. If you are a \nlitigant and trying to get a case heard, you do not care whether your \njudge was nominated by a Republican or a Democratic President, you just \nwant to make sure there is a judge there so your case can be heard. All \nover the country, however, people cannot get their cases heard because \nof the judicial vacancies.\n  That is why Chief Justice Roberts, Attorney General Holder, White \nHouse Counsel Bob Bauer, and many others, including the President of \nthe United States, have spoken out and urged the Senate to act. That is \nwhy the front page story in the Washington Post last Tuesday bore the \nheadline: ``Vacancies on Federal Bench Hit Crises Point.'' As that \nreport stated, vacancies are ``increasing workloads dramatically and \ndelaying trials in some of the Nation's Federal courts.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my statement a copy of the Washington Post report \non the judicial vacancies crises.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, nearly one in eight Federal judgeships \nacross our Nation--east to west, north to south--are vacant. That puts \nat risk, as I mentioned earlier, the ability of all Americans to get a \nfair hearing in court. The real price for these unnecessary delays \nfalls upon judges who are already overburdened with cases, unable to \nput the time into them they should, and the American people who depend \non our courts, and are being denied hearings and justice in a timely \nfashion.\n  Regrettably, the progress we made during the first two years the Bush \nadministration has not been duplicated and the progress we made over \nthe eight years from 2001 to 2009 to reduce judicial vacancies from 110 \nto a low of 34 was reversed. The vacancy rate we reduced from 10 \npercent at the end of President Clinton's term to less than four \npercent in 2008 has now risen back to over 10 percent. In contrast to \nthe sharp reduction in vacancies during President Bush's first 2 years \nin office, when the Democratically-controlled Senate confirmed 100 of \nhis judicial nominations, only 60 of President Obama's judicial \nnominations were allowed to be considered and confirmed during his \nfirst two years in office. We have not kept up with the rate of \nattrition, let alone brought the vacancies down. Judges die and judges \nretire and there are additional vacancies created all the time. By now, \nthose vacancies should have been cut in half. Instead, they continue to \nhover above 100.\n  I believe the Senate can do better. In fact, I believe the Senate has \nto do better. The Nation cannot afford further delays in the Senate \ntaking action on the nominations pending before it. Judicial vacancies \non courts throughout the country hinder the Federal judiciary's ability \nto fulfill its constitutional role. They create a backlog of cases that \nprevents people from having their day in court. That is unacceptable.\n\n  We can consider and confirm this President's nominations to the \nFederal bench in a timely manner. President Obama has worked with \nDemocratic and Republican home state Senators to identify superbly \nqualified consensus nominations. None of the nominations on the \nExecutive Calendar are controversial. Half of them have Republican home \nstate Senators who support them, like the nomination of Justice Graves \nwe consider today. All have a strong commitment to the rule of law and \na demonstrated faithfulness to the Constitution.\n  I want to thank Senator Grassley, the Judiciary Committee's ranking \nmember, and all the members of the Judiciary Committee for working with \nme at the start of this Congress to establish a fair and timely \nschedule for holding confirmation hearings and considering nominations \nin committee.\n  Again, I would note that during President Bush's first term, in his \nfirst four tumultuous years in office, we proceeded to confirm 205 of \nhis judicial nominations. We confirmed 100 of those during the 17 \nmonths when I was chairman during President Bush's first two years in \noffice. Democrats were in charge and I was the chairman. So we have \nshown that we are willing to cooperate. In contrast, now in President \nObama's third year in office, the Senate has only been allowed to \nconsider 65 of his Federal circuit and district court nominees. We \nremain well short of the benchmark we set during the Bush \nadministration. We have to do better. When we approach it, we can \nreduce vacancies of historically high levels at which they have \nremained throughout these first three years of the Obama administration \nto the historically low level we reached toward the end of the Bush \nadministration.\n  The nominations we consider today both demonstrate President Obama's \ncommitment to working with home state Senators to select well qualified \nnominees. Justice Graves, nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on the \nFifth Circuit, is currently the only African American on the \nMississippi Supreme Court. When confirmed, he will be the first African \nAmerican from Mississippi to serve on the Fifth Circuit and only the \nsecond African American in the circuit's history. His confirmation will \nbe a significant milestone after years of broken promises.\n  President Obama's commitment to increase diversity on the Federal \nbench helps ensure that the words ``equal justice under law,'' \ninscribed in Vermont marble over the entrance to the Supreme Court, is \na reality and that justice is rendered fairly and impartially. I thank \nSenator Cochran and Senator Wicker for their strong support of the \nnomination of Justice Graves. His nomination received a rating of \nunanimously well qualified from the ABA's Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary, its highest possible rating. He will make an \nexcellent addition to the Fifth Circuit.\n  Judge Davila has been nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on the \nNorthern District of California. Currently a judge on the Superior \nCourt of California, Judge Davila previously spent 20 years as a trial \nlawyer, first as a deputy public defender in the Santa Clara County \nPublic Defender's Office and then as a lawyer in private practice. He \nalso has taught trial advocacy course sessions at Stanford Law School, \nSanta Clara University School of Law, and the University of San \nFrancisco School of Law. If confirmed, Judge Davila will become the \nfirst Latino to take the Federal bench in the Bay Area in more than 15 \nyears. He has the strong support of his two home state Senators, \nSenator Feinstein and\n\n[[Page S666]]\n\nSenator Boxer. I am glad his nomination will finally be considered by \nthe Senate.\n  I have often said that the 100 of us in the Senate stand in the shoes \nof over 300 million Americans. We owe it to them to do our \nconstitutional duty of voting on the President's nominations to be \nFederal judges. We owe it to them to make sure that hard-working \nAmericans are able to have their cases heard in our Federal courts.\n  Again, I commend both the majority leader and the Republican leader \nfor moving forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my \ntime and my voice.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 8, 2011]\n\n            Federal Judicial Vacancies Reaching Crisis Point\n\n                 (By Jerry Markon and Shailagh Murray)\n\n       Federal judges have been retiring at a rate of one per week \n     this year, driving up vacancies that have nearly doubled \n     since President Obama took office. The departures are \n     increasing workloads dramatically and delaying trials in some \n     of the nation's federal courts.\n       The crisis is most acute along the southwestern border, \n     where immigration and drug cases have overwhelmed court \n     officials. Arizona recently declared a judicial emergency, \n     extending the deadline to put defendants on trial. The three \n     judges in Tucson, the site of last month's shooting rampage, \n     are handling about 1,200 criminal cases apiece.\n       ``It's a dire situation,'' said Roslyn O. Silver, the \n     state's chief judge.\n       In central Illinois, three of the four judgeships remain \n     vacant after two of President Obama's nominees did not get a \n     vote on the Senate floor.\n       Chief Judge Michael McCuskey said he is commuting 90 miles \n     between Urbana and Springfield and relying on two 81-year-old \n     ``senior'' judges to fill the gap. ``I had a heart attack six \n     years ago, and my cardiologist told me recently, `You need to \n     reduce your stress,' '' he said. ``I told him only the U.S. \n     Senate can reduce my stress.''\n       Since Obama took office, federal judicial vacancies have \n     risen steadily as dozens of judges have left without being \n     replaced by the president's nominees. Experts blame \n     Republican delaying tactics, slow White House nominations and \n     a dysfunctional Senate confirmation system. Six judges have \n     retired in the past six weeks alone.\n       Senate Republicans and the White House are vowing to work \n     together to set aside the divisions that have slowed \n     confirmations, and the Senate on Monday approved Obama \n     nominees for judgeships in Arkansas, Oregon and Texas. Eight \n     more nominees are expected to receive votes in the coming \n     weeks.\n       If the backlog eases, Obama will have the chance to appoint \n     dozens of judges who might gradually reverse what many \n     consider a conservative drift in the lower federal courts \n     under the George W. Bush administration.\n       Even with Obama's difficulties in the past two years, his \n     appointees have given Democrats control of two of the \n     nation's 13 federal circuits, including the influential U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit in Richmond, long a \n     conservative bastion.\n       And about three-fourths of his appointees have been women \n     or minorities, a historically high rate aimed at diversifying \n     a judiciary that is made up of nearly 60 percent white men.\n       ``It's fair to say that the Obama administration has had an \n     impact on the federal courts and that at the end of this \n     Congress, I believe that impact will be reinforced,'' said \n     Sheldon Goldman, an expert on judicial selection at the \n     University of Massachusetts at Amherst.\n       Obama's opportunity is brief, however, because the \n     presidential election season will ramp up by next year. And \n     even with the current promises of bipartisanship, Senate \n     rules allow individual senators to hold up nominations.\n       There are now 101 vacancies among the nation's 857 district \n     and circuit judgeships, with 46 classified as judicial \n     emergencies in which courts are struggling to keep up with \n     the workload. At least 15 more vacancies are expected this \n     year, according to the administrative office of the U.S. \n     Courts. When Obama took office in 2009, 54 judgeships were \n     open.\n       Most of the departing jurists have taken what is known as \n     senior status--A semi-retirement in which they receive full \n     pay but can take a reduced workload and are not considered \n     active members of the court. But court officials say the \n     increased work, heavier caseloads and lack of pay increases \n     are prompting more judges to leave the bench entirely.\n       The effect is most visible in civil cases, with delays of \n     up to three years in resolving discrimination claims, \n     corporate disputes and other lawsuits.\n       ``Ultimately, I think people will lose faith in the rule of \n     law,'' said Alex Kozinski, chief judge of the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the 9th Circuit in California. ``We as a nation \n     believe that if you have a dispute, you go to court and \n     within a reasonable period of time, you get a decision.''\n       Kozinski, who oversees the federal court in the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. \n     territory, said the government has spent at least $250,000 to \n     fly visiting judges to the island of Saipan, where the sole \n     judge retired last year.\n       In Arizona, the number of criminal cases has increased 65 \n     percent since 2008, while three of the 13 federal judgeships \n     are vacant. Former chief judge John M. Roll was working on \n     the judicial emergency declaration when he was killed during \n     last month's shootings in Tucson.\n       Beyond the practical need for judges, the political stakes \n     are high. The vast majority of federal cases are dispensed \n     through the district and circuit courts of appeal, with the \n     Supreme Court hearing fewer than 100 cases each year.\n       And control of the influential appellate courts tends to \n     shift with the party in power: By the time Bush left office, \n     his appointees had given Republican nominees a majority of \n     about 56 percent on those bodies.\n       Party affiliation is not a perfect predictor of a judge's \n     behavior, but studies have shown that Democratic and \n     Republican nominees vote differently on some ideologically \n     charged issues, such as abortion, gay rights and capital \n     punishment.\n       When Obama took office, experts predicted he would flip the \n     Republican appellate court majority in his first term. But in \n     2009 and 2010, the administration nominated 103 district and \n     circuit judges, compared with 129 during Bush's first two \n     years and 140 in President Bill Clinton's first two years, \n     said Russell Wheeler, a Brookings Institution scholar who \n     studies federal courts.\n       White House counsel Bob Bauer attributed the slow start to \n     the administration's large legislative agenda, two time-\n     consuming Supreme Court vacancies and an increasingly \n     complicated background review process for nominees.\n       ``We have made progress,'' Bauer added, pointing out that \n     the pace of nominees picked up significantly last year. But \n     those nominees faced a tough road in the Senate, as \n     Republicans repeatedly exercised their right to ``hold over'' \n     nominees before sending them to the floor.\n       The 60 nominees confirmed in Obama's first two years in \n     office made up the lowest number in 35 years, according to \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n       Still, Obama has been putting his stamp on the courts. When \n     he took office, Democratic appointees had small majorities on \n     two appeals courts--the New York-based 2nd Circuit and the \n     9th Circuit. Obama's nominees have also given Democrats \n     control of the 4th Circuit and the 3rd Circuit, which covers \n     Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware.\n       The 4th Circuit is an influential voice on national \n     security and one of the appellate courts expected to hear \n     challenges to the health-care overhaul law. It has a 9-5 \n     Democratic majority, because of four Obama appointees.\n       ``That's almost unimaginable,'' said Curt Levey, executive \n     director of the conservative Committee for Justice. ``When I \n     first went to law school, that was the one circuit you knew \n     was conservative.''\n       If the Senate approves the 48 pending White House judicial \n     nominations, the circuits would be about evenly divided \n     between Democratic and Republican nominees, according to \n     Wheeler's analysis. ``This Congress has the power to shift \n     the balance rather substantially,'' he said.\n       Saying the courts face ``a severe problem,'' Bauer vowed \n     that the White House will move nominees ``at a very steady \n     clip. . . . We will use all the resources at our disposal to \n     bring attention to the issue and work on a bipartisan \n     basis.''\n       Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and Minority \n     Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) struck a ``gentleman's \n     agreement'' in January to quash many of the procedural \n     tactics that have slowed nominations.\n       ``We'll be discussing with Senator Reid how to begin moving \n     them in an orderly fashion,'' said Don Stewart, a spokesman \n     for McConnell.\n       Liberal groups, which have blasted what they call \n     Republican obstructionism and pushed the White House to focus \n     more on judges, said this year will be key.\n       ``This is really a critical time for the legacy this \n     president will be able to create on the federal judiciary,'' \n     said Marge Baker, an expert on judicial selection at People \n     for the American Way. ``We have an opportunity now, and we \n     have to take advantage of it.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont, and I \nwill be very brief.\n  I know today the President has put forth the administration's \nproposal on the budget, and a lot of people on both sides of the aisle \nhave spent a tremendous amount of time over the course of this last \nyear----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the Senator yield for a moment? I assume the Senator \nis speaking on the time reserved for the Republican side.\n  Mr. CORKER. That is correct, Mr. President, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Vermont for being so fastidious.\n  Back to what I was talking about. I know a lot of people on both \nsides of the aisle have spent a great deal of time looking at ways for \nus to lessen, if not close, the tremendous amount of\n\n[[Page S667]]\n\nthe deficit we have in this country. I think everybody understands what \na threat this is to our economic security--candidly, to, I believe, our \nnational security--and I think many of us have paid close attention to \nwhat has happened to other countries in this type of situation. There \nis a strong sense on both sides of the aisle, and becoming even \nstronger, that this is an issue we as a country have to deal with.\n  What is unique about the issue of this fiscal deficit our country has \nis that it is something totally within our hands. In other words, we \ncan deal with this. This is not like some of the situations we deal \nwith in Afghanistan or other places, where it takes others, if you \nwill, working with us to ensure our efforts there are successful. This \nis something we as a Congress can solve. Again, the economy requires \nprivate sector investment and people doing work outside of this body to \ncreate the kind of prosperity we would like to see. But this is totally \nwithin our control.\n  So, Mr. President, I really do try to look at the bright side of \nthings. On the other hand, I was disappointed to see the President's \nbudget today and the lack of urgency that was displayed there and the \nlack of concern. I think what that means for those of us in this body \nand in the House who are going to have to--as we should--deal with this \nissue, it is much more difficult when dealing with a national crisis \nnot to have the administration pulling along with you. It is my hope, \neven though I think the President did miss an opportunity to lead on \nthis issue, that over the course of the next several months he will \ncome to the table and deal with this issue in a responsible way with \nboth the House and Senate.\n  I know the House is wrestling with these issues right now. My guess \nis that by the time they get ready for recess this weekend, they will \nsend over something that deals with some cuts in discretionary \nspending. I think we all know we have to deal with the entire budget if \nwe are actually going to make the type of headway all of us know needs \nto be made. But I do hope what we will do this spring, early on, is go \nahead and vote to pass on some very large reductions in spending. I \nhope we will pass something like the Cap Act that Claire McCaskill and \nI have cosponsored, which takes us from where we are in spending \nrelative to our country's economic output down to the 40-year average.\n  I would think most people in this body would consider that to be a \nreasonable approach over a 10-year period that would be a straitjacket \non Congress to ensure that we actually make those cuts. So those are \ntwo steps that need to occur, and it is my hope the administration, \nafter putting forth what has been put forth, will join us in this \neffort.\n  Mr. President, I think all of us know that in order to deal with the \nbig issues of this country, it is going to take the executive branch, \nthe House, and the Senate. We have divided government, but this is a \nperfect opportunity for us, as a country, to deal with this huge issue \nthat threatens certainly the future of the young people sitting before \nme, but threatens our country's economic security and our national \nsecurity.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank you for the time. I hope all of us will \ndeal with this budget in a serious, sober, and responsible manner. I \nthink we have several months over which we have a tremendous \nopportunity to come together and do the right thing as it relates to \nour country's economic and fiscal situation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the order right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently debating two \nnominations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is it appropriate that I speak on one of those \nnominations but also make some comments about the budget?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very happy today to know that we are \nabout to cast a vote on Edward Davila, nominee for the U.S. District \nCourt for the Northern District of California. This is a wonderful \nnominee, and he deserves this up-or-down vote. I am convinced he is \ngoing to get an overwhelming vote, and I am going to speak to that in a \nmoment. But the Senator from Tennessee was critical of President \nObama's budget, and I wanted to just make a response to that.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is not the only Republican to criticize \nPresident Obama's budget. They are all reading out of the same \nplaybook. I just have to say that while no one agrees with everything \nin that budget--I certainly don't--the basis of the budget is critical, \nand this is the basis of the budget: The President is addressing the \ndeficit in a very responsible way--freezing domestic discretionary \nspending--very tough, very tough--cutting billions and billions and \nbillions of dollars of red ink while not jeopardizing the economic \nrecovery that we are in the midst of.\n  To me, it is very interesting because I had the privilege of being in \nthis body the last time we balanced the budget. As far as I know, I \ndon't recall any Republicans voting for Bill Clinton's budget. Maybe \nthere were one or two, I don't recall. But that budget was in balance \nand we went into surplus. Frankly, we learned how to do it then.\n  What did we learn? We learned that when we are facing a crisis like \nthis--a budget deficit that is growing too fast and an economic \nrecovery that we don't want to disrupt--we have to be responsible. We \ndon't take a meat ax to this economy and cut things just for the sake \nof telling the American people we met a certain number. Every billion \ndollars of cuts means real people with real jobs.\n  Then the Republicans are criticizing our President for investing in \nthe infrastructure of this country. Mr. President, you and I know we \ncan't have a great nation if we can't move goods, if we can't move \npeople, if people are stuck in traffic, if we have sewer systems that \nare overflowing, water systems that are antiquated, and we have \nmillions of people who can't get access to broadband and the Internet. \nWe all know the value of that.\n  So I would say to my Republican friends: Please don't be against \nsomething simply because our President is for it. He is reaching out \nhis hand. Don't give him the back of your hand. I am very optimistic we \ncan work together. I am certainly pleased the President has reached out \nhis hand, and Republicans and Democrats have reached out their hands, \ntoo, in this Congress.\n  I am pleased to say on the highway bill I am working very closely \nwith Mr. Mica, who is the chairman of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee in the House. I am working with Jim Inhofe, my \nfriend and ranking member of the committee in the Senate. So let's, in \nour rhetoric, not each go to our corners. Let's welcome this \nPresident's budget. Let's take a look at it, let's ask economists what \nthe impact is of cutting so much that we derail our economic recovery.\n\n  We can do this. We did it under Bill Clinton. We balanced the budget \nand created 23 million jobs. Under George W. Bush, that was gone in 5 \nminutes--tax cuts to the people who didn't need it--and with it a \nhorrible economic recession, which this President--President Obama--\nstepped to the plate and dealt with, without much help from the other \nside. A couple helped us, yes. And I am preparing a little presentation \non what we did and what was the impact. We had capitalism on the brink \nof failure, and this President had the courage to deal with it.\n  There were calls from the Republican side of the aisle to nationalize \nthe banks. I remember that. President Obama said: No way. We are not \ngoing to do that.\n  Now, has it been rough? Has it been tough? Horribly so. My State is \nsuffering from this mortgage crisis. We have to do more. We all know \nthat. But economists are saying we are moving forward. We have turned \nthe corner. Therefore, I don't understand this chorus of negativity \ncoming from the Republicans toward our President when he was able to \ntake the worst recession since the Great Depression and bring us back \nto a stable situation.\n  Let's work together. Let's not heat up this rhetoric. We can do this. \nWe did it before. We know how to wrap our arms around this deficit, and \nwe know how to grow jobs. So let's take a page out of that book. It \nmeans we take bold steps, but we don't go so far so fast\n\n[[Page S668]]\n\nthat we derail economic recovery. We can do this.\n  The attack by the other side on the Environmental Protection Agency \nis unbelievable. I saw a cartoon in the Gannett papers in my hometown. \nIt had a drawing of an elephant, representing the Republican Party. In \nthe elephant's trunk was a can that was obviously poison. It had skull \nand bones on it, spraying the flowers, the trees, and the air. Under \nthe Republican logo it said: Environmental Destruction Agency. The \nRepublican Party calls it the Environmental Destruction Agency, and \nthey have cut one-third--that is their proposal--of the EPA's budget.\n  Now when I go out to talk to people, not one of them ever says to me: \nThe air is too clean, Senator. Make it dirtier. My kid only missed 2 \ndays from this school year, and I want dirty air. Nobody has ever said \nto me: I want unhealthful water. Nobody has ever told me they want to \nlive close to a Superfund site. So I say to my friends: Watch what you \nare doing. You are taking a meat ax to the Environmental Protection \nAgency that protects the health and the safety and the well-being of \nour children and our families. If you can't breathe, you can't work. \nYou know that? You lose time from work. So let's be careful. Let's not \nbe radical. Let's not be extreme. That is not what the people send us \nhere to do.\n  They certainly didn't send us here to take away a woman's right to \nchoose. They sent us here to work on this economic recovery. Yet we \nhave proposals over there on the other side that are unbelievable and \nthat would raise taxes on people who have health care policies that \ninclude reproductive health care for women. Can you imagine? They want \nto raise taxes on small businesses that have health policies that cover \nreproductive health care for women. I don't think that is what this \nelection was about. I thought it was about getting jobs in this \neconomy.\n  So between that and the overreaching on the budget, we have a lot of \nwork to do. I say it with due respect, I really do. But the American \npeople need to weigh in. They are going to need to say how much is too \nmuch and what their values are.\n  Richard Nixon signed the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. A \nRepublican President signed these acts. Yet now the Republicans are \ntrying to destroy these important bipartisan accomplishments. You know \nwhy? They say it kills jobs. Guess what. We heard the same thing from \nthe people who tried to stop the Clean Air Act--the polluters. They \nsaid, it is going to cost jobs. But we had the greatest economic growth \nafter that period. And guess what. Jobs are created when we clean up \nthe air. Jobs are created when we have technologies we can export and \nwhen we find ways to make drinking water safe.\n  Frankly, I am energized by this debate because I believe there are \ndifferences in the parties. I think that is OK, it is fine. I will be \ninvolved in the debate. I am sure colleagues on the other side who \ndisagree will put forward their views. They are trying to take away the \npower of the Environmental Protection Agency to enforce standards on \ncarbon pollution--dangerous carbon pollution--that the Bush \nadministration told us through their work puts our people in danger, \nputs our families in danger, puts our country in danger, puts our \neconomy in danger. They are actually trying to stop the EPA from \nenforcing the Clean Air Act. I do not know one constituent who ever \ntold me they thought the air was too clean or the water was too safe to \ndrink.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Edward Davila\n\n  Mr. President, today it is my honor to support the nomination of \nJudge Edward Davila as the Senate prepares to vote on his confirmation \nto become a district court judge. I congratulate him and his family on \nthis important day. I have had the privilege of recommending Judge \nDavila to President Obama to serve on the Northern District Court of \nCalifornia. He is respected by his colleagues and those who appear \nbefore him, and he will make an excellent addition to the bench.\n  This is a critical vacancy to fill. The Northern District has been \ndesignated a judicial emergency by the Administrative Office of the \nU.S. Courts. We do not have enough judges. This is another area in \nwhich we must work better together. I am hopeful on this one that we \ncan.\n  I am pleased that we are voting on Judge Davila today. When he is \nconfirmed, Judge Davila will be the only Latino serving on the Northern \nDistrict Court. That is important. Our State is so diverse, it is \nextraordinary, and we need everybody believing they are represented.\n  The judge is outstanding. He brings an impressive background of \nservice in both public service and private practice.\n  Judge Davila was born in Palo Alto, one of three children raised by a \nsingle mother. It is from his mother Dora that he learned the important \nqualities that have served him well. He defines those as hard work and \ndetermination. I extend my personal congratulations to Dora. As a \nmother, I know the immense pride she must feel for her son at his \nextraordinary accomplishments.\n  Judge Davila is a graduate of the California State University at San \nDiego and the University of California's Hastings College of Law in San \nFrancisco. He practiced law for nearly three decades, spending his \nfirst 7 years as Santa Clara County public defender before moving into \nthe private sector as the co-owner of a small firm specializing in \ncriminal defense. During his time as defense counsel, Judge Davila \nearned the respect of prosecutors and law enforcement officials with \nwhom he interacted, and he received awards from the State Bar of \nCalifornia. He served as president of the Santa Clara Bar Association \nin 1998.\n  Since 2001, he has served on the Santa Clara County Superior Court, \nwhere he has drawn praise from fellow judges and lawyers for his hard \nwork, his integrity, and his fairness. In a recent survey by the Santa \nClara County Bar Association, his performance was rated ``excellent'' \nor ``good'' by a huge percentage of participants with respect to his \nwork ethic, his knowledge of the law, his knowledge of procedure, \nintegrity, dispute resolution, and his judicial temperament, which we \nknow is so important. He has also received awards and recognition for \nhis judicial performance from the Santa Clara Bar Association and the \nCalifornia State Assembly.\n  I close by congratulating Judge Davila and his entire family on this \nmomentous day. Here is another example of the American dream. I urge my \ncolleagues in the Senate to join me in voting to confirm this highly \nqualified nominee to the Federal bench.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nCalifornia Superior Court Judge Edward Davila to be a U.S. district \njudge in the Northern District of California.\n  If confirmed, Judge Davila would bring a wealth of relevant \nexperience to the district court. Since 2001, he has served as a \nsuperior court judge in Santa Clara County. He has presided over more \nthan 10,000 cases--both civil and criminal--and has seen more than 50 \ncases from trial to final judgment.\n  He is a seasoned lawyer who also has more than 20 years of litigation \nexperience under his belt. For 13 years, Judge Davila tried criminal \ncases as a partner at his own law firm in San Jose. For 7 years before \nthat, he worked as a deputy public defender for Santa Clara County. In \ntotal, during his two decades as a litigator, he tried more than 45 \ncases to verdict or judgment.\n  Beyond his professional experience, Judge Davila has also been a \ndevoted member of the Santa Clara community. He is a former president \nof the Santa Clara County Bar Association as well as the Santa Clara \nCounty La Raza Lawyers Association. He has taught trial advocacy at \nStanford Law School, the University of San Francisco School of Law, and \nthe University of Santa Clara School of Law. And he has made it a \nlongstanding practice to teach local high school students about the \ncriminal justice system through mock trials in his courtroom.\n  Judge Davila's confirmation would also bring much needed diversity to \na court with broad reach in California. There are currently 18 active \nand senior district judges in the Northern District of California, but \nnot a single one is of Latino or Hispanic descent. Judge Davila's \nconfirmation would correct this imbalance. I am pleased to support his \nnomination, and I strongly urge my colleagues to confirm him.\n  Finally, I want to say a word about the caseload in this district. \nLast\n\n[[Page S669]]\n\nweek, the Judicial Conference of the United States sent a letter to the \nPresident and the leadership of the Senate calling attention to a \nhandful of courts with severe caseload problems.\n  The Northern District is one of these courts. Last year, the \ndistrict's judges carried a caseload of nearly 600 weighted filings per \njudgeship--far above the recommended level. With two vacancies \nunfilled, that caseload rose to more than 700 weighted filings per \nactive judge.\n  These vacancies did not exist for lack of a nominee. The President \nnominated Judge Davila in May of last year. He was reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee without objection, but he is only now receiving a \nvote. Another very qualified nominee for this court, Magistrate Judge \nEdward Chen, was nominated in August of 2009. He has been reported out \nof the Judiciary Committee twice but still has not received a vote on \nthe floor.\n  Today's vote on Judge Davila's nomination is a step in the right \ndirection. I urge my colleagues to support him, and I hope that we can \ncontinue to work together to ensure that our Federal courts have the \njudges they need to administer justice fairly and in a timely manner \nfor the American people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination \nof Mississippi Supreme Court Justice James Graves to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit. I thank all of those on both sides of \nthe aisle who have worked to get this vote scheduled and to bring us to \nthis moment, where I am confident Justice Graves will be confirmed.\n  When that happens today and when he takes the oath, Justice Graves \nwill bring a rich and distinguished background of public service to the \nFifth Circuit. He is a Mississippi native. He graduated as \nvaledictorian of Sumner High School in the small delta town of Sumner \nand went on to receive his bachelor's degree from Millsaps College \nbefore going to law school at Syracuse University.\n  Justice Graves currently presides as a justice on the Mississippi \nSupreme Court, where he has faithfully served since his appointment in \n2001 and his subsequent election in 2004. Before being appointed to the \nMississippi Supreme Court, Justice Graves served as a circuit court \njudge in Hinds County, MS, for 10 years.\n  Justice Graves is a dedicated family man and community volunteer. He \nhas been honored on numerous occasions with awards recognizing his \npublic service. Those who know him know he is particularly committed to \nteaching and motivating young people, particularly the young people of \nmy State of Mississippi. I am confident that even in this position of \nincreased responsibility and visibility, he will continue taking time \nto work with our Nation's young people.\n  I am proud today to speak on behalf of Justice Graves. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in support of his nomination to the Fifth Circuit.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of \nJustice James E. Graves, Jr., to serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit. At this time, Justice Graves is serving \nas a presiding justice on the Mississippi Supreme Court. He was \nappointed to our State's highest court in 2001, and he was elected to \nthe court in 2004. Prior to that, he served as a trial court judge for \n10 years.\n  Justice Graves has earned impressive academic credentials, including \nan undergraduate degree from Millsaps College, a law degree from \nSyracuse University College of Law, and a master's degree in public \nadministration from Syracuse University.\n  Justice Graves has served as a director of the Child Support Division \nof the Mississippi Department of Human Services. It is with pride and \npleasure that I am able to recommend to the Senate the confirmation of \nJustice James E. Graves, Jr.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate will confirm two more \nof President Obama's judicial nominees. With this action, we are \nfilling two seats which have been declared judicial emergencies. I am \npleased we are moving forward with these important positions.\n  I agree with the chairman's recent editorial and remarks he has made \nthat we have an opportunity to turn the page and work together in a \nspirit of bipartisanship and civility. I do not view it as a productive \neffort to continue with the finger pointing and the negative back and \nforth regarding the previous pace or outcome of judicial nominations. \nUnfortunately, that rhetoric has frequently overshadowed the debate on \nthe qualifications of particular nominees.\n  I and my Republican colleagues have been very cooperative in taking \naction on the President's nominees. During this Congress, the President \nhas nominated 50 individuals to the Federal judiciary. This Congress \nhas been in session for approximately 1 month. In this brief time, we \nhave taken positive action, in one form or another, on nearly half of \nthose nominees. With today's votes, we will have confirmed 5 nominees. \nIf this is not cooperation, I do not know what is.\n  Furthermore, we have seen a high level of bipartisanship with regard \nto President Obama's confirmed nominees. For President Obama's \nconfirmed district judge nominees, 94 percent of those confirmations \nwere by unanimous votes. Only 59 percent of President Bush's confirmed \ndistrict court nominees were afforded that same level of \nbipartisanship. So I think it is fair to say that we are cooperating in \na bipartisan manner, and in a deliberate pace.\n  I am working with the chairman to ensure nominees are afforded a fair \nbut thorough process, in a timely manner. I have appreciated the \nchairman's courtesy as we have worked together to set schedules and \nagendas. As we do so, I assure my colleagues that I will not falter on \nensuring each nominee is properly and thoroughly evaluated.\n  We are acting to reduce the judiciary vacancy rate. There are \ncurrently 99 vacancies in the Federal courts. However, it is remarkable \nto me that more than half of those vacancies, 52 seats, have yet to \nreceive a nomination. Furthermore, 25 of the 46 seats deemed to be \njudicial emergencies do not have nominees. It is unfair to blame \nRepublicans for any delays with these vacancies. It is impossible to \nfill seats when a nominee has not been named. It is the responsibility \nof the President to send to the Senate consensus nominees for these \npositions.\n  Let me say a few words about the nominees who are scheduled to have \nvotes today. I thank our leadership for the reasonable arrangement that \nwas reached to consider these nominations.\n  First, Justice James E. Graves has been nominated to be a circuit \njudge for the Fifth Circuit. He received his B.A. from Millsaps \nCollege, his J.D. and an M.P.A. from Syracuse University.\n  Justice Graves comes to the Federal bench with extensive experience \nin the legal field. He was a staff attorney for the Central Mississippi \nLegal Services for 3 years before moving into private practice. Justice \nGraves also spent time, first as a counsel, then as a chief legal \ncounsel, in the office of the Mississippi attorney general. Justice \nGraves left the Office of the Attorney General to become director of \nthe Mississippi Department of Human Services' Child Support Enforcement \nDivision.\n\n[[Page S670]]\n\n  Justice Graves also has considerable judicial experience. He was \nappointed to Mississippi Circuit Court judge in 1991 and was re-elected \ntwice. Since 2001, Justice Graves has served on the Mississippi Supreme \nCourt and has authored 151 majority opinions for the court and 92 \nconcurring or dissenting opinions. The American Bar Association \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated him \n``Qualified.''\n  I also rise in support of Judge Edward Davila to be U.S. district \njudge for the Northern District of California. With today's vote, we \nwill have confirmed 7 of President Obama's nominees to the district \ncourts of California. Judge Davila received his B.A. from California \nState University, San Diego and his J.D. from University of \nCalifornia's Hastings College of the Law. A majority of the American \nBar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated him \n``Qualified.''\n  Judge Davila began his career at the Santa Clara County Public \nDefender before entering private practice. He represented criminal \ndefendants in State and Federal courts. In August 2001, Governor Gray \nDavis appointed Judge Davila to the Superior Court of California, \nCounty of Santa Clara, a trial court of general jurisdiction. Judge \nDavila was re-elected without opposition twice.\n  We are making good progress in considering judicial nominations. I am \npleased the chairman and I have been able to move forward. We are \nfilling judicial vacancies, with a particular focus on judicial \nemergencies. We are working in a manner that treats each nominee in a \nfair manner and permits each Senator to thoroughly review the \nqualifications of each nominee.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are prepared to yield back any time on \nthis side. I understand from my colleague that they will yield back on \ntheir time.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: Is the first nomination the Graves nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is my understanding there is not a request for a \nrollcall vote on that one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of James E. \nGraves, Jr., of Mississippi, to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Fifth \nCircuit?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Edward J. Davila, of California, to be a \nU.S. district judge for the Northern District of California?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKerry), the Senator from Maryland (Ms. Mikulski), the Senator from \nArkansas (Mr. Pryor), and the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Udall) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Blunt), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint), and the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin).

For the information of all Senators, there will be no more \nvotes tonight. I have had a number of conversations with the Republican \nleader today. We are going to have one or two votes before our caucus \nlunches tomorrow. We will have a number of votes set up after the \ncaucus luncheons. We want to finish this bill as quickly as we can, \nwhich will be this week. I know a number of people are waiting around \nfor votes. I know Senator Paul is waiting around for a vote on his \namendment tomorrow afternoon, and I know Senator Nelson of Nebraska and \nSenator Wicker have amendments we are trying to get a vote on. We are \ntrying to move to those as soon as we can.\n  Anyway, we are going to have some votes tomorrow. No more votes \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Oklahoma and I be recognized for a \ntotal of 6 minutes evenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                       Amendment No. 6 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Senator Leahy and I have two amendments. \nHe has Leahy amendment No. 50 and my amendment is No. 6. I say to my \nfriend from Iowa, I will just be a few minutes, as he was kind enough \nto allow us to do this first.\n  This has to do with the liability of those individuals who are making \ntheir own sacrifice to help people in distress. It is something that \nthose of us who are pilots have done--helping individuals in being \nrelieved of some of the individual liability that might be incurred. \nThe Leahy amendment goes a little further than mine, but I am satisfied \nwith his. So what I wish to do is request unanimous consent to withdraw \nmy amendment No. 6 that gives liability protection to volunteer pilots \nand organizations, as well as request to be added as a cosponsor to the \nLeahy amendment No. 50. We have been in negotiations for a number of \nweeks. In fact, we were even last year. I think we\n\n[[Page S671]]\n\nhave reached an agreement we both find acceptable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma and \nI worked together to advance both of these amendments in a bipartisan \nway. We worked together during the last year, and we are working \ntogether again this year.\n  Our amendment closes a gap in our Public Safety Officers Benefits Act \nfor emergency service providers by extending Federal benefits to \nemergency service providers who die or are disabled in the line of duty \nand who work for private, nonprofit emergency services organizations.\n  A tragedy in Vermont 2 years ago highlighted this issue. First \nresponder Dale Long from Bennington, VT, was Bennington Rescue Squad's \n2008 EMT of the Year and a 2009 recipient of the American Ambulance \nAssociation's Star of Life Award. Shortly after that ceremony, he was \nkilled in the line of duty. Given the private, nonprofit status of his \nambulance service, he is ineligible for Federal death benefits.\n  The Judiciary Committee--all Republicans, all Democrats--unanimously \napproved this legislation last Congress. The Leahy-Inhofe amendment is \nfully paid through an included offset.\n  The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma and I have talked about this. \nHe comes from a part of the country where people have to fly to rescue. \nWe drive to rescue. We are much smaller. They fly. Either way, we ought \nto be doing something to protect the people who are out there trying to \nrescue or aid people in distress.\n  I am proud to join with Senator Inhofe, and I hope at some \nappropriate time the amendment, as now amended, will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will respond by saying that on numerous \noccasions in my 55 years of flying airplanes, I have done a lot of Good \nSamaritan things. It never really occurred to me, but one time I went \nall the way down to Dominica, near Caracas, Venezuela--I was telling \nthe Senator from Iowa about it--leading 10 planes. Eight of us made it \ndown and back. That is something we did not have to do, but no one else \nwould do it.\n  I believe we can encourage a lot more people to do these Good \nSamaritan duties if we give them a little bit of relief from liability.\n  I ask unanimous consent that after the Senator from Iowa makes his \nremarks, I be recognized for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to discuss for a few moments a few \namendments that are pending that I think would undermine the basic \nrights and protections of American workers. In these difficult economic \ntimes, working families are struggling enough. Wages are stagnant. In \nfact, I saw a report the other day that, in real terms, if you take \ninflation into account, wages right now for working men and women are \nabout where they were in 1974--almost 40 years. Job security is harder \nto find. More and more companies facing financial pressures are \ndeciding to cut corners on fundamentals such as worker safety.\n  Now more than ever, workers need the basic protections our laws \nprovide. The last thing we need to do is take a step backward and make \nworking people even more vulnerable than they are today, especially in \nterms of their safety and health. That is exactly what the Wicker \namendment and the Paul amendment would do for two groups of very \ndedicated people--flight crews and transportation security officers who \nwork every day to keep us safe when we travel.\n  First, the Paul amendment would undermine valuable safety and health \nprotections for flight crews. I do not think it would come as a \nsurprise to any of us that working on an airplane could be a dangerous \njob. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, flight attendants, as \nwell as other employees in the air transportation industry, suffer \noccupational injuries and illnesses at rates far higher than workers in \nnearly every other sector of private industry. This industry raises \nunique safety challenges, and we need to make special efforts to keep \nthese workers safe on the job.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration regulates all workplace safety \nissues on airplanes. However, at Congress's urging, FAA has entered \ninto a memorandum of understanding with the Occupational Safety and \nHealth Administration that is supposed to facilitate consultation and \ncoordination between the two agencies about safety issues. This is \nentirely appropriate since the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration has the expertise in this area. But that coordination \nhas not been effective in recent years. While a 2000 OSHA/FAA report \nidentified areas where flight crew safety could be improved, after that \nreport, coordination essentially stopped, and the FAA has failed to \ntake additional action to review and implement the recommended \nworkplace safety standards.\n  The bill we are considering on the floor would restore and improve \nthe level of coordination between the FAA and OSHA so that they can \ncomplete the valuable work outlined in that memorandum of \nunderstanding. It would basically require the two agencies to put their \nheads together and consider whether any OSHA standards should properly \nbe applied to people working on aircrafts.\n  I wish to be very clear on this point. The bill does not supplant \nFAA's authority. OSHA would not be conducting investigations or issuing \nfines for FAA-covered employees. That is the sole purview of the FAA. \nAll the bill says is that the two agencies should continue to talk and \nto coordinate. This seems to be eminently sensible. It simply defies \nexplanation to preclude this kind of coordination, and it could put \nworkers' lives and workers' safety at risk.\n  For example, flight crews are currently exposed to a variety of \ndangerous chemicals, including jet fuel vapors, compressed oxygen, \ncommercial cleaning agents, deicing chemicals. Yet there is no current \nrule requiring that the employees be informed of hazardous materials in \ntheir workplace.\n  OSHA has a safety standard about hazard communication requiring that \nworkers be informed of such hazardous materials. This simple, easy-to-\ncomply-with standard saves workers' lives. The 2000 report I referred \nto earlier found that FAA could implement the OSHA standard on hazard \ncommunication without any implications for flight safety. But what has \nhappened? Absolutely nothing. Despite finding that the OSHA standard \ncould improve safety for airline employees and that it would not impact \naviation safety, the cooperative effort stalled in its tracks. This \nbill would resuscitate that cooperation. This is just one of a number \nof important reforms that would improve workplace safety without \ncompromising flight safety. Hard-working flight attendants and other \nflight crew workers deserve our best efforts to make these reforms a \nreality.\n  Again, I wish to make one point very clear. The legislation does not \nchange or undermine FAA's role at all. It simply fosters cooperation \nbetween two government agencies--one that has a lot of technical \nexpertise, the other one which has the jurisdiction.\n  Again, I think this would be something where one would say: Sure, \nthey should cooperate and communicate. The amendment before us would \nundermine a common sense practice--collaboration between agencies--and \nwould make people less safe on the job. I urge my colleagues to protect \nthe safety of our workers by opposing this amendment.\n  I am equally concerned about the impact the amendment by Senators \nWicker and Collins would have on the hard-working people who keep our \nairports and planes safe. I have spoken about this amendment before. I \nwould like to bring it up again.\n  In legislation creating the Transportation Security Administration, \nTSA, Congress gave TSA the right to determine whether transportation \nsecurity officers, TSOs, have the right to collectively bargain. Those \nare the people we see every time we go through the airport. They check \nour IDs. They run the machines and check our bags. These are the \ntransportation safety officers.\n\n[[Page S672]]\n\n  The Transportation Security Administration found that collective \nbargaining could improve security by addressing the agency's chronic \nlow morale and employee engagement. However, certain subjects remain \noff limits for bargaining, including pay, deployment, training, and any \nTSA emergency response measures. Right now, the TSOs, under what the \nTSA wanted to do, would be allowed to collectively bargain but for \nthose certain items. As I said, they could not collectively bargain on \npay or deployment or training or emergency response measures.\n  As I mentioned when I previously addressed this issue on the Senate \nfloor, a recent ``best places to work'' survey ranked the TSA 220 out \nof 224 Federal employers. The agency's turnover and injury rates are \namong the highest for any Federal agency. Low morale and high turnover \nat a front-line security agency are a recipe for disaster.\n\n  TSA determined that collective bargaining will address those problems \nand improve the agency's ability to fulfill its mission. The TSA's \ndecision is well reasoned and sound. It states that a ``one-size-fits-\nall model of labor relations that undermines initiative and flexibility \nwould not serve TSA or its workforce well.'' That is exactly what this \namendment by Senators Wicker and Collins would do. It would lock into \nplace one model of labor relations--the most adversarial model--that is \nmost harmful to employee morale. As I just said, we know employee \nmorale at the TSO level is very low, and there is a very high turnover \nrate.\n  While my colleagues who support this amendment cite concerns about \ndisruptions to security procedures, the agency believes--and I agree--\nthat those concerns are misguided.\n  First and foremost, I question the assumption underlying this \nconcern: that men and women who take a job protecting our Nation would \ncast that duty aside if they were granted basic labor concessions such \nas collective bargaining. I think that is an insult to every man and \nwoman in uniform who works under collective bargaining agreements \nacross this country. To suggest unionized security personnel are \nsomehow less effective, less dedicated, less willing to put their lives \non the line in an emergency is just plain scandalous. Most Federal \nsecurity employees, including Border Patrol personnel, Immigration and \nCustoms officials, our Capitol police officers who protect us, Federal \nProtective Services officers--they all have collective bargaining \nrights.\n  I always point out that famous picture of September 11, 2001, when \nthat awful tragedy happened in New York and those buildings came down \nand we saw the thousands of people running away from this disaster and \nthe buildings falling down, while running into the buildings were our \npolice, our firefighters, and our emergency personnel. Those workers \nwere members of a union and covered by a collective bargaining \nagreement. Did they shirk their duty? Did they shirk their \nresponsibility? Not a bit. We are proud of them. Why should TSOs be any \ndifferent?\n  Again, the exclusion of deployment and training and emergency \nresponse measures from bargaining will prevent any disruptions to \nsecurity procedures.\n  I firmly believe collective bargaining is the best way to bring \ndignity, consistency, and fairness to a workplace. It will make our TSO \nworkforce safer and more stable. Restoring these essential rights is \nlong overdue. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Wicker-Collins \namendment.\n  Finally, while I think it is critically important that the bill we \nare considering must not be a vehicle for rolling back worker \nprotections, I regret that it will not be a vehicle to correct an \noutrageous attack on workers' rights that was enacted on this \nlegislation in 1996.\n  In a rider to the 1996 FAA reauthorization bill, Congress made it \nharder for employees of an express carrier to organize a union in order \nto unfairly advantage one company--FedEx Express. The bill carved out \nemployees of an express carrier delivery company--which meant only one \ncompany: FedEx--from coverage under the National Labor Relations Act \nand placed them under the Railway Labor Act. As a result, it is much \nmore difficult for FedEx employees to organize and bargain \ncollectively. What is the difference? Under the National Labor \nRelations Act, workers can act locally in seeking to organize and \nbargain collectively. Under the Railway Labor Act, workers must \norganize nationally--an enormous challenge in today's labor \nenvironment, especially for workers who do not necessarily work in \nmobile industries. Under the current law, if package sorters in Des \nMoines, for example, want to organize a union, they would have to go to \nNew York and Georgia and Texas and California to get every warehouse \nworker in the country to join them, which is obviously extremely \ndifficult.\n  This quirk in the law is not only illogical, it is the worst kind of \npolitical favoritism. Why do I say that? Obviously because one of the \nbiggest competitors of FedEx is United Parcel Service. United Parcel \nService is under the National Labor Relations Act. Not every single one \nof their employees is unionized, but they are allowed to organize and \nbargain collectively locally. In certain States that are covered by \nunion shop, then they would all be covered. In a State such as Iowa, \nwhich is a right-to-work State, some of the employees of United Parcel \nService would be members of a union and some would not. But they would \nall be covered by a collective bargaining agreement.\n  United Parcel Service workers, doing the same exact job as FedEx \nworkers, can organize and bargain collectively locally. FedEx workers \ncannot because they are under the Railway Labor Act, not the National \nLabor Relations Act. That was a rider to this bill in 1996 to favor one \ncompany. Again, identical jobs for FedEx and another company, different \nrights under the law--that is unfair. Congress should ensure that \ncompanies compete on a level playing field. We should not be picking \nfavorites, especially not by silencing the voices of employees of one \ncompany.\n  In past Congresses, I have introduced legislation to eliminate this \nspecial treatment and ensure that employees who have nothing to do with \nair transport have all the rights they are entitled to under the \nNational Labor Relations Act. There are tens of thousands of \ntruckdrivers and warehouse employees who have nothing to do with \nairline travel, and the rules of the game are rigged against them.\n  I had hoped this bill would provide an opportunity to right these \npast wrongs, but I know it is important to complete our work on the FAA \nreauthorization in short order. This bill will create hundreds of \nthousands of jobs. It will make crucial investments in our Nation's \ninfrastructure. As a pilot myself--and my friend from Oklahoma has been \nflying even longer than I have, I think, but we have both been flying \nfor a long time--I have been waiting for the NextGen to come on board \nbecause it will enhance flight safety and make it a lot easier for our \ngeneral aviation pilots to fly in this environment and it is important \nto get the bill done. So that is why I support the bill.\n\n  Again, I had hoped we would address this inequity that exists as \nregards the Federal Express, but we did not, so we will have to carry \non the battle on another bill on another day. It is just an issue of \nfundamental fairness for workers, so I expect that we will revisit this \nagain in the future.\n  I thank my friend from Oklahoma for being so patient, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Before my friend from Iowa leaves the floor, when he \ntalked about NextGen, I can remember--and he can remember--years ago, \nwhen we first flew, there was nothing but low frequency out there, and \nwe used to shoot those low-frequency approaches. Then they came along \nwith VORs, and I thought this has to be the end of it. Then they came \nalong with RNAV. They could pick up a VR and move it over here. What \nmore could they ever do than that? Then LORAN came along and then GPS. \nSo I quit saying they can't get better because now there is hardly a \nrunway in the world you can't shoot an instrument approach on using \nGPS. I flew an airplane around the world, all across Siberia--bad \nweather all the way--and I shot my approaches with GPS. You could train \na chimpanzee to do it with a GPS.\n  I agree with my friend from Iowa. We are anxious for NextGen and \nthese opportunities we have that are coming up to enhance the safety \nand abilities of general aviation along with commercial aviation.\n\n[[Page S673]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. If my friend would yield just for a second, I would just \ntell him the first plane I owned had an old--I called it a coffee \ngrinder in it, you would get the ANN--annuls--and that would take you \ninto the airport. So I can remember those days quite well. Thank God we \nhave GPS now.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank my friend.\n  Mr. President, a few minutes ago I talked about two amendments I had \nin the FAA bill. One was what I would call the Good Samaritan \namendment. We have talked about this for years. Senator Leahy and I \nhave come to an agreement. I would like to have it go further and offer \nliability protection beyond just the pilots who might be offering their \nservices, as my friend from Iowa and I have done many times at our own \nexpense because no one else would do it.\n  I would say to the occupier of the chair, it wasn't that many years \nago there was a horrible hurricane that wiped out an island called \nDominica, north of Caracas, Venezuela. I remember putting together 10 \nairplanes, general aviation airplanes, and we took doctors and nurses \nand generators and goods down there and food and water because nobody \nelse would do it. This type of thing is going on all the time, and I \nthink they should be afforded some protection from the liability laws. \nBut I do realistically know with this compromise, we can get it passed \nand this would offer individuals protection.\n  The other amendment I have is quite different. It has to do with \nsomething called subpart S of FAR in the regulations, part 121. The \nDepartment of Defense--in the movement of many of the troops and \nindividuals--relies on supplemental carriers. We are talking about \nnonscheduled carriers or charter airlines, and these are people or \nairlines that are nonscheduled. They come under a separate part, \nsubpart B, and they are given some exemption from the crew rest rigid \nparts that affect the scheduled airlines. It is easy for a scheduled \nairline to have these very rigorous crew rest times because they are, \nas it says, scheduled. But when you get into nonscheduled, you are \ngetting into areas where it is much more difficult.\n  So I wish to say two things about it. First of all, the supplemental \nair carriers have had a safety record that is even better than \nscheduled. There has never been one time in 15 years that the NTSB has \ncited something wrong, something that has happened with the part B or \nnonscheduled carriers as a result of fatigue. It hasn't happened. I \noften say we get too anxious to pass laws around here. I have always \nhad the philosophy if it ``ain't'' broken, don't fix it. This is not \nbroken, and it has worked very well. So I think their record speaks for \nitself.\n  The thing a lot of people are not aware of is if you are a \nnonscheduled airline, you are able to have longer rest periods, even \nthough you may go over the 15 hours of actual flight time. So it works \nout, in the long range, they can do things they couldn't do otherwise.\n  Here is the thing not many people realize about nonscheduled \nairlines. The Department of Defense depends on them for 95 percent of \nall military passengers and 40 percent of military cargo. That is going \ninto Iraq, Afghanistan, all throughout the danger points, and Southwest \nAsia, and it is expected that these new regulations will negatively \nimpact the mission capability and increase the cost to both the \ncarriers and to DOD.\n  Supplemental flights in support of the Department of Defense are \ncarried out under control of the Air Mobility Command, which is at Fort \nScott Air Force Base in Illinois. A central feature of the supplemental \ncarrier's ability to complete these critical missions every day is the \nflexibility built into subpart S of the FAA regulations.\n  I am not offering something that is going to change how they treat \nsubpart S. I am only going to say they currently have a rule they are \nconsidering, and this rule would do away with the distinction between \nsubpart Q, R, and subpart S, which is nonscheduled airlines. So if we \nare depending upon these nonscheduled airlines to fly our troops, our \ncargo into these war-torn areas, then there is no other way of doing \nit.\n  You can say: Well, the Air Force can use their C-17s. Right now the \nAir Force's C-17s are in an OPTEMPO, where they can't take on any more \nmissions. So you have critical things that are happening--such as \nflying blood into areas of combat. Let me give a couple examples. There \nis a regular run that goes from NATO--that is Belgium--from Belgium to \nBagram, then back to Amsterdam. They are taking things such as tents, \ncargo, gasoline, food, and other supplies. That would be 19.6 hours. \nThat means they can't do it. To do it, they would have to have crew \nrest time, and that would have to take place in Bagram. There are rules \nagainst it. You can't leave a commercial airline in Bagram. It cannot \nbe done. So you have to figure out some way to get that cargo in and \nout of Bagram.\n  There is another regular run from Germany to Kandahar and then to \nHong Kong. Well, that is 17.5 hours, so you can't do that because you \ncan't leave your aircraft in a war zone. There is another run from \nShannon to Kyrgystan and return, and that is something that is 16 hours \nand 15 minutes. That can't be done.\n  I think the one that is most critical is twice a week one carrier \ncurrently operates and takes lifesaving blood runs from McGuire Air \nForce Base in New Jersey to Ramstein in Germany and then to Qatar. From \nQatar, they have to go all the way into Afghanistan and back, and that \nround trip extends beyond the 15 hours that would be allowed with a \nscheduled airline. So under subpart S, they can do it. We are talking \nabout twice a week, regular runs, taking blood into areas in \nAfghanistan where it is critical we get it in.\n  So I am just saying the FAA, in promulgating the rules they are \nlooking at right now, should take into consideration that there is a \nseparate type of a mission that has to be performed for our young men \nand women in harm's way, and we can't do it unless we treat the subpart \nS of the rule FAR 121 from the scheduled airlines. So I am hoping we \nwill have a chance.\n  My concern is this: There are a lot of people who, for some labor \nreasons, don't want to have anyone to have the ability to go beyond the \n15 hours, even though they get more rest time. I am the only one \ntalking about the fact we have the lives of our young men and women in \nharm's way at stake depending on this subpart S treatment. So this \nthing is very critical. I believe we should do something to make sure, \nif they are going to look at the rules, they at least look at the rules \nin a different light than just looking at them altogether, but look at \nsubpart S and hear the testimony and see if that doesn't work, the \nspecial consideration.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. President, I don't see anyone else in the Chamber waiting to \ntalk, so I wish to make one additional comment. I was in shock when I \ngot off the plane and read what the President came out with in his \nbudget. I think it is unbelievable--$8.7 trillion in new spending, $1.6 \ntrillion in new taxes, $13 trillion in new debt, the current year \ndeficit increased by $1.6 trillion--not $1.4 or $1.5, as they talked \nbefore--and it is incredible this could be happening right now.\n  I wonder if he didn't get the message of last November 2; that is, \npeople know we cannot keep extending the spending, the fact we had an \nincrease in the first 2 years--and this came straight from the White \nHouse, from the administration--in our spending greater than all \nspending in the history of this country from George Washington to \nGeorge W. Bush can't happen. People are talking about the deficits that \ntook place during George W. Bush, with an average deficit of $247 \nbillion, and that was right after trying to rebuild a military and \nafter 9/11, when we found ourselves, for all practical purposes, in two \nwars. So instead of a deficit of $247 billion, the deficit in this \nadministration has been $3 trillion in 2 years. That is inconceivable.\n  I thought he would come out with something, after listening to the \nState of the Union Message, that would start moderating and start \ntrying to save some money, but it hasn't happened. There is spending \nmoney on everything except the military, which is the big loser. I \ndon't know why it is that liberals never want to spend money on the \nmilitary--an $80 billion cut over a 5-year period in the Department of \nDefense. This is right after we went through the 1990s, where we had a\n\n[[Page S674]]\n\ndrawdown of our Defense by about 40 percent, and of course we find \nourselves now, after 9/11, in two wars.\n  So I think we need to make sure the American people realize the State \nof the Union Message sounded real good when he said we are going to \nstart putting a freeze on. You know what that freeze is? The freeze is \nto take the nondefense discretionary spending and freeze it for 5 \nyears. But wait a minute, that is after he increased it over 20 \npercent. So he increased it so we can't afford it and then he freezes \nit there so we can't bring it back down.\n  So anyway, I hope people are looking carefully and seeing what is \nhappening. They will. If you look at what they are doing just to the \noil and gas industry--and I know a lot of people in the liberal \ncommunities who want to put them out of business, and they are going to \nsuccessfully do it if they pass this particular budget--I am talking \nabout percentage depletion, the IDC--the section 199 manufacturer's \ndeduction. By the way, the only industry under this budget that is \naffected negatively by that is oil and gas. All other manufacturers in \nindustry are all right. So I hope people have a chance to look at this \ncarefully.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Gallaudet UNIVERSITY\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I rise to talk about one of \nAmerica's great institutions, Gallaudet University. On July 4, 1861, \nPresident Lincoln celebrated our Nation's independence on the eve of \nthe Civil War by declaring to Congress the principal aim of the U.S. \nGovernment should be ``to elevate the condition of men; to lift \nartificial weights from all shoulders; to clear the paths of laudable \npursuit for all; to afford an unfettered start and a fair chance in the \nrace of life.''\n  Just a few months before that President Lincoln signed into Federal \nlaw the authorization to confer collegiate degrees to the deaf and to \nthe hard of hearing at a campus in Washington, DC. For the first time \nin the Nation's history and still alone to this day Gallaudet \nUniversity is the only liberal arts university in the world dedicated \nto the pursuit of higher education for deaf and hard of hearing people. \nSimply put, Gallaudet is a gem, a gem for this city, a gem for our \ncountry, a gem for the world for higher education, truly a national \nuniversity located a short distance from the Capitol and founded by \nPresident Abraham Lincoln.\n  I am one of two appointees--one from the House, one from the Senate--\nby statute to the board of trustees at Gallaudet University. During my \ntenure on the board I have met with proud alumni and supporters of \nGallaudet in Ohio and in Washington.\n  Last Friday I was again on campus and met with members of the board, \nthe president's cabinet, and a few students. Some people I admire a \ngreat deal, with whom I have talked about the culture of our nation's \ndeaf communities, are Jay and Meredith Crane. Jay is a member of the \nGallaudet board of trustees.\n  Jay and his wife Meredith are outstanding advocates for Ohio's deaf \ncommunity and culture. Jay and Meredith have a son and a daughter who \nare deaf. They demonstrate to all of us how important a Gallaudet \neducation can be in one's life.\n  Jay's son, at an event in Columbus last year, explained to us how \nGallaudet is an oasis for students, students who have lived all over \nthe country, generally integrated into a community but having a sense \nof isolation among people who are not deaf. Yet Jay's son, when coming \nto the university, talked about what an oasis Gallaudet University is \nfor him and for his classmates.\n  The parents, the educators, the administrators at Gallaudet serve as \nrole models and continue to make a difference in the lives of students. \nThat is why the relationship between Gallaudet and our Federal \nGovernment is so important. It is why our support and encouragement of \ndeaf and hard-of-hearing students allow them to explore new \nopportunities and experiences to enrich our workplaces and our \ncommunities.\n  The overwhelming majority of undergraduate students at Gallaudet are \ndeaf. About half of the students at the graduate school at Gallaudet \nare deaf and half of them are hearing students. Many of those \ngraduates, graduates and undergraduates in the master's program at \nGallaudet, go into serving the deaf around the country. Many of them, \nas Jay and Meredith's son, go into other professions not directly \nconcerned with the deaf. Jay and Meredith's son, for example, is in law \nschool in California. Most of these students come from middle-class or \nworking-class families.\n  In 2008-2009, more than 80 percent of Gallaudet students received \nfinancial aid in order to get the education they deserve. These \nstudents are talented. I will soon have a Gallaudet intern by the name \nof Brianna Johnson, a student at Gallaudet, who is an education and \nhuman rights justice major. She will be graduating in May 2010. She is \non the dean's scholar list. She is originally from Atlanta, GA.\n  The Gallaudet University women's basketball team, ranked 18th in the \nNation, was undefeated until, unfortunately, this past weekend when \nthey lost to Penn State-Harrisburg. They play in the North Eastern \nAthletic Conference, division III. One of their guards is a graduate \nfrom the Columbus School for the Deaf in Columbus,\n\n[[Page S677]]\n\nOH. Their head coach is Mark Ehlen. Their assistant coach came out of \none of the great women's basketball programs in Ohio, Stephanie \nStevens, a 2010 graduate of the University of Cincinnati. She went to \nPickerington High School, which has been in the state finals and final \nfour many times.\n  As we prepare our Nation to ``win the future'' and outcompete and \nouteducate the rest of the world, we must ensure that mission includes \nall Americans. The creation of Gallaudet, 140-plus years ago, helped \nestablish a nationwide community for generations of deaf children.\n  Ohio's first school for the deaf was established in 1829 in a small \nhouse right near where the State House now is on Broad and Highway in \nColumbus. That school, the Columbus School for the Deaf for Ohio, will \nsoon have a new campus on 200 acres on Morse Road in Columbus with \nconvenient student housing and modern education technology and space \nfor future expansion. Such progress demonstrates how far education for \ndeaf and hard-of-hearing students has come, and how much farther it can \ngo.\n  Last year I gave a speech on this floor honoring Gallaudet as the \nSenate passed a resolution commemorating the 145th anniversary of \nGallaudet's charter that was authored by President Lincoln. And 141 \nyears ago, the three members of Gallaudet's first graduating class \nreceived degrees signed by President Lincoln.\n  Last year, during Gallaudet's 140th commencement, 10 Ohio students \ngraduated from Gallaudet with a degree signed by President Obama. I am \nconcerned, though, that funding for Gallaudet may be compromised in the \nbudget that is working its way through the House of Representatives. \nGallaudet's budget has been frozen at $118 million for, I believe, 3 \nstraight years. They have gotten no increase in Federal funding. They \nraise private money. They obviously charge tuition, although a huge \npercentage of their students, as I said, are on scholarship. The \nFederal money they have has not increased over the last, I believe, 3 \nyears.\n  My concern is as the budget makes its way through here, we do not \njust help those students who are going to Gallaudet but we do \nunderstand that Gallaudet is one of our Nation's gems, a national \nuniversity unlike any other, not just in the United States of America \nbut any other university anywhere in the world. The proud alumni of \nGallaudet have enriched our communities and have taught all of us the \nmeaning of the values President Lincoln laid before us, that we educate \nourselves as part of a community, full of opportunity, free of, as \nLincoln said, artificial weight that works toward the good of our \nsociety.\n  Gallaudet is a jewel for our country. It is an honor to be on their \nboard. It is an honor, frankly, to me, as a mission for the United \nStates of America, that we continue to assist this great national \nuniversity that is a credit to all of us.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nresume consideration of S. 223 on Tuesday, February 15, at 11 a.m.; \nfurther that at 11:40 a.m., the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nthe Nelson of Nebraska amendment No. 58; that a Nelson second-degree \namendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, there be up to 20 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to the \namendment, as amended; that no further amendments be in order to the \nNelson of Nebraska amendment prior to the vote; and that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table and there be no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is a somewhat poorly kept secret that \nmany of the successes of government are attributable to those who work \noutside of the limelight. While Senators, Cabinet Secretaries, and even \nthe generals in our military are the public face of the policies of the \nUnited States, behind every leader is a cadre of dedicated and \nknowledgeable civil servants.\n  Today I wish to call out one name in particular. Ellen Maldonado, a \nprofessional staff member on the Senate Appropriations Committee, will \nsoon be retiring after 30 years of government service. Ellen joined the \nDefense Subcommittee in 2006, brought onboard by my friend and former \ncolleague, Senator Ted Stevens. The subcommittee, and in fact the \nSenate as a whole, was fortunate to find someone with such a wealth of \ntalent and experience in the complex field of budgeting for our Armed \nForces.\n  Ellen has worked at every level of the budgeting workforce for our \nmilitary establishment. She began her career as a program analyst at \nthe Naval Ship Research and Development Center in Carderock, MD, and \nrapidly progressed through the ranks in critical budgeting positions \nboth inside and outside the beltway. Some of her most rewarding \npositions outside of Washington have included service at the Defense \nLanguage Institute in Monterey, CA, Air Force Special Operations \nCommand at Hurlburt Field, and even the U.S. Embassy in Lima, Peru.\n  Inside the Pentagon, Ellen worked on an impressive array of budgeting \nissues. From revising the Army's reprogramming process to programming \nfor military health care, from reviewing defense research and \ndevelopment programs to developing emergency spending requests for the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan, she has earned the respect of all of \nthose around her. She has won a reputation of being an expert on the \nmost arcane points of the Financial Management Regulations, as well as \nunderstanding the details of highly complex weapons systems. Ellen has \nbeen recognized for her outstanding achievements by being awarded both \nthe Secretary of Defense Medal for Meritorious Service and the \nExceptional Civilian Service Award.\n  Ellen's career at the Pentagon culminated in her 2005 appointment as \nthe Director for Investment for the Comptroller of the Department of \nDefense. In this position, she was responsible for overseeing the \nbudget for every stage of developing, testing, and procuring equipment \nfor all of the military services. This position brought her into \nregular contact with the highest levels of the Department of Defense, \nas well as Congress and the Office of Management and Budget.\n  It is extremely fortunate for the Committee on Appropriations that we \nmanaged to lure her away from this important position in 2006. While \nserving on the Defense Subcommittee, Ellen has excelled in reviewing \nthe budget proposals on critical Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, \nand intelligence programs. She has tackled some of the greatest \nnational security challenges facing our country today, including an in-\ndepth investigation into our government's cyber security efforts and \nexhaustive reviews of the Nation's most expensive military program in \nhistory, the Joint Strike Fighter. Her impressive track record made her \na natural pick to join President Obama's transition team at the \nDepartment of Defense in 2008 and 2009.\n\n[[Page S678]]\n\n  While I could continue to list her professional successes, one cannot \ncomment on her career without saying a few words on her outstanding \ncharacter. Ellen combines a sunny disposition with a deep-rooted sense \nof fairness. She is a true master of her field, and always eager to \nshare her knowledge and experience with her colleagues. While \nconsistently a good steward of the taxpayer's money, her patriotism has \ninsured that the welfare of the men and women serving in uniform has \nalways been foremost in her mind. And finally, everyone who knows Ellen \nalso knows of her remarkable and touching relationship with her \nhusband, Rob.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nimpressive accomplishments of a remarkable woman and native of the \nCommonwealth, Lieutenant Anna Dixon of the U.S. Coast Guard. Lieutenant \nDixon has always possessed an adventurous spirit and harbored a desire \nto expand her horizons and explore the possibilities of the world \noutside of her hometown of Barbourville, KY. So it came as no surprise \nto those who know her that upon graduating from Barbourville High \nSchool and attending the University of Kentucky to study architecture \nfor a year, Lieutenant Dixon decided to take advantage of an exchange \nprogram and follow her dream of becoming a marine biologist at Coastal \nCarolina College in Myrtle Beach, SC.\n  Upon graduating with her degree in marine science and working at an \nenvironmental testing lab, Lieutenant Dixon decided to take another \nadventurous and courageous leap and enlist in the U.S. Coast Guard. \nLieutenant Dixon not only completed her basic training at Camp May, NJ, \nin August of 2004, but also graduated at the top of her class and was \nassigned to the Coast Guard Station in Long Beach, CA, where she \nremained for 2 years.\n  In the years that followed, this bright and determined woman worked \ntirelessly to qualify for numerous positions within the U.S. Coast \nGuard, including Officer Candidate School where she graduated third in \nher class, as a patroller on the Coast Guard Cutter Spencer, and as \nChief of Contingency Preparedness at the Coast Guard Station in Key \nWest, FL. Most recently, Lieutenant Dixon was assigned the duties of \npublic information officer for the Florida Keys response to the \nDeepwater Horizon oilspill, and was hand-selected to be the lead \nadvance officer and deputy press secretary for now-retired National \nIncident Commander Admiral Thad Allen of the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  During her time in the post from July to October of 2010, Lieutenant \nDixon worked steadfastly to coordinate daily national press conferences \nfor Admiral Allen and other high-ranking national leader, to make sure \ninformation on one of the Nation's most devastating offshore disasters \nwas delivered in a timely and accurate manner. Because of her strong \nsense of leadership and her eye for detail, Lieutenant Dixon was \nselected by a board of Coast Guard officers to attend a fully funded \ngraduate program to further her experience in communications and public \nrelations, as well as to complete a follow-on tour as a public affairs \nofficer for a multistate Coast Guard district.\n  It is unquestionable that Lieutenant Dixon's career successes, \nincluding her recent change in rank, have come with much sacrifice, but \nhave been well-deserved. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing \nthe accomplishments of LT Anna Dixon, and in sending congratulations to \nher proud parents Katy Jones and Bill Matt Dixon, and stepparents \nMichael Jones and Kay Dixon. I wish Lieutenant Dixon continued success \nfor the future.\n  The Mountain Advocate recently published a story about Lieutenant \nDixon and her successful career. I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Mountain Advocate, Jan. 6, 2011]\n\n                           (By Eddie Arnold)\n\n                       Just Call Her `Lieutenant'\n\n       When Anna Dixon graduated from Barbourville High School in \n     1998, she had dreams of being a marine biologist. However, \n     with the nearest ocean hundreds of miles away, pursuing such \n     a career seemed even unlikely.\n       Little did she know that working in and around oceans is \n     something that she would eventually do--not as a marine \n     biologist but as a member of the United States Coast Guard.\n       Even more ironic is that she never even considered the \n     military as a young girl. ``I never even thought about it,'' \n     she said.\n       After one year at the University of Kentucky as a student \n     of architecture. she chose to take advantage of an exchange \n     program and moved to South Carolina, where she graduated from \n     the Coastal Carolina College in Myrtle Beach with a B.S. \n     degree in marine science.\n       ``There are very few jobs for marine biologists that don't \n     have an advanced degree,'' she said. It was then that her \n     best friend's husband, who was in the Army, suggested that \n     she consider the Coast Guard. ``I didn't even know what that \n     was, I thought they were water cops.''\n       However, the suggestion planted a seed in Dixon's mind. \n     ``At first it was a joke. But the more I joked about it, the \n     more I thought maybe it's not that bad of an idea,'' she \n     said.\n       After graduation and while living in Savannah, Dixon worked \n     at an environmental testing lab. ``It was like real \n     chemistry, but I could tell that was what I would be doing \n     forever if I didn't make a change and go out on a limb. So I \n     went and talked with a recruiter,'' she said, adding that she \n     made the decision to enlist. ``It sounded like a really good \n     idea.''\n       Dixon graduated from basic training at Cape May, New Jersey \n     at the top of her class in August 2004. After going on to \n     Boatswain's Mate ``A'' School training, she was assigned to \n     the Coast Guard Station Los Angeles/Long Beach where she \n     remained from December 2004 to March 2006.\n       ``I worked really hard and got qualified as quickly as I \n     could and got recommended to go to Officer Candidate School, \n     where she graduated third in her class.\n       From there, she went to a ship--the Coast Guard Cutter \n     Spencer out of Boston, Massachusetts.\n       ``I never wanted to do ship life.'' she said. ``But I \n     thought if I didn't do it then. I would never get the chance \n     to do it.''\n       During her two years aboard ship, they patrolled from the \n     northeast coast off Canada all the way down to the Caribbean, \n     including doing migrant patrols.\n       Even though Dixon said she learned a lot on that \n     assignment, she longed to get her feet back on dry land. When \n     she applied for a new assignment, she noticed that Key West \n     was available. ``I thought to myself there's no way I'm going \n     to get that. There will be thirty other people in line for \n     that. When I learned that I had got it, I was off the coast \n     of Canada. It was like eight degrees,'' she said. ``At three \n     o'clock in the morning I got an email saying I was going to \n     Key West.''\n       Being a female presented it's own set of challenges for \n     Dixon. ``During my whole time in the Coast Guard it has been \n     a challenge no matter where I go. But within a month, they \n     find out that I am for real. But I've never had any real \n     problems,'' she said.\n       Since being assigned at Key West through the present, \n     Dixon's job as Chief of Contingency Preparedness has posed \n     challenges also.\n       In April of this year she was assigned the duties of public \n     information officer for the Florida Keys response to the \n     Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\n       ``Since I've been doing that it has been a full-time \n     thing,'' she said. ``But I am still the chief of planning.\n       Dixon was hand-selected to be the Lead Advance Officer and \n     Deputy Press Secretary for National Incident Commander \n     Admiral Thad Allen (USCG-Ret.), a job she held from July \n     through October of this year.\n       During her time in the post, she coordinated daily \n     national-level press conferences for Allen and other high-\n     ranking national leaders including Dr. Lane Lubchenco, \n     Director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration.\n       Although she has enjoyed her duty assignments so far, Dixon \n     said she is looking forward to the next level in her career.\n       ``I have been selected by a board of Coast Guard officers \n     to attend a fully-funded graduate program to study \n     communications and public relations, with a follow-on tour as \n     a Public Affairs Officer for an entire multi-state Coast \n     Guard district,'' she said.\n       Dixon, who was recently promoted to the rank of lieutenant, \n     said she has enjoyed her six plus years in the Coast Guard. \n     ``I didn't know what to expect when I went in but I \n     definitely didn't expect to live in eight states and have all \n     these different experiences. It has been unbelievable,'' she \n     said, adding that her family and friends are really proud of \n     me.\n\n[[Page S679]]\n\n       ``My friends laugh because they say `Anna is in charge of \n     things?' They don't see me as Lt. Dixon, they just see me as \n     Anna. But they are all super proud of me.''\n       Over the holidays, she came home to spend some time with \n     her family, including her parents Katy and Michael Jones of \n     Corbin, Bill and Kay Dixon of Barbourville, and brothers John \n     W. Dixon and Matthew Dixon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/14/senate-section/article/S679-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/14/senate-section/article/S679-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/14/senate-section/article/S679-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S679-S681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012--PM 5\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred jointly, pursuant to the order of January \n30, 1975 as modified by the order of April 11, 1986; to the Committees \non Appropriations; and the Budget:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  America is emerging from the worst recession in generations. In 2010, \nan economy that had been shrinking began to grow again. After nearly 2 \nyears of job losses, America's businesses added more than one million \njobs. Our capital and credit markets are functioning and strong. \nManufacturing is coming back. And after teetering on the brink of \nliquidation just 2 years ago, America's auto industry is posting \nhealthy gains and returning money to the taxpayers who helped it \nthrough a period of turmoil. The determination and resilience of the \nAmerican people and the tough choices we made over the past 2 years \nhelped to pull our economy back from the brink of a second Great \nDepression.\n  Two years after those dark days, the stock market is booming. \nCorporations are posting record profits. Momentum is building. Yet, in \nAmerica, we have always had a broader measure of economic health. We \nbelieve in a country where everyone who is willing to work for it has \nthe opportunity to get ahead; where the small businessperson with a \ndream or entrepreneur with a great new idea has their best chance to \nmake them a reality; where any child can go as far as their talent and \ntenacity will take them. That is the genius of America. That spirit is \nwhat has built the greatest prosperity the world has ever known.\n  So even as recovery begins to take hold, we have more work to do to \nlive up to our promise by repairing the damage this brutal recession \nhas inflicted on our people, generating millions of new jobs, and \nseizing the economic opportunities of this competitive, new century.\n  These must be the priorities as we put together our Budget for the \ncoming year. The fiscal realities we face require hard choices. A \ndecade of deficits, compounded by the effects of the recession and the \nsteps we had to take to break it, as well as the chronic failure to \nconfront difficult decisions, has put us on an unsustainable course. \nThat's why my Budget lays out a path for how we can pay down these \ndebts and free the American economy from their burden.\n  But in an increasingly competitive world in which jobs and businesses \nare mobile, we also have a responsibility to invest in those things \nthat are absolutely critical to preparing our people and our Nation for \nthe economic competition of our time.\n  We do this by investing in and reforming education and job training \nso that all Americans have the skills necessary to compete in the \nglobal economy. We do this by encouraging American innovation and \ninvesting in research and development--especially in the job-creating \nindustries of tomorrow such as clean energy. We do this by rebuilding \nAmerica's infrastructure so that U.S. companies can ship their products \nand ideas from every corner in America to anywhere in the world. And \nfinally, we do this by coming together as Americans, not Democrats or \nRepublicans, to make the tough choices that get America's fiscal house \nin order, investing in what works, cutting what doesn't, and changing \nthe way business is done in Washington.\n  Growing the economy and spurring job creation by America's \nbusinesses, large and small, is my top priority. That's why, over the \ncourse of the last year, I pushed for additional measures to jump-start \nour economic recovery: tax credits for businesses that hire unemployed \nworkers; assistance to States to prevent the layoffs of teachers; and \ntax cuts and expanded access to credit for small businesses. At the end \nof the year, I signed into law a measure that provided tax cuts for 159 \nmillion workers saving the typical worker $1,000 per year. And the same \nlaw extended important tax credits to help families make ends meet and \nafford to send their kids to college. This bipartisan tax cut plan also \ngave businesses two powerful incentives to invest and create jobs: 100 \npercent expensing on the purchase of equipment and an extension of the \nresearch and experimentation tax credit.\n  Moreover, my Administration has moved aggressively to open markets \nabroad and boost exports of American made goods and services, signing a \nnew trade agreement with South Korea, the twelfth-largest economy in \nthe world. And last month, I laid out a balanced approach to regulation \nthat is pragmatic, driven by data, and that will protect the health and \nwell-being of the American people and help lay the groundwork for \neconomic growth and job creation.\n  These steps will help the economy this year. But it is also essential \nthat we take stock and look to the future--to what kind of America we \nwant to see emerge from this crisis and take shape for the generations \nof Americans to come. This Budget lays out our roadmap not just for how \nwe should invest in our economy next year, but how we should start \npreparing our Nation to grow, create good jobs, and compete in the \nworld economy in the years ahead.\n  At its heart is a recognition that we live in a world fundamentally \ndifferent than the one of previous generations. Revolutions in \ncommunication and technology have made businesses mobile and commerce \nglobal. Today, a company can set up shop, hire workers, and sell their \nproducts wherever there is an Internet connection. It is a \ntransformation that has touched off a fierce competition among nations \nfor the jobs and industries of the future.\n  The winners of this competition will be the countries that have the \nmost skilled and educated workers; a serious commitment to research and \ntechnology; and access to quality infrastructure like roads and \nairports, high-speed rail, and high-speed Internet. These are the seeds \nof economic growth in the 21st century. Where they are planted, the \nmost jobs and businesses will take root.\n  In the last century, America's economic leadership in the world went \nunchallenged. Now, it is up to us to make sure that we maintain that \nleadership in this century. At this moment, the most important contest \nwe face as a Nation is not between Democrats and Republicans or \nliberals and conservatives. It's between America and our economic \ncompetitors around the world.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that we can win this competition. The \nUnited States is home to the world's best universities and research \nfacilities, the most brilliant scientists, the brightest minds, and \nsome of the hardest-working, most entrepreneurial people on Earth. But \nour leadership is not guaranteed unless we redouble our efforts in the \nrace for the future.\n  In a generation, we've fallen from first place to ninth place in the \nproportion of our young people with college degrees. We lag behind \nother nations in the quality of our math and science education. The \nroads and bridges that connect the corners of our country and made our \neconomy grow by leaps and bounds after World War II are aging and in \nneed of repair. Our rail and air traffic systems are in need of \nmodernization, and our mobile networks and high-speed Internet access \nhave not kept pace with some of our rivals,\n\n[[Page S680]]\n\nputting America's businesses and our people at a competitive \ndisadvantage.\n  In 1957, when the Soviet Union beat us into space by launching a \nsatellite called Sputnik, it was a wake-up call that caused the United \nStates to boost our investment in innovation and education--\nparticularly in math and science. As a result, we not only surpassed \nthe Soviets, we developed new American technologies, industries, and \njobs. Fifty years later, our generation's Sputnik moment has arrived. \nOur challenge is not building a new satellite, but to rebuild our \neconomy. If the recession has taught us anything, it is that we cannot \ngo back to an economy driven by too much spending, too much borrowing, \nand the paper profits of financial speculation. We must rebuild on a \nnew, stronger foundation for economic growth. We need to do what \nAmerica has always been known for: building, innovating, and educating. \nWe don't want to be a nation that simply buys and consumes products \nfrom other countries. We want to create and sell products all over the \nworld that are stamped with three simple words: ``Made in America.''\n  My Budget makes investments that can help America win this \ncompetition and transform our economy, and it does so fully aware of \nthe very difficult fiscal situation we face. When I took the oath of \noffice 2 years ago, my Administration was left an annual deficit of \n$1.3 trillion, or 9.2 percent of GDP, and a projected 10-year deficit \nof more than $8 trillion. These deficits were the result of a previous \n8 years of not paying for programs--notably, two large tax cuts and a \nnew Medicare prescription drug benefit--as well as the financial crisis \nand recession that exacerbated our fiscal situation as revenue \ndecreased and automatic Government outlays increased to counter the \nrecession and cushion its impact.\n  We took many steps to re-establish fiscal responsibility, from \ninstituting a statutory pay-as-you-go rule for spending to going line \nby line through the budget looking for outdated, ineffective, or \nduplicative programs to cut or reform. And, most importantly, we \nenacted the Affordable Care Act. Along with giving Americans more \naffordable choices and freedom from insurance company abuses, reform of \nour health care system will, according to the latest analysis by the \nnon-partisan Congressional Budget Office, reduce our budget deficits by \nmore than $200 billion in its first decade and more than $1 trillion \nover the second.\n  Now that the threat of a depression has passed, and economic growth \nis beginning to take hold, taking further steps toward reducing our \nlong-term deficit has to be a priority, and it is in this Budget. The \nreason is simple: in the long run, we will not be able to compete with \ncountries like China if we keep borrowing more and more from countries \nlike China. That's why in this Budget, I put forward a number of steps \nto put us on a fiscally sustainable path.\n  First, I am proposing a 5-year freeze on all discretionary spending \noutside of security. This is not an across-the-board cut, but rather an \noverall freeze with investments in areas critical for long-term \neconomic growth and job creation. A commonsense approach where we cut \nwhat doesn't work and invest in those things that make America stronger \nand our people more prosperous. Over a decade, this freeze will save \nmore than $400 billion, cut non-security funding to the lowest share of \nthe economy since at least 1962, and put the discretionary budget on a \nsustainable trajectory.\n  Making these spending cuts will require tough choices and sacrifices. \nOne of them is the 2-year freeze on Federal civilian worker salaries. \nThis is in no way a reflection on the dedicated service of Federal \nworkers, but rather a necessary belt-tightening measure during these \ndifficult times when so many private sector workers are facing similar \ncuts. This Budget also includes many terminations and reductions to \nprograms across the entire Federal Government. These cuts include many \nprograms whose mission I care deeply about, but meeting our fiscal \ntargets while investing in our future demands no less. All told, we \nhave put forward more than 200 terminations and reductions for over $30 \nbillion in savings.\n  Even in areas outside the freeze, we are looking for ways to save \nmoney and cut unnecessary costs. At the Department of Defense, for \ninstance, we are reducing its funding by $78 billion over the next 5 \nyears on a course for zero real growth in funding. To do this, \nSecretary Gates is pursuing a package of terminations, consolidations, \nand efficiencies that include, for example, the elimination of the \nMarine Corps Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle; the consolidation of four \nAir Force air operations centers into two; and reducing the number of \nGenerals and Admirals by more than 100. And throughout the entire \nGovernment, we are continuing our efforts to make Government programs \nand services work better and cost less: using competition and high \nstandards to get the most from the grants we award, getting rid of \nexcess Federal real estate, and saving billions of dollars by cutting \noverhead and administrative costs.\n  Second, I continue to oppose the permanent extension of the 2001 and \n2003 tax cuts for families making more than $250,000 a year and a more \ngenerous estate tax benefiting only the very largest estates. While I \nhad to accept these measures for 2 more years as a part of a compromise \nthat prevented a large tax increase on middle-class families and \nsecured crucial job-creating support for our economy, these policies \nwere unfair and unaffordable when enacted and remain so today. I will \npush for their expiration in 2012. Moreover, for too long we have \ntolerated a tax system that's a complex, inefficient, and loophole-\nriddled mess. For instance, year after year we go deeper into deficit \nand debt to pay to prevent the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) from \nhurting many middle-class families. As a start, my Budget proposes a 3-\nyear fix to the AMT that is paid for by an across-the-board 30 percent \nreduction in itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers. My \nAdministration will work with the Congress on a long-term offset for \nthese costs.\n  Third, to address looming, long-term challenges to our fiscal health, \nthe Budget addresses future liabilities in the unemployment insurance \nsystem; the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which protects the \npensions of workers whose companies have failed; and the Federal \nHousing Administration, which plays a critical role in affordable \nhousing. It also is committed to implementing the Affordable Care Act \nswiftly and efficiently since rising health care costs are the single \nbiggest driver of our long-term fiscal problems. Finally, as a down \npayment toward a permanent fix, the Budget proposes additional reforms \nto our health care system that would be sufficient to pay for 2 years \nof fixing the Medicare's sustainable growth rate, thus preventing a \nlarge cut in Medicare reimbursements for doctors that would jeopardize \ncare for older Americans.\n  In addition, I believe that we need to act now to secure and \nstrengthen Social Security for future generations. Social Security is a \nsolemn commitment to America's seniors that we must preserve. That is \nwhy I have laid out my principles for reform and look forward to \nworking with the Congress on ensuring Social Security's compact for \nfuture generations.\n  As we move to rein in our deficits, we must do so in a way that does \nnot cut back on those investments that have the biggest impact on our \neconomic growth because the best antidote to a growing deficit is a \ngrowing economy. So even as we pursue cuts and savings in the months \nahead, we must fund those investments that will help America win the \nrace for the jobs and industries of the future--investments in \neducation, innovation, and infrastructure.\n  In an era where most new jobs will require some kind of higher \neducation, we have to keep investing in the skills of our workers and \nthe education of our children. And that's why we are on our way to \nmeeting the goal I set when I took office: by 2020, America will once \nagain have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.\n  To get there, we are making college more affordable for millions of \nstudents, through the extension of the American Opportunity Tax Cut and \nmaintaining our historic expansion of the Pell Grant program while \nputting it on firm financial footing. We are taking large steps toward \nmy goal of preparing 100,000 science, technology, engineering, and \nmathematics teachers over the next decade. And we are continuing our \nreform of elementary and secondary education--not from the top-down, \nbut from the bottom-up. Instead\n\n[[Page S681]]\n\nof indiscriminately pouring money into a system that doesn't always \nwork, we are challenging schools and States to compete in a ``Race to \nthe Top'' to see who can come up with reforms that raise standards, \nrecruit and retain good teachers, and raise student achievement, \nespecially in math and science. We are expanding the ``Race to the \nTop'' to school districts, and since in today's economy learning must \nlast a lifetime, we are extending this competitive framework to early \nchildhood education, universities and colleges, and job training.\n  Once our students graduate with the skills they need for the jobs of \nthe future, we also need to make sure those jobs end up in America. In \ntoday's high-tech, global economy, that means the United States must be \nthe best place to do business and the best place to innovate. That will \ntake reforming our tax code, and I am calling for immediate action to \nrid the corporate tax code of special interest loopholes and to lower \nthe corporate rate to restore competitiveness and encourage job \ncreation--while not adding a dime to the deficit.\n  And since many companies do not invest in basic research that does \nnot have an immediate pay off, we--as a Nation--must devote our \nresources to these fundamental areas of scientific inquiry. In this \nBudget, we are increasing our investment in research and development \nthat contributes to fields as varied as biomedicine, cyber-security, \nnano-technology, and advanced manufacturing. We are eliminating \nsubsidies to fossil fuels and instead making a significant investment \nin clean energy technology--boosting our investment in this high-growth \nfield by a third--because the country that leads in clean energy will \nlead in the global economy. Through a range of programs and tax \nincentives, this Budget supports my goals of the United States becoming \nthe first country to have one million electric vehicles on the road by \n2015 and for us to reach a point by 2035 where 80 percent of our \nelectricity will come from clean energy sources. We also are working \ntoward a 20 percent decrease in energy usage in commercial and \ninstitutional buildings by 2020, complementing our ongoing efforts to \nimproving the efficiency of the residential sector. If this is truly \nour Sputnik moment, we need a commitment to innovation that we have not \nseen since President Kennedy challenged us to go to the moon.\n  To flourish in the global economy, we need a world-class \ninfrastructure--the roads, rails, runways, and information \nsuperhighways that are fundamental to commerce. Over the last 2 years, \nour investments in infrastructure projects already have led to hundreds \nof thousands of good private sector jobs and begun upgrading our \ninfrastructure across the country. But we still have a long way to go.\n  In this Budget, I am proposing a historic investment in repairing, \nrebuilding, and modernizing our transportation infrastructure. The \nBudget features an immediate, up-front investment of $50 billion to \nboth generate jobs now and lay a foundation for future economic growth. \nLooking toward the future, the Budget provides funds to develop and \ndramatically expand access to high-speed rail as well as the creation \nof a National Infrastructure Bank to support projects critical to our \nnational competitiveness. While this transportation bill is a major \ninvestment of funds, it is also a major reform of how transportation \nfunds have been invested in the past. We are committing to paying for \nour surface transportation plan and making it subject to the Congress' \npay-as-you-go law; to consolidating duplicative, earmarked programs; \nand to making tens of billions of dollars of funds subject to a \ncompetitive ``Race to the Top'' process.\n\n  And looking to what we will need to thrive in the 21st century, I am \nproposing an ambitious effort to speed the development of a cutting-\nedge, high-speed wireless data network that will reach across our \ncountry to 98 percent of Americans and provide for the needs of both \nour citizens and our first responders. We are the Nation that built the \ntranscontinental railroad and the first airplanes to take flight. We \nconstructed a massive interstate highway system and introduced the \nInternet to the world. America has always been built to compete, and if \nwe want to attract the best jobs and businesses to our shores, we have \nto be that Nation again.\n  Finally, to make it easier for our businesses and workers to sell \ntheir products all over the globe, we are working toward our goal of \ndoubling U.S. exports by 2014. This will take specific efforts to open \nup markets and promote American goods and services. It also will take \nmaintaining American leadership abroad and ensuring our security at \nhome. This Budget invests in all elements of our national power--\nincluding our military--to achieve our goals of winding down the war in \nIraq; defeating al Qaeda in Afghanistan and around the world; reducing \nthe threat of nuclear weapons; and preparing our Nation for emerging \nthreats. We also invest resources to provide for our men and women in \nuniform and to honor the service of our veterans. And we do this all \nwith an eye to cutting waste, finding efficiencies, and focusing \nresources on what is essential to our security.\n  Throughout our history, the investments this Budget makes--in \neducation, innovation, and infrastructure--have commanded support from \nboth Democrats and Republicans. It was Abraham Lincoln who launched the \ntranscontinental railroad and opened the National Academy of Sciences; \nDwight Eisenhower who helped build our highways; and Republican Members \nof Congress who worked with Franklin Roosevelt to pass the GI Bill. In \nour own time, leaders from both sides of the aisle have come together \nto invest in our infrastructure, create incentives for research and \ndevelopment, and support education reform such as those my \nAdministration has been pursuing. Moreover, when faced with tough, \nfiscal challenges, our country's leaders have come together to find a \nway forward to save Social Security in the 1980s and balance the budget \nin the 1990s.\n  There are no inherent ideological differences that should prevent \nDemocrats and Republicans from making our economy more competitive with \nthe rest of the world. We are all Americans, and we are all in this \nrace together. So those of us who work in Washington have a choice to \nmake in this coming year: we can focus on what is necessary for each \nparty to win the news cycle or the next election, or we can focus on \nwhat is necessary for America to win the future.\n  I believe we must do what this moment demands, and do what we must to \nspur job creation and make the United States competitive in the world \neconomy. For as difficult as the times may be, the good news is that we \nknow what the future could look like for the United States. We can see \nit in the classrooms that are experimenting with groundbreaking reforms \nand giving children new math and science skills at an early age. We can \nsee it in the wind farms and advanced battery factories that are \nopening across America. We can see it in the laboratories and research \nfacilities all over this country that are churning out discoveries and \nturning them into new startups and new jobs.\n  And when you meet these children and their teachers, these scientists \nand technicians, and these entrepreneurs and their employees, you come \naway knowing that despite all we have been through these past 2 years, \nwe will succeed. The idea of America is alive and well. As long as \nthere are people willing to dream, willing to work hard, and willing to \nlook past the disagreements of the moment to focus on the future we \nshare, I have no doubt that this will be remembered as another American \ncentury.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 14, 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/14/senate-section/article/S681-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       H.R. 359.

A bill to name the Department of Veterans Affairs telehealth \nclinic in Craig, Colorado, as the ``Major William Edward Adams \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Clinic''; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to \nsupport legislation I am introducing today to name the Veterans \nTelehealth Clinic in Craig, Colorado, after Medal of Honor recipient \nMajor William E. Adams. I am pleased that Senator Bennet will join with \nme in introducing this bill.\n  Our bill isn't the first effort to honor Major Adams. My good friend \nCongressman John Salazar introduced this legislation last year in the \nHouse of Representatives with the support of the entire Colorado \ndelegation. I would like to see this bill through to passage in this \nCongress in part to honor John and his efforts to commemorate the \nheroism of Major Adams and to get the VA clinic established in \nnorthwest Colorado.\n  I'd also like to honor Larry Neu, a local business owner and Veterans \nof Foreign Wars Post 4265 quartermaster, who has been the architect of \nefforts to commemorate Major Adams. With Larry's leadership and the \nhelp of other Craig residents, the Colorado state legislature passed a \nresolution renaming part of Colorado Highway 13 the ``Maj. William \nAdams Medal of Honor Highway.'' I know he worked closely with \nCongressman Salazar in the last Congress to develop the legislation I \nam introducing today.\n  Above all, this bill is intended to honor Major William Adams himself \nand his ``conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life \nabove and beyond the call of duty.''\n  A resident of Craig, Major Adams served and lost his life in the \nVietnam War. He was awarded the Medal of Honor posthumously, after \ndistinguishing himself while serving as an Army helicopter pilot. In \nMay 1971, he volunteered to fly a lightly armed helicopter in an \nattempt to evacuate three seriously wounded soldiers from a small base \nthat was under attack. He made the decision with full knowledge that \nnumerous antiaircraft weapons were positioned around the base and that \nthe clear weather would make him visible to enemy gunners. As he \napproached the base, the enemy gunners opened fire, but he continued \nhis approach, directing the attacks of supporting gunships while \nmaintaining control of the helicopter he was flying. He picked up the \nwounded soldiers, but his aircraft was then struck and damaged by enemy \nanti-aircraft fire and crashed.\n  I was pleased to learn that many of his family members attended the \nceremony in November dedicating part of Colorado Highway 13 to Major \nAdams. I want to pay tribute today to his wife Sandra and his daughter \nJean, both Colorado residents, and his son, Col. John Adams, an \nintelligence officer in the Marine Corps, recently back from \nAfghanistan. I hope this bill serves to reinforce what they already \nknow--that Major Adams is a real hero to this county, to Colorado and \nto Craig. He is part of a special class of American heroes who will \nforever be remembered for their service and sacrifice. His story will \ncontinue inspiring generations to come, while reminding us all about \nthe contributions and sacrifices of America's greatest.\n  I have introduced this legislation not only to recognize the \nsacrifice of Major Adams, but also to recognize the service of our \nVietnam veterans and especially all veterans in Northwest Colorado. The \nTelehealth Clinic in Craig is on track to have nearly 1700 visits from \narea veterans this year, and I will always fight to make sure our \nveterans get the health care they earned and deserve.\n  As Larry Neu said about Major Adams, ``The man made the ultimate \nsacrifice for his country--he should not be forgotten.'' Passage of \nthis bill will help us remember Major Adams and so many other brave \nveterans who have sacrificed their lives for our country. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation and to continue to support our \ndedicated men and women in uniform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 332. A bill to promote the enforcement of immigration laws and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the \nStrengthening Our Commitment to Legal Immigration and America's \nSecurity Act. There is little doubt that our immigration system is \nbroken and needs reform. Yet, we can make progress by starting with the \nlaws that already exist. The proposed legislation would enhance our \ncore immigration and enforcement laws for both legal and illegal \nimmigrants.\n\n[[Page S685]]\n\n  When I first introduced my bill last September, I mentioned that it \nrepresents countless hours of conversation and feedback from my \nconstituents. This bill is a common-sense approach on how best to \nenforce and tighten-up our immigration laws.\n  Of course, securing the actual physical border should remain our top \npriority. However, we cannot ignore the residual problems caused by a \nporous border. The weakness of a porous border has been experienced by \ncommunities across the country--draining all facets of local resources, \nincluding public safety, welfare programs, and medical assistance.\n  By no means is the proposed legislation intended to be a \ncomprehensive immigration reform bill. Rather, it is focused on \nenforcement and accountability of existing immigration laws and \nprograms. There is much that remains to be done before we can tackle \ncomprehensive immigration reform. But this bill is the next step toward \nstrengthening our immigration laws.\n  The Strengthening Our Commitment to Legal Immigration and America's \nSecurity Act will curb identity theft and techniques that have been \nexploited by the illegal alien community; stop the abuse by this \nadministration from granting mass parole or deferral to illegal aliens; \nhelp prevent Mexican drug cartels from growing marijuana in our \nnational parks and on our public lands; and prevent so-called sanctuary \ncities by requiring law enforcement agencies that are selected and \nenrolled in the 287(g) and Secure Communities programs to fully comply \nwith the established requirements.\n  There is a need for accurate accounting to track the flow of federal \nand state welfare dollars given to illegal aliens and ensure that U.S. \ncitizens are the first to receive Federal health benefits. \nAdditionally, my bill would rectify a gaping hole in our visa system by \nrequiring the Department of Homeland Security to create a mandatory \nvisa exit procedure that would track the departure of our foreign \nvisitors to the United States; provide that gang members will be \nineligible to receive a visa for travel to our country; and direct the \nState Department to examine the Diversity Visa program, which in the \npast has been wrought with fraud and abuse.\n  I do not think anyone could disagree with the substance of the \nStrengthening Our Commitment to Legal Immigration and America's \nSecurity Act. It touches on some of the more overlooked, but critical \nareas of our broken immigration system. Moreover, I believe these steps \ncan be enacted in a bipartisan fashion without creating a host of new \nprograms and revenue streams. I encourage my colleagues to work with me \nto move this bill forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 338. A bill to prohibit royalty incentives for deepwater drilling, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nDeepwater Drilling Royalty Relief Prohibition Act.\n  The purpose of this bill is to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not \nused to incentivize the dangerous and often dirty business of offshore \ndrilling in deep waters.\n  Over the past two decades, Congress has established a number of \nroyalty-relief programs to encourage domestic exploration and \nproduction in deep waters. This may have made sense in times when oil \nprices were too low to provide energy companies with an incentive to \ndrill in difficult places. It may have made sense before we were ready \nto deploy large scale renewable energy production.\n  But it no longer makes sense today.\n  The Deepwater Horizon catastrophe showed that safety and response \ntechnologies are not sufficient in deep waters. The President's \nNational Oil Spill Commission pointed out that while offshore oil and \ngas will remain part of the nation's energy portfolio for years to \ncome, we need to ``begin a transition to a cleaner, more energy-\nefficient future.'' I agree.\n  I believe that taxpayer-funded incentives should go to clean, \nrenewable energy, not deepwater oil drilling. It's time that we roll-\nback incentives for the riskiest, least environmentally friendly non-\nrenewable energy production.\n  The disastrous impacts of the Deepwater Horizon explosion illustrate \nthe enormous environmental and safety risks of offshore drilling--\nparticularly in deep waters. 11 people died and 17 others were injured \nwhen the Deepwater Horizon caught fire. Oil and gas rushed into the \nGulf of Mexico for 87 days before the well was finally plugged. The \nscope of the disaster was tremendous.\n  Oil slicks spread across the Gulf of Mexico, pelicans and other \nwildlife struggled to free themselves from crude oil, tar balls spoiled \nthe pristine white sand beaches of Florida, wetlands were coated with \ntoxic sludge, more than \\1/3\\ of Federal waters in the Gulf were closed \nto fishing, and oyster beds could take years to recover, the plumes of \nunderwater oil may have created zones of toxicity or low oxygen for \naquatic life, and the response techniques, such as the use of \ndispersants, may have their own toxic consequences to both wildlife and \nthe spill response workers.\n  The impacts of an oil spill are so dramatic and devastating, it seems \nclear to me that this is not an area in which we should be subsidizing \ndevelopment.\n  Things have not improved much since the oil spill in 1969 off the \nCalifornia Coast near Santa Barbara. Like the Deepwater Horizon \ndisaster, the Santa Barbara spill was caused by a natural gas blowout \nwhen pressure in the drill hole fluctuated. It was successfully plugged \nwith mud and cement after 11 and a half days, but oil and gas continued \nto seep for months. The Santa Barbara spill was devastating, but it was \na tiny fraction of the size of the Deepwater Horizon spill.\n  Technology 40 years ago was not good enough to prevent a disaster. We \ndiscovered last summer that today's technology is no better at \npreventing well-head blowouts.\n  The Deepwater Horizon drill rig was less than 10 years old when it \nexploded. A similar accident that caused the 2009 spill in the Montara \noil and gas field in the Timor Sea--one of the worst in Australia's \nhistory--was even newer, designed and built in 2007. That spill \ncontinued unchecked for 74 days.\n  The failures that led to these catastrophes were human and \ntechnological. While measures are being put in place to remedy these \ndeficiencies, the risks remain high and the potential damage immense. \nIn deep waters, the risks are higher and the scope of the damage even \ngreater.\n  Drilling in deep waters is not the type of activity that tax-payer \ndollars should subsidize.\n  Drilling in deep water presents even more challenges than drilling in \nshallow water or on shore. This was demonstrated during the Deepwater \nHorizon disaster.\n  Methane hydrate crystals form when methane gas mixes with pressurized \ncold ocean waters--and the likelihood of these crystals forming \nincreases dramatically at a depth of about 400 meters.\n  These crystals interfere with response and containment technologies. \nThey formed in the cofferdam dome that was lowered onto the gushing oil \nin the Gulf, which failed to stop the oil in the early days of the \nspill. And when a remotely operated underwater vehicle bumped the \nvalves in the ``top hat'' device, the containment cap had to be removed \nand slowly replaced to prevent formation of these crystals again.\n  In order to drill at deeper depths, many technical difficulties must \nbe overcome.\n  The ocean currents on the surface and in the water column exert \ntorque pressure on the pipes and cables, which are longer and heavier.\n  The water temperature decreases closer to the sea floor, but the \nearth's core temperature increases the deeper the well--sometimes \nreaching temperatures in excess of 350 degrees Fahrenheit.\n  The ocean pressure increases dramatically at depth, but the pressure \nin a well can exceed 10,000 pounds per square inch.\n  Drills must be able to pass through tar and salts, and the well bores \nmust remain intact.\n  The volume of drilling mud and fluids is greater, the weight of the \ncables heavier, and many technical procedures can only be accomplished \nwith the use of remotely operated vehicles thousands of feet below the \nsurface.\n\n[[Page S686]]\n\n  American taxpayers should not forego revenue in order to incentivize \noffshore drilling. It is not good environmental policy, and it's not \ngood energy policy either.\n  We need to move to cleaner renewable fuels.\n  I believe that global warming is the biggest environmental crisis we \nface--and the biggest culprit of global warming is manmade emissions \nproduced by the combustion of fossil fuels like oil and coal.\n  Taxpayer funded incentives should not finance production of fossil \nfuels--particularly in places where the production itself poses \npotential devastation. Instead, incentives should be used to develop \nand deploy clean energy technologies like wind and solar.\n  I have worked with my colleagues on a number of legislative \ninitiatives designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase \nenergy efficiency and incentivize the use of renewable energy.\n  One of our biggest victories was the enactment of the aggressive fuel \neconomy law, called the Ten in Ten Fuel Economy Act, which was passed \nby Congress and signed into law by then-President Bush in the 110th \nCongress. This law, which I authored with Senator Snowe, will improve \nfuel economy standards for passenger vehicles at the maximum feasible \nrate.\n  The good news is that the Administration has taken the framework of \nthis law and implemented aggressive standards that require raising \nfleetwide fuel economy to 35.5 mpg in 2016--a 40 percent increase above \ntoday's standard.\n  The other positive development is that the domestic renewable energy \nindustry has grown dramatically over the last few years. In 2009, the \nUnited States added more new capacity to produce renewable electricity \nthan it did to produce electricity from natural gas, oil, and coal \ncombined. A great deal of this growth can be attributed to government \nrenewable energy incentives. That is where public investment in energy \ndevelopment should go.\n  It is clear that the clean energy sector is the next frontier in jobs \ncreation.\n  We need to ensure that developers can access financing to launch \nwind, solar and geothermal projects, so that they can put people to \nwork. Programs like Treasury Grant Program have been very successful in \nencouraging private investment in this sector. So far, the program has \nhelped to bring more than 1,880 renewable energy projects online.\n  The program, however, is set to expire at the end of this year if we \ndon't act. I'm working on legislation that will extend and expand this \nsuccessful program.\n  All told, these types of measures are helping to foster the \nincentives that will push the United States to adopt a cleaner energy \nfuture, and to move away from fossil fuels.\n  Let me make one final point very clear: I don't believe oil companies \nneed taxpayer dollars to help them out. They are already reaping record \nprofits.\n  In 2009, the top 10 U.S. oil companies' combined revenues were almost \n$850 billion. And while all results are not yet in on 2010, it is clear \nthat oil companies did even better last year.\n  Exxon Mobil reported $30 billion in profit, up 57 percent from 2009.\n  Shell reported $19 billion in profit, up 90 percent from 2009.\n  Conoco Phillips raked in $11.4 billion in profit during 2010, a \nwhopping 159 percent increase over its 2009 profits.\n  Yet we continue to use taxpayer dollars to add to their bottom line. \nThis is unacceptable.\n  Oil reserves are a public resource. When a private company profits \nfrom those public resources, American taxpayers should also benefit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and ensure that \nroyalties owed to the taxpayers are not waived to incentivize risky \noff-shore drilling. In these critical economic times, every cent of the \npeople's money should be spent wisely.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 338\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the special rule for contributions of qualified conservation \ncontributions; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nHeritage Conservation Extension Act.\n  In the last few months, our nation has engaged in a discourse about \nresponsibility. No one can deny that our job is to promote the \nprotection of American interests and investment in our future. I am \nintroducing this bill today, because we have a responsibility to \nprotect one of our country's most precious resources: our land.\n  When I visit with ranchers and farmers across my home state of \nMontana, it's clear to me they want to preserve open space on their \nland for their kids and grandkids. Together with Montana farmers and \nranchers and the Montana Land Reliance, which is dedicated to \nprotecting agricultural production, we've come up with a commonsense \nproposal. This is a plan we developed together based on teamwork and \nour common goal to leave our land in better shape than we found it for \nfuture generations.\n  As we all know, we are losing precious agricultural and ranch lands \nat a record pace. But our soil is worth more more than just the \nnutritious foods and natural resources it produces. When we lose our \nland, we lose the natural habitat of our wildlife and open spaces for \nour communities. It is our job to protect the land for future \ngenerations and to support the farmers, ranchers and other landowners \nwho rely on it to make a living.\n  Many Montana farmers and ranchers are land rich, but cash poor. These \nlandowners make a modest living off the land and, in this economy, need \nthe right tools to move toward conservation.\n  That is why Congress provides targeted income tax relief to small \nfarmers and ranchers who wish make a charitable contribution of \nqualified conservation easements. This allows eligible farmers and \nranchers to increase the deduction they can take for charitable \ncontributions of qualified conservation easements. The provision allows \nfarmers and ranchers to do this by increasing the current adjusted \ngross income limitations from 50 percent to 100 percent and extending \nthe carryover period from five to 15 years. In the case of all \nlandowners, the AGI limitation was raised from 30 percent to 50 \npercent. This provision will expire at the end of this year. It is time \nto make this provision permanent--and that is what our Rural Heritage \nConservation Extension Act will do.\n  Conservation easements sometimes take years to work out. These tax \nbreaks are meant to streamline the process and help those folks who \nstruggle with cash flow but believe in the value of conserving our \nagricultural lands for future generations.\n  Conversation easements continue to be an effective land management \ntool in Montana, and across the country. We currently have over two \nmillion acres covered by conservation easements. To some, that may seem \nlike a\n\n[[Page S687]]\n\nlarge amount, but, in Montana, those easements are only 2.1 percent of \nthe total State land area. Montana has begun to recognize the \nimportance of using conservation easements to preserve our lands. I \nbelieve that now is the time for our state, and the entire country to \ndo even more.\n  It is time to say, ``We believe in the environment. We believe that \nlandowners should be able to afford to choose conservation over \ndevelopment.'' Let us remove the uncertainty and build on the success \nof what we have already begun to do. Let's pass the Rural Heritage \nConservation Extension Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 340. An original bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \nto extend the funding and expenditure authority of the Airport and \nAirway Trust Fund, and for other purposes; from the Committee on \nFinance; placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today Chairman Baucus filed an original \nbill and an amendment to the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA, bill \ncurrently being considered by the Senate. Both of these items are \nidentical. They reflect the revenue title to the FAA bill that was \nreported by the Finance Committee last Tuesday. I am hopeful that this \nheralds the passage of long-term FAA reauthorization and represents a \nbreak with our ongoing pattern of funding the FAA with short-term \nextensions of current law.\n  In most respects the Finance Committee product reflects the FAA bill \nthat was passed unanimously last year with 93 votes. However, there is \na very important difference. Thanks to an amendment filed by Senator \nCoburn, who is a new member of the Finance Committee, only 90 percent \nof forecasted revenues to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for a given \nyear will be spent. Over the past several years the uncommitted cash \nbalance remaining in the trust fund has steadily decreased because \nactual revenues have fallen short of forecast revenues. Since \nrecipients of trust fund revenues expect to be paid in real dollars and \nnot forecasted dollars, it makes sense to make sure the trust fund \ncontains actual dollars. By allowing only 90 percent of forecast trust \nfund revenues to be spent, we are putting in place a 10 percent cushion \nto guard against the frequent occurrence that actual trust fund \nrevenues will fall short of projected revenues.\n  The Finance Committee product also increases the amount general \naviation and fractional aircraft will pay for each gallon of jet fuel \nthey use. These increases will impact neither commercial airlines nor \npassengers of commercial airlines. The cost of fuel for commercial \naviation is not changed at all by the Finance Committee product. What \nmakes the increases of the costs borne by the general aviation and \nfractional communities unique is that both groups are active supporters \nof these increases. As these letters explain, the increases in the cost \nof jet fuel are supported because the proceeds will help our airport \nand airway system transition to the Next Generation Air Transportation \nSystem, or NextGen. NextGen is the satellite-based air traffic control \nsystem that is slated to replace our current radar-based system. The \ntransition to NextGen is expected to reduce inefficiencies within and \nenhance the benefits of our airport and airway system.\n  In closing, I want to thank Chairman Baucus and the other Members of \nthe Finance Committee for their work on the revenue title to the FAA \nbill, and I hope for the rapid completion of FAA reauthorization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  General Aviation\n\n\n                                    Manufacturers Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 31, 2011.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Senate Finance Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Finance Committee, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Senator Hatch: On behalf of the \n     seventy members of the General Aviation Manufacturers \n     Association (GAMA), I am writing in strong support of the tax \n     title to the ``FAA Air Transportation Modernization and \n     Safety Improvement Act'' which will be considered by the \n     Senate this week.\n       As you know, this legislation is identical to the FAA \n     reauthorization bill that passed in the Senate last year. The \n     tax title of the bill, which was drafted by the Finance \n     Committee, includes an increase in the excise tax on jet-fuel \n     used in general aviation operations. The funding raised by \n     this fuel tax increase will be placed in an account within \n     the Airport and Airway Trust Fund to help fund air traffic \n     control modernization programs.\n       In previous Congresses, our members have supported the fuel \n     tax increase included in the bill because we strongly support \n     modernization and are willing to pay more to help complete \n     it. We believe that the Finance Committee has examined this \n     issue thoroughly and that its actions will help move the bill \n     quickly through Congress and put us on the right path towards \n     modernization.\n       In conclusion, we support the tax title to the FAA \n     reauthorization bill and thank the committee for being \n     receptive to our views during this process. We look forward \n     to working with you as the bill proceeds through Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Peter J. Bunce,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      National Air\n\n\n                                   Transportation Association,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, February 3, 2011.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Hatch: The National \n     Air Transportation Association (NATA), the voice of aviation \n     business, is the public policy group representing the \n     interests of aviation businesses before the Congress, federal \n     agencies and state governments. NATA's 2,000 member companies \n     own, operate and service aircraft. These companies provide \n     for the needs of the traveling public by offering services \n     and products to aircraft operators and others such as fuel \n     sales, aircraft maintenance, parts sales, storage, rental, \n     airline servicing, flight training, Part 135 on-demand air \n     charter, fractional aircraft program management and scheduled \n     commuter operations in smaller aircraft. NATA members are a \n     vital link in the aviation industry providing services to the \n     general public, airlines, general aviation and the military.\n       On behalf of NATA, I write in support of the tax title to \n     S. 223, the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety \n     Improvement Act, which would increase the tax on general \n     aviation jet fuel. A reasonable tax increase allows general \n     aviation operators to provide more revenue to the Airport and \n     Airways Trust Fund (trust fund). General aviation fuels have \n     not had a substantial tax increase in over 15 years and, \n     despite the recent downturn in the economy, we believe the \n     current system of aviation excise taxes has proven to be a \n     stable and efficient source of revenue for the trust fund as \n     opposed to another funding mechanism that has been proposed \n     in the past few years.\n       As you know, passage of Federal Aviation Administration \n     reauthorization legislation will provide much needed funding \n     for the trust funds while ensuring that our national airspace \n     system remains safe and efficient and creating and \n     maintaining valuable jobs in the United States. Investments \n     to our aviation infrastructure will allow the modernization \n     of the Next Generation Air Transportation System to expand as \n     efficiently as possible.\n       We support a tax increase on general aviation fuels to \n     finance the trust fund in a manner that has proven successful \n     since its creation. Thank you for your attention to this \n     important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James K. Coyne,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   aircraft Owners\n\n\n                                       and Pilots Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 2011.\n     Hon.

Orrin Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Finance Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Hatch: In \n     anticipation of Senate action on S. 223, legislation to \n     reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), I am \n     writing to reiterate our support for the previously agreed to \n     tax increases in general aviation fuel taxes.\n       The stability and certainty that an FAA reauthorization \n     bill provides is vital for federal investments in safety, \n     modernizing the air traffic control system, FAA operations, \n     airport improvements and aviation research efforts.\n\n[[Page S688]]\n\n       AOPA has consistently supported using the time-tested \n     system of passenger transportation and aviation fuel taxes in \n     combination with general fund tax revenues to support the FAA \n     and the aviation system. We have consistently supported a 25 \n     percent increase in aviation gasoline and a 65 percent tax \n     increase on non-commercial jet fuel in lieu of user fees to \n     generate additional revenue to the Aviation Trust Fund for \n     air traffic control modernization.\n       Even though economic times are extremely difficult, AOPA \n     members continue to support the agreed-to increases in \n     general aviation fuel taxes and we support the inclusion of \n     this funding mechanism in the Senate FAA Reauthorization \n     Bill.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views. We look \n     forward to working with you to complete the FAA \n     Reauthorization Bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Craig L.

Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus: The National Business Aviation \n     Association (NBAA) strongly supports passage of legislation \n     to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, and urges \n     the U.S. Senate to expeditiously approve this critical \n     legislation.\n       Aviation, including business aviation, is a vital link in \n     our transportation system and powerful engine for job \n     creation and economic growth. Ensuring that the United States \n     has the largest, safest, and most efficient air \n     transportation system is clearly in our country's interest \n     and should be a national imperative.\n       NBAA represents approximately 8,000 companies that rely on \n     general aviation aircraft to help them survive and compete in \n     the marketplace. Eighty-five percent of our members are small \n     and mid-size businesses, many of whom operate to and from \n     small towns and rural communities with little or no \n     commercial airline service.\n       This legislation will greatly facilitate and accelerate the \n     transformation of our air traffic control system to the Next \n     Generation Air Traffic Control System--NextGen. As you know, \n     NextGen will increase the capacity and enhance the safety of \n     our air traffic control system. It will also reduce \n     aviation's environmental impact.\n       The legislation will provide much needed long-term \n     direction and stability to the Federal Aviation \n     Administration. The bill will enable the agency to do the \n     critical long-range planning, and make the long-range \n     investments in airport infrastructure and technology that are \n     needed to modernize and expand the system. The time to enact \n     a strong multi-year reauthorization bill is now.\n       The reauthorization bill helps fund the transformation to \n     NextGen in part through an increase in the general aviation \n     fuel tax. While no industry wants to pay additional taxes, \n     particularly during these very challenging times, NBAA \n     supports the fuel tax increase contained in this bill because \n     we believe that the rapid transformation to NextGen is \n     critically important to the vitality of the U.S. aviation \n     system.\n       We urge the Senate to expedite consideration of the FAA \n     reauthorization bill. It is important that we finalize this \n     legislation that will undoubtedly enhance safety, reduce \n     emissions, expand the system and ensure that the U.S. will \n     continue to lead the world in aviation technology.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ed Bolen.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                       NETJETS\n\n                                   Columbus, OH, February 7, 2011.\n     Hon.

Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley: As a \n     leading fractional ownership program management company here \n     in the United States, I write today in support of language \n     included within S. 223, the Federal Aviation Administration \n     (FAA) Air Transportation Modernization and Safety Improvement \n     Act, that provides for a minor change in the tax code to \n     ensure that operations of aircraft in fractional ownership \n     programs are taxed as general aviation.\n       The FAA has determined that fractionally-owned aircraft \n     operations are in fact private. However, the Internal Revenue \n     Service continues to tax the operations of such aircraft as \n     if they are commercial. The IRS made this tax determination \n     when the concept of fractional ownership was very new, and \n     before the FAA had completed its analysis and issued \n     regulations that classify fractionally-owned aircraft as non-\n     commercial general aviation.\n       To remedy this situation, we request your support for \n     language contained within S. 223 to also be included within \n     the House FAA reauthorization bill. Specifically, Section 805 \n     of S. 223, entitled, ``Treatment of Fractional Ownership \n     Operations,'' would ensure that all fractionally-owned \n     aircraft operations are taxed as non-commercial general \n     aviation.\n       We strongly support Section 805 of S. 223 and request your \n     assistance to secure this language within the House FAA \n     Reauthorization bill. Thank you for your attention to this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Jordan B. Hansell\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Ms. Murkowski) (by request):\n  S. 342. A bill to provide supplemental ex gratia compensation to the \nRepublic of the Marshall Islands for impacts of the nuclear testing \nprograms of the United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I join the Ranking Member of the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, Senator Murkowski, in \nreintroducing The Republic of the Marshall Islands Supplemental Nuclear \nCompensation Act at the request of the President of the Marshall \nIslands, the Honorable Jurelang Zedkaia.\n  This legislation tracks S. 1756, a bill that was introduced in the \n110th Congress at the request of then-President of the Republic of the \nMarshall Islands, Kessai Note, and that was ordered reported from the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources, on September 11, 2008. The \nbill was reintroduced in the 111th Congress as S. 2941 at the request \nof President Zedkaia, and it was again reported from the Committee, on \nAugust 5, 2010. Unfortunately, there was insufficient time before \nadjournment for floor consideration and to identify an offset for the \nbill's CBO-estimated cost of $58 million. It is my hope that the 112th \nCongress will move promptly to consider this bill, find any necessary \noffset, and enact this legislation as a part of our Nation's continuing \nengagement with the Marshall Islands to address the damage and injuries \nthat resulted from the nuclear weapons testing program.\n  The need for consideration of this bill is clear--to monitor and, as \nappropriate, update our Nation's continuing response to the \nconsequences of the nuclear weapons testing program conducted in the \nMarshall Islands in the 1940s and 50s.\n  For a period of 12 years, the United States detonated nuclear bombs \nin the Northern Marshall Islands that caused substantial damage and \ninjury. In 1986, with the negotiation of the compact of Free \nAssociation between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands and its approval by Public Law 99-239, the United States \n``accept[ed] the responsibility for compensation owing to citizens of \nthe Marshall Islands . . . for loss or damage to property and person of \nthe citizens of the Marshall Islands . . . resulting from the testing \nprogram . . .''. The compact and other U.S. laws established programs \ndesigned and intended to provide compensation and to respond to the \nconsequences of the nuclear tests.\n  First, Section 177 of the compact provided a $150 million grant to \nthe Marshall Islands for the settlement of all claims arising from the \nnuclear testing program through the establishment of the Nuclear Claims \nTribunal, including $2 million annually for the so-called ``Four Atoll \nHealth Care Program'' to provide supplemental health care services to \nthose communities most affected by the tests and funding for a \nnationwide radiological survey. The subsidiary agreement implementing \nSection 177 further provided that the Marshall Islands could seek \nadditional funds from Congress through a so-called ``changed \ncircumstances'' petition, if ``injuries render the provisions of this \nAgreement manifestly inadequate.'' Finally, Section 105(c) of the law \napproving the compact authorized additional appropriations for ``health \nand education as a result of exceptional circumstances,'' and \nauthorized ex gratia contributions for the affected populations of the \nnorthern atolls of Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap, and Utrik.\n  Second, in response to the nuclear tests, Congress funded the \nDepartment of Energy's Marshall Islands Program to continually monitor \nresidual radiation in the environment, research strategies for \nmitigating radiation effects, and to support mitigation and \nresettlement efforts. This DOE program also monitors and provides \nhealth care to members of the Rongelap and Utrik communities who were \nseriously exposed to radiation fallout from the ``Castle Bravo'' test \nwhich took place in 1954 and contaminated the inhabited islands \ndownwind.\n\n[[Page S689]]\n\n  Third, in 2001, Congress enacted the Energy Employees Occupational \nIllness Compensation Program, EEOICPA, to provide compensation for DOE \nand DOE-contractor employees who were associated with the Nation's \nnuclear weapons program. The legislative history for the program \nindicates that workers hired from the local population at the Marshall \nIslands Test Site were intended to be covered. However, islanders who \napplied for compensation from EEOICPA had their claims denied because \nthey were not U.S. citizens.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to make appropriate amendments to \nprograms and activities to meet our continuing responsibility to \naddress the consequences of the nuclear testing program. Accordingly, \nthis bill would expand the scope of these existing programs: the Four \nAtoll Health Care Program; the DOE Marshall Islands Program; and the \nU.S. Department of Labor's Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program. The bill would also provide for an assessment and \nreport by the National Academy of Sciences on the health impacts of the \nnuclear testing program in the Marshall Islands.\n  However, there is recent information regarding the health impacts of \nthe testing program which may meet the objectives of this section. Last \nyear, the August issue of Health Physics published a series of peer-\nreviewed papers on the radiation doses and cancer risks in the Marshall \nIslands from U.S. nuclear weapons tests. These papers grew out of a \nrequest from the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to the \nNational Cancer Institute for their expert opinion of the health \neffects of the testing program. I anticipate a presentation of the \nconclusion of these papers when a hearing is held on this bill.\n  For more information on this legislation, I recommend review of \nprevious Committee hearings, S. Hrg. 109-178 and S. Hrg. 110-243, and \nlast year's Committee report on S. 2941, S. Rpt 111-268. I look forward \nto continue working with President Zedkaia, the RMI Ambassador to the \nUnited States, Banny Debrum, officials at the U.S. Departments of \nState, Energy, and the Interior, and my colleagues on the Committee in \nconsidering this legislation as a part of our continuing response to \nthis tragic legacy of the nuclear testing program in the Pacific.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a letter of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 342\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman: I write to you on behalf of the \n     Marshallese people to renew our mutual efforts to address the \n     continuing consequences of the U.S. Nuclear Testing Program \n     in the Marshall Islands.\n       First, I would also like to take this opportunity to thank \n     you for your efforts in twice introducing Republic of the \n     Marshall Islands Supplemental Nuclear Compensation \n     legislation in both 2007 and 2010. I would also like to take \n     this opportunity to thank the Committee for approving S. 2941 \n     last year subsequent to a hearing held on May 19, 2010.\n       Your understanding and efforts over the past several years \n     to move these difficult issues forward and address them in a \n     substantive and meaningful manner is most appreciated by my \n     Government and the Marshallese people. In this respect, I \n     strongly believe that the substituted version of S. 2941 as \n     approved by your Committee constituted real and substantive \n     progress in addressing outstanding nuclear related issues.\n       Understanding that S. 2941 expired without further action \n     at the close of 2010, I would once again respectfully request \n     that legislation be introduced in the United States Senate to \n     deal with the enduring consequences of the nuclear testing \n     program in the Marshall Islands.\n       My Government submitted a Petition to the United States \n     Congress in respect to Article IX of the Section 177 \n     Agreement concerning ``Changed Circumstances'' in September, \n     2000. While my Government believes that we have firmly \n     established that ``changed circumstances'' exist within the \n     meaning of Article IX, we wish to focus our efforts on coming \n     to a resolution and implementing measures that produce \n     results in addressing the health, safety and damages caused \n     by the nuclear testing program.\n       Senate Bill No. 2941, as approved by the Committee, \n     represented a serious and substantive effort to deal with the \n     consequences of the nuclear testing program since the Section \n     177 Agreement went into effect almost 25 years ago.\n       Accordingly, I would like to review some specific measures \n     for inclusion in the legislation, which I believe will \n     address outstanding concerns and issues.\n       The provisions contained in Section 4 of the substituted \n     version of S. 1756 and S. 2941 approved by the Committee in \n     2010 that provided the sum of $4.5 million annually plus \n     adjustment for inflation as a continuing appropriation \n     through FY 2023 to address radiogenic illnesses and the \n     nuclear related health care needs of Bikini, Enewetak, \n     Rongelap, Utrik, Ailuk, Mejit, Likiep, Wotho, and Wotje, is \n     acceptable to my Government.\n       We support the addition of persons who were citizens of the \n     Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands for inclusion for \n     eligibility in the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \n     Compensation Program Act of 2000. There are many Marshallese \n     who worked at Department of Energy sites in the RMI in the \n     same manner as their U.S. citizen co-workers, yet have never \n     received the health care and other benefits of this program.\n       We also support provision in the legislation for the pro-\n     active and ongoing monitoring of the integrity of the Runit \n     Dome at Enewetak Atoll. This is an issue that has long been \n     of concern to the people of Enewetak who live, fish and \n     harvest food in the immediate area.\n       Any legislation addressing the consequences of the nuclear \n     testing program would not be complete without consideration \n     of the awards made by the Marshall Islands Nuclear Claims \n     Tribunal. Absent from S. 1756 or S. 2941 was any reference to \n     the decisions and awards made by the Tribunal. The \n     administrative and adjudicative processes of the Tribunal \n     over the past 20 years are an important mutually agreed-to \n     component of the Section 177 Agreement and its implementation \n     to resolve claims for damage to person and property arising \n     as a result of the nuclear testing program. We cannot simply \n     ignore the Tribunal's work and awards that it has made. The \n     RMI has presented a Report on this subject prepared by former \n     United States Attorney General Richard Thornburgh in January \n     2003; however, issues and concerns apparently continue. We \n     should move forward and resolve any remaining issues and \n     concerns regarding the Tribunal and its work.\n       We look forward to working with you and your staff to \n     address the issues I have raised in this letter and to move \n     forward on finally addressing the consequences of the nuclear \n     testing program. We remain hopeful as the 112th U.S. Congress \n     begins, this important legislation can be enacted into law to \n     provide badly needed help and assistance to the Marshallese \n     people who have suffered so much.\n       Finally, I would like to wish you and your staff a Happy \n     and Healthy New Year and, once again, thank you for all of \n     your help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Jurelang Zedkaia,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 343. A bill to amend Title I of PL 99-658 regarding the Compact of \nFree Association between the Government of the United States of America \nand the Government of Palau, to approve the results of the 15-year \nreview of the Compact, including the Agreement Between the Government \nof the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of \nPalau. Following the Compact of Free Association Section 432 Review, \nand to appropriate funds for the purposes of the amended PL 99-658 for \nfiscal years ending on or before September 30, 2024, to carry out the \nagreements resulting from that review; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nand the Ranking Member of the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, Lisa Murkowski, in introducing legislation to strengthen the \nrelationship between the United States and the Republic of Palau--one \nof our closest and most reliable allies. This legislation, if enacted, \nwould implement the recommendations of the 15-year review called for \nunder the Compact of Free Association between our two nations.\n  Palau is one of the world's smallest nations, located in the western \nPacific about 800 miles south of Guam and 500 miles east of the \nPhilippines. It has a total land area of 177 square miles with a \npopulation of about 21,000. The close ties between the U.S. and Palau \ndate from World War II, when Japanese forces were defeated in the \nBattle of Peleliu. In 1947, the islands became a District in the United \nNations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The United States was \nappointed Administrating Authority of the Trust Territory with the \nresponsibility to promote economic and political development. Because \nof the United States' strategic interest in this region, the Trust \nTerritory was established as the only U.N. ``Strategic'' Trust under \nthe authority of the U.N. Security Council, as opposed to the U.N. \nGeneral Assembly.\n  In the 1970s, talks on future political status were undertaken with \nthe United States. The Northern Mariana Islands voted to become a U.S. \nterritory, and the districts of Palau and the Marshall Islands chose to \nseparate from the remaining Trust Territory districts. In 1982, Palau \nsigned a 50-year Compact of Free Association that was approved by the \nU.S. in 1986, P.L. 99-658. The Compact went into effect on October 1, \n1994, and the U.N. Trusteeship was subsequently terminated, making \nPalau a sovereign, self-governing state in free association with the \nUnited States. The U.S. entered into similar Compacts of Free \nAssociation with the Marshall Islands and the remaining districts of \nthe Trust Territory, now known as the Federated States of Micronesia, \nin 1986, P.L. 99-239.\n  The U.S.-Palau Compact consists of four parts:\n\n       Title One, ``Government Relations,'' provides for \n     government-to-government relations including the privilege \n     for Palau citizens to enter the U.S. to work and reside as \n     non-immigrants, and for U.S. citizens to do the same in \n     Palau.\n       Title Two, ``Economic Relations,'' provided for a total of \n     $560 million in U.S. assistance from fiscal year 1995-2009, \n     including operational support of about $13 million annually, \n     $149 million for road construction, and $70 million for \n     capitalization of a Trust Fund to provide funds after the end \n     of direct U.S. financial assistance.\n       Title Three, ``Security and Defense Relations,'' closed \n     Palauan territory to the military forces of any nation except \n     the U.S., so-called ``Strategic Denial,'' and provides that \n     the U.S. may establish defense sites, although none exist at \n     this time or are planned.\n       Title Four, ``General Provisions,'' among other things, \n     Section 432 requires that there be a formal bilateral review \n     of the relationship on the 15th, 30th and 40th anniversaries \n     of the compact's entry into force, and that both parties \n     commit themselves to take specific actions based on the \n     conclusions of the review.\n\n  The U.S. and Palau completed this formal 15th anniversary review and, \non September 10, 2010, signed an agreement setting forth amendments to \nthe compact based on the conclusions and recommendation of the review. \nThe bill being introduced today would approve this agreement and its \nappendices and incorporate them into the law which originally \nestablished the compact.\n  First, the legislation would extend financial assistance for another \n14-year\n\n[[Page S691]]\n\nterm, until 2024, for operations, construction, maintenance and trust \nfund contributions totaling $229 million, or an average of $16.4 \nmillion annually. This is a substantial reduction from the average of \n$37.3 million annually that was provided in the first 15-year term. \nSecond, the legislation significantly enhances accountability of U.S. \nfinancial assistance by requiring Palau to undertake financial and \nmanagement reforms, and the U.S. is authorized to withhold funds if the \nU.S. determines that Palau ``has not made significant progress in \nimplementing meaningful reforms.'' Third, the bill would require any \nPalauan entering the U.S. to have a Palau passport. This would be the \nsame requirement that was imposed on citizens of Micronesia and the \nMarshall Islands when their compacts were reviewed and amended in 2003.\n  I believe this Agreement and legislation reaffirm and strengthen the \nspecial ties between the U.S. and Palau. Together we will continue our \ncommitment to regional security. The United States will continue to be \nresponsible for the security and defense of Palau, and the U.S. is \nhonored to have the continued service of the men and women of Palau in \nthe U.S. armed services. Strategic denial and the associated base \nrights provided for under the compact were originally designed to \ncounter the Cold War threat in the Pacific. While the Cold War has \nended, the U.S. will continue to face new challenges in the region.\n  Another indicator of the close relationship between the U.S. and \nPalau is evidenced by comparing votes in the United Nations. Palau and \nthe U.S. vote together consistently. The most recent issue of the State \nDepartment's report, ``Voting Practices in the United Nations 2009,'' \nshows that Palau's voting coincidence with the United States in 2009 on \n12 important issues was 100 percent. This is the highest voting \ncoincidence of any country and indicates that Palau is a trusted and \nreliable ally at the U.N.\n  In 2003, the U.S. determined that a number of Chinese Uighurs who had \nbeen arrested in the war on terrorism and were sent to Guantanamo were \nnot terrorists. The Bush Administration sought new homes for them, \nknowing that they would likely be persecuted if they were returned to \nChina. Plans to send them to a Uighur community in Virginia were \ndropped because of Congressional opposition. Nearly every nation in the \nworld was asked to assist in their resettlement, but Palau was the \nfirst to agree. Six Uighurs were resettled there. Palau has taken more \ndetainees from Guantanamo than any other nation except Albania not \ncounting those who were repatriated to their home countries.\n  It is important to note that this legislation is time-sensitive. The \nfirst 15-year term of compact financial assistance ended with fiscal \nyear 2009. Fiscal Year 2010 funding for Palau was provided through \nenactment of a 1-year extension in the fiscal year 2010 Omnibus \nAppropriations bill, and the first few months of fiscal year 2011 \nfunding is made available by the recent continuing resolutions. It is \nimportant that the next CR include continued financial support for \nPalau through the end of this fiscal year, to allow time for Congress \nto consider and pass this legislation. I understand that the \nadministration's fiscal year 2012 budget will assume enactment of the \nbill before October 1, leaving the Congress a relatively short period \nof time to do its work.\n  I look forward to working with Ranking Member Murkowski and our \ncolleagues on the Committee in moving this bill promptly. I anticipate \nreaching out to our colleagues on the Foreign Relations and Armed \nServices Committees because of the important role Palau plays in U.S. \nforeign and defense policy. Finally, I look forward to working with \nofficials in the administration and in Palau who conducted the compact \nReview and concluded this important Agreement. I urge my colleagues to \njoin with me and Senator Murkowski in approving this agreement and \nassuring the continued strength of this historic partnership.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na letter of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 343\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, Title I \n     of PL 99-658 is hereby amended by inserting a new section 105 \n     as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 105.

Such persons shall enjoy \n     the same taxation exemptions as are set forth in Article 34 \n     of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The \n     privileges, exemptions and immunities accorded under this \n     paragraph are not for the personal benefit of the individuals \n     concerned but are to safeguard the independent exercise of \n     their official functions.

Audit officials from the Government of the United \n     States shall provide the Government of Palau with advance \n     notice of the specific dates and nature of their visits prior \n     to entering the Republic of Palau and shall show verifiable \n     identification to officials of the Government of Palau when \n     seeking access to records. In the performance of their \n     responsibilities under this Agreement, audit officials from \n     the Government of the United States shall have due regard for \n     the laws of the Republic of Palau and the duties and \n     responsibilities of the officials of the Government of Palau. \n     Officials of the Government of Palau shall cooperate fully to \n     the extent practicable with the United States audit officials \n     to enable the full discharge of their responsibilities.\n       ``7.

Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is a draft bill to amend Title \n     I of Pub. L. No. 99-658, 100 Stat. 3672 (Nov. 14, 1986), \n     regarding the Compact of Free Association between the \n     Government of the United States of America and the Government \n     of Palau. The draft bill would approve the results of the 15-\n     year review of the Compact, including the Agreement Between \n     the Government of the United States of America and the \n     Government of the Republic of Palau following the Compact of \n     Free Association Section 432 Review (the Agreement), and \n     appropriate funds to the Department of the Interior for the \n     purposes of the amended Pub. L. No. 99-658 for fiscal years \n     ending on or before September 30, 2024, to carry out the \n     agreements resulting from that review. We strongly urge that \n     the draft bill be introduced, referred appropriately, and \n     enacted at the earliest opportunity.\n       Section 432 of the Compact of Free Association between the \n     Government of the United States of America and the Government \n     of Palau (Compact) provides for the two governments formally \n     to review the Compact upon the fifteenth anniversary of its \n     effective date--October 1, 2009. The two governments \n     concluded this review with the signing of the Agreement on \n     September 3, 2010.\n       The proposed legislation would amend Pub. L. No. 99-658, \n     the legislation that approved the Compact, to add a section \n     to approve and implement the results of the 15-year review. \n     In particular, the proposed legislation would provide $215.75 \n     million beginning in fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year \n     2024 to be administered by the Department of the Interior. \n     Over this 14-year period, $30.25 million would supplement the \n     fund already provided in section 211(f) of the Compact; \n     $107.5 million would be in direct economic assistance to \n     assist Palau in transitioning to the level of assistance that \n     will be provided exclusively by the section 211(f) fund after \n     fiscal year 2024; $40 million would be for infrastructure \n     projects; $28 million would be for maintenance of major \n     infrastructure already provided to Palau (the Compact road \n     and improvements to Palau's international airport); and $10 \n     million would enable fiscal consolidation.\n       Under the Agreement, Palau is to undertake economic, \n     legislative, financial, and management reforms; economic \n     assistance may be withheld in the absence of significant \n     progress in implementing meaningful reforms. In addition to \n     providing economic assistance and requiring reform, the \n     Agreement would require citizens of Palau entering the United \n     States to have a passport.\n       Direct economic assistance is scheduled to end after the \n     expiration of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (Pub. \n     L. No. 111-242), which is currently March 4, 2011. To ensure \n     continuity of financial assistance for Palau, we are eager to \n     provide Congress whatever information and assistance is \n     necessary to secure early passage of the proposed \n     legislation.\n       The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) Act of 2010 provides \n     that revenue and direct spending legislation cannot, in the \n     aggregate, increase the on-budget deficit. If such \n     legislation increases the on-budget deficit and that increase \n     is not offset by the end of the Congressional session, a \n     sequestration must be ordered. This draft bill would increase \n     mandatory outlays and the on-budget deficit as shown below:\n\n                                                                      FISCAL YEARS\n                                                                      [$ Millions]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   2011    2012    2013    2014    2015    2016    2017    2018    2019    2020    Total\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDeficit Impact..................................................      28      28      26      23      22      20      14      12      11      10     194\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       This proposal would increase direct spending, and it is \n     therefore subject to the Statutory PAYGO Act and should be \n     considered in conjunction with all other proposals that are \n     subject to the Act.\n       Enactment of the draft bill would protect United States \n     interests and promote the continued mutual well being of our \n     two countries. Palau is one of our nation's closest and most \n     reliable allies. The legislation will support U.S. national \n     security interests in an important part of the western \n     Pacific where U.S. influence is being challenged. The Office \n     of Management and Budget has advised that enactment of the \n     draft bill would be in accord with the program of the \n     President.\n           Sincerely,\n     David J. Hayes,\n       Deputy Secretary of the Interior.\n     James B. Steinbeg,\n       Deputy Secretary of State.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 344. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit \ncertain retired members of the uniformed services who have a service-\nconnected disability to receive both disability compensation from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs for their disability and either retired \npay by reason of their years of military service or Combat-Related \nSpecial Compensation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of our nation's \nveterans to once again discuss the unjust and outdated policy of \nfailing to give our veterans their full earned military retirement \nbenefits and veterans disability compensation. Full payment of \nretirement and disability benefits, known as ``concurrent receipt,'' is \nan issue that I have ardently supported for more than 10 years now.\n  In the past, veterans were prevented from receiving the full pay and \nbenefits they had earned. The law required that military retired pay be \nreduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of any VA disability \ncompensation received. Many Senators have joined me in fighting this \npolicy and we have made some progress on behalf of our nation's \nveterans.\n  In 2003, Congress passed legislation which allowed disabled retired \nveterans with at least a 50 percent disability rating to become \neligible for full concurrent receipt benefits by 2013. Then in 2004, \nthe 10-year phase-in period was eliminated for veterans with 100 \npercent service-related disability. These are significant victories \nthat put hundreds of thousands of veterans on track to receiving both \ntheir retirement and disability benefits, but many more are\n\n[[Page S696]]\n\nstill affected by the unjust denial of concurrent receipt.\n  For me, this is a simple matter of fairness. There is no reason to \ndeny a veteran who has served his country honorably the right to the \nfull value of their retirement pay simply because his service also \ncaused him to become disabled. Unfortunately, that is exactly what the \ncurrent law does. This legislation will put an end to it.\n  It is not a partisan issue. Our nation has been at war for almost a \ndecade, and our soldiers have performed with unmatched honor and \ncourage in difficult theatres of war. Our utmost duty as lawmakers \nshould be to ensure that the brave men and women in the United States \nArmed Forces receive the benefits they have earned.\n  Today I reintroduce this legislation which will eliminate all \nrestrictions to concurrent receipt. We must take action now, and \nsupport our veterans who have given so much to this grateful nation. \nThis is the right thing to do.\n  I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in supporting this bill. \nThese veterans have faced arbitrary discrimination long enough.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 344\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 49\n\n       Whereas in 1776, the United States of America was imagined, \n     as stated in the Declaration of Independence, as a new Nation \n     dedicated to the proposition that ``all men are created \n     equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and \n     the pursuit of Happiness'';\n       Whereas on November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln, in \n     reference to the Declaration of Independence, stated, \n     ``[f]our score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, \n     upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and \n     dedicated to the proposition that all men are created \n     equal'';\n       Whereas the history of this Nation includes injustices and \n     the denial of basic, fundamental rights at odds with the \n     words of the Founders of the Nation and the sacrifices \n     commemorated at Gettysburg, and these injustices include \n     nearly 250 years of slavery, 100 years of lynchings, denial \n     of both fundamental human and civil rights, and withholding \n     of the basic rights of citizenship;\n       Whereas the vestiges of slavery still exist in the systemic \n     inequalities and injustices in our society;\n       Whereas for every Shirley Chisholm, Dorothy Height, \n     Constance Baker Motley, Charles Hamilton Houston, Thurgood \n     Marshall, Lena Horne, James Baldwin, W.E.B. Du Bois, Harriet \n     Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Jackie Robinson, \n     or Ralph Bunche, each of whom lived a life of incandescent \n     greatness, many African Americans lived, toiled, and died in \n     obscurity, never achieving the recognition they deserved;\n       Whereas on November 4, 2008, the people of the United \n     States elected an African American man, Barack Obama, as \n     President of the United States, and African-Americans \n     continue to serve our country at the highest levels of our \n     government and military; and\n       Whereas William H. Hastie, the first African American to be \n     appointed as a Federal judge, stated, ``[h]istory informs us \n     of past mistakes from which we can learn without repeating \n     them. It also inspires us and gives confidence and hope bred \n     of victories already won'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the importance of Black History Month as an \n     opportunity to reflect on our Nation's complex history, while \n     remaining hopeful and confident for the path that lies ahead;\n       (2) acknowledges the significance of Black History Month as \n     an important opportunity to recognize the tremendous \n     contributions of African Americans to the Nation's history;\n       (3) encourages the celebration of Black History Month to \n     provide a continuing opportunity for all people in the United \n     States to learn from our past and to understand the \n     experiences that have shaped our Nation; and\n       (4) calls on citizens to remember that, while this Nation \n     began in division, it must now move forward with purpose, \n     united tirelessly as one Nation, indivisible, with liberty \n     and justice for all, and to honor the contribution of all \n     American pioneers who help ensure the legacy of these great \n     United States.\n\n[[Page S697]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/14/senate-section/article/S697-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 74.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 49\n\n       Whereas in 1776, the United States of America was imagined, \n     as stated in the Declaration of Independence, as a new Nation \n     dedicated to the proposition that ``all men are created \n     equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain \n     unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and \n     the pursuit of Happiness'';\n       Whereas on November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln, in \n     reference to the Declaration of Independence, stated, \n     ``[f]our score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, \n     upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and \n     dedicated to the proposition that all men are created \n     equal'';\n       Whereas the history of this Nation includes injustices and \n     the denial of basic, fundamental rights at odds with the \n     words of the Founders of the Nation and the sacrifices \n     commemorated at Gettysburg, and these injustices include \n     nearly 250 years of slavery, 100 years of lynchings, denial \n     of both fundamental human and civil rights, and withholding \n     of the basic rights of citizenship;\n       Whereas the vestiges of slavery still exist in the systemic \n     inequalities and injustices in our society;\n       Whereas for every Shirley Chisholm, Dorothy Height, \n     Constance Baker Motley, Charles Hamilton Houston, Thurgood \n     Marshall, Lena Horne, James Baldwin, W.E.B. Du Bois, Harriet \n     Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, Jackie Robinson, \n     or Ralph Bunche, each of whom lived a life of incandescent \n     greatness, many African Americans lived, toiled, and died in \n     obscurity, never achieving the recognition they deserved;\n       Whereas on November 4, 2008, the people of the United \n     States elected an African American man, Barack Obama, as \n     President of the United States, and African-Americans \n     continue to serve our country at the highest levels of our \n     government and military; and\n       Whereas William H. Hastie, the first African American to be \n     appointed as a Federal judge, stated, ``[h]istory informs us \n     of past mistakes from which we can learn without repeating \n     them. It also inspires us and gives confidence and hope bred \n     of victories already won'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the importance of Black History Month as an \n     opportunity to reflect on our Nation's complex history, while \n     remaining hopeful and confident for the path that lies ahead;\n       (2) acknowledges the significance of Black History Month as \n     an important opportunity to recognize the tremendous \n     contributions of African Americans to the Nation's history;\n       (3) encourages the celebration of Black History Month to \n     provide a continuing opportunity for all people in the United \n     States to learn from our past and to understand the \n     experiences that have shaped our Nation; and\n       (4) calls on citizens to remember that, while this Nation \n     began in division, it must now move forward with purpose, \n     united tirelessly as one Nation, indivisible, with liberty \n     and justice for all, and to honor the contribution of all \n     American pioneers who help ensure the legacy of these great \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/14/senate-section/article/S703-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 359\n\n  Mr. REID.
