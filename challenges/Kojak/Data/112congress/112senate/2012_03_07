Madam President, 47 years ago today a group of 600 freedom-\nloving men and women set out on a march from Selma, AL, to Montgomery, \nAL. The purpose of the march was to call for an end to discrimination \nand violence against African Americans. Among those peaceful protesters \nwas a young man by the name of John Lewis, now Congressman John Lewis. \nHis life has been one of truly a great civil rights leader, outstanding \nlegislator, and a patriot beyond excellence.\n  Only 6 blocks from the church where the march began, they were met at \nEdmund Pettus Bridge by police dogs, firehoses, and clubs. The terrible \nviolence that day, known as Bloody Sunday, was broadcast across the \ncountry.\n  March 1965 marked a turning point in the civil rights movement, as \nAmericans cried out against the injustice and bloodshed they saw on \ntelevision. Later that month about 25,000 courageous souls finally \ncompleted that 12-mile march from Selma to Montgomery that started on \nBloody Sunday, and 6 months later President Lyndon Johnson signed the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965.\n  A year ago I was privileged to lock arms with Congressman John Lewis \nand Congressman Jim Claiborne, two men whom I admire deeply, as we \nreenacted the march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. It was really a \nhumbling experience as John Lewis, with throngs of people--but we were \ntogether--explained to me what he remembered from that day:\n\n       As we were starting up the bridge there was a drug store \n     that doesn't exist anymore, but a lot of whites were gathered \n     there. They were, of course, up to mischief.\n\n  John Lewis had on his back a backpack--they were not very common in \nthose days--he had a backpack on his back. He thought perhaps he would \nbe arrested, as he had been many times, and he would have something to \nread while he was in jail. He had a book and an apple in that backpack, \nbut, of course, he was beaten very badly, and no one will ever know \nwhat happened to the backpack and the apple and the book.\n  It was really a humbling experience--I repeat, one I will never \nforget. On this day, I think we should all pause to\n\n[[Page S1434]]\n\nthink that, while we have come a long way, we have a long way to go to \nmake sure we have civil rights for everyone in America.\n\n\n                            The Highway Bill\n\n  Madam President, we were disappointed, as I indicated yesterday, at \nnot being able to invoke cloture on this highway bill. I was satisfied \nyesterday that the Speaker of the House indicated that he thought the \nbest thing to do, at least as I read the reports, would be to take the \nSenate version of a bill, if we can figure out a way to pass one, and \nthen they would use that--he would bring it to the floor for a vote. I \nhope that is the case. The press doesn't always get things right, but I \nhope in this case they did.\n\n  Senator McConnell's staff and my staff are exchanging paper as we \nspeak. I hope we can work our way through this bill. I think it is \nunfortunate that we are going to have to have votes on a number of \namendments that have nothing to do with this underlying piece of \nlegislation.\n  This is one thing the American people really do not like. At our \ntownhall meetings, our visitations with people throughout our States, I \nhave come to the realization that they hate what they call riders--\nthings that have nothing to do with bills. The Senate rules allow them \nin most instances, so if it takes this to get this bill done, then we \nwill have to move forward in that way. I hope we can do that. As I \nsaid, we are going to exchange paper, and I hope both sides will react \npositively. I am confident we will over here, and I hope we can work \nsomething out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/07/senate-section/article/S1434-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, last week I came to the Senate floor \nto speak out on an issue that is on the minds of a lot of Americans \nthese days: the rising cost of gas at the pump and how the \nadministration's policies are actually making matters worse.\n  The President may try to take credit for production gains that are \nentirely the work of others, but more to the point is the fact that \nproduction is up on private lands and down on Federal lands. The \nproperty the President and the Interior Secretary actually manage is \nthe property upon which production is down.\n  In fact, when it comes to the rising cost of gas at the pump, it is \nmy view that the administration's policies are actually designed to a \npurpose: to bring about higher gas prices. That is a view which should \nnot be the least bit controversial given the fact that the President's \nown Energy Secretary has suggested on a couple of occasions now that \nhis goal certainly is not to drive gas prices down.\n  For the President's part, he often says that Americans should judge \nhim not only by his words but on his deeds. So when it comes to gas \nprices, I have pointed out that the President continues to limit \noffshore areas to energy production and is granting fewer leases on \npublic land for oil drilling, has encouraged countries such as Brazil \nto move forward with their own offshore drilling projects, continues to \nimpose burdensome regulations on the domestic energy sector that will \nfurther drive up the cost of gasoline for the consumer, has repeatedly \nproposed raising taxes on the energy sector, which we all know would \nonly drive gas prices even higher, and, finally, has flatly rejected \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  All of these help drive up the cost of gas and increase our \ndependence on foreign oil. So the President simply cannot claim to have \na comprehensive approach to energy because he doesn't--he simply \ndoesn't--and anytime he says he does, the American people should \nremember one word: Keystone. Keystone.\n  Another thing they might want to do is play a clip of the press \nconference the President held just yesterday. Asked about whether he \nactually wants gas prices to go up, the President's facetious attempt \nto deflect the question only served to confirm the premise. But it was \nthe President's admission that rising gas prices hurt the economy that \nreally betrayed the administration's attempt to have it both ways on \nthis issue, because if higher gas prices hurt the economy, then why in \nthe world is the administration calling for higher taxes on energy \nmanufacturers? We know these taxes would drive up the price at the pump \nand send jobs overseas. The Congressional Research Service said that. \nIf the President wants to drive prices down, he should stop calling for \nthese increases in taxes.\n  Look, if the President wants Americans to think he is serious about \nlower gas prices, he has to do more than simply say--and this is what \nhe said yesterday--``No President would want higher gas prices in an \nelection year.'' ``No President would want higher gas prices in an \nelection year.'' What about other years? Would they want them in other \nyears? It is only in election years that it is a problem? He has to get \nserious about changing his policies, and he might want to consider an \nEnergy Secretary who is more committed to helping the American people \nthan in helping the administration's buddies in the solar panel \nbusiness--and that brings me to a larger point.\n  The President likes to talk a lot about fairness. We have heard a lot \nabout fairness, but when it comes to rising gas prices, the American \npeople don't think it is particularly fair that at a time when they are \nstruggling to fill the tank, their own tax dollars are being used to \nsubsidize failing solar companies of the President's choosing, not to \nmention the bonuses executives at these companies keep getting. I think \nmost Americans are tired of reading about all the goodies this \nadministration's allies are getting on their dime even as the President \ngoes around lecturing everybody about fairness.\n  I will tell you what is not fair. What is not fair is that it costs \nabout $40 more to fill a 20-gallon tank with gasoline than it did when \nthis President took office. That is not fair. Yet this administration \ncontinues to pursue policies that would make it even worse.\n  Earlier this year the White House launched a campaign in support of \nthe payroll tax holiday, asking Americans what $40 a month would mean \nto them. Yet, now, when it comes to gas prices, they are doubling down \non policies that are taking away that $40 a month given by the payroll \ntax holiday to fill the gas tank. Once again, they are trying to have \nit both ways, and, frankly, the American people have had it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/07/senate-section/article/S1434-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1434-S1435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN RABUN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I would like to pay tribute today to \na friend of many decades, a Kentuckian who is a hero to many and a \npersonal hero of mine for his work on behalf of children that has had a \nnational impact. In his 28 years of service with the National Center \nfor Missing and Exploited Children, John Rabun has saved literally \nthousands of lives and averted tragedy for thousands of families.\n  As the very first employee of the national center since its creation \nback in 1984, he has been the heart and the soul of that organization. \nHis dedication and passion for the issue will continue to shape the \nnational center long after he leaves it. Frankly, for John, saving \nchildren was not just a job, it was his mission. That is why it is such \na blow that after 28 years of service, John Rabun will retire from his \nwork at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children this \nFriday, March 9. I cannot say enough how much this man will be missed.\n  John and I have a history that stretches back almost four decades, \ndating to his time as a social worker in Jefferson County, KY. Of \ncourse, Jefferson County contains the city of Louisville, my hometown, \nand in the late 1970s and early 1980s, I served as the judge-executive \nfor Jefferson County. What that is, I say to the Presiding Officer from \nNew York, is like the county executive for the county. It was in this \ncapacity that I got to know John Rabun.\n  John earned his bachelor's degree from Mercer University in Macon, \nGA, and his master of science in social work from the University of \nLouisville. As a social worker, John managed the company's group home \nfor kids and was one of the first in town to identify\n\n[[Page S1435]]\n\nthe growing crisis of child abduction and sexual exploitation. Working \nin those foster homes, John saw the problem firsthand and saw what \nlocal police and social services were not seeing. He saw that \ninformation between social service workers and law enforcement was not \nbeing shared as it should have been. He realized a lot more could be \ndone.\n\n  So John, along with a friend and fellow social worker, Kerry Rice, \napproached Ernie Allen, who at the time was the director of the \nLouisville-Jefferson County Crime Commission. Ernie is now known as the \ndirector and CEO of the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, which he helped build alongside John. But way back then, the \nissue of missing and exploited children had yet to receive the national \nfocus it deserved.\n  It was John who proposed to Ernie that the county create a special \nunit bridging the traditional barriers between social services and law \nenforcement to try to combat this serious problem. They came to me--as \nthe CEO of the county--with this idea, and together we created what I \nbelieve to be the first police-social services team in the Nation \ndedicated to working child abduction and sexual exploitation cases. \nEventually, we created Jefferson County's first exploited and missing \nchild unit, with John as its manager. Under John's leadership, almost \nimmediately the unit began to solve cases, rescue victims, and put some \nvery good news on the front pages.\n  John became famous nationwide as a leading expert on missing and \nexploited child cases. In 1980, the U.S. Department of Justice asked me \nto send John and Ernie to Atlanta to consult on a grisly child murder \ncase. John is now so recognized as a leader in this field that he has \nprovided expert testimony to Congress seven times on child abduction \ncases and has instructed for the FBI Law Enforcement Satellite Training \nNetwork. John has provided consultation at nearly 1,000 hospitals and \nfor over 62,000 personnel in America, Canada, and the United Kingdom on \nthe abduction of newborns in hospitals. He is the author of the book \n``For Healthcare Professionals: Guidelines on Prevention of and \nResponse to Infant Abductions.'' Thanks in large measure to his \nefforts, what was once a recurring problem is now all but eliminated.\n  John has been recognized by the FBI as 1 of only 27 investigators \nnationwide with the highest expertise in the investigation of cases \nconcerning missing and exploited children. He has appeared on \ntelevision shows such as ``20/20,'' ``Primetime,'' ``Good Morning \nAmerica,'' ``Larry King Live,'' and, of course, ``America's Most \nWanted'' with his friend and my friend, John Walsh.\n  In 1984, John signed the lease for office space for the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children right here in Washington. He \nbegan working as that organization's executive vice president and chief \noperating officer. It is a post he has held ever since. As the National \nCenter's executive vice president and COO, John manages a staff of 350 \nand a budget of $42 million a year. He is the hub of the wheel for all \ninteragency communication between the center, the Justice Department, \nthe State Department, the Secret Service, the FBI, the Department of \nHomeland Security, as well as State governments.\n  When I say John Rabun has a great passion and drive on this issue \nthat has animated his entire career, I mean it. He is absolutely \ndedicated to rescuing children who would otherwise fall through the \ncracks.\n  Back when he was running the Jefferson County Crime Unit, John led \nthe effort to successfully identify and prosecute the pastor of a major \nlocal church for sexually abusing over one dozen children in his \ncongregation. After this pastor's conviction, the judge shockingly \nsentenced him merely to probation with a community service requirement. \nJohn leapt from the prosecutor's table and cried: ``Your Honor, will \nyou at least stipulate that this community service not be with \nchildren?'' The judge held John in contempt of court. Luckily, the \nprosecutor quickly scurried John out through a side door before he \ncould be taken into custody and after a few days the heat died down. \nBut this story goes to illustrate how John will stop at literally \nnothing to see justice is done for those who are weakest among us, our \nchildren.\n  John's lifetime of service to children has directly led to the rescue \nof over 80,000 kids. Let me share with my colleagues just one success \nstory. About 1 year ago, a Los Angeles police detective contacted the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children for information on a \n10-year-old boy who had been missing for many years. In 2004, the \nchild's parents separated, and although the mother received custody, \nher son was abducted from their home. A search began for the boy and \nhis father, which continued for 7 years. Law enforcement had no leads \non the child's whereabouts, suspecting the father may have abducted him \nback to his native country of Guatemala. Upon receiving the call from \nthat Los Angeles detective, the National Center's case management team \nbegan coordinating the center's resources with the child's mother and \ndetectives in the Los Angeles Police Department. A missing child poster \nwas created and disseminated around California, and detectives were \nprovided with detailed public database searches throughout the National \nCenter's case analysis division.\n  Just a little over 1 month ago, the center received a lead from a \nschool official who believed he had recognized the boy as a fifth \ngrader at a Los Angeles elementary school. This official had searched \nthe center's Web site, saw the missing child's poster, and contacted \nthe center's 24-hour hot line. The center passed this lead along to \npolice, and I am pleased to say that on January 31 of this year, 8 \nyears after his abduction, this boy was reunited with his mother, and \nhis father was arrested.\n  Imagine that mother's relief and then multiply that feeling by \nliterally thousands. Only then can we begin to appreciate the immense \nservice John Rabun has done for his country. So that is why we are all \ngoing to miss John so much. No one can say he could have done more; \nhowever, neither could anyone say his retirement is not extremely well \ndeserved. I am sure he is looking forward to being able to spend more \ntime with his lovely wife Betsy, a retired schoolteacher, and their two \nchildren and five grandchildren.\n  A national movement on behalf of America's most precious resource, \nour children, was launched because one social worker in Louisville, KY, \nsaw that too many children were at risk and not enough was being done. \nIf every family impacted by the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children's work could thank John Rabun personally, it might \ntake another 28 years, and he would never get to retire. But on behalf \nof a grateful and safer America, I hope the recognition of this Senate \nand the thanks and friendship of this Senator will suffice instead. So \nthank you very much, John Rabun.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/07/senate-section/article/S1435-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to speak regarding the highway \nbill. We each come into work daily with different thoughts. I come in \ntoday very hopeful. The fact is we have a bipartisan bill that \nhopefully will actually have the finance component of it on the floor \nsoon. We have had it worked through the various committees of the \nSenate--the Banking Committee, the Commerce Committee, the EPW \nCommittee. I think what this body is waiting for right now is the \nFinance Committee package, and I know they are continuing to work on \nthat package. The reason I come down here, in a very hopeful way, is I \nthink all of us support the highway bill. We want\n\n[[Page S1436]]\n\nto see a bill such as this passed. But I think we also want to see it \npassed in an appropriate way, and some of the earlier renditions that \nhave come out of the Finance Committee, unfortunately, have not paid \nfor this bill. It is my sense that maybe what is happening right now is \nthat there is some work being done to try to make that not the case.\n  I know the Senator from New York is familiar with the health care \ndebate we had years ago, and one of the issues many of the folks on \nthis side of the aisle were concerned about--and I think many folks on \nthe other side of the aisle were concerned about--was some of the \ngimmickry used to pay for it. We had 6 years' worth of spending and 10 \nyears' worth of revenues. Obviously, people around the country--\nrightfully so--were concerned about that. What we have at present with \nthis highway bill is something that is even worse than that. We have 2 \nyears' worth of spending and 10 years' worth of revenues to pay for it. \nEverybody in this body knows there is no family in New York and no \nfamily in Tennessee who could possibly survive under that scenario.\n  I had an op-ed published this morning in the Washington Post talking \nabout the fact that we have had so many bipartisan efforts here to try \nto deal with deficit reduction. We had the Bowles-Simpson report that \ncame out; we had 64 Senators--32 on each side of the aisle--who wrote a \nletter to the President to encourage him to embrace deficit reduction \nand progrowth tax reform. We had another group of colleagues who became \ninvolved in something called Go BIG, and the whole focus was to deal \nwith the fiscal issues of this country.\n  I come in somewhat hopeful this morning, but what I fear is happening \nis because this highway bill is so popular that Members on both sides \nof the aisle are willing to kick the can down the road in an area where \nwe could--in a bipartisan way--address deficit reduction and get the \nhighway bill on a spend-as-you-go basis, meaning that we pay for it as \nwe go--instead of doing that, because this is an election year and this \nis a popular bill, both parties--instead of leading on deficit \nreduction--are going to cave in and basically kick the can down the \nroad because this is ``a popular bill.'' To me, that is not what the \nAmerican people sent us to do.\n  So we have this opportunity to pay for it. I don't know whether we \nare going to get where we need to go. As a matter of fact, even though \nI am hopeful we are going to make progress on this issue, I don't think \nwe are going to quite get there. I sense in this body a desire to kick \nthe can down the road, to turn our head, to not live up to our \nresponsibilities as it relates to this bill.\n  So I am going to offer two amendments. One amendment would say: Look, \nwe have a highway trust fund. We have had the transfer of $34 billion \nor $35 billion into it from the general fund since 2008. We have a \ntrust fund. We ought to either spend the money that comes into it \naccordingly and reduce the amount of spending on highways or what we \nshould do is lower discretionary spending someplace else.\n  Again, we have not seen the final bill because another negotiation is \ntaking place. It appears to me, in order to live up to our \nresponsibilities to the American people, that what we would have to do \nis cut about $11 billion or $12 billion out of the discretionary caps \nwe agreed to as part of the Budget Control Act to make this \nappropriate. I will offer an amendment once we see what the final \npackage is that does just that.\n  In other words, if we all think highways and transit bills are \nimportant--and by the way, I do. I used to be the mayor of a city. I \nknow that infrastructure is very important to our economic growth in \nthis country. But if we believe spending on highways and transit is \nimportant and it is a priority, then what we need to do is lower \ndiscretionary caps and lower spending in another area. For us to do \nanything short of that would be making a mockery of the American people \nand certainly making a mockery of the arrangement that was created \nthrough the Budget Control Act. So I am certainly hopeful this \namendment will pass if we continue on this course. I can't imagine that \nin a bipartisan way both sides would show the irresponsibility that has \nled to today anyway. I am still hopeful that by the time we pass this \nhighway bill, we will have come together and acted responsibly and \nactually paid for this. But I think the American people understand that \npassing a bill that spends money over 2 years and tries to recoup it \nover a 10-year period is a highway to insolvency.\n\n  So I am committed more than ever to us living up to our \nresponsibilities to the American people. I believe there is something \nbrewing in this body that says we have to live up to these \nresponsibilities. I think the best place for us to start is on this \nhighway bill.\n  I will close with this. I know the Senator from Utah wishes to speak \nfor a few moments also. A lot of people are saying: Senator Corker, \nthis is such a small amount of money; and, gosh, this is such a popular \nbill--everybody likes it. Can't we just turn our heads on this issue \nand kick the can down the road and do something we know fiscally is \ntotally irresponsible because all of us like highways?\n  My response is, look, if we cannot deal with the highway bill that, \nby the way, is just simple math--this isn't something such as Medicare \nreform or something else where we have all kinds of moving parts that \nare very difficult to deal with--the highway bill is just simple math. \nIf we don't have the ability in this body to deal with just addition \nand subtraction, there is no way the American people are going to trust \nus with things such as Medicare reform and Social Security reform and \nmaking sure those programs are solvent down the road for seniors who \ndepend upon them.\n  So what I would say to this body is we have a great opportunity this \nweek and next week to show the American people we are serious about \ngetting this country on a solid footing. There is no better place to do \nthat than on a popular bill. In other words, if we have to make \npriorities, if we have to make choices, if we have to cut spending in \nother places to make 2 years' worth of payouts equal 2 years worth of \nincome, there is no place better to do it than on the highway bill. I \nurge this body to stand tall, to meet its responsibilities, and only \npass this bill if it is paid for over the same amount of time that it \nis extended. So that means all the money that goes out is paid for over \nthe next 2 years. I will be offering amendments to do that if the \nFinance Committee does not in and of itself.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, the American people need help because they \nare suffering at the gas pump. With the national average price for \ngasoline up at around $3.75 per gallon, representing an increase of \nabout 40 cents from a year ago and about 20 cents from just 1 month \nago, citizens are suffering and they need relief.\n  It is important to point out in this context that when President \nObama took office, gas prices were at about $1.85 per gallon. Now that \nthey are up to about $3.75 per gallon we can see a steady increase. \nOver this 38-month period of time of his Presidency so far, gasoline \nprices have risen an average of about 5 cents per gallon per month. \nThis is staggering when we think about the fact that if he is \nreelected--if he serves out the rest of this term and if he is \nreelected--that is a total of an additional 58 months. With that \nincrease, gas prices will be up at around $6.60 per gallon.\n  This is a lot of money. It is staggering. It affects everything we \ndo--from the miles we drive to the products we buy at the grocery \nstore. Everything gets more expensive when the fuel we use to transport \nourselves and our products becomes more expensive.\n  Now, to some extent, one could suggest this was not only foreseeable, \nbut it was actually foreseen. To some, it was considered a desired \noutcome. Let's consider, for example, that in 2008, Dr. Steven Chu, who \nnow serves as President Obama's Energy Secretary, said:\n\n       Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of \n     gasoline to the levels in Europe.\n\n  Well, Mr. Chu, it looks as though we are headed in that direction, \nand if we\n\n[[Page S1437]]\n\ncontinue to follow this administration's energy policies, we may get \nthere.\n  As a member of the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I \nwas somewhat surprised when a suggestion was made just a few days ago \nthat there are some who believe there is no relationship between U.S. \nproduction of petroleum and the price of gasoline in the United States. \nThat simply is not true, and it cannot be true. With oil being the \ninput ingredient into gasoline, it is the precursor for gasoline. \nAnytime we do anything that cuts off or restricts or limits the supply, \nthat is necessarily going to have an impact on the price, and it does.\n  The fact that it is indisputable that there are other factors which \nalso influence the price of gasoline makes it no less true that we have \nto produce petroleum at home in addition to buying it from other \nplaces. In order to keep gasoline prices at reasonable levels, we have \nto produce more.\n  There are some things we can do in order to help improve that trend. \nFor example, we could open ANWR for drilling. We could open our \ncountry's vast Federal public lands to development of oil shale. It is \na little known fact that in three Rocky Mountain States, a small \nsegment of Rocky Mountain States--Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming--we have \nan estimated 1.2 trillion barrels of proven recoverable oil reserves \nlocked up in oil shale. Now, 1.2 trillion barrels is a lot of oil. That \nis comparable to the combined petroleum reserves of the top 10 \npetroleum-producing countries of the world combined--just in one \nsegment of three Rocky Mountain States.\n  Yet we are not producing it commercially, in part to a very \nsignificant degree because that oil shale--especially in my State, the \nState of Utah--is overwhelmingly on Federal public land, and it is \nalmost impossible to get to it, to produce it commercially on federally \nowned public land. We need to change that.\n  We need to create a sensible environmental review process for oil and \ngas production generally. We need to improve the permitting process for \noffshore development in the Gulf of Mexico and in other areas. We need \nto allow the States to regulate hydraulic fracturing without the fear \nof suffocating and duplicative Federal regulations. We need to keep all \nthe Federal lands in the West open to all kinds of energy development. \nAnd, of course, we need the President to approve the Keystone XL \nPipeline. This will contribute substantially to America's energy \nsecurity and will provide an estimated 20,000 shovel-ready jobs right \noff the bat.\n\n  There are things we can do to help Americans with this difficult \nproblem--one that will affect almost every aspect of the day-to-day \nlives of Americans. We need government to get out of the way. We need \nthe government to become part of what the President laudably outlined \nas an all-of-the-above strategy in his State of the Union Address just \nrecently. We need to get there. We cannot afford gas at $6.60 per \ngallon, which is exactly where we are headed if we continue to do \nthings as this administration has done, which has lead to an increase \nin the price of gasoline at a staggering rate of 5 cents per gallon \nevery single month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/07/senate-section/article/S1437-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1437-S1438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RAILROAD ANTITRUST\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President.\n  I stand in this moment in opposition to the railroad antitrust \namendment offered by my distinguished colleague, Senator Kohl, and I \nurge my fellow Senators to do likewise.\n  As the Antitrust Modernization Commission noted in 2007, free market \ncompetition is the fundamental economic policy of the United States. In \nadvancing this overarching policy goal, we should be wary of \nparticularized exemptions from our Nation's antitrust laws. I know \nSenator Kohl shares my view in that regard.\n  When properly applied, antitrust laws function to help ensure that \nmarket forces promote robust competition, spur innovation, and result \nin the greatest possible benefit to the American consumer. In many \nrespects, Federal and State agencies enforce antitrust laws in order to \nforestall the need for burdensome and long-lasting government \nregulation.\n  If competition thrives and market forces operate properly, there is \nno need for extensive government intrusion or interference. Likewise, \nwhen the antitrust laws do apply, comprehensive economic regulations \nshould not dictate how an industry operates. It, therefore, makes \nlittle sense to impose upon a heavily regulated industry an additional \nlayer of government oversight and enforcement through the application \nof antitrust laws while at the same time leaving in place a \ncomprehensive regime of government oversight through economic \nregulation. Piling layer upon layer of government interference will not \nadvance the cause of free market competition, innovation, and consumer \nwelfare.\n  I am concerned that such layering of government regulation is \neffectively what the Kohl amendment does. I worry that in extending the \nreach of antitrust laws to the freight rail industry, the amendment \ndoes not remove any authority or jurisdiction of the Surface \nTransportation Board, the regulatory agency currently overseeing the \nrail industry. As a result, the amendment simply imposes additional \ngovernment supervision over the rail industry with attendant increased \nregulatory burdens and costs as well as inevitable conflicts and \nuncertainties resulting from a second layer of government oversight \nover the same activities.\n  Given the highly regulated nature of the freight rail industry, \napplication of antitrust laws would likely require courts to wade into \nthe complex realm of rate setting and other highly technical matters--a \ntask for which judges are particularly ill-equipped. In addition to \nthis fundamental unease over multiplying government regulatory burdens, \nI am also very concerned with a number of the amendment's provisions \nthat seem to reach beyond simply eliminating antitrust exceptions for \nthe rail industry.\n  First, I worry that section 4 of the amendment limits what is known \nas the doctrine of ``primary jurisdiction'' in those antitrust cases \nthat involve railroads. Under this longstanding doctrine, which was \nestablished in 1907, a court will normally defer to an expert agency \nwhen that agency has jurisdiction over the subject matter of a legal \ndispute. This doctrine allows courts to balance regulatory requirements \nwith other legal requirements for regulated industries. The primary \njurisdiction doctrine is not an antitrust exemption and discouraging \nthe use of this would be a legal and judicial change that reaches far \nbeyond the antitrust laws and its implications.\n  I would also note that section 4 would give trial lawyers the power \nto disregard agency action, but only with respect to the railroads. As \na result, railroads would be singled out for special treatment, leaving \nthe doctrine of primary jurisdiction available to the courts in cases \ninvolving electrical utilities and other regulated industries. I am \nunaware of any compelling justification for this disparity.\n  My second concern relates to section 7(a) of the amendment which not \nonly repeals antitrust immunity for rail rate bureaus but also repeals \nprocedural protections that facilitate lawful rail transportation \nservices. Because of their route structures, railroads are often not \nindividually capable of providing rail transportation services to all \nlocations that a customer may request or that regulations may require. \nAs a result, approximately 40 percent of all rail travel is jointly \nhandled by more than one railroad.\n  While the railroads must work together to provide through service on \nsome routes in order to meet their regulatory obligations and to meet \ntheir customers' transportation needs, the railroads compete with one \nanother for freight movements on routes not involved with through \nservice, and they are fully subject to the antitrust laws.\n  Current law provides that proof of an antitrust violation may not be \ninferred from discussions among two or more rail carriers relating to \ninterline movements and rates. In the conference report for the \nStaggers Rail Act of 1980, Congress explained the need for these \nevidentiary protections as follows:\n\n       Because of the requirement that carriers concur in changes \n     to joint rates, carriers must talk to competitors about \n     interline movements in which they interchange.\n       That requirement could falsely lead to conclusions about \n     rate agreements that were\n\n[[Page S1438]]\n\n     lawfully discussed. To prevent such a conclusion, the \n     Conference substitute provides procedural protections about \n     lawful discussions and resulting rates.\n\n  These evidentiary protections are not antitrust exemptions. They are \ndesigned to avoid prejudicial inferences from discussions the railroads \nmust have in order to implement joint arrangements. I am unaware of any \ncompelling reason to alter Congress's considered judgment in \nestablishing these procedural protections. Were these protections to be \ndiscarded, railroads would be exposed potentially to legal liability \nfor interline discussions, and they may choose simply not to \nparticipate, and rail customers would be faced with the burden of \nhaving to deal separately with each railroad in a given route in order \nto work out commercial and service details.\n  Third, and perhaps most critically, I am concerned that section 8 of \nthe amendment would effectively lead to retroactive application of \nantitrust laws, allowing a government agency or private plaintiff to \nbring a case attacking past railroad activities that were expressly \nimmunized from the antitrust laws in that respect.\n  Section 8(b) would allow antitrust lawsuits for ongoing railroad \nactivity that was previously immunized from the railroad antitrust \nlaws. This would leave open the possibility that conduct in accordance \nwith railroad merger and line sale transactions previously approved by \nthe Interstate Commerce Commission or the Surface Transportation Board \nas in the public interest, immunized by statute from antitrust laws, \nand implemented by the railroads, consistent with the agency's \napproval, could now be challenged as unlawful.\n  Were this to become law, the impact on the railroad network and its \nability to plan and invest to meet our Nation's growing transportation \nneeds would be adversely affected in a significant way.\n  In summary, if this amendment eliminated regulatory intervention in \nthe marketplace for rail transportation and left the rail industry \nsubject solely to the antitrust laws, I could, perhaps, endorse that \neffort. However, that is not the case. This amendment increases rather \nthan improves government oversight of the rail industry's activities \nand, in my view, is inconsistent with the overarching goal of seeking \ngreater competition in the transportation marketplace unfettered by \nintrusive government regulation.\n  In addition, the amendment goes beyond simply eliminating antitrust \nexemptions and instead changes longstanding policies and judicial \ndoctrine that are not antitrust law tenets.\n  Last year, when the Judiciary Committee favorably reported S. 49, \nwhich is the text of Senator Kohl's current amendment, I made clear \nthat my support was contingent upon resolving these and other concerns \nprior to floor consideration. Regrettably, such a resolution did not \noccur, and I must now oppose the amendment and ask my colleagues in the \nSenate to do likewise.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/07/senate-section/article/S1438-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1438-S1440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I wish to speak for a few minutes \nabout gasoline prices, which my colleague from Utah talked about a few \nminutes ago, also about domestic oil and gas production, and also about \naccess to federally owned oil and gas resources. These are issues that \nhave been raised by numerous Senators on this Transportation bill. They \nare issues of critical importance to our country's economy, to national \nsecurity, and to resource management. I have been increasingly \nconcerned that the issues we are debating and the facts that are being \nput out there are often not the true facts. There is widespread \nmisunderstanding of what needs to be done to deal with this set of \nissues, in my opinion.\n  Let me start with the issue that is most important to most Americans; \nthat is, the price of gasoline at the pump--the price of oil and then, \nof course, the price of gasoline. We need to understand clearly what is \ncausing these prices, and we need to be direct with our constituents \nabout what is causing these prices.\n  Let me state as clearly as I can what I believe is really without \ndispute among experts; that is, we do not face cycles of high gasoline \nprices in the United States because of a lack of domestic production, \nand we do not face these cycles of high gasoline prices because of the \nlack of access to Federal resources or because of some environmental \nregulation that is getting in the way of us obtaining cheap gasoline. \nAs was made clear in a hearing we had in the Senate Energy Committee in \nJanuary, the prices we are paying for oil and the products refined from \noil, such as gasoline, are set on the world market. They are relatively \ninsensitive to what happens here in the United States with regard to \nproduction. Instead, the world price of oil and our gasoline prices are \naffected more by events beyond our control, such as instability in \nLibya last year or instability in Iran and concerns about oil supply \nfrom Iran this year.\n  First, I have two charts that I think make this point very clearly. I \nbelieve this first chart I have in the Chamber is very instructive. \nThis is entitled ``Weekly Retail Price for Premium Unleaded Gasoline, \nIncluding Taxes Paid.'' There are two lines on the chart. The top line \ncontains the weekly retail prices in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, \nthe Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. You can see how that has \nfluctuated. This is through January of last year. The comparable prices \npaid in the United States are reflected in this bottom line. And, of \ncourse, the lower prices are because we pay much less in taxes than do \nthese other countries.\n  So it is a useful chart that I think makes a couple of important \npoints. The first point it makes is that the price patterns are \nremarkably similar in all countries; that is, the prices for gasoline \nin all of these countries reflect the world price of oil. Second, while \nthe patterns are similar, the U.S. price is significantly lower because \nof the lower taxes we pay in this country.\n  The second chart I have in the Chamber shows U.S. domestic oil \nproduction and U.S. gasoline prices between 1990 and 2011. Here, the \nred line is the change in domestic production year over year. The blue \nline is gasoline prices. What is striking about the chart is the lack \nof relationship between the two lines. Even with U.S. production \nincreasing, as it was at some points, oil prices also were increasing \nand gasoline prices were increasing.\n  So while domestic oil production plays an important role in the \nenergy security and the economy of our country, its contribution to the \nworld oil balance is not sufficient to bring global oil prices down. \nFor this reason, increased domestic production unfortunately will not \nbring down gasoline prices in our country.\n  We also need to understand the status of domestic production. Here \nagain, the facts are often misunderstood. For example, we have heard \nthe claim that the United States and the Obama administration have \nturned away from producing the domestic oil and gas resources we \npossess. The facts are very much to the contrary.\n\n  At the hearing we had in January in the Energy Committee, James \nBurkhard, a managing director of IHS Cambridge Energy Research \nAssociates, described our situation in this country as the ``great \nrevival'' of U.S. oil production. He provided this next graph, which \nclearly demonstrates what we are experiencing in the United States. \nThis graph shows the net change in production of petroleum liquids in \nthe United States and in other major oil-producing countries between \n2008 and 2011. The U.S. increase is shown by this very large column \nhere on the left. We can see that our increase in production is far \ngreater than that of any other country in the world. The United States \nis now the third largest oil producer in the world, after Russia and \nSaudi Arabia.\n  Another chart on domestic production is also instructive. This chart \nshows total U.S. oil production between 2000 and 2011. It clearly \ndemonstrates that current increases in oil production are reversing \nseveral years of decline in that production. We have not had to change \nany environmental laws or limit protections that apply to public lands \nin order to get these increases.\n  This next chart shows the percentage of our liquid fuel consumption \nthat is imported, including the projections the\n\n[[Page S1439]]\n\nEnergy Information Administration has made out to 2020. The trend is \nvery encouraging. In 2005 we imported almost 60 percent of the oil we \nconsumed. Now we import about 49 percent of the oil we consume. The \nEnergy Information Administration projects that these imports will \ncontinue to decline to around 38 percent by 2020. This is an enormous \nimprovement that we would not have thought possible even a few years \nago.\n  Now, let me say a few words about natural gas because that is also \nsomething which greatly affects utility bills in this country and, of \ncourse, is very important to our economy.\n  The good news continues as we look at natural gas. This graph shows \nU.S. natural gas production between 2000 and 2011. As we can see, there \nhas been a dramatic increase in recent years. As we have heard from the \nInternational Energy Agency, headquartered in Paris, U.S. gas \nproduction grew by more than 7 percent in 2011. Our natural gas \nreserves are such that the United States is expected to become an \noverall net exporter of natural gas in the next decade. And natural gas \ninventories are now at record highs--20 percent above their level at \nthe same time last year. In fact, there is so much natural gas being \nproduced, frankly, some producers are shutting-in production. They are \nwaiting and hoping that prices improve before they actually sell the \nnatural gas they are able to produce today.\n  This next chart contains production data for the world's largest \nnatural gas producers for the years 2008 through 2010. There are three \nbars here. The green bar is 2010 production, the most recent data \navailable. This chart shows that in 2009, the United States surpassed \nRussia and became literally the world's leader in natural gas \nproduction. The green bar shows that trend continued in 2010.\n  So, unlike oil, the price of natural gas is not set on the world \nmarket. For natural gas, our enormous domestic resources and increased \nproduction have a significant effect on the price American consumers \nhave to pay on their utility bills especially. Natural gas prices are \nnear historic lows, and this is important to consumers who depend on \nthis fuel for electricity, for heating. It is good for manufacturers \nwho depend on natural gas. It is good for our economy overall.\n  Further evidence of our extremely robust domestic oil and gas \nproduction is the fact that the number of oil and gas drilling rigs \nactive in the United States exceeds that of most of the rest of the \nworld. As of last week, there were 1,981 rigs actively exploring for or \ndeveloping oil and natural gas in the United States. The best \ncomparable figure we have for rigs operating internationally is 1,871. \nThis does not include Russia. It does not include China. It is probably \nsafe to say, though, that more oil and gas drilling is occurring here \nin the United States than in any other country in the world.\n  Despite our relatively modest resource base for conventional \npetroleum, the industry in the United States has led the world in \ndeveloping state-of-the-art technology for oil and gas exploration and \nproduction, tapping both conventional formations and unconventional \nresources, such as shale and tight sands.\n  To use a boxing metaphor, we are ``punching above our weight'' in oil \nand gas production, thanks to the technology lead our companies have \ndeveloped, and it is a success story our country should celebrate. Even \nin light of this good news on domestic production, we hear claims that \nthe Obama administration has withheld access to the oil and gas that is \navailable on Federal lands and the Outer Continental Shelf. So we in \nCongress are urged to mandate that virtually all federally owned oil \nand gas resources be leased for development more quickly without regard \nto any impact that might have on other resources or economic interests, \nwithout any scientific analysis that is currently required.\n  Again, however, the facts tell us a different story. Secretary \nSalazar testified before our Energy Committee on February 28 that oil \nproduction from the Outer Continental Shelf has increased by 30 percent \nsince 2008. It is now at 589 million barrels--in 2010. Annual oil \nproduction onshore on Federal lands increased by over 8 million barrels \nbetween 2008 and 2011. It is now over 111 million barrels of \nproduction.\n  Industry has been given access to millions of acres, much of which \nthey either have not leased--not chosen to lease--or they have not put \ninto production. In 2009, 53 million acres of the resource-rich central \nand western Gulf of Mexico were offered for lease. Industry chose to \nlease only 2.7 million out of that 53 million acres. In 2010, 37 \nmillion acres of the gulf were offered. Only 2.4 million acres were \nactually leased in that year.\n  In June of 2012, 3 months from now, the administration will offer \nanother 38 million acres in the central Gulf of Mexico for lease. The \nInterior Department estimates that these areas could produce 1 billion \nbarrels of oil and 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The \nadministration has recently proposed a leasing plan for 2012 through \n2017 that would make at least 75 percent of the undiscovered, \ntechnically recoverable oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental \nShelf available for lease.\n  So even when the industry leases these resources, it often does not \nmove to produce oil or gas from these areas they have leased. Onshore, \nout of 38 million acres currently under lease, the industry has about \n12 million acres actually producing. Offshore, there are a total of 35 \nmillion acres under lease. Six million acres of that is actually in \nproduction.\n  As of September 2011, industry held over 7,000 permits to drill \nonshore that were not being used. I have heard it stated that only 2 \npercent of the acres in the Outer Continental Shelf are currently \nleased and that this is evidence of lack of access to the resources. In \nmy view, this is a misleading way to think about the current situation.\n  Just as oil is not found uniformly everywhere on land but instead is \nconcentrated where the geology is favorable, the same is true offshore. \nThe total acreage on the Outer Continental Shelf is huge. It is 1.7 \nbillion acres. Much of it does not have oil and gas reserves that can \nbe tapped economically.\n  Oil and gas occurs in the greatest quantities in only a few areas, \nsuch as the central and western Gulf of Mexico. It is those productive \nregions in which the industry expresses interest and which are the \nprimary areas where leasing is occurring that the Obama administration \nplan would cover.\n  The total 1.7 billion acres is not a useful metric without \nconsideration of which of those acres actually have significant oil and \ngas resources that are economically recoverable. Much more relevant is \nthe amount of the resources that are being made available. As I pointed \nout, Secretary Salazar has testified that the proposed 5-year oil and \ngas leasing plan they have put forward would make more than 75 percent \nof the Outer Continental Shelf resources available for development.\n  The bottom line is, an increased amount of Federal acres and \nresources onshore and offshore are being made available to industry. \nProduction on federally owned resources continues to increase. The \nincrease in this production can be even greater if industry would lease \nand explore and produce on a greater percentage of the lands that are \noffered to them for lease, the lands that are believed to have some of \nthe highest oil and gas resource potential.\n  Before I close, let me return for a moment to the issue of gasoline \nprices. It is clear we are increasing our domestic production \nsignificantly but that gasoline prices continue to rise. So we need to \nlook for other solutions. This does not mean we are powerless to help \nreduce the price of gasoline. We know what we need to do.\n  If we want to reduce our vulnerability to world oil prices and to \nvolatility of world oil prices, the most important measure we can take \nis to find ways to use less oil. One of our colleagues gave a good \nspeech a few years ago in which he advocated that we produce more and \nuse less. We are doing a pretty good job of producing more, and we need \nto do a better job of using less. We can do much better in this ``use \nless'' part of the equation without affecting the quality of life in \nthis country. We can do that by being more efficient in our use of \nfuel, by diversifying our sources of transportation fuel away from oil.\n  We have taken some first steps along this path, notably in the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007. It passed the Senate with a \nstrong bipartisan vote. That law required us to make our vehicles more \nefficient and\n\n[[Page S1440]]\n\nto shift toward relying more on renewable fuel, and it is working. \nDemand is down. Biofuel use is up. Consumers save money on fuel for \ntheir vehicles. Our percentage of imported oil has dropped by over 10 \npercent.\n  How do we continue on this path forward toward reducing oil use and \ndependence? I think there are three areas we can focus on. First, we \nneed to enable further expansion of our renewable fuel industry, which \nis currently facing infrastructure and financing constraints. Second, \nwe need to move forward the timeline for market penetration of electric \nvehicles. Finally, we need to make sure we use natural gas vehicles in \nas many applications as make sense based on that technology. Every \nbarrel of oil that we are able to displace in the transportation sector \nand that we therefore do not need to consume makes our economy \nstronger.\n  Obviously, it also helps our personal pocketbooks. It makes us less \navailable to the volatility of the current marketplace. This is not to \nsay we should not keep drilling and that the Obama administration \nshould not continue to move forward with its plans to bring even more \nsupplies into the market. We lead the world in innovative exploration \nand production technology. It is helpful to our economy and our \nnational security to increase domestic supply, and that is exactly what \nis happening.\n  But in the many debates we will have in the future over issues \nrelated to gasoline prices, we need to recognize the key issue very \nclearly is not lack of access to federally owned oil and gas resources. \nOur public lands contain many resources and uses that Americans value. \nWe do not need to sacrifice science or balance the protection of these \nother resources and economic interests in order to have robust domestic \nproduction.\n  The long-term solution to the challenge of high and volatile oil \nprices is to continue to reduce our dependence on oil. This is a \nstrategic vision that President George W. Bush, who had previously \nworked in the oil industry, clearly articulated in his State of the \nUnion speech in 2006. We subsequently proved in Congress in 2007, the \nyear after that State of the Union speech, that we have the ability to \nmake significant changes in our energy consumption and that it is \npossible to mobilize a bipartisan consensus to do that. The bipartisan \npath the Senate embraced in 2007 is still the right approach today.\n  As part of whatever approach we take to energy and transportation in \nthe weeks and months ahead, we need to be honest with our constituents \nabout what works, and we need to keep moving in the direction that we \nbegan moving in with that 2007 bill. We need to allow the facts and not \nthe myths to be our best guide.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/07/senate-section/article/S1440-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1440-S1441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SURFACE TRANSPORTATION ACT\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to address the surface \ntransportation bill that is on the floor. It has been a mark of the \nchallenges this body faces in deliberation that we have now been on \nthis bill for 3 weeks, and we have not had a debate over transportation \namendments. But hope does spring eternal.\n  In that spirit, I wished to come to the floor and share some thinking \nabout the amendments that we should be debating and should be approving \nin this process. Certainly, the underlying Transportation bill is a \ngreat step toward our No. 1 goal of passing legislation that would \ncreate jobs, put people back to work in the hardest hit sectors of our \neconomy.\n  Building and repairing our transportation infrastructure will create \nor save 2 million jobs nationwide, good-paying jobs that would provide \na huge boost to our struggling construction industry, the families, to \nthe workers, and to our economy. This infrastructure we would be \nbuilding is a downpayment for the success of our future economy.\n  China is spending 10 percent of its GDP on infrastructure. They are \npreparing for a stronger economy in the future. Europe is spending 5 \npercent of their GDP, but in America we are spending only 2 percent. \nIndeed, it was not but a few months ago that our colleagues on the \nHouse side of Capitol Hill said we should cut transportation spending \nby 30 to 35 percent, which would devastate the infrastructure efforts \nthat are underway, even within the existing 2 percent, the small amount \nwe are spending.\n  Is it any wonder our communities are struggling to repair the bridges \nand roads we have, let alone to solve the challenges, the bottlenecks \nin the transportation lines that need to be addressed for the future. \nWe have made a good start in committee on this bill, despite the \nparalysis on the floor of the Senate. We had elements of this bill go \nthrough four different committees and incorporate good ideas from both \nsides of the aisle in each of those committees and come to the floor in \na bipartisan fashion.\n  I wish to share a couple other thoughts to build on this groundwork \nthat came out of our committees, commonsense fixes, cutting redtape, \nand closing loopholes. The first amendment, No. 1653, is one I am \nsponsoring with my colleagues Senator Toomey and Senator Blunt. Right \nnow, farmers are exempt from certain Federal regulations when they \ntransport their products in farm vehicles, as long as they are \ntransporting these products inside their own State. But should they \nventure across State lines, even by just a short distance, then the \nFederal regulations are triggered. So we have farmers who are simply \ntrying to get their products to market, to the local grain elevator, if \nyou will, and they have to cross a State border and suddenly their \nchallenge becomes very complex indeed.\n  For instance, Oregon farmers who live just across the border from \nIdaho, in these cases, the best market might be the nearest processing \nfacility just across the State line. These farmers are exactly the same \nas their counterparts elsewhere, except for one small fact, the \nprocessing facility is across the border. This arbitrary distinction \ncan mean major differences in how these farmers and ranchers have to do \nbusiness in the form of additional burdensome regulations, regulations \nsuch as vehicle inspections for every trip the vehicle makes, even if \nthe farm vehicle is simply driving from the field to the barn or having \nto adhere to reporting requirements for things like hours of service \nrules, even though the farmer is just driving an hour down the road; or \nobtaining medical certifications meant for commercial truck drivers.\n\n  This amendment would simply make life a little easier and more \nlogical for these farmers by exempting them from these regulations \ndesigned for interstate transport, not designed to intervene or \ninterfere when a farmer is attempting to take his product to market. We \nhave put limits on mileage and limits on purpose to make sure it serves \nthe intended function--to get rid of that arbitrary boundary that \ncreates a regulatory nightmare.\n  A second amendment is related to freight. The underlying bill has a \nfreight program to improve the performance of the national freight \nnetwork. That is a proposal that will help make desperately needed \nimprovements. There are a few technical improvements that would further \nimprove the bill; that is, to recognize that funding should be used in \nthe most efficient and effective way to ensure that high-value goods \nare being moved quickly to market.\n  We often think of freight in terms of volume or tonnage. But when we \nstart looking at the high-tech sector, we can have enormously high-\nvalue content such as that produced by the microchip industry in Oregon \nand the roads necessary to make sure that high-value freight gets to \nmarket, which drives a tremendous number of jobs. It is just as \nimportant to address as are the routes that involve high tonnage and \nvolume.\n  Let's turn to a third issue, which is ``Buy American.'' I salute my \ncolleagues, Sherrod Brown and Bernie Sanders, for working on these \nissues. We already recognize the principle that if we are paying to \ncomplete a public infrastructure project in America, it only makes \nsense for American businesses and workers to do as much of the work as \npossible.\n  Unfortunately, there are several loopholes that have undermined this \nbasic premise in recent years. My amendment No. 1599 is an amendment \nthat addresses one of these loopholes.\n  This summer, construction of a rail bridge in Alaska to a military \nbase will\n\n[[Page S1441]]\n\nbe undertaken by a Chinese company because the Federal Rail \nAdministration, unlike the Federal Transit and Federal Highway \nAdministration, doesn't have the ``Buy American'' provision. An \nAmerican company was ready to build this bridge, but because of this \nloophole the contract went to a Chinese company using Chinese steel. \nIsn't it frustrating that the infrastructure to provide access to a \nmilitary base involves jobs and the steel going across the Pacific \nOcean?\n  Then I wanted to note that a related amendment led by Senator Sherrod \nBrown, No. 1807, addresses another ``Buy American'' challenge. States \nhave been using a project segmentation loophole to avoid putting \nAmericans to work, to avoid the ``Buy American'' seal.\n  The Bay Bridge in California put in 12 separate projects so that \nFederal funds would only apply to a couple of those pieces. This allows \nthe bulk of the bridge to be built--you guessed it--with Chinese steel, \nby Chinese workers. My amendment is modeled after a Republican \namendment in the House Transportation bill, by Representative Cravaack \nof Minnesota, to close this loophole and ensure that the spirit of the \nlaw is upheld. These provisions were incorporated into the amendment \nled by Senator Sherrod Brown.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these amendments to make these \ncommonsense fixes to our transportation program. We must have debate on \nthe amendments on the Senate floor. This room should not be empty. The \nconversation should not be quiet because transportation is at the heart \nof our economy.\n  We have a construction industry that is flat on its back. We have \ninterest rates that are low. We have infrastructure that needs to be \nbuilt. This is a win-win for our future economy and our current workers \nand our current economy.\n  Let's get to work. I ask my colleagues to continuously object to \namendments being debated--for those listening in, the Senate has had a \nrule that any Senator can block an amendment. We have to get 100 \npercent of the Senators to agree to bring an amendment to the floor. \nThe social contract that allows this to happen on a regular and orderly \nfashion in the past has been broken. So while families across this \ncountry look to us to put a transportation plan into place for our \nfuture economy and to put America back to work now, we are sitting here \nfiddling. Let's end the fiddling and do our work so America can do its \nwork of rebuilding our highway infrastructure.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thought I would use this opportunity \nto inform our colleagues and anyone following this transportation \ndebate as to where we are.\n  Yesterday, we had an opportunity to stop the filibuster and get right \nto our bill and get it done and protect 1.8 million jobs and create \nanother 1 million. We didn't do that--pretty much on a party line vote. \nThe filibuster continues.\n  The hopeful sign we had was right before the vote when the Republican \nleader said he was open to reaching an agreement. I was hopeful that \nagreement would not contain extraneous votes. I don't think that is \ngoing to happen. I think we are going to face extraneous votes--to \nrepeal Clean Air Act rules, to open our States to drilling that rely on \nfishing and tourism and recreation when we know the oil companies have \nmillions of acres they can drill on without going to these areas that \nare so essential to our economic future just as they are to our \nenvironmental future. It looks as though we are going to face that and \na vote probably on the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n  Again, I am very sad we could not come together when we have a bill \nthat got an 85-to-11 vote to proceed to it. We still have to face a \nfilibuster and still we had to lose two votes to cut off debate. But \nthe Senate, being the Senate, this is it.\n  So now we have to vote. The two leaders can agree. I hope they can \nwork together to achieve an agreement whereby we would have votes on \nthese extraneous matters, and, hopefully, we would not have a prolonged \ndebate on them because this is a highway bill. Thousands and thousands \nof businesses are waiting for us to act. By March 31, if we don't act, \neverything stops. In your State and mine all these highway projects \nwill shut down with no Federal contribution at all, which is most of \nthem.\n  I am hopeful. I cannot report to the Senate that we have an agreement \nnow, but I hope we will have one at some point today. Once we do have \nthat, we have a path forward; and if we work together in goodwill, we \ncan get this done.\n  Frankly, I don't think we have a choice but to get it done. \nEverything, as I said, expires March 31. Here it is March 7 and we have \na few days left before this whole thing blows up, and we will have no \nhighway bill and people will be laid off.\n  In this economic time, that is the last result we need. We need to \nfix our highways, bridges, and roads.\n  Madam President, the occupant of the chair is a proud member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. She has worked hard to get us \nto this day. I know she has worked hard to bring this debate to a close \nand get a path forward. We can all hope that happens today.\n  I will be back on the floor with Senator Inhofe. I am hopeful the two \nof us can lead us through this bill and get this bill done. Then I \nthink we can have the House follow our example of Democrats and \nRepublicans working together. If they start that over there, they will \nhave the bill quicker than they think, and we can finally put this \nbehind us and send a message that we are functioning.\n  This concept of a Federal highway system was brought to us by a \nRepublican President, Dwight Eisenhower. He understood logistics better \nthan most. He knew we could not have a thriving economy if we could not \nmove goods and people. So I am hopeful. I will be back on the Senate \nfloor when we have an agreement and we can move forward.\n  I will yield the floor, as I know the Senator from Vermont is here. I \nalways look forward to his comments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S1442]]\n\n                            Citizens United\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, over 2 years ago, the Supreme Court \nrendered what I consider to be one of the worst decisions in the \nhistory of the United States Supreme Court, and that is regarding the \ncase of Citizens United. In that case, the Supreme Court, by a 5-to-4 \ndecision, determined that corporations are people, and they have first \namendment rights to spend as much money as they want on elections. I \nthink when that decision first came about a lot of people in this \ncountry didn't pay attention to it. They looked at it as an abstract \nlegal decision, not terribly important.\n\n  Well, today the American people understand the disastrous impact that \ndecision has had because what they are seeing right now on their \ntelevision screens all across this country is a handful of billionaires \nand large corporations spending huge amounts of money on the political \nprocess, and the American people are asking themselves: Is this really \nwhat people fought and died for when they put their lives on the line \nto defend American democracy? Is American democracy evolving into a \nsituation where a small number of billionaires can put hundreds of \nmillions of dollars into the political process in this State and that \nState, in Presidential elections, and then elect the people who will \ngovern this country?\n  I believe very strongly the American people do not think that is \nappropriate, and I am very happy to say that yesterday, on Town Meeting \nDay in the State of Vermont--I think my small State has begun the \nprocess to overturn this disastrous Citizens United decision. We had 55 \ntowns at town meetings demand the Congress move forward to overturn \nCitizens United and restore American democracy to the concept of one \nperson, one vote.\n  What we do on Town Meeting Day in Vermont, all over our State, is \npeople come together and argue about the school budget. They argue \nabout the town budget. They debate the issues, and then they vote. What \npeople in Vermont are saying is they do not want to see our democracy \ndevolve into a situation where corporations are determining who will \ngovern our Nation.\n  So I am very proud that in the State of Vermont just yesterday 55 \nseparate towns voted to urge the Congress to move forward on a \nconstitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. I hope we will \nheed what the towns in Vermont are saying. I hope other towns and \ncities in States all over the country will move forward in that \ndirection. I hope the day will come--sooner rather than later--where \nthe Congress will entertain a constitutional amendment and bring it \nback to the States.\n  Madam President, at this difficult moment in American democracy, it \nis imperative that we stand and reclaim our democracy and say to the \nmillionaires and billionaires and the large corporations: Sorry, this \ncountry belongs to all of us. This democracy belongs to all of us and \nnot just to you.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the names of the 55 towns that passed resolutions yesterday to \noverturn Citizens United.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Bolton, Brandon, Brattleboro, Bristol, Burlington, Calais, \n     Charlotte, Chester, Chittenden, Craftsbury, East Montpelier, \n     Fayston, Fletcher, Greensboro, Granville, Hardwick, Hartland, \n     Hinesburg, Jericho, Marlboro, Marshfield, Monkton, Moretown, \n     Montpelier, Newfane, Peru, Plainfield, Randolph, Richmond, \n     Ripton, Roxbury, Rochester, Rutland City, Rutland Town, \n     Sharon, Shelburne, South Burlington, Thetford Center, \n     Tunbridge, Underhill, Waitsfield, Walden, Waltham, Warren, \n     West Haven, Williamstown, Williston, Windsor, Winooski, \n     Woodbury, Woodstock, Worcester,\n\n  I am proud to sponsor a constitutional amendment which would overturn \nCitizens United and return the power to regulate elections to Congress \nand the states. In the coming weeks and months I hope to see more \ntowns, cities, counties, and states pass similar resolutions.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an issue of \ngreat importance to millions of my constituents in New York, our \nNation's transportation system, particularly public transit. This is \nthe very lifeline that millions rely on to get to and from work, to \nbring their paychecks home every single day to their families at night. \nVarious proposals that have been put forth throughout the course of the \ndebate in both the House and the Senate would actually slash funding \nfor mass transit. The proposal advanced by the House Republicans last \nmonth to eliminate the mass transit account of the highway funds was a \nstunning misunderstanding of our Nation's transit needs. Cutting off \npublic transit from its traditional funding source without providing \nviable alternatives is irresponsible. In fact, former Congressman and \nnow Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood called the House bill ``the \nworst transportation bill'' he had ever seen.\n  Let me state some clear facts. New York's Metropolitan Transit \nAuthority is the Nation's largest public transportation system, \noperating over 8,000 rail and subway cars and nearly 6,000 buses. On an \naverage weekday, nearly 8.5 million Americans ride these trains, \nsubways, and buses operated by the MTA to commute to work or to visit \nthe city, which generates enormous economic revenue, not just for New \nYork but for our country. Moving these riders into cars flies in the \nface of any sound environmental public policy and furthers our \ndependence on Middle Eastern oil.\n  Increasing costs for our Nation's transit riders should be rejected \nout of hand by the Senate. I will continue to work with my colleagues \nto ensure that we do what is responsible and that we maintain transit \nfunding to encourage the use of mass transit and reduce our dependence \non foreign oil. I understand we have many very difficult decisions to \nmake as we debate this bill, but I think stopping New York's transit \nsystem in its tracks is simply not a credible solution.\n  I also have a few amendments for this bill. Each of them is equally \nimportant and they address different issues. The first one I wish to \naddress affects me as a mom of two young boys who I know will want to \nbe driving at 16. Kids all across America cannot wait for that day when \nthey get their driver's license. But there are terrible statistics \nabout teen deaths. In fact, one statistic showed 11 teens die every \nsingle day because of car accidents. I know every family in America has \nbeen affected by those horrible high school tragedies, of kids dying in \na car accident on their way home from the big game, on their way from \nthe prom, every scenario we can imagine.\n  We have to give our teens better tools, better training, so when they \nget to become full-time drivers and have all the various permissions \nallowed, they are ready for that. We can imagine the scenarios in our \nown minds as parents, I know. Think about texting and driving. One \ncannot imagine how deadly distracted driving is in our country. Imagine \nthe young driver who does not have a lot of judgment. Imagine the young \ndriver who has five other kids in the car and they are coming back from \nthe big game and they are all excited and they are all listening to the \nmusic and it is nighttime. Those are risky situations where we know if \nwe give those drivers more training before they are in those risky \nsituations, they will be able to handle them better.\n  Experts agree the graduated driver's license, basically gradually \nphasing teens into the driving experience with different \nresponsibilities and different permissions as they get older, is the \nway to begin to address some of these risks. It has been a proven \neffective method in many States that have already instituted graduated \ndriver's licenses. So I think we need to have a national priority, a \npriority that says they must as a State put in some basic training \nrequirements, some measure of graduated driver's license, to ensure \nwhen these kids get on the road they have the skills and tools they \nneed to keep themselves safe, their passengers safe, and the other \ndrivers on the road are safe as well.\n\n[[Page S1443]]\n\n  As parents, as people who set public policy for our Nation, we should \nbe making the safety and well-being and the lives of at least those 11 \nteens every day who die a priority, and this is a proven way to do it \nand we can do it.\n  The second amendment basically increases economic opportunity. New \nYork is unusual in that we are a border State. We share a border with \nCanada. There is so much opportunity for cross-border transactions and \ncross-border commerce. This change is very simple. It gives authority \nto our States to invest in critical border crossings, such as freight \nand passenger rail systems. By providing this very simple change, \nStates such as New York, California, Vermont, and Texas will be able to \nchoose to enhance these crossings and increase many more economic \nengines to address our tough economy.\n  The last amendment, equally important, is about jobs. How do we \ncreate the economic engine to get America working again? One way is to \nincrease our pipeline, actually do better training for jobs that are \navailable. One of the ways we can do that is this pilot program, \nalready proven effective elsewhere, the Construction Careers \nDemonstration Project, amendment No. 1648. Basically, it is a proven \ncommonsense strategy for at-risk workers to give them an opportunity to \nbe trained in the building and construction trades so they find \nemployment, they provide for their families, and we reduce \nunemployment. It is a very simple change. It is just a pilot program.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these three amendments and focus on \nhow we can pass a good, useful, beneficial transportation bill which \nwill get our economy moving.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Tribute To Judge Jimmie Edwards\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a new and \nsuccessful program for at-risk youth in St. Louis--the Innovative \nConcept Academy--and about its founder, my friend, Judge Jimmie \nEdwards. Before I talk about the school and the incredible work Judge \nEdwards has done in the St. Louis community, I wish to spend a moment \ntalking about his childhood roots.\n  Judge Edwards grew up on the north side of St. Louis in the shadows \nof the city's Pruitt-Igoe housing project. The residents of this \nhousing project faced many challenges, including drug and gang \nactivity, violence, and sometimes acute poverty. But through \ndiscipline, hard work, and determination, Judge Edwards rose above \nthese circumstances. He earned his bachelor's and law degrees from St. \nLouis University before being appointed to the State bench in 1992, and \nfor 4 years he has served as the chief judge of the St. Louis Family \nCourt's Juvenile Division.\n  During his service on the bench, Judge Edwards became increasingly \nconcerned about the number of young repeat offenders coming into his \ncourtroom time and time again, only to be sent back to the same \ntroubled environment that negatively influenced their behavior in the \nfirst place. From his own experience, he knew that offering these kids \nthe opportunity for a proper education and for mentoring was absolutely \ncritical to breaking the cycle.\n  In 2009 Judge Edwards, together with the St. Louis public school \ndistrict, the Family Court Juvenile Division, and the nonprofit \norganization MERS/Goodwill Industries, founded Innovative Concept \nAcademy, a unique educational opportunity for juveniles who had already \nbeen expelled from the city's public schools and who were on parole. \nThese young people, whom many would have given up on, found a \nformidable advocate in Judge Edwards and the academy. From the \nbeginning, Innovative Concept Academy has been devoted to helping at-\nrisk youth achieve success through education, rehabilitation, and \nmentorship. Its mission--to enrich the learning environment for some of \nour most troubled kids--has resulted in second chances for these young \nmen and women to dramatically improve their lives.\n  At the start, Judge Edwards planned on providing educational and \nmentoring services to 30 students who had been suspended or expelled \ndue to Missouri's Safe Schools Act. When he asked the St. Louis public \nschools for a building to use for the program for 30 students, they \nasked him if he wouldn't mind taking on the responsibility of 200 more. \nThis was a challenge he accepted with his usual enthusiasm and can-do \nattitude.\n  During the first year of its existence, the academy saw 246 students \nmove through its doors. Today the academy teaches at-risk youth between \nages 10 and 18 and has an enrollment of over 375. Some of these \nstudents are visiting our Nation's Capital this week with Judge \nEdwards, his wife Stacy, his daughter Ashley, and his son John, along \nwith chaperones. Here today along with Judge Edwards and his family and \nchaperones are students Angel Tharpe, Deyon Smith, Tyrell Williams, and \nNadia Jones. These are young men and women who have turned their lives \naround with the help of Judge Edwards and the academy and who serve as \nan inspiration to others in the community and, frankly, an inspiration \nto me. I am so proud of what they have been able to accomplish.\n  The Innovative Concept Academy provides these students and many like \nthem with so many important services--a quality education in a safe \nenvironment; one-on-one mentoring with school staff, counselors, deputy \njunior officers, and police; an array of extracurricular and \nafterschool activities, many of which are often new experiences for \nthese students, including golf, chess, dance, classical music, and \ncreative writing; uniforms, meals, and so many other necessities are \nalso provided; and with tough love and important lessons about \ndiscipline, respect, anger management, goal setting, and follow-\nthrough.\n  All of this allows the students to meet their full potential, and St. \nLouis has seen positive results already. The academy has an attendance \nrate of over 90 percent. Let me repeat that. The academy has an amazing \nattendance rate of over 90 percent, and we are seeing significant \nimprovement in these young people's grades. And the students are \nresponding positively. For example, at the end of the first semester at \nthe academy, the suspensions of 40 of the students ended and the \nstudents were supposed to return to their home school. Almost every \nstudent asked if they could stay at the academy because they know the \nacademy is a special place where they can improve their lives.\n  The innovative program has garnered national attention. Judge Edwards \nhas appeared as a guest on a number of major network shows and most \nrecently was honored by People Magazine as one of its 2011 Heroes of \nthe Year. But, for him, it is not about the magazines or the \ninterviews; for him, it is still about the kids.\n  I am proud that Judge Edwards hails from my home State of Missouri \nand from my hometown of St. Louis. His compassion for those whom \nsociety may have given up on and his commonsense and innovative \napproach to solving the problems facing some of our young men and women \nare inspirational. He is compelled by his duty to serve and uplift the \nnext generation no matter what the circumstances. He said it best when \nhe observed that ``if the community, and that includes judges, does not \ntake it upon itself to educate the children, then our community and \nwhat we stand for will be no more.'' This notion that we all succeed \nwhen we work together with a common cause and unified purpose is \ncentral to our American identity.\n  I ask my distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the \nInnovative Concept Academy and Judge Jimmie Edwards. The success of the \nacademy and Judge Edwards' dedication and service to the St. Louis \ncommunity should be an inspiration for everybody serving in this \nChamber. If we could have a little bit of Judge Jimmie Edwards' \nattitude about working together, not worrying about taking the credit, \nand a can-do attitude, it is amazing what we could accomplish on behalf \nof the American people.\n\n[[Page S1444]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor for my distinguished colleague, the \nSenator from Missouri, Mr. Blunt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for all the comments \nshe has made about Judge Edwards, his family, and the school. This is \ntruly a remarkable story. I know both of our staffs have been telling \nus for some time now of incident after incident of young people's lives \nthat are being changed by this school, by a judge who decided he needed \nto get outside the courtroom to make a difference in the lives of kids.\n  In fact, People magazine calls this the ``School of Last Resort.'' It \nis a chance, it is an opportunity of which many are taking advantage.\n  Judge Ohmer, presiding judge of the circuit where Judge Edwards \nworks, put out the following statement. He said:\n\n       The editors of PEOPLE magazine have selected St. Louis \n     Juvenile Court Judge Jimmie Edwards as one of the \n     publication's `Heroes of the Year' for 2011. Judge Edwards \n     was profiled in a recent issue of the magazine and the \n     announcement was made in the November 7, 2011 issue.\n\n  Quoted in this comment from his colleague, the magazine said:\n\n       ``We chose men and women who reached across boundaries to \n     help strangers or worked within their communities to deepen \n     bonds. From Logan, Utah . . . to Judge Jimmie Edwards of St. \n     Louis who started a school for wayward teens, the 2011 \n     winners never let daunting odds stand in their way,'' said \n     Managing Editor [of People magazine] Larry Hackett.\n\n  In 2009, after watching a string of teen offenders come through his \ncourtroom, Judge Edwards decided to take action. Along with 45 \ncommunity partners, he took over an abandoned school that he and I were \ntalking about earlier today and opened the Innovative Concept Academy. \nProviding strict discipline, counseling, and programs such as, as my \ncolleague mentioned, music, chess, and creative writing, the center \nliterally has changed life after life of young person after young \nperson, giving them the opportunity to graduate from high school and \nlead successful lives after they had been expelled from high school at \nan earlier time.\n  These winners each received an award of $10,000 that they were able \nto use for their favorite causes, and certainly Judged Edwards has this \ncause and others.\n  Quoting Judge Edwards:\n\n       I am thrilled that our school has received this recognition \n     but also amazed at the other individuals across America \n     profiled by the magazine.\n\n  Judged Edwards is married to Stacy, and Stacy is here today in \nWashington with two of their three children--Amy, Ashley, and John.\n  His colleagues at the circuit court admire what he has done. The \nfamilies involved, the teachers involved, the community partners \ninvolved admire what has happened here. MERS Goodwill, the St. Louis \npublic schools, according to the judge himself, court employees, all \nthe teachers and staff and volunteers at the school have made a \ndifference in the Innovative Concept Academy.\n  Judge Edwards said:\n\n       By supporting our school St. Louis is refusing to give up \n     on troubled juveniles and, in turn, the students are proving \n     that hope for a better life is a universal dream.\n\n  What a great story this is. His colleagues see him as a hero among \nus. People magazine has talked about this. I notice and like in the \nPeople magazine article what they refer to as Judge Jimmie's rules. \nHere are three of Judge Jimmie's rules.\n  One headline is, ``No Saggy Pants.''\n\n       Like mumbling, bad grammar and rudeness, droopy pants are \n     big no-nos [at this school]. ``Kids need to understand what \n     it means to be civilized,'' says Edwards.\n\n  Another rule: ``No Loitering.''\n\n       Edwards wears his kids out with after-school activities. \n     ``I expect them to be so tired that they can't do anything \n     but go [home and go] to sleep, get back up and start [the \n     day] all over again.''\n\n  Then maybe the best rule of all: ``No Quitting.''\n\n       ``As long as you're trying,'' says Edwards, ``you're \n     succeeding.''\n\n  This is being proven time after time, day after day: One person can \nmake a difference, and the way this one judge has made a difference is \ninspiring a lot of other people to come together and make that \ndifference, and then inspiring these kids and others who care about \nthem to decide that this is the school of last resort, but the school \nof last resort can produce lots of great results, and we are seeing \nthat happen. I am proud this is going on in our State and hope that \nJudge Edwards's example becomes an example for community after \ncommunity around this country.\n  I yield back the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness and engage in a colloquy with my colleagues for up to 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I do week after \nweek, as a physician who has practiced medicine in Wyoming for almost \none-quarter of a century to give a doctor's second opinion about the \nhealth care law, a law that I believe is bad for patients, it is bad \nfor providers--the nurses and the doctors who take care of those \npatients--and terrible for taxpayers.\n  March 23 of this year, a little over 2 weeks from now, will mark the \nsecond anniversary of the President's health care law being signed. Two \nyears ago at this time, Democrats in Congress said the Americans would \nlearn to love this law. As a matter of fact, on March 28, 2010, the \nsenior Senator from New York Mr. Schumer said: As people learn what's \nexactly in the bill, 6 months from now by election time--the election \nof 2010, remember--this is going to be a plus. Because the parade of \nhorribles, particularly the worries that the average middle-income \nperson has that this is going to affect them negatively, those will \nhave vanished and they will see it will affect them positively in many \nways.\n  Here we are 2 years later. We know that is definitely not the case. \nThe health care law is more unpopular today than it was when it was \npassed and Nancy Pelosi famously said: First, you have to pass it \nbefore you get to find out what is in it. The more the American people \nhave learned about the President's new law, the less they like it. \nMaybe that is why the White House and Democrats in Congress are hoping \nthis 2-year anniversary of the health care law passes quietly and \nwithout great fanfare, while Republicans believe the American people \ndeserve to know exactly how this law is going to impact them as well as \nthe health care they receive.\n  So in the lead-up to the second anniversary of the law, I am going to \ntalk about specific ways the law has actually made it worse for the \nAmerican people--something I believed from the beginning would happen \nand now, 2 years later, we are seeing is specifically the case: It has \nhurt jobs, it has driven up costs, it has given Washington more control \nover Americans' health care, and I believe it has weakened Medicare.\n  Today, Senator Cornyn and I are going to focus on how the law \nthreatens Medicare and specifically our seniors trying to get a doctor, \nour seniors trying to get health care, and how this new Washington \nboard, called the Independent Payment Advisory Board, has had that \nimpact. It is an unaccountable board. It is a group of unelected \nbureaucrats who will decide how to fund the care that is covered by \nMedicare.\n  So I come to the floor with my colleague Senator Cornyn. He has been \ntraveling around the State of Texas as I have been traveling around the \nState of Wyoming talking with seniors, visiting with them, asking about \ntheir needs. They have great concerns about what is happening with this \nhealth care law, to the point that this week the House of \nRepresentatives is actually working in a bipartisan way to repeal this \nBoard, these unelected, Washington-appointed bureaucrats. To me,\n\n[[Page S1445]]\n\nit is the commission that is going to ration seniors' care and make it \nharder for our seniors to see a health care provider and get the care \nthey need.\n  I know Senator Cornyn is leading the effort in the Senate to work \nwith the House in an effort to repeal this payment board. I know \nSenator Cornyn is doing this in an effort to protect our seniors, to \nmake sure our seniors get the care they need. So I would ask that the \nSenator possibly share with me and others the concerns he has and the \nconcerns he has heard and ways he is hoping to address them.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am happy to respond to my colleague from \nWyoming Senator Barrasso, who has been not only a Senator but a medical \ndoctor and who has been on the receiving end of government policy, that \nwhile it may be well intended, backfires, particularly this bipartisan \nsupport now we have seen in the House of Representatives Energy and \nCommerce Committee yesterday, where they voted to repeal this \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board--Independent Payment Advisory Board, \nIPAB--not iPOD, IPAB.\n  The reason this is so important, and I would like to ask my \ncolleague, from his long experience as a medical practitioner, the \npurpose of this 15-member, unelected, unaccountable bureaucracy to \nactually set prices for health care, what happens if, to the exclusion \nof all other health care reform, the IPAB or the Federal Government \ngenerally cuts reimbursement to providers? It would seem to me we get a \nphenomenon that we get the illusion of coverage, but we have no real \naccess to health care.\n  The experience we have had in Texas is, for example, Medicaid and the \nPresident's health care bill puts a whole lot of people into Medicaid, \nbut only about one-third of Medicaid patients can find a doctor who \nwill see a new Medicaid patient in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, one of \nthe most populous parts of our State. I know, particularly in many \nrural areas--and I know Wyoming has a big rural population as well--\nmany times it is hard for seniors to find a doctor who will see a new \nMedicare patient, again, because reimbursement rates are so low.\n  So I would like to ask the Senator from Wyoming what his experience \nhas been in that area.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. My experience is exactly what the Senator describes. He \nsaid the words ``the illusion of coverage.'' When the President talked \nabout the health care law, so often he wasn't actually talking about \ncare; he was using the word ``coverage,'' and he was trying to use \nthose words interchangeably. But coverage is not care, because someone \nhaving a card doesn't mean they can actually see a doctor. We see that \nwith Medicaid now, with its low levels of reimbursement. With seniors \nalready having trouble getting in to see a physician, this has a \nsignificant impact when a board, an independent payment advisory \nboard--15 unelected bureaucrats--decides they are going to decide how \nmuch to pay for a doctor's visit, how much they are going to pay a \nhospital for a bypass surgery or a hip replacement, which is an area of \nmy specialty. That hospital has to decide if they are going to provide \nthat service. That doctor gets to decide whether they are going to see \nthat patient.\n\n  In rural communities, if the reimbursement is so low--and I have \nheard this from hospital administrators in Wyoming. If the \nreimbursement level is so low for a procedure that is primarily, if not \nexclusively, done on people of Medicare age--and we can think of those \nthings that are more likely to happen with someone over the age of 65--\nthe hospital may ultimately decide they cannot continue to afford to \nprovide those services and keep the doors open to a hospital. So \nseniors in that community will then be denied access to the care in \ntheir own community because the hospital will no longer do or provide \nthat service, whether it is bypass heart surgery, whether it is total \njoint replacement. That senior then has to travel greater distances to \ntry to find someplace to do that. The hospital may look at \nreimbursement for a procedure or different kinds of technology and say: \nThe reimbursement is so low we are not going to upgrade our x-ray \nequipment or our MRI machine. Again, that community would suffer.\n  Even during the debate of the health care law, we heard in many rural \ncommunities that 1 in 10 hospitals was likely to actually be so \nfinancially stressed by the health care law that they may end up having \nto close their doors over the next 10 years. I am hearing that in \nWyoming. But it is because of this Board that the President wants to be \nthe one to essentially, it looks to me, do the rationing of care.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Wyoming, it seems \nto me that what the intent is behind this Independent Payment Advisory \nBoard and the President's health care law, sometimes called the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act--I think it needs to be named \n``Unaffordable Care Act'' for reasons we can go into later.\n  But the purpose behind it we can all understand; that is, to try to \ncontain health care costs and spending by the Federal Government \nbecause, of course, health care inflation is going up much faster than \nregular inflation of the Consumer Price Index.\n  It strikes me that, as in a lot of the policy debates we have in \nWashington and Congress, we all agree we need to do something to \ncontain costs, but we disagree about the means to achieve that \naffordability that we all know we need and to contain the inflation of \nhealth care costs. I would like to ask my colleague, rather than have \nCongress outsource its responsibility in this area to an unelected, \nunaccountable group of 15 bureaucrats, from which there is no appeal \nand which would have the consequence, as he said, of limiting people's \naccess--because if all they are going to do is cut provider payments to \nhospitals and doctors, then fewer and fewer doctors and hospitals are \ngoing to be able to see those patients. Does he see an alternative that \nwould perhaps help contain costs more by using transparency, patient \nchoice, and good old-fashioned American competition? I am thinking, in \nparticular, about the rare success we have had in the health care area \ncontaining costs in the Medicare Part D Program, to me, perhaps a model \neven where seniors have a choice between competing health care plans \nand where they get their prescription drugs. But because of the choices \nthey have and the natural competition that occurs, we get market forces \ndisciplining costs. Indeed, it is a very popular program, but the \nprojected costs for Medicare Part D have come in at about 40 percent \nless than what was originally projected. It strikes me that is one of \nthe missing elements with outsourcing of this responsibility to this \nunelected, unaccountable group of bureaucrats, where the only thing \nthey try to do is cut provider payments.\n  Does the Senator see any alternative along the lines of Medicare Part \nD or otherwise?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I think the two key words I heard the Senator from \nTexas say are ``choice'' and ``competition'' because those things put \nthe patient at the center. It is patient-centered care, not government-\ncentered care, not insurance company-centered care but patient-centered \ncare. It is something we have been talking about for years on the \nSenate floor, at least on this side of the aisle, to put the patient at \nthe center to give them the choice, as well as have the availability of \nthe competition.\n  The concern I have--and I was at a statewide meeting in Wyoming with \na number of our veterans and their families and I asked the simple \nquestion: How many believe, under the health care law as passed, that \nthey are actually going to ultimately end up paying more for their \nhealth care? Every hand went up, every hand. Over 100 people there in \nCasper and over 100 hands went up. They all believe they are going to \nend up paying more under the President's health care plan than they \nwould have had it not been passed. That is what we are seeing from a \nlot of the research as well, the admittance that the costs are going up \neven faster under the health care law than if it hadn't been passed.\n  Then we ask the critical question the Senator from Texas has referred \nto about the availability of care, the quality of care. If we asked the \nquestion: How many believe the availability of their care and the \nquality of their care under the President's new health care law will go \ndown, again, every hand in the room went up.\n  These are all people who believe this health care law, crammed \nthrough Congress, crammed down the throats of the\n\n[[Page S1446]]\n\nAmerican public at a time when they were shouting: No, we don't want \nthis--the American people believe it made it worse and that they are \ngoing to end up paying more and getting less for something they didn't \nask for at all.\n\n  The American public did have concerns from the beginning, which is \nwhat generated the whole discussion about health care and reform. What \npatients are looking for is the care they need, from the doctor they \nwant, at a cost they can afford. Under the President's health care law, \nthey are losing all three.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his \nresponse. I think that shows there is an alternative to this \noutsourcing of our responsibilities to try to make care more affordable \nto this group of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats and cutting \nprovider payments, which actually limits access to health care.\n  But I tell my colleague from Wyoming, I had an experience a couple \nyears ago visiting with some folks at Whole Foods, the grocery chain \nthat is headquartered in Austin, TX, where I live. John Mackey, the \nCEO, is very proud of this. They vote each year on their health care \nplan. What they have chosen--the employees choose year after year--is a \nhigh-deductible insurance coverage for catastrophic losses, but then to \ncover the rest of their care it is a health savings plan that actually \nWhole Foods makes contributions into, which is owned by the worker and \ncould then be used to pay for their health care for their regular sort \nof routine needs.\n  I remember sitting at the table with a number of the workers and \ntalking about why they like this alternative so much, and it is clear: \nBecause it gave them the choices we all would want for ourselves and \nour families in terms of the doctor we want and the kinds of treatment \nwe want, and it provided incentives because people were spending not \nthe government's money, some sort of a credit card they would never see \nthe bill for, but they were spending their own money in their health \nsavings account; thus, realigning incentives for not only providers but \nalso for consumers in a way that creates more transparency, more \nchoices, and the kind of market discipline to hold down the costs.\n  I ask my colleague, my impression is, while there was great division \nin Congress over the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act, what some people call ObamaCare--60 Democrats voted for it, \n40 Republicans voted against it in the Senate--that on this issue, on \nthe IPAB, Independent Payment Advisory Board, there actually is \nbipartisan support, particularly in the House Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, to take out that particular provision because people now, on \nfurther examination, have seen how it could actually backfire in \nlimiting people's access to health care.\n  I would ask my colleague, does he see a way for us, on a bipartisan \nbasis, to narrowly address that provision while we continue to wait on \nthe Supreme Court of the United States to rule on the constitutionality \nof the individual mandate? We don't know how things, such as the State-\nbased insurance exchanges, will operate and the subsidies and whether \nthose are going to be affordable. But on the narrow issue of repealing \nthe Independent Payment Advisory Board, does he see the possibility for \nbipartisan support for that?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I believe there is going to be bipartisan support. We \nsee bipartisan support in the House. I would like to see bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate. When you look at what fundamentally this board \ndoes, they make recommendations, and it is practically impossible for \nthe recommendations not to automatically become law. We were elected to \nmake laws, not having independent parties make the laws. American \npatients are going to be forced to accept whatever this unelected \nboard's recommendations are. It is very hard for Congress to override. \nI expect, in a bipartisan way, people would say: Let's completely \neliminate this board, which I know the Senator's legislation is \ndesigned to do.\n  If American patients, people all across the country, suffer from the \nrecommendations of the board, the way the law is written, they cannot \nchallenge this unelected board in court. Americans have a right to \nchallenge things but not this unelected board, as was written into the \nhealth care law.\n  Those are the sorts of issues I hear about when people say: What if I \ncan't get a doctor? What if I can't get the care I need because of the \ndecisions made by the board?\n  This fundamentally gets to the issue of the whole health care law, \nwhich took $500 billion from our seniors on Medicare not to save and \nstrengthen Medicare but to start a whole new government program for \nsomeone else. This board, which I think we should eliminate and which I \nthink is going to be hurtful for our seniors, is the group responsible \nfor making the sorts of very challenging cuts from our seniors on \nMedicare--again, not to help save Medicare but to start a program for \nsomeone else, which is why this program is even more unpopular today \nthan it was the day it was passed.\n  I do believe we have a bipartisan reason to eliminate this, and that \nis why I am supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would like to ask my colleague one final question. \nWhenever we talk about reforming, saving, and securing Medicare so we \ncan keep the promise we made to seniors that when people reach the \nappropriate age, they can actually qualify for this benefit and it \nactually will be there for them--and people do, in fact, pay into this \nfund, and they expect to get their money's worth back--sometimes the \ncharge is made that various reform proposals will destroy Medicare as \nwe know it.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Wyoming, a medical doctor by \nprofession, whether Medicare as we know it, as currently constructed \nunder the President's health care bill, with this IPAB provision in \nplace--does it have any chance of survival as it currently operates now \nwith this new board of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats setting \nprices and limiting access? Because doctors and hospitals simply cannot \nafford to provide the service at that cost. Doesn't that have the \npotential to radically transform Medicare as people have come to know \nit?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. My view is that people will still get a Medicare card \nin the mail, but whether there will be doctors or hospitals or nurse-\npractitioners or others who will accept that card is the bigger \nconcern. Because of what this board may do and is likely to do under \nthe demands of the health care law, those on Medicare today and those \ncoming onto Medicare may have a harder and harder time finding a doctor \nand a hospital to care for them.\n  Let's face it, today about 10,000 baby boomers will turn 65. \nYesterday about 10,000 baby boomers turned 65. Tomorrow about 10,000 \nbaby boomers will turn 65. We need to make sure Medicare is there and \nsecure for the current generation as well as the next generation and \ngenerations to come.\n  My concern is that this board, which I know my colleague is trying to \nrepeal and which I am trying to repeal, is going to make it that much \nharder for our seniors to receive the care they need from a doctor they \nwant at a cost they can afford.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as we approach the 2-year anniversary of \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act--otherwise known as \nObamaCare--there are a lot of things you are going to hear from across \nthe street at the Supreme Court of the United States on the \nconstitutional challenge to this individual mandate, which is a very \nimportant constitutional question for the Supreme Court to decide--\nwhether there is any limit to the power of the Federal Government when \nit comes to forcing you to buy a product approved by the government and \npenalizing you if you do not do it, whether that is within the \nconstitutional power of the Congress under the commerce clause. Then \nthere are other important questions about the workability of the law, \nthe affordability of the law.\n  I think today we can just see if we could work together in a \nbipartisan way to repeal the IPAB requirement. Senator Reid is the only \none, as the majority leader, who can bring it to the floor, but \nhopefully, in light of the bipartisan support this has on the House \nside, he will see fit to do that. I certainly encourage him. I know \nSenator Barrasso will encourage him to do that. I hope we can do this \nand help ensure that people, when they qualify for Medicare, do not \njust get a card but actually have a good chance--I should say better \nthan a good chance--they will be able to find a doctor who will treat \nthem for the price the government is willing to pay.\n\n[[Page S1447]]\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I thank the Senator for the efforts on his part to \nrepeal this terrible idea that was a fundamental part of the \nPresident's proposal. It is one reason I think the health care law is \neven more unpopular today than the day it was passed and signed into \nlaw almost 2 years ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin).

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \npay tribute to America's sons and daughters who have fallen in the line \nof duty--citizens of this great Nation who gave their lives to preserve \nthe liberties upon which America was founded, the finest among us who, \nbecause they cherished peace, risked their lives by becoming warriors \non our behalf.\n  What could be more sacrificial than the lives our service men and \nwomen choose to lead? They love America, so they spend long years \nseparated from their loved ones, deployed in faraway lands. They revere \nfreedom, so they sacrifice their own so that we may be free. They \ndefend our right to live as individuals by yielding their own \nindividuality in that noble cause. They value life, yet bravely ready \nthemselves to lay down their own in humble service to their comrades-\nin-arms, their families, and their Nation.\n  For more than 234 years, our service men and women have served as \nguardians of our freedom. The cost of that vigilance has been high. \nSince the Revolutionary War, more than 42 million men and women have \nserved in our military and more than 1 million of those selfless heroes \nhave given their lives. Wisconsin has borne its share of that great \nsacrifice. Since statehood, 27,000 of Wisconsin's sons and daughters \nhave died in military service. Since September 11, 2001, we have lost \n143 brave souls with ties to Wisconsin. Since I took office last \nJanuary, 13 more have perished. Statistics cannot possibly convey the \nweight of these losses. After all, statistics are merely numbers that \ncould never fully communicate the qualities of these fine men and women \nwhose promising lives were cut far too short. Statistics say nothing of \ntheir unfulfilled hopes and dreams. So instead of numbers such as 1 \nmillion, 27,000, 143, or even 13, I would like to ask everyone to think \nfor a moment about a much smaller but still staggering number, the \nnumber 1.\n\n  Each of these men and women was a loved one cherished by family and \nfriends. Each was a loss to their community and to this great Nation. \nEach paid a price that we must never forget. We must also remember the \nsacrifice made was not theirs alone. Every family member and friend \nleft behind experiences profound loss, sadness, and grief. The tragedy \nmultiplies; it is not contained. For those left behind, the pain may \nslowly subside, but the wound will never heal.\n  Two weeks ago I had the privilege of bearing witness to the sacrifice \nof one of Wisconsin's fallen heroes and the courage of those he left \nbehind. On February 22, a grateful Nation laid 1LT David Johnson of \nMayville, WI, to his final rest at Arlington National Cemetery. I was \nhonored to join David's loving and proud parents Laura and Andrew, his \nsister Emily, and his brothers Matthew and Michael as they said their \nfinal goodbyes. Out of sheer coincidence Michael was already scheduled \nto intern in my office this week and is with us today. It is fitting \nthat we acknowledge his loss and sacrifice.\n  The Johnson family loved their brother and son. They loved him dearly \nand our hearts go out to them. I pray that they find God's peace and \ncomfort today and in the tough times ahead as they deal with this \noverwhelming and tragic loss.\n  Lieutenant Johnson was only 24 years old when he died of injuries \nsuffered after encountering an improvised explosion device on January \n25 while leading his men in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan.\n  In addition to Lieutenant Johnson, today I would also like to pay \ntribute to the other Wisconsin heroes who gallantly gave their lives \nsince I took office last January.\n  Since then Wisconsin has lost SSgt Jordan Bear, U.S. Army.

The clerk will call the roll of the Senate.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Honoring Doug and Samantha Levinson\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, this Friday will mark 5 years \nsince FBI agent Bob Levinson disappeared while on a business trip as a \nretired FBI agent. He was on a business trip to Kish Island in the \nPersian Gulf. It is a part of Iran. That is 5 long years that his wife \nChristine has been without a husband and 5 long years that her seven \nchildren have been without their father.\n  Over those 5 years I have spoken so many times about Bob--a retired \nFBI agent and a resident of south Florida--from the floor of the Senate \nand so many other venues. Just yesterday I met with his wife Christine \nafter she joined FBI Director Robert Mueller and Deputy Director Sean \nJoyce in announcing a $1 million reward for information leading to \nBob's safe return. So in southwest Asia billboards will soon start to \nappear announcing that $1 million reward, and it is in southwest Asia \nthat we know Bob is being held.\n  Today I wish to talk about his children because tomorrow in Miami the \nSociety of Former Special Agents of the FBI will honor Bob's two \nyoungest children--his son Doug and his daughter Samantha, both of \nwhom, along with their other siblings, have persevered through this \nvery difficult time.\n  Doug was in the seventh grade when Bob disappeared. This year he will \ngraduate from high school, on his way to college. He has excelled \nacademically and athletically and has grown to almost his father's \nheight. Bob will be shocked at how tall Doug is, but he will be even \nmore proud of all that his son has accomplished.\n  Samantha, Bob's daughter, was in high school when Bob disappeared. In\n\n[[Page S1448]]\n\njust a few weeks she will graduate from college. Samantha has been a \nresident adviser and a proud member of her sorority. She interned at \nDisney where she hopes to work after graduation. Again, when her father \nreturns, he will be so proud.\n  To honor Bob's children, and standing in solidarity with one of their \nown, the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI will award to Doug \nand Samantha scholarships to assist with the cost of college. I thank \nthat society and those agents who have protected us so much over the \nyears. I thank them for their service and for their kindness. I \ncongratulate Doug and Samantha for all they have accomplished under \nsuch very difficult circumstances.\n  To Christine Levinson, this heroic woman who has stood so strong in \nthe midst of great adversity for 5 years--I say to Christine and her \nchildren that this government will not rest, none of us will rest until \nwe have brought Bob home. I look forward, as do so many, to that day of \ncelebrating with them and celebrating with all of Bob's friends and his \nformer colleagues.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll of the Senate.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, first, I want to say how important roads and \nbridges are. We are on the highway bill, and that is one of the main \nadvantages the United States has had--having excellent transportation. \nOf course, that is particularly important in my own State because we \nwant people to be able to get to the first national park, which is \nYellowstone National Park, and another gorgeous park, the Grand Teton \nNational Park, and a place called Fossil Butte National Monument, where \npeople can actually fish for 60 million-year-old fish. We have a spot \nin the middle of the State where people can help dig up dinosaur \nbones--and if you dig one out by yourself, you get it named after you--\nor the first national monument, Devils Tower, which is up in the \nnortheast corner. And, of course, we are a corridor between those \nWestern States too. So we know how important roads and bridges are. We \nneed to do that, and we need to do it now, but we should do it the \nright way.\n  So I want to refer to an amendment I have filed, No. 1645. My \namendment is very simple and straightforward. It would allow the gas \ntax to be adjusted with inflation--not with the price of gas, with \ninflation. This is not a new idea, and it certainly is not a very \npopular discussion point, but this is the debate the Senate needs to \nhave.\n  The long-term viability of the highway trust fund is incredibly \nimportant to our States. The underlying proposal the Senate is debating \nwould pay for transportation and infrastructure projects and programs \nfor the next 2 years, but it does not address the future of these \nprograms, nor do the financing proposals fit within the timeframe of \nthe bill. I have serious objections to paying for 2 years of spending \nwith 10 years of revenue.\n  Let me stop on that issue for a moment. We are spending money in 2 \nyears that it will take us 10 years to generate. How can we tell the \nAmerican people we are serious about the deficit and serious about \nspending when we allow money to be spent five times as fast as it comes \nin?\n  If the Senate wants to keep the highway programs viable through a \ntrust fund instead of subjected to the general fund, which any \naccountant or banker would say is bankrupt, we need to either cut \nspending or generate more revenue. Those are the two choices.\n  A lot of work has gone into the bill before the Senate. Four \ncommittees have worked on it. Four committees have filed amendments \nthat have been included in the version we are seeing. I appreciate that \nmany of my colleagues are trying to reduce the mandates on the States \nas well as consolidate and eliminate programs. That is good. Those are \nsteps we need to take. Even with some serious streamlining, however, \nthe highway trust fund will not have the revenues needed to meet the \ncurrent obligations of the fund. We can certainly give States more \nflexibility in how they prioritize the Federal funds they receive.\n  We should not and cannot ignore that with this bill we are just \nbuying time. Buying time is something the Federal Government has been \ndoing for decades, and that has gotten us into this serious financial \nmess. We are buying time with borrowed money. The borrowing is pretty \ndubious, and some of it is from countries we would rather not be \nborrowing from.\n  I want to share some charts with you. You may only be able to discern \nwhat I say, and what I say is what appears in the Senate Record, not \nthe charts.\n  These have a lot of numbers on them. I am an accountant, so I get \nexcited over numbers. Too many numbers, but it still makes the point. \nWhat we have is the highway trust fund balances, starting in 1993, \nwhich was the last time we passed the gas tax. That was 18.3 cents. \nThis column shows the total revenue received. For the most part they \nhave been going up, which means more gas has been bought.\n  But here are the expenditures, and you will see what effect that has \nhad on the closing balance in the trust fund. We have had quite a few \nyears when there was some money in there--right after 1993 when the gas \ntax more closely matched the cost of construction, and as we get out \nhere in 2001, we can see that it drops significantly and keeps \ndropping. At balance, at the end of 2012, it is going to be $11.4 \nbillion. Of course, we are spending more than that just in this one \nbill.\n  So next year it will be a minus $2.8 billion and $18.7 billion, and \nthen $34.7 billion. Those are deficits I am talking about, deficits in \nthe trust fund, which means in those years we are going to have to get \nthe money from somewhere else. It winds up in 2016 at being a $50.7 \nbillion deficit to the trust fund. That is what we are doing generally \nwith all of our accounting, but it shows up here in something that I do \nnot think anybody in America denies is absolutely necessary. We have to \nhave roads and bridges.\n  So if my amendment were enacted, what kind of an adjustment to the \ntax rate would we see? If this amendment had been enacted last year, in \n2011, this January--the tax does not go into effect until the year \nafter the inflation is measured. This January the tax would have \nincreased by one-half of one penny--one-half of one penny. The price of \na gallon fluctuates more than that on a daily basis. In fact, I was \nwatching on television the other night, and the lady was showing the \nhigh price of gas, and she showed a sign out in front of the pumps. \nJust as she was about to leave, she said: Wait a minute. While I have \nbeen talking, the price has gone up 20 cents.\n  So we are seeing some huge changes there, but not with the gas tax. \nIf we had enacted the indexing in 1993, the last time Congress adjusted \nthe gas tax, there would have been an increase of 11 cents in the \ngasoline tax over 19 years. Excluding the one-tenth of 1 cent that is \nadded to the base tax rate for the leaking underground storage tanks, \nthe rate would adjust from 18.3 cents a gallon in 1993 to 29\\1/2\\ cents \nper gallon today.\n  That is what this chart shows. It shows the amount of inflation there \nwas each of those years, so the amounts the gas tax would have gone up \nin each of those years to provide a fund that would actually help us \nwith building the roads and bridges, and it would be at 29.5 cents per \ngallon today.\n  In that same timeframe gasoline prices have risen from $1 per gallon \nto $3.50 per gallon or more. It was $4 in the example I was giving off \nthe television. If we had enacted indexing in 2005 under the last \nhighway bill, there would have been only a 3\\1/2\\-cents-per-gallon \nadjustment. I estimate there would have been increased revenue in the \nhighway trust fund by over $18 billion from the gas tax alone.\n  So this is the chart that shows what would have happened if we had \nindexed it in 2005, what the CPI index would have been and what the \nadjustment would have been. So that would have been a change of 3.5 \ncents per gallon, hardly noticeable in the price of gas we have today. \nBut the trust fund would have had $18 billion, which we need to be able \nto spend. Very important.\n  In 1993 the gas tax of 18.3 cents was included in the $1 of gas, and \nthere was\n\n[[Page S1449]]\n\nalso State taxes included in the $1 gasoline price, 18 cents out of a \ndollar. Now the 18 cents is part of $4 a gallon.\n  Don't you think construction costs have increased based on the cost \nof a gallon of gas alone? Remember, the gas tax is what paid for roads \nand bridges but cannot anymore, causing us to use very bad financing \nmethods--stealing from pension funds with no way to pay it back, using \n10 years' of projected revenue to pay for 2 years' of construction.\n  What do we do for the money in 2 years? Roads and bridges will always \nneed construction. Our economy runs on construction. The construction \nindustry has mixed feelings about my proposed amendment. They are for \nit as long as it does not bring the bill down. My intent is not to \nbring the bill down but, rather, to make it a viable bill. Of course, \nmy amendment will not make it a viable bill all by itself. The Bowles-\nSimpson Commission deficit report said we needed to increase the gas \ntax by 5 cents a year for 3 years to have a viable fund.\n  Here are the quotes from that deficit commission. The President \nappointed the deficit commission. They looked at everything, and on \nhighways and bridges alone, this is what they came up with: 15-cent-\nper-gallon increase in the gas tax over a 3-year period; limit spending \nto match the revenues the trust fund collects. That is what we are \nfailing to do with this current bill.\n  Once fully implemented, a 15-cent increase would generate an \nadditional $24 to $27 billion per year for the highway trust fund. Each \n1-cent increase would generate about $1.6 to $1.8 billion per year. \nThat is from that deficit commission that was trying to figure out how \nto get ourselves out of the hole we are in right now. This is what they \ncame up with just for the highway fund.\n  So with my amendment, it indexes with inflation. It does not start \nuntil next year. It is just a way to test the waters to see if there is \nenough courage in this body to take a very minimal step. My amendment \ndoes not solve the shortfall of the highway trust fund, nor would it \nfully pay for this legislation. It is just a small step in the right \ndirection. It is a step in getting the highway trust fund back to what \nit was created to be, a dedicated pot of money to pay for the roads, \nfunded by those who use the roads.\n  We need to take this step and a lot of other steps if we are going to \nfix our money problems and fund programs as intended. The National \nCommission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform--that is that Simpson-\nBowles Commission--supported a 15-cent increase in the gas tax to be \ngradually adjusted over a 3-year period. Once fully implemented, a 15-\ncent increase, as I said, would provide $24 to $27 billion per year. \nThat is what we need for roads and bridges.\n  The Commission also recommended that Congress enact a limitation so \nthat the spending could not go beyond revenues. That seems like a \nfairly commonsense approach. Spend only what we generate. We could use \nthat around here. Of course, that principle is something we need to \nenact in the overall budgeting in Washington.\n\n  Let's be clear. The tax rate and gas prices are two very separate \nissues. Folks might think that as the price of fuel goes up, so does \nthe Federal gas tax. That is not true. Whether the price of gas is $1 \nper gallon or $4 per gallon, the Federal tax remains the same. Again, \nthe fund collected 18.3 cents from every dollar of gas in 1993. \nConstruction costs have increased, and now we only collect the same \n18.3 cents for a $4 gallon of gas. If we were being successful with \nsome alternate means of transportation, the amount of gas would go down \nas people used those other ones, but it is not.\n  I am sensitive to the fact that the gas prices are high right now. I \nam always looking for ideas on how we can work to bring those prices \ndown. With the distances we have to travel in Wyoming alone, high fuel \nprices have a disproportionate effect on the residents of my State.\n  The President said there is not a silver bullet to bring the prices \ndown. That is certainly true if we look at his administration's \npolicies, having done everything possible to increase the price of \nfuel. While there might not be a silver bullet, there are a number of \nactions that will make a real difference.\n  One reason gas prices are high is that the supply is limited, and \ntensions in the Middle East have further strained that supply and \nencouraged speculators.\n  To fix the supply problem, we should be producing American energy \nwherever it is possible. Instead of blocking production the President \nshould be encouraging us to develop American energy in Alaska and off \nthe Outer Continental Shelf and on Federal land. Yes, production is up, \nbut it is not from Federal lands. That is shut down. It is coming from \nprivate land where a permit does not take a lifetime of investment and \ndelay. Federal lands are down 12 percent in production. We should be \nenacting policies that encourage energy production on public lands in \nWyoming and other Western States rather than relying on oil from the \nMiddle East and Venezuela.\n  President Obama should approve the Keystone XL Pipeline so we can get \nas much supply as possible from friendly nations such as Canada before \nthey feel forced to sell it all to China, who is buying up energy \nworldwide. China understands that in 20 years the country with the \nenergy will have the power. I am not talking about electrical power; I \nam talking about world power.\n  Gas prices are high because of the regulatory uncertainty created by \nthe administration's relentless pursuit of policies that are designed \nto make energy more expensive under the guise of halting climate \nchange. Rather than arguing over new taxes for the oil and gas \nindustry, we should be working to rein in the Environmental Protection \nAgency to stop those regulations that make it impossible for businesses \nto plan.\n  We have a permitting problem. When I hear the lecture about the \nnumber of acres leased for exploration but not being drilled, I get \nangry. I am usually not angry. Leased parcels include land that has no \noil. When you buy a lease, you buy a package, and then you drill where \nthe oil or gas is within that package. Also, there are millions of \nacres ready to be drilled, but the leaseholder cannot get the \nbureaucrats to turn loose the permits.\n  Of course, Energy Secretary Chu recently confirmed that his energy \npolicy is to create conservation by having our gas prices reach the \nsame level as Europe. Well, unless we do something with the gas tax at \nhis desired $7 a gallon, we will still only get 18.3 cents a gallon for \nthe critical highway fund.\n  If we were really trying to match cost to construct with revenue, the \nradical suggestion would be for the gas user fee--and it is a user fee. \nIf you do not drive on the roads, you do not need to buy the gas. You \ndo not need to pay the tax. So it is a user fee. But it would be a \npercentage of the cost of a gallon of gas if we were really being \nradical.\n  But be clear, we are not doing that. We are probably not doing any of \nthis. We need to do everything we can to lower gas prices. I am working \nto do just that. In fact, we are debating some of these issues on this \nlegislation because the majority refuses to debate them using regular \norder. However, the issue of gas prices is entirely separate from the \nissue of determining how we should pay for highways.\n  We have set up a trust fund that is supposed to take care of road and \nbridge needs. I might mention that changing the formula to miles driven \nwould just be to increase the gas user fee while hiding the increase. \nThat is not the way to do it. We should be honest about whatever kind \nof an increase we are putting on this user fee. That is the wrong way \nto do it. If we do not add more revenue to the trust fund, we should \ncut our spending to the amount of money we have in the trust fund. That \nis, again, what the Simpson-Bowles report said.\n  I know there a lot of sensitivities in talking about the rate of gas \ntax or any other tax. There is no doubt that individuals and businesses \nare still stressed in this economy and are struggling to make ends \nmeet. People in rural States such as Wyoming have few options. They \nhave to drive long distances for many of their needs. Several of my \ncolleagues have said to me: This just is not the time to be talking \nabout the gas tax.\n  I must ask: When will the time be right? Members of Congress do not \nwant to tackle this topic when the economy is strong nor do they want \nto tackle the topic when we have economic challenges. When revenues to\n\n[[Page S1450]]\n\nthe highway trust fund were meeting the needs of the highway program, \nno one wanted to consider that there might be a time when the revenue \ncould not keep up with the needs to maintain our highway system.\n  We are pennies away from insolvency of the highway trust fund. When \nis the right time to talk about the revenue stream for the highway \ntrust fund? We need to start today. My amendment is a small step to \naddress the long-term viability of the highway trust fund. It is a \nsmall step to get us moving toward living within our means and \nmaintaining our roads with the money we have not the money we wish we \nhad.\n  I probably cannot get a vote on this minimal increase, but it does \ntest the water. I would be happy to revise my amendment to any \nreasonable level that Senators would support. We cannot continue to \nkick this conversation down the road for another 2 years. We cannot lie \nto our constituents about the state of the highway trust fund. We \nshould not steal from other trust funds, and we should not do \nunapproved long-term financing for short-term projects. We have a \nmechanism to pay for the road programs, a dedicated funding stream paid \nfor by those who use the roads.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will take a hard look at my amendment, take a \nlook at the plan under Simpson-Bowles, and study the numerous ideas out \nthere. Let's have a real debate on how to preserve this dedicated \nfunding for our roads.\n  In Wyoming, we have an optional sales tax for projects by communities \nand counties. The construction project is stated, and the people get to \nvote for this increase in their taxes. As long as the money is used to \npay for the promised projects, the voters continue to approve \nadditional projects with additional taxes. It has happened for 30 years \nin Wyoming. People will allow focused taxes for what they know they \nneed if they believe that is what it will be spent for. And I say they \nknow the needs for roads and bridges.\n  When is it the wrong time to do the right thing? I believe most \neveryone in this Chamber knows this is the right thing. Most of our \nconstituents will see it that way too. A vocal few won't, but the \nreason congressional approval is at a record low is because so many \nlive in fear of taking the votes that will fix the problems. We have a \nchance to change that with this amendment. I hope my colleagues will \ntake a serious look at it and fund the highway fund the way it was \nintended.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Benefits of Free Enterprise\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, last week I came to the floor to talk about \nhow free enterprise helps people achieve earned success and thus helps \nthem pursue true happiness. Today I want to talk about another moral \nbenefit of free enterprise--its effectiveness in reducing poverty and \npromoting economic mobility.\n  This is an important conversation to have since President Obama has \nmade income and class inequality the centerpieces of his reelection \ncampaign. For example, in his Osawatomie, KS, speech last year, he \nsaid:\n\n       This is a make-or-break moment for the middle class and all \n     those who are fighting to get into the middle class. I \n     believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair \n     shot, when everyone does their fair share, and when everyone \n     plays by the same rules.\n\n  He followed up with similar themes in the 2012 State of the Union \nspeech, saying that he believes in ``an America where hard work paid \noff, responsibility was rewarded, and anyone could make it if they \ntried--no matter who you were, where you came from, or how you started \nout.''\n  Of course, these are quintessential American values in no dispute. \nBut the President's soaring rhetoric is at odds with his main policy, \nwhich is to achieve greater economic equality not by equal opportunity \nbut through forced redistribution of wealth. For example, the President \nhas proposed a litany of tax increases, such as the so-called Buffet \nrule, higher marginal income tax rates, and higher taxes on investment. \nNew taxes don't lift anybody, but they do tear some people down.\n  The President also proposes more government spending to redistribute \nthe new tax dollars collected. Redistributionist programs have a role, \nof course, as government safety nets. They help, for example, people \nwho are ill temporarily, down on their luck, or not able-bodied. But, \nunfortunately, they do not cure poverty. If they did, poverty would no \nlonger exist in America.\n  The only permanent cure for poverty and the only system capable of \nproducing massive increases in economic mobility is free enterprise. \nSenator Mark Rubio put it well when he said that ``the free enterprise \nsystem has lifted more people out of poverty than all the government \nanti-poverty programs combined.'' As we will see in a moment, economic \ndata confirms this is true.\n  As Arthur Brooks and Peter Wehner wrote in their book called ``Wealth \nand Justice: The Morality of Democratic Capitalism,'' before the rise \nof free enterprise; that is, for most of human history, life was \n``bleak, cruel and short.'' Life expectancy was low, infant mortality \nwas high, disease was rampant, and food was scarce. Education was only \nfor the wealthy. Indeed, the wealthy were the only people who lived in \nrelative comfort.\n  But the emergence of free enterprise roughly two centuries ago helped \nto change all that. As the free enterprise system took root, \nparticularly in Western Europe, protectionist measures eased, trade \nincreased, and businesses accumulated capital to grow and create new \njobs. People pursued their self-interests free of state coercion or \ncorruption, and the economic benefits flowed to every strata of \nsociety. As Brooks and Wehner note, ``Markets, precisely because they \nare wealth generating, also end up being wealth distributing.''\n  By every universal measure, life has improved dramatically in free \nmarket societies. Literacy, basic living standards, and life expectancy \nhave increased, while disease and starvation have plummeted. Child \nlabor has been eradicated. As free enterprise has spread during the \nlast two centuries, the world's average per capita income has \nskyrocketed by about 10 times. These are major moral achievements. Yes, \nsome people are richer than others, and that is true in all nations \nwhether characterized as market economies or not. But where it exists, \nfree enterprise has helped make the poor make tremendous gains, and \nthey continue to climb. In the modern era of globalization, we have \nseen this on an unprecedented scale. Since 1970, as economic freedom \nhas grown in developing countries such as China and India, the number \nof people living on $1 a day has plunged by 80 percent, according to a \nrecent study.\n  What about President Obama's arguments that free enterprise has \nharmed middle-class prosperity? Over the past quarter century, economic \nstudies have shown otherwise. Indeed, as Hoover Institution fellow \nHenry Nau pointed out in a recent Wall Street Journal article, middle-\nincome earners have become richer and many have leaped into the upper-\nmiddle class. Between 1980 and 2007, a period Nau calls ``the Great \nExpansion,'' the United States grew by more than 3 percent per year and \ncreated more than 50 million new jobs, ``massively expanding a middle \nclass of workers,'' in Nau's words.\n  Nau continues:\n\n       Per capita income increased by 65 percent, and household \n     income went up substantially in all income categories. . . . \n     In the past three decades, households making more than \n     $105,000 in inflation-adjusted dollars doubled to 24 percent \n     from 11 percent.\n\n  These are remarkable increases in wealth. What policies produced this \nexpansion? Again quoting Nau:\n\n       Precisely the free-market policies of deregulation and \n     lower marginal income-tax rates that [President] Obama \n     decries.\n\n  If the President wants to increase class mobility and prosperity and \nbuild on the successes of the ``Great Expansion,'' then he must turn \naway from\n\n[[Page S1451]]\n\nthe statist policies that have dominated his 3 years in office. As \nBrooks and Wehner write:\n\n       The answer is not less capitalism, it is better \n     capitalists.\n\n  And I would add, that includes the President and his advisers.\n  Most fundamentally, our policies must reward hard work and merit for \nthe simple reason that people are more successful and industrious when \nthey get to keep more of the fruits of their labor.\n  That is what we call earned success. Their prosperity flows to others \nwhen they open businesses, create jobs and new products, compete for \nworkers, raise wages, and invest their profits, which can then be lent \nto other entrepreneurs. But when market forces are restricted--when \ntaxes are too high and regulations are too stifling--entrepreneurship \nloses its appeal. If people think outcomes are predetermined by the \ngovernment, they don't have incentives to compete.\n  A 2005 study by economists Alberto Alesina and George-Marios \nAngeletos underscores the point. They found that beliefs about \nmeritocratic rewards are self-fulfilling. They concluded that if a \nsociety thinks people have a right to enjoy the fruits of their effort, \nit will choose low taxes and have lower tolerance for redistribution. \nEffort will be high in these places. Conversely, they found that if \ncitizens believe the system is rigged and that luck and connections, \nnot merit, are the key determinants of success, then they will demand \nforced wealth redistribution and effort will be lower in these places.\n  Simply put, if people think the system is inherently unfair, it will \nwind up that way. That is precisely what has happened in countries such \nas Spain and Greece, where outcomes are divorced from effort, and, to a \nlarge measure, bureaucrats and special interests dictate who gets \neconomic rewards.\n  Since everyone does better when effort is rewarded, then protecting \nmerit-based success is a moral issue. Indeed, the first American \nimmigrants left countries with too little opportunity for advancement \nto come here and earn rewards based on merit and be the masters of \ntheir own destiny. Polls have shown that, over the years, Americans \nhave not grown tired of the merit-based system but instinctively \nsupport it. U2 singer Bono colorfully explained why individual \ndeterminism in America is so great:\n\n       In America, the guy looks up at the mansion on the hill and \n     says, ``One day, if I really work hard, I am going to live in \n     the mansion on the hill.'' In Dublin, they look at the \n     mansion on the hill and say, ``One day I'm going to get that \n     [guy].''\n\n  Free markets breed a culture of aspiration and mobility, in which \npeople reject the politics of envy and instead focus on their own \nadvancement and their own success. If our goal is to foster such a \npositive culture of achievement, then we must eschew class warfare in \nfavor of the free-market policies that have done so much to boost \nprosperity both at home and abroad.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the amendment I have \noffered with my friend, Senator Casey from Pennsylvania, on the highway \nbill, amendment No. 1540.\n  In my State, and I think in the whole country, the question we hear \nover and over again is: Where are the private sector jobs? What can we \ndo to get the economy back on track?\n  There are very few places the Federal Government can create private \nsector jobs. One of the few places we can do that is in public works, \nsuch as the highway bill, where most of the work to build a new bridge \nor a new highway is done by competitive bid and by private sector \nemployers and private sector employees. While we probably take a \ndifferent approach to how we get there, I think all of us understand it \nis critical we work together to find common ground to create jobs and \nto create economic growth.\n  This infrastructure bill could be--and I hope it turns out to be--a \ngood start. There is no doubt that infrastructure is the foundation of \nour economy. Quality transportation is vital to connect people and \ncommunities, to connect people to the places they work, to connect the \nproducts they make to the places they need to go. That doesn't happen \nwithout a good infrastructure program and one that maintains and \nexpands as needs to be the infrastructure that we have. I am very \nhopeful this bill can provide that additional element to getting our \neconomy back on track.\n  At the heart of the problem for small towns and for local governments \nin so many States, and particularly in Missouri, is the bridge system \nthat is not part of the Federal structure. It is the so-called off-\nsystem bridge network, where local communities are responsible for \nbridges.\n  Missouri has perhaps more bridges than any other State. I was in one \nof our counties just recently where the county itself--and we have 115 \ncounties. So unlike some of the Western States, the counties aren't \nhuge. They are designed to be compact, and people could get across them \nin the 1820s and 1830s in 1 day, before automobiles. So we have lots of \ncounties, and 1 of them has 148 bridges. Our smallest county by \npopulation, with only 4,000 people, has 100 bridges. So every 40 people \nin that county are essentially responsible for maintaining a bridge, \nand bridges are expensive. That off-system bridge network carries \nschoolbuses, emergency vehicles, lots of agricultural products, \nfamilies going about their daily routine. Without those bridges, that \nlocal infrastructure doesn't work.\n  What we are suggesting and calling for in this amendment is simply to \ncontinue the current policy. I am not talking about any new money for \nbridges. We are not talking about any new program for bridges. But the \nbill itself doesn't continue the 15 percent of the bridge funds that \nhas been allocated for some time now to local government. This would \ncontinue to have that same 15 percent going to local governments.\n  There are almost 600,000 bridges in the country--more than 590,000, \nand 50 percent of those are considered off-system, and approximately 28 \npercent of that 50 percent are currently considered deficient. Thirty-\ntwo percent of the bridges in Missouri in the off-bridge system are \nconsidered deficient. They either aren't adequate for the traffic they \nnow carry or are in need of repairs. One out of three bridges in our \nState needs an investment.\n  The new penalty section of the underlying bill that would replace the \ncurrent off-system bridge program makes that program even more \nuncertain at times when communities and job creators need it the most. \nWithout our amendment, States would only have to sustain the previous \nnumber of deficient bridges every other year in order to avoid \ninvesting in their off-system bridges. It is a formula that doesn't \nwork. It might work in big communities that have lots of miles that \nthey maintain, but I doubt that. I think this makes an inconsistent \ninvestment in bridges all over the country.\n  Our amendment ensures that counties are not left bearing the full \nresponsibility of these off-system bridges. If they are left bearing \nthat full responsibility, many of these bridges will not be fixed. This \nhas been a major source of funding for counties working on bridges. \nThis amendment would give States and counties the proper tools and \nresources and the assurance of a steady flow of funding in order to \ninvest in the Nation's bridges.\n\n  Additionally, the amendment establishes a procedure where the \nTransportation Secretary can rescind this requirement if State and \nlocal officials determine they have inadequate needs to justify these \nexpenditures. In other words, if they can't justify spending the money \nin their State, then the Federal Government clearly doesn't have to \nallocate that 15 percent to local communities and to States for the \noff-system program.\n  When I listen to community leaders, and certainly when I listen to \ncounty commissioners, this is a topic that comes up in most of our \ncounties with great concern. The counties where it doesn't come up \nwouldn't have to apply for the money. That 15 percent, allocated \nappropriately, will make a big difference.\n  Community leaders and job creators are looking for things that allow \nthem\n\n[[Page S1452]]\n\nto prepare for a more certain future. They need the ability to look \nbeyond 6 months or 1 year to plan and anticipate how they are going to \nrepair bridges, which bridges they are going to look at this year, \nwhich bridges they will then put off until next year. But right now, \nthey would have no way of knowing whether there would be any Federal \nassistance to these communities. We need to be sure we provide this \ncertainty for off-system bridges if we are going to promote job \ncreation and economic development. We have to work together in the \nNation's Capital to make smart investments in our Nation's \ntransportation system if we are going to provide communities and job \ncreators with greater certainty to prepare for the future.\n  I wish to thank Senator Casey for his hard work on this issue. I am \nglad to join him on this amendment. It is critical to the State of \nMissouri and many other States. The National Association of Counties, \nthe National League of Cities, the National Conference of Mayors, the \nNational Association of County Engineers, the American Public Works \nAssociation, the National Association of Regional Councils, and the \nNational Association of Development Officials are all in support of \nthis amendment. I hope we have it included in the amendments we get to \nvote on, and I urge my colleagues to join in this bipartisan effort to \ncreate more certainty for local governments.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         WIND TURBINE SUBSIDIES\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, today in the Wall Street Journal \nthere coincidentally was an editorial on the subject about which I \nspeak, and this was entitled ``Republicans Blow With the Wind. Another \nindustry wants to keep its tax subsidies.'' It is about the possibility \nthat the Senate will be asked--maybe as early as the next few days \nduring the debate on the Transportation bill--to extend yet 1 more year \nthe Federal taxpayers' subsidy for large wind turbines.\n  I would like to take a few minutes to say why I don't believe we \nshould do that, and I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks \nthe Wall Street Journal editorial be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I believe it is time for Congress to \nstop the Big Wind gravy train. Subsidies for developers of huge wind \nturbines will cost taxpayers $14 billion over 5 years, between 2009 and \n2013, according to the Joint Tax Committee and the Treasury Department. \nThis is more than the special tax breaks for Big Oil, which Congress \nshould also end. $6 billion of these Big Wind subsidies will come from \nthe production tax credit for renewable energy, which Congress \ntemporarily enacted in 1992. The prospect for the expiration of this \ntax break at the end of this year has filled the Capitol with lobbyists \nhired by investors wealthy enough to profit from the tax breaks. \nPresident Obama even wants to make these tax credits permanent. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, this is a ``make or break \nmoment'' for wind power companies.\n  There are three reasons the Big Wind subsidies should go the way of \nthe $5 billion annual ethanol subsidy, which Congress allowed to expire \nlast year. First, we cannot afford it. The Federal Government borrows \n40 cents of every dollar it spends. It cannot justify such a subsidy, \nespecially for what the Nobel Prize-winning U.S. Energy Secretary calls \na ``mature technology.''\n  Second, wind turbines produce a relatively puny amount of expensive, \nunreliable electricity. Wind produces 2.3 percent of our electricity, \nless than 8 percent of our pollution-free electricity. One alternative \nis natural gas, which is abundant, cheap, and very clean. Another \nalternative is nuclear. Reactors power our Navy and produce 70 percent \nof our pollution-free electricity. Using windmills to power a country \nthat uses one-fourth of all of the world's electricity world would be \nthe energy equivalent of going to war in sailboats.\n  Finally, these massive turbines too often destroy the environment in \nthe name of saving the environment. When wind advocate T. Boone Pickens \nwas asked whether he would put turbines on his Texas ranch, Mr. Pickens \nanswered: No, they're ugly.\n  A new documentary movie, ``Windfall,'' chronicles upstate New York \nresidents debating whether to build giant turbines in their town. A New \nYork Times review of this film reported this:\n\n       Turbines are huge: Some are 40 stories tall, with 130-foot \n     blades weighing seven tons and spinning at 150 miles per \n     hour. They can fall over or send parts flying; struck by \n     lightning, say, they can catch fire. Their 24/7 rotation \n     emits nerve-racking low frequencies (like a pulsing disco) \n     amplified by rain and moisture, and can generate a \n     disorienting strobe effect in sunlight. Giant flickering \n     shadows can tarnish a sunset's glow on a landscape.\n\n  Let's consider the three arguments one by one. First, the money. For \nall we hear about Big Oil, you may be surprised to learn that special \ntax breaks for Big Wind are greater. During the 5 years from 2009 to \n2013, Federal subsidies for Big Wind equal $14 billion. I am only \ncounting the production tax credit and the cash grants that the 2009 \nstimulus law offered to wind developers in lieu of the tax credit. An \nanalysis of that stimulus cash grant program by Greenwire found that 64 \npercent of the 50 highest dollar grants awarded--or about $2.7 \nbillion--went to projects that had begun construction before the \nstimulus measures started.\n  Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told \nGreenwire:\n\n       It's essentially funding economic activity that already \n     would have occurred. So it's just a pure subsidy.\n\n  According to President Obama's new budget, Big Oil receives multiple \ntax subsidies. Doing away with them would save about $4.7 billion a \nyear in fiscal year 2013 or about $22 billion over 5 years it says. So \nfar it sounds like Big Oil with $22 billion, is bigger in subsidies \nthan Big Wind with $14 billion. But here is the catch: Many of the \nsubsidies that the President is attacking oil companies for receiving \nare regular tax provisions that are the same or similar to those other \nindustries receive. For example, Xerox, Microsoft, and Caterpillar all \nbenefit from tax provisions like the manufacturing tax credit, \namortization or depreciation of used equipment that the President is \ncounting as Big Oil subsidies.\n  Of course, wind energy companies also benefit from many similar tax \nprovisions. But the production tax credit that benefits wind is in \naddition to the regular Tax Code provisions that benefit many \ncompanies. So the only way to make a fair comparison is to look only at \nsubsidies that mostly benefit only oil or only wind, and by that \nmeasure wind gets more breaks than oil.\n\n  The Heritage Foundation has done an analysis showing that if Big Oil \nreceived the same type of production tax credit as Big Wind, then the \ntaxpayer would be paying Big Oil about $50 per barrel of oil when \nadjusted for today's prices. According to a 2008 Energy Information \nAdministration report, Big Wind received an $18.82 federal subsidy per \nmegawatt hour, 25 times as much as per megawatt hour as subsidies for \nall other forms of electricity production combined.\n  The production tax credit became law in 1992. Its goal was to jump-\nstart renewable energy production. While it is advertised as a tax \ncredit for renewable energy, according to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, 75 percent of the credit goes to wind developers. Here is how \nit works: For every kilowatt hour of electricity produced from wind, \nturbine owners receive 2.2 cents in a tax credit. For example, if a \nTexas utility buys electricity from a wind developer at 6 cents a \nkilowatt hour, the Federal taxpayer will pay the developer another 2.2 \ncents per kilowatt hour. This 2.2-cent subsidy continues\n\n[[Page S1453]]\n\nfor the first 10 years that the turbine is in service. This 2.2-cent \ncredit is worth 3.4 cents per kilowatt hour in cash savings on the tax \nreturn of a wealthy investor. Wind developers often sell their tax \ncredits to Wall Street banks or big corporations or other investors who \nhave large incomes. They create what is called a tax equity deal in \norder to lower or even eliminate taxes. This is the scheme our \nPresident, who is championing economic fairness, would like to make \npermanent.\n  Energy expert Daniel Yergin, the Pulitzer prize winner, says the \nprice of oil during 2011, when adjusted for inflation, is higher than \nat any time since 1860. It therefore makes no sense whatsoever to give \nspecial tax breaks to Big Oil. Neither does it make sense to extend \nspecial tax breaks to Big Wind, a mature technology. For every $3 saved \nby eliminating these wasteful subsidies, I would spend $2 to reduce the \nFederal debt and $1 to double research for new forms of cheap, clean \nenergy for our country.\n  The second problem with electricity produced from wind is there is \nnot much of it, and since the wind blows when it wants to, and for the \nmost part, it cannot be stored, it is not reliable. For this reason the \nclaims in newspapers about how much electricity wind produces are \nmisleading because of the difference between the capacity of an energy \nplant and its actual production.\n  Daniel Yergin says the U.S. installed capacity for wind power grew at \nan average annual rate of 40 percent between 2005 and 2009. In terms of \nabsolute capacity, Yergin writes in his book The Quest, that growth in \ncapacity was the equivalent to adding 25 new nuclear plants. But Yergin \nwrites: In terms of actual generation of electricity, it was more like \nadding nine reactors. This is because nuclear plants operate 90 percent \nof the time while wind turbines operate about one-third of the time.\n  As an example, the Tennessee Valley Authority constructed a 29-\nmegawatt wind farm at Buffalo Mountain at a cost of $60 million. It is \nthe only wind farm in the Southeast.\n  We read in the papers about a 29-megawatt wind farm, but that is not \nits real output. In practice, Buffalo Mountain has only generated \nelectricity 19 percent of the time, since the wind doesn't blow very \nmuch in the Southeast. So this wind farm, sounding like a 29-megawatt \npower plant, only generates 6 megawatts. TVA considers Buffalo Mountain \nto be a failed experiment. In fact, looking for wind power in the \nSoutheast is a little like looking for hydropower in the desert.\n  So one problem with this Big Wind subsidy is that it has encouraged \ndevelopers to build wind projects in places where the wind doesn't blow \nor the wind doesn't blow.\n  Finally, there is the question of whether in the name of saving the \nenvironment wind turbines are destroying the environment. These are not \nyour grandma's windmills. They are taller than the Statue of Liberty, \ntheir blades are as long as a football field, and their blinking lights \ncan be seen for 20 miles. Not everyone agrees with T. Boone Pickens \nthat they are ugly but, when these towers move from television \nadvertisements into your neighborhood, you might agree with Mr. \nPickens. Energy sprawl is the term conservation groups use to describe \nthe march of 45-story wind turbines onto the landscape of ``America the \nBeautiful.''\n  If the United States generated 20 percent of our electricity from \nwind, as some have suggested, that would cover an area the size of West \nVirginia with 186,000 wind turbines. It would also be necessary to \nbuild 12,000 new miles of transmission lines.\n  The late Ted Kennedy and his successor Senator Scott Brown have both \ncomplained about how a wind farm the size of Manhattan Island will \nclutter the ocean landscape around Nantucket Island.\n  Robert Bryce told the Wall Street Journal that the noise of turbines, \nthe ``infra sound'' issue, is the most problematic for the wind \nindustry. ``They want to dismiss it out of hand, but the low frequency \nnoise is very disturbing,'' he explains. ``I interviewed people all \nover, and they all complained with identical words and descriptions \nabout the problems they were feeling from the noise.''\n  Theodore Roosevelt was our greatest conservation President, and his \ngreatest passion was for birds. Birds must think wind turbines are \nCuisinarts in the sky.\n  Last month, two golden eagles were found dead at California's Pine \nTree wind farm, bringing the total count of dead golden eagles at that \nwind farm to eight carcasses. And the Los Angeles Times reports that \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ``has determined that the six golden \neagles found dead earlier at the 2-year-old wind farm in Kern County \nwere struck by blades from some of the 90 turbines spread across the \n8,000 acres at the site.'' That puts the death rate per turbine at the \nPine Tree wind farm at three times higher than at California's Altamont \nPass Wind Resource Area, which has 5,000 turbines that kill 67 golden \neagles each year.\n  Apparently eagle killing has gotten so commonplace that the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior will grant wind developers hunting licenses \nfor eagles. In Goodhue County, MN, a company wants to build 48 turbines \non 50 square miles of land, and to do that it has applied for an \n``eagle take'' permit which will allow it to kill a certain number of \neagles before facing penalties.\n  I have figured out how such a hunting license squares with federal \nlaws that will put you in prison or fine you if you kill migratory \nbirds or eagles. Nor have I figured out how it squares with the Fish \nand Wildlife Service fining Exxon $600,000 in 2009 when oil development \nharmed protected birds. Do not the same laws protecting birds apply to \nboth Big Wind and Big Oil?\n  Surely, there are appropriate places for wind power in a country that \nneeds clean electricity and that has learned the value of a diverse set \nof energy sources. But if reliable, cheap, and clean electricity \nwithout energy sprawl is our goal, then four nuclear reactors--each \noccupying 1 square mile--would equal the production of a row of 50-\nstory wind turbines strung along the entire 2,178-mile length of the \nAppalachian Trail from Georgia to Maine.\n  According to Benjamin Zycher at the American Enterprise Institute, a \n1,000-megawatt natural gas powerplant would take up about 15 acres \nwhile a comparable wind farm would take up 48,000 to 60,000 acres. And, \nof course, even if someone built all of those turbines, you would still \nneed the nuclear or gas plants for when the wind doesn't blow.\n  Our energy policy should to be, first, double the $5 billion Federal \nenergy budget for research on new forms of cheap, clean, reliable \nenergy. I am talking about such research for the 500-mile battery for \nelectric cars, for commercial uses of carbon captured from coal plants, \nsolar power installed at less than $1 a watt, or even offshore wind \nturbines.\n  Second, we should strictly limit and support a handful of jumpstart \nresearch and development projects to take new technologies from their \nresearch and development phase to the commercial phase. I am thinking \nhere of projects like ARPA-E, modeled after the Defense Department's \nDARPA, that led to the internet, stealth, and other remarkable \ntechnologies. Or the 5-year program for small modular nuclear reactors.\n  Third, we should end wasteful, long-term, special tax breaks such as \nthose for Big Oil and Big Wind. The savings from ending those subsidies \nshould be used to double clean energy research and to reduce our \nFederal debt.\n  For a strong country, we need large amounts of cheap, reliable, clean \nenergy, and we need a balanced budget. This is an energy policy that \ncould help us do both.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     Republicans Blow With the Wind\n\n\n         Another Industry wants to keep its taxpayer subsidies\n\n       Congress finally ended decades of tax credits for ethanol \n     in December, a small triumph for taxpayers. Now comes another \n     test as the wind-power industry lobbies for a $7 billion \n     renewal of its production tax credit.\n       The renewable energy tax credit--mostly for wind and solar \n     power--started in 1992 as a ``temporary'' benefit for an \n     infant industry. Twenty years later, the industry wants \n     another four years on the dole, and Senator Jeff Bingaman of \n     New Mexico has introduced a national renewable-energy mandate \n     so consumers will be required to buy wind and solar power no \n     matter how high the cost.\n       The truth is that those giant wind turbines from Maine to \n     California won't turn without burning through billions upon \n     billions of taxpayer dollars. In 2010 the industry received\n\n[[Page S1454]]\n\n     some $5 billon in subsidies for nearly every stage of wind \n     production.\n       The ``1603 grant program'' pays up to 30% of the \n     construction costs for renewable energy plants (a subsidy \n     that ended last year but which President Obama calls for \n     reviving in his budget). Billions in Department of Energy \n     grants and loan guarantees also finance the operating costs \n     of these facilities. Wind producers then get the 2.2% tax \n     credit for every kilowatt of electricity generated.\n       Because wind-powered electricity is so expensive, more than \n     half of the 50 states have passed renewable energy mandates \n     that require utilities to purchase wind and solar power--a de \n     facto tax on utility bills. And don't forget subsidies to \n     build transmission lines to deliver wind power to the \n     electric grid.\n       What have taxpayers received for this multibillion-dollar \n     ``investment''? The latest Department of Energy figures \n     indicate that wind and solar power accounted for a mere 1.5% \n     of U.S. energy production in 2010. DOE estimates that by 2035 \n     wind will provide a still trivial 3.9% of U.S. electricity.\n       Even that may be too optimistic because of the natural gas \n     boom that has produced a happy supply shock and cut prices by \n     more than half. Most economic models forecasting that \n     renewable energy will become price competitive are based on \n     predictions of natural gas prices at well above $6 per \n     million cubic feet, more than twice the current cost.\n       The most dishonest claim is that wind and solar deserve to \n     be wards of the state because the oil and gas industry has \n     also received federal support. That's the $4 billion a year \n     in tax breaks for oil and gas (which all manufacturers \n     receive), but the oil and gas industry still pays tens of \n     billions in federal taxes every year.\n       Wind and solar companies are net tax beneficiaries. \n     Taxpayers would save billions of dollars if wind and solar \n     produced no energy at all. A July 2011 Energy Department \n     study found that oil, natural gas and coal received an \n     average of 64 cents of subsidy per megawatt hour in 2010. \n     Wind power received nearly 100 times more, or $56.29 per \n     megawatt hour.\n       Most Congressional Democrats will back anything with the \n     green label. But Republican support for big wind is a pure \n     corporate welfare play that violates free-market principles. \n     Last week six Republican Senators--John Boozman of Arkansas, \n     Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Charles Grassley of Iowa, John \n     Hoeven of North Dakota, Jerry Moran of Kansas and John Thune \n     of South Dakota--signed a letter urging their colleagues to \n     extend the production tax credit.\n       ``It is clear that the wind industry currently requires tax \n     incentives'' and that continuing that federal aid can help \n     the industry ``move towards a market-based system,'' said the \n     letter. What's the ``market-based'' timetable--100 years? In \n     the House 18 Republicans have joined the 70 Member wind pork \n     caucus. Someone should remind them that in 2008 and 2010 the \n     wind lobby gave 71% of its PAC money to Democrats.\n       Here's a better idea. Kill all energy subsidies--renewable \n     and nonrenewable, starting with the wind tax credit, and use \n     the savings to shave two or three percentage points off \n     America's corporate income tax. Kansas Congressman Mike \n     Pompeo has a bill to do so. This would do more to create jobs \n     than attempting to pick energy winners and losers. Mandating \n     that American families and businesses use expensive \n     electricity doesn't create jobs. It destroys them.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Capital Formation\n\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, it is probably clear to all of us that the \nAmerican people have a very high level of frustration with the lack of \nproductivity of this Congress. The fact is, when we go home to our \nrespective States, I am sure we are all hearing what I heard last week \nas I traveled across Pennsylvania. People ask me: Why can't you guys \nwork together? Why can't you get something done? Why does it seem there \nis so much partisan bickering that you can't come together even on \nsimple things that could help grow this economy, help make progress in \nthese very difficult times?\n  Well, on this front I think we have some good news, and I am \ndelighted to talk about this tonight. I hope this early sign of good \nnews reaches fruition and we actually have a meaningful accomplishment \nsoon in this body as well as the other body.\n  Specifically, I am referring to the work that has been coming \ntogether of late on a series of capital formation bills that will help \nsmall and growing companies raise the capital they need to expand, to \nhire new workers, to help improve our economy and give us a healthier \neconomy with the job growth we badly need.\n  In particular, I want to thank House majority leader Eric Cantor. \nCongressman Cantor took the step of pulling together a series of \nseparate bills and putting them together in a package--a capital \nformation package. There is very broad support for this package in the \nHouse. I think under his leadership it is very likely to pass the House \nand will present a tremendous opportunity for us because there is broad \nbipartisan support for these commonsense reforms that will help \ncompanies raise capital and grow.\n  The bipartisan support includes the President of the United States. \nMuch to his credit, the President--I believe just yesterday--issued a \nformal Statement of Administrative Policy indicating his full support \nfor the passage of the measure that Leader Cantor is proposing in the \nHouse. Many of these proposals come from the work that the President \ninitiated. Some of them are included in the startup America jobs plan \nthat the President proposed. Some of them were recommended by \ncommissions that the President assembled. The President spoke about the \nneed for enhancing small- and medium-sized companies' access to capital \nin his State of the Union Address. So I think the President has been \nvery clear and very strong in his support as the House Republican \nleadership has been.\n  In this body I think the leadership on both sides of the aisle has \nindicated support. The majority leader and the minority leader have \nboth indicated their support for moving in this direction. The chairman \nand the ranking member of the Banking Committee have expressed a desire \nto move forward with the capital formation package, and there is wide \nsupport among outside groups. In fact, there is very broad support and \nvery little opposition. The support includes support of entrepreneurs, \nwhether they be from convenience stores, financial services firms, or \nhigh-tech firms.\n  In Pennsylvania, the life science companies feel very strongly about \nthis because for them access to capital is a huge challenge. It is the \nabsolutely essential precondition for their growth, and they are not \nalone. Manufacturers generally, supermarkets, all kinds of trade \nassociations, the support for these kinds of capital foundation bills \nis very broad.\n  I want to touch specifically on three of the bills that I have been \nworking on for quite some time now, and I am very hopeful and \noptimistic. First of all, these three bills are among six bills. The \nHouse companion version of these bills is in the package that Leader \nCantor has proposed, and I believe there is broad support in this body \nfor these bills as well.\n  The first I want to refer to is a bill that I have introduced with \nSenator Tester. It is S. 1544, and it is called the Small Company \nCapital Formation Act. It is more commonly known as the reg A bill. \nWhat it does is lift the current ceiling on the amount of money that a \nbusiness can raise under the regulation provision of the securities \nlaw. That is a provision that allows a small\n\n[[Page S1455]]\n\ncompany to issue a modest amount of debt or equity without being \nsubject to the full range of very costly regulations. The limit has \nbeen at $5 million for many years, and the bill that Senator Tester and \nI have proposed would raise that limit to $50 million. It has not been \nupdated in almost two decades, and there is no question that raising \nthe ceiling would allow a lot of companies that need to raise \nsubstantially more than $5 million the ability to do so and to thereby \ngrow.\n  This is something the President has supported as well, and it passed \nthe House by a pretty stunning margin of 421 to 1. It was not very \ncontroversial. I don't think it is controversial here, so I am glad \nthis bill is included in this package in the House.\n  The second bill I would like to mention is S. 1824, the Toomey-Carper \nbill. It has to do with the limit on the number of shareholders a \nclosely held company can have without triggering the full SEC \ncompliance. Currently, that limit is at 500 shareholders. If you reach \n500 or go above 500, then you are treated as a public company such as \nExxonMobile for reporting purposes. That might have been appropriate \nmany years ago, but in the modern era where communication is so much \neasier, access to information is so much greater and so much faster, \nthe necessary information for shareholders can be distributed more \nbroadly, more quickly, more easily, it is high time we raised that \nlimit from 500 to 2,000 as this bill would do.\n\n  I appreciate Senator Carper's support for this legislation.\n  This is a bill that has a companion measure in the House that was \nraised at the House Financial Services Committee. They voted on it. \nThey voted by voice vote and approved it. By voice vote that means, \ngenerally speaking, there is no opposition and nobody bothered with the \nrollcall vote because everybody supported it. That is a big, broad \ncommittee that represents virtually every constituency in the House of \nRepresentatives, and it was passed by a voice vote. This has very \nstrong and broad support.\n  The third bill I want to mention is S. 1933, the Schumer-Toomey bill. \nThe technical name is Reopening American Capital Markets to Emerging \nGrowth Companies Act. We call this more colloquially the on-ramp bill. \nThe reason we call it that is because we think of it as an on-ramp to \nbecoming a publicly traded company, a path to launching an IPO that \nwill facilitate this.\n  There has been a big reduction in the number of IPOs that occur in \nthe United States. The IPO, initial public offering, is the process by \nwhich a private company becomes a public company. It can be a very \nsubstantial opportunity to raise capital. As I mentioned earlier, when \ncompanies raise capital, they put that money to work by expanding and \nhiring new workers. An IPO is a hugely important step in a company's \nprogress and almost invariably follows a substantial increase in \nhiring, and that is why this is so important.\n  One of the reasons companies are slower to go public now than they \nwere in the past is because we in Congress created a much more \nexpensive set of regulations when a company does go public. Part of \nthat is the Sarbanes-Oxley bill, and certain features within Sarbanes-\nOxley are enormously complex and expensive to comply with.\n  Our bill says if you are a relatively small company--specifically, \nless than $1 billion in revenues or less than $700 million in public \nfloat, the amount of stock that is traded, then you can do an IPO \nwithout having to comply with all of the Sarbanes-Oxley regulations \nimmediately. Over time you will have to comply if you exceed those \nthresholds that I mentioned, or within 5 years. In any case, you have \nto comply as everybody else does, but at least you have the opportunity \nto grow and the ability to afford the expense that is associated with \nit.\n  A companion measure to this bill--an identical version in the House \nwas considered by the House Financial Services Committee, and that \npassed just a week ago. It passed the Financial Services Committee by a \nvote of 54 to 1. This is not very controversial. This has very broad \nbipartisan support, and this is the kind of legislation that is going \nto help businesses grow. I cannot stress enough the link between \nraising capital and growing one's company and hiring new workers. \nCapital and jobs are completely linked. What these bills will do, \ntogether with the other bills that make the broader package, is they \nwill encourage a wealthier economy, stronger job growth, and more \npeople working.\n\n  Let me stress one other aspect about this that I think is important \nto note. This came out at a hearing we had earlier this week on this \nvery topic; that is, for many small companies, young companies, growing \ncompanies, there are a number of steps along the way to becoming a \nlarger and more successful company, employing more people.\n  There are a number of steps along the way in raising capital that can \nstart with an angel investor, followed by venture capital, followed by \nprivate equity, followed by maybe a securities issuance, followed by an \nIPO. This sequence of capital-raising is very important. If you \nfacilitate any one step along the way, as these bills would, the \nexperts who came and testified before our committee confirmed that by \nfacilitating one step along the way, you facilitate the capital-raising \nat the earlier steps because what happens is the investors are more \nconfident they will have the opportunity to liquidate their investment \nat a later stage if they see that the regulations have been made more \namenable to that liquidation further down the road. So even if a \ncompany is not yet necessarily poised, for instance, to do the IPO, the \nfact that the IPO is easier to achieve when that company gets there \nincreases their chance of raising money now through other vehicles, \nthrough other sources, and therefore increases their ability to grow.\n  I am very enthusiastic, as my colleagues can tell, about this \nlegislation--certainly the three bills I have been working on and the \nother bills as well, which are a perfect complement to this and really \nconstitute a portfolio of bills that will facilitate portfolio-raising \nacross the board.\n  I thank my Democratic cosponsors of these particular bills, including \nSenators Tester, Carper, and Schumer, for working with me. I also wish \nto commend Leader McConnell for his leadership and Senator Reid for \nhis, as well as Ranking Member Shelby and Chairman Johnson. I think \nwhat our constituents have been telling us for a long time is they want \nto see us working together and doing what is right for our country, for \nour economy, for job growth. This is a wonderful opportunity to do \nthat.\n  I think it is quite likely that a package of these bills is going to \npass the House very soon. I hope some comparable measure will pass in \nthe Senate. The President has already indicated he supports it and \nwants to sign it. I don't think we should waste any time at all in \npassing the legislation that will be good for small and medium-sized \nbusinesses and good for their ability to grow and hire more workers.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I don't think apologies are in \norder. We have been doing the best we can for several days now. We have \na typical agreement, not one that either side jumps for joy about. In \nthe near future, we are going to be able to finish this important piece \nof legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to recommit be \nwithdrawn; that the pending second-degree amendment be withdrawn; that \nthe Reid of Nevada amendment No. 1761 be agreed to; that the bill, as \namended, be considered original text for the purposes of further \namendment; that the following amendments be the only first-degree \namendments remaining in order to S. 1813:\n  Vitter No. 1535; Baucus or designee relative to rural schools; \nCollins No. 1660; Coburn No. 1738; Nelson of Florida, Shelby, Landrieu \nNo. 1822, with a modification in order if agreed to by Senators Nelson \nof Florida, Shelby, Landrieu, and Baucus; Wyden No. 1817; Hoeven No. \n1537; Levin No. 1818;\n\n[[Page S1456]]\n\nMcConnell or designee with a side-by-side to Stabenow No. 1812; \nStabenow No. 1812; Demint No. 1589; Menendez-Burr No. 1782; DeMint No. \n1756; Coats No. 1517; Brown of Ohio No. 1819; Blunt No. 1540; Merkley \nNo. 1653; Portman No. 1736; Klobuchar No. 1617; Corker No. 1785, with a \nmodification; Shaheen No. 1678; Portman No. 1742; Corker No. 1810; \nCarper No. 1670; Hutchison No. 1568; McCain No. 1669, modified with \nchanges at the desk; Alexander No. 1779; Boxer No. 1816; and Paul No. \n1556; that on Thursday, March 8, at a time to be determined by the \nmajority leader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the \nSenate proceed to votes in relation to the amendments in the order \nlisted; that the following amendments be subject to a 60-vote \naffirmative threshold: Vitter No. 1535; Baucus or designee relative to \nrural schools; Collins No. 1660; Coburn No. 1738; Nelson of Florida-\nShelby-Landrieu No. 1822; Wyden No. 1817; Hoeven No. 1537; McConnell or \ndesignee side-by-side to Stabenow No. 1812; Stabenow No. 1812; DeMint \nNo. 1589; Menendez-Burr No. 1782; that there be no other amendments in \norder to the bill or the amendments listed other than the managers' \npackage and there be no points of order or motions in order to any of \nthese amendments other than budget points of order and the applicable \nmotions to waive; that it be in order for a managers' package to be \nconsidered and, if approved by the managers and the two leaders, the \nmanagers' package be agreed to; further, the bill, as amended, then be \nread the third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the \nbill, as amended, and if the bill is passed, it be held at the desk; \nfinally, that when the Senate receives the House companion to S. 1813, \nas determined by the two leaders, it be in order for the majority \nleader to proceed to its immediate consideration, strike all after the \nenacting clause and insert the text of S. 1813, as passed by the \nSenate, in lieu thereof; that the House bill, as amended, be read the \nthird time, a statutory pay-go statement be read, if needed, and the \nbill, as amended, be passed, the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table; that upon passage, the Senate insist on \nits amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses and that the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 100th \nanniversary of the Frederick County Chamber of Commerce, the first \nchartered chamber in the United States. When the United States Chamber \nof Commerce was formed at a conference held by President Taft in April \n1912, four delegates from the Maryland's Frederick County Board of \nTrade were in attendance. Inspired by the conference, the Frederick \nCounty Board of Trade applied for membership to the newly formed \nchamber the very next day.\n  The newly renamed Frederick County Chamber of Commerce committed \nitself to serving the business interests of Frederick County. During \nthe ravages of the Great Depression, the chamber was a beacon of hope, \nadvocating for Federal work programs and organizing the Community \nChest, now known as the United Way of Frederick County.\n  Over the past 100 years, the Frederick County Chamber of Commerce has \nsuccessfully promoted economic vitality in Frederick, and has been a \ncrucial partner to countless local businesses and organizations. The \nFrederick Arts Council and the Tourism Council of Frederick County were \nboth chamber initiatives that grew into independently successful \norganizations. The Chamber has also been a leader in promoting women \nand minority-owned businesses. In 1969, the chamber worked with the \nNAACP to form the People's Opportunity and Information Center, and in \n1997 they welcomed their first female president.\n  Today, the Frederick County Chamber of Commerce works with nearly \n1,000 member businesses to expand Frederick County's economy and \nimprove the quality of life for Frederick County residents. By bringing \nbusiness leaders together to tackle challenges and proactively plan for \nthe future, the Frederick County Chamber of Commerce has strengthened \nthe community and the region.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Frederick County \nChamber of Commerce on 100 years of leadership and advocacy on behalf \nof the businesses and citizens of Frederick County.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/07/senate-section/article/S1456-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING MINNESOTA SENATOR GARY KUBLY\n\n Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes \nto remember the life of Minnesota Senator Gary Kubly, who died on \nFriday, March 2, after a battle with Lou Gehrig's disease.\n  Gary was a model Midwestern politician--one who worked hard, but \nquietly, on behalf of his constituents. He was a strong voice for the \nrural communities that he served, communities whose struggles continue \nto mount and are shared across this country. He cared deeply about \nissues from agriculture and rural development to education and the \nenvironment.\n  In 2010, Gary was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, more \ncommonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. As a Lutheran pastor, Gary met \nhis diagnosis with strong faith and determination. He chose to continue \nhis work in public service, always putting his constituents first.\n  Gary wasn't the stereotypical politician whom many disparage so often \nin today's discourse. He kept his head down and just worked for the \npeople who elected him, reaching across ideological boundaries to do \nhis job. In his 16 years in the Minnesota House and Senate, he didn't \nseek out the limelight. He simply served as a voice for rural \nMinnesota, and he was remarkably effective.\n  We in this body have a lot to learn from Gary's style of legislating. \nMinnesota benefited greatly from his work, and we have lost a hard-\nworking public servant and friend.\n  I would like to conclude with a prayer that Gary read at a Minnesota \nFarmers Union convention in 2010, which I think is a perfect reflection \nof his values:\n  Creator God, Redeemer Son and Indwelling Spirit, we thank You for \nbringing us together this weekend. Be with us as we attempt to move our \nindustry forward in ways that benefit the people of our State and \nNation.\n  Help us to see that the decisions we make in caring for the land, \nmarketing local foods, sustaining our resources for all of these things \nare part and parcel of our call as Your people to care for our \nneighbor.\n  Help us to embrace once again the values of community that allow us \nto see our neighbors in the same light that You see them for You have \ncreated all of us in equal standing before You.\n  Move us from our tendency to isolate ourselves from one another to \nseeing our neighbors as benefactors along with us of Your love and \ngrace.\n  Bless us now as we received these gifts of nourishment from Your hand \nthat we might be sustained in our call to care for our neighbor coupled \nwith our own call to farm the land You have given into our keeping.\n  In Your strong name, Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/07/senate-section/article/S1456-4", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1456-S1457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO ASSISTANT POLICE CHIEF MARCY KORGENSKI\n\n Mr. LEE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the career \nof Assistant Police Chief Marcy Korgenski, who is retiring after 30 \nyears with the Ogden Police Department and was the first female to hold \nthe position in Ogden's history.\n  A graduate of both Weber State University and the FBI National \nAcademy, Chief Korgenski first joined Ogden's police force in 1982 as a \npatrol officer.\n\n[[Page S1457]]\n\nShe helped to found the department's gang unit in 1991, and, rising \nthrough the ranks, she became a sergeant in 1995 and a lieutenant in \n1999. In 2010, Korgenski was promoted to assistant police chief, a \nposition she had earned with hard work throughout her career.\n  As assistant chief, Korgenski has been in charge of the department's \nInvestigation Division, training and records operations, and selective \nenforcement. She has also directed officers assigned to the Weber-\nMorgan Narcotics Strike Force, established and managed the Ogden Police \nApprentice Program, and joined prosecutors in establishing a special \ninvestigator for Hispanic victims of domestic violence. Using her \nexperience to teach others, Korgenski trained members of the Volunteers \nin Policing program in techniques to assist local police in keeping \nresidents safe.\n  In 2011, Korgenski was awarded the Ogden/Weber Chamber Women in \nBusiness Committee's ATHENA award, which recognizes individuals who \ndemonstrate excellence, initiative, and creativity in their profession. \nWhen interviewed about the award, Korgenski said that she encourages \nwomen to ``dream the impossible dream.''\n  Korgenski has also received her department's Distinguished Service \nAward, the Mattie Harris Spirit of the American Woman Award, and the \nRotary Club's Outstanding Selfless Dedication and Public Service Award.\n  Beyond her professional accomplishments, Korgenski is very active in \nher community. She is involved with the Ogden Area Youth Alliance, the \nAmerican Cancer Society Relay for Life, the Special Olympics of Utah, \nand the Domestic Violence Coalition for Weber County. She also serves \non the Swanson Foundation Advisory Board, the Ogden Noon Exchange Club \nExecutive Board, Weber Sate's Child and Family Services Advisory Board, \nand the GOAL Foundation, and is a trustee for Youth Impact, a nonprofit \norganization dedicated to helping at-risk youths. Her decision to \nretire was made in part to devote even more time to her volunteering \nefforts.\n  I join Ogden Mayor Mike Caldwell in saying that Marcy Korgenski's \nservice to the public will be missed. Her career is a testament to the \naccomplishments of hardworking women everywhere, and I congratulate her \non her many achievements and 30 years of excellence in her \nfield.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/07/senate-section/article/S1457-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING BAXTER BREWING COMPANY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, throughout the 112th Congress, I \nhave consistently implored my colleagues to remember the value of our \nNation's small businesses. These enterprising firms are the key to job \ncreation. Nowhere is this more prevalent than in my home State of \nMaine, whose entrepreneurial spirit has remained vibrant as businesses \ncontinue to make headlines. Today I wish to recognize and commend \nBaxter Brewing Company, whose owner and founder, Luke Livingston, was \nrecently named one of Forbes Magazine's 30 under 30 in the food and \nwine category.\n  A native of Auburn, ME, Luke began brewing while still in college at \nClark University in Worcester, MA. Following college, although he was \nsuccessfully employed, Luke's passion continued to remain in brewing. \nAt 24, he decided it was time to take the leap, and quit his day job to \ndevelop a business plan for Baxter Brewing Company. In seeking to \ncreate a well-crafted business plan--particularly in such a tumultuous \neconomy--Luke turned to counselors within the Maine Small Business \nDevelopment Center, who provided him critical guidance that was \ninstrumental in achieving his goal.\n  Now at age 27, Luke's dream has become a reality, as his business has \nquickly risen to the ranks of top micro-breweries. Baxter Brewing \nCompany, began selling its product in January of 2011, and is located \nin a portion of newly renovated space at the Bates Mill Complex, a \nhistoric former textile mill in downtown Lewiston. Currently, the \ncompany offers three varieties of beer including a Stowaway India Pale \nAle, IPA, Pamola Xtra Pale Ale, and its newest addition, the Amber \nRoad. Unlike most craft beer producers, Luke sells his micro-brew in \ncans rather than glass bottles. By using cans, Baxter is able to \nutilize recycled materials while reducing shipping costs and providing \nfresher beer to their customers at the same time.\n  Recently, celebrating Baxter's first year anniversary, Luke's gamble \nhas certainly paid off with expanding sales markets and multiple \naccolades for the young brewery. In the first year, the company sold \nslightly over 5,000 barrels of beer, making it one of 2011's most \nsuccessful first year craft breweries. Accordingly, in addition to \nLuke's personal recognition by Forbes, Baxter Brewing is also being \nrecognized by BevNet Magazine, an elite beverage trade magazine, as the \nNew Brewery of the Year.\n  As Baxter Brewing Company continues to expand further into \nMassachusetts and New Hampshire, this small business offers incredible \ninsight into how young entrepreneurs can triumph in today's economy. \nLuke's ambition and zealous commitment to his craft have provided a \nremarkable pathway to success. I am proud to extend my congratulations \nto Luke and everyone at Baxter Brewing for their richly deserved \nhonors, and offer my best wishes for their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/07/senate-section/article/S1457-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:49 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4105.

A bill to amend the provisions of title 5, United States \nCode, which are commonly referred to as the ``Hatch Act'' to eliminate \nthe provision preventing certain State and local employees from seeking \nelective office, clarify the application of certain provisions to the \nDistrict of Columbia, and modify the penalties which may be imposed for \ncertain violations under subchapter III of chapter 73 of that title; to \nthe Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hatch Act \nModernization Act of 2012. I am pleased that Senators Lieberman, Levin, \nand Lee have joined as cosponors.\n  The Hatch Act restricts political activity of Federal employees, \nDistrict of Columbia employees, and certain other state and local \nemployees. Originally enacted in 1939, the Hatch Act has not been \namended since 1993.\n  The Hatch Act plays two very important roles. First, it ensures that \nthe government works for American citizens regardless of the political \nparty controlling the White House or Congress. Second, the Hatch Act \nprotects Federal employees in the workplace. Specifically, the Hatch \nAct restricts Federal employees' partisan political action in order to \nprotect them for being coerced to participate in political activities \nin the workplace. This is essential to the merit-based system that \ncurrently exists.\n  In 2007, I chaired a hearing of the Senate Subcommittee of Oversight \nof Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of \nColumbia, which examined whether enhancements or clarifications to the \nHatch Act were necessary. Since that time, I have considered what \nchanges to the law would be appropriate, while being mindful that the \nHatch Act represents a careful balance intended to shield employees \nfrom pressure to use federal time and money for partisan gain, while \nalso protecting employees' personal freedoms of choice and expression.\n  The legislation I am introducing today makes common sense changes to \nthe Hatch Act. First, it would grant State and local employees the \nfreedom to run for partisan elective office. Under current law, state \nand local employees are permitted to run for nonpartisan elective \noffice, but are prohibited from running for partisan elective office. \nThis can lead to confusing and inconsistent rules in different \nlocations, depending on whether a particular elective office is \ncategorized as partisan or non-partisan. This change will also save the \ngovernment money, as the Office of Special Counsel would not be \nrequired to spend valuable time and resources investigating the \nhundreds of complaints it receives each year on this issue.\n  The legislation would also modify the Hatch Act's draconian penalty \nprovisions. The Hatch Act currently provides for a presumed penalty of \ntermination for any violation of the law, regardless of its severity. \nUnder the law, it is possible that a federal employee could lose his or \nher job for inadvertently sending an email at work containing improper \npolitical content or hanging a picture on his or her wall during a \ncampaign season. My bill would amend these provisions of the Hatch Act \nto allow the Merit Systems Protection Board, which adjudicates Hatch \nAct complaints in the federal government, to impose a range of \npenalties, from termination to a reprimand, depending on the nature of \nthe offense involved.\n  Finally, the legislation would ensure that employees of the District \nof Columbia are subject to the same restrictions on political activity \nthat currently apply to all other state and local employees. Under \npresent law, District of Columbia employees are subject to the Hatch \nAct provisions that apply to federal employees, rather than those that \napply to employees of States and localities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2170\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to remove the limit on the anticipated award price \nfor contracts awarded under the procurement program for women-owned \nsmall business concerns, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, at the onset of Women's \nHistory Month, along with my colleagues Senators Gillibrand, Landrieu, \nBennet, Shaheen, Mikulski, and Murkowski to introduce the Fairness in \nWomen-Owned Small Business Contracting Act. The purpose of the bill is \nto remove inequities that exist in the women-owned small business \ncontracting program, when compared to other socio-economic programs.\n  As former Chair and now Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I have long championed women \nentrepreneurship and have urged both past and present Administrations \nto implement the woman-owned small business, WOSB, Federal contracting \nprogram, which was enacted into law 10 years ago. On March 4, 2010, the \nSmall Business Administration, SBA, finally proposed a workable rule to \nimplement the women's procurement program. I am pleased to report that \ntoday there is a functional WOSB contracting program, however, the \nprogram lacks the critical elements that the SBA's 8(a), historically \nunderutilized business zones, and the service-disabled veteran-owned \ngovernment contracting programs include.\n  To remedy this, our bipartisan bill will help provide tools women \nneed to compete fairly in the Federal contracting arena by allowing for \nreceipt of non-competitive contracts, when circumstances allow. \nMoreover, the legislation would eliminate a restriction on the dollar \namount of a contract that a WOSB can compete for, thus putting them on \na level playing field with the other socio-economic contracting \nprograms.\n  Women-owned small businesses have yet to receive their fair share of \nthe Federal marketplace. In fact, our government has never achieved its \ngoal of five percent of contracts going to WOSBs, achieving only 4.04 \npercent in fiscal year 2010. Our bill would greatly assist Federal \nagencies in achieving the small business goaling requirement for WOSBs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2172\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness in Women-Owned \n     Small Business Contracting Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROCUREMENT PROGRAM FOR WOMEN-OWNED SMALL BUSINESS \n                   CONCERNS.\n\n       Section 8(m) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(m)) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``who are economically \n     disadvantaged'';\n       (B) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``paragraph (3)'' and \n     inserting ``paragraph (4)'';\n       (C) by striking subparagraph (D); and\n       (D) by redesignating subparagraphs (E) and (F) as \n     subparagraphs (D) and (E), respectively; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(7) Sole source contracts.--A contracting officer may \n     award a sole source contract under this subsection to a small \n     business concern owned and controlled by women under the same \n     conditions as a sole source contract may be awarded to a \n     qualified HUBZone small business concern under section \n     31(b)(2)(A).''.\n\n     SEC. 3.
