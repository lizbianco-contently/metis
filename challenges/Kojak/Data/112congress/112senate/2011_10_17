Mr. President, Bart Giamatti was a well-rounded man. He was \nthe president of the Yale University and also Commissioner of Major \nLeague Baseball. He once called education the ``heart of a civil \nsociety.'' But he also said the heart of education is the act of \nteaching.\n  The commitment to educate the children of this Nation is our greatest \ninvestment in our collective future. It is the key to keeping the \nAmerican dream alive and crucial to staying competitive in a global \neconomy. Teachers are the stewards of that investment. But the terrible \nrecession that has rocked our national economy has threatened their \nability to give our children the education they deserve.\n  Since 2008, State and local budget cuts have cost this country \n300,000 education jobs. Nearly 200,000 of those jobs were lost in the \nlast year alone. Schools are feeling the pinch of a larger class size, \nespecially at the elementary and middle school levels. The number of \nchildren in an elementary school classroom has a direct correlation to \nstudent achievement and even college graduation rates.\n  Districts also shortened schooldays, school years, and eliminated \nsummer\n\n[[Page S6566]]\n\nschool programs that help underprivileged children to compete in the \nworld. They have cut art and music classes and afterschool activities \nthat keep students engaged and prevent everything from high school \ndropouts, delinquency, to even teen pregnancy.\n  While all of these cuts have been difficult, things could be much \nworse. The Recovery Act and the Education Jobs Fund provided money to \nkeep 422,000 teachers in the classroom for a year. School districts \nacross the country used that Federal funding to keep class sizes small \nand ensure students are given the world-class education they deserve. \nThey used this funding to ensure America's children are trained for the \njobs of today and prepared for the challenges of tomorrow.\n  Still, as the economy continues to struggle, so do State and local \nbudgets. That means schools that are already doing more with less will \ncontinue to be at risk. Although Democrats have saved hundreds of \nthousands of teacher jobs already, schools have still lost 300,000 \neducators since this recession began.\n  And the brain drain could even get worse. State and local budgets \ncould cost as many as 280,000 teacher jobs next year unless we do more. \nThat is why President Obama proposed we invest $30 billion as part of \nthe American Jobs Act to keep our schools well staffed and to ensure \nour children are well educated. This is not deficit spending. This is \nmoney that will be paid for. Republicans blocked that job-creating \nlegislation which would have put 2 million people to work in classrooms \nand at construction sites across the country. But Democrats have not \ngiven up on keeping our schools fully staffed. Nearly 300,000 teacher \njobs--I repeat--are at risk, and so is the quality of our education \nsystem.\n  Unless school districts get a helping hand, many will be forced to \nmake more difficult choices between laying off educators and going \nwithout schoolbooks, paper, and other supplies.\n  Democrats will pursue the President's plan to keep nearly 400,000 \nteacher and support staff where they belong, in the classroom--a $30 \nbillion investment, fully paid for, which will help school districts \nnot only avoid layoffs but also rehire tens of thousands of teachers \nwho have already lost their jobs because of budget cuts.\n  It will also commit $5 billion to retaining the police, firefighters, \nand first responders who work so hard to keep our communities safe, and \nto rehiring those who have already been laid off in these tough \neconomic times. Our economy cannot afford to lose more jobs. Our \ncommunities cannot afford to lose the men and women who keep us safe \nand secure. Our Nation cannot afford to lose the competitive edge a \nworld-class education system gives us in a constantly changing world. \nDemocrats are committed to protecting the heart of education Bart \nGiamatti spoke of, the talented teachers who will shape our civil \nsociety.\n  Mr. President, will the Chair announce the business of the day?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6566-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss the \nJobs Through Growth Act that was recently introduced by most of my \nRepublican colleagues on this side of the aisle. I wish to highlight \nthe hard work done by my colleagues Senators Paul and Portman in \nputting this bill together.\n  This bill is a commonsense alternative to the plan being championed \nby President Obama and Majority Leader Reid. The differences between \nour plan and theirs are that we want to create jobs through growth and \nthey want to create jobs through government spending. We believe \nbusiness creates jobs in America.\n  It is clear from the President's stimulus 2 that he believes \ngovernment creates jobs, so there is a fundamental difference between \nour proposal and theirs. What they have proposed is another stimulus. \nWe tried that. We saw the movie before. It did not work. It added to \nour debt and deficit. We lost jobs.\n  My colleagues and I are putting forth a plan to create jobs through \nsound policies. Most economists will tell you that economic growth is a \nfundamental part of long-term sustainable job creation, and that is \nwhat the plan does. It contains key components--spending reforms, \nincluding a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, to give job \ncreators the certainty that Washington will not continue to grow \nunchecked.\n  Almost all of us understand from experience over the years that \nunless the United States of America, our government, is required--as \nevery State and every town and every county and every city in America \nis required--to have a balanced budget, we will continue the mass \ndeficits that mortgage our children and our grandchildren's futures.\n  Republican and Democratic Presidents alike over the years have asked \nfor enhanced rescission authority--what we used to call the line-item \nveto--that would give the President of the United States the ability to \neliminate unnecessary, wasteful, earmarked, porkbarrel spending \nprovisions without having to veto the entire bill.\n  We believe these two measures can bring about a fiscal discipline in \nthis Congress and in this Nation that has been sadly lacking for a long \ntime and has given us the massive debts and deficits--a deficit of \nnearly $50,000 for every man, woman, and child in America today.\n  We need tax reform. Is there anyone in America who doesn't believe \nthat the Tax Code, which is this high, doesn't need to be reformed? Our \nproposal is simple: Cut the corporate tax rate from 35 to 25; create 3 \ncategories of tax rates in America, and close the loopholes, eliminate \nthe subsidies, and let's give Americans a Tax Code they can trust and \nbelieve in--even understand.\n  Let's bring home the $1.4 trillion in foreign earnings that are \ntrapped overseas in countries where U.S.-based multinational companies \ndo business. Why won't they bring the money home? It is because they \nhave to tax it at 35 percent. It is not that complicated.\n  Last week, Senator Hagan and I introduced a bill that would provide \nincentives for that money to come home on the proviso that they create \njobs in America and invest in America. According to a recent study done \nby the chamber of commerce, the repatriation of this $1.4 trillion in \ncorporate earnings currently trapped overseas can result in increasing \nthe gross domestic product by roughly $360 billion and would create as \nmany as 2.9 million new U.S. jobs.\n  I must say, recently from the other side there was a study that \nshowed this money would have no effect. How in the world could you \npossibly believe that if you brought $1.4 trillion back home to America \nit would have no effect? I think it probably shows you can have a study \nthat shows there was indeed a landing of aliens in a city in New Mexico \na long time ago.\n  Reforming the regulatory process costs taxpayers nothing, but it does \nmore for creating jobs than any stimulus program possibly could. There \nis nothing more constraining to job growth than the adversarial \nrelationship between business and government. Talk to any \nbusinessperson, small or large, and they will tell you why they are \nsitting on large sums of money and not creating jobs and not investing. \nIt is because they don't know which regulation is coming down next that \nthey are going to have to comply with.\n  Please, I ask my colleagues and my friends, go ask the business \npeople and they will tell you that. They will tell you that the fear \nand specter of additional regulations has an incredibly\n\n[[Page S6567]]\n\nnegative affect on their desire to invest and hire. Lifting the \nprohibitions on offshore energy exploration will immediately create \njobs, drive investment, and reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign \nsources of oil.\n  According to the American Energy Alliance, which is a pro-exploratory \ngroup, admittedly, permanently lifting the offshore moratoria would \nresult in 1.2 million new U.S. jobs.\n  Of course, we need to give the President the fast track authority to \nnegotiate trade agreements. I point out that the President is now on \nhis ``listening tour,'' at taxpayers' expense. He was taking credit for \nthe passage of these three free-trade agreements for Panama, Colombia, \nand South Korea. It only took nearly 3 years.\n  As far as our bill is concerned, we have a statement from the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce:\n\n       Yesterday, a group of Senators, including John McCain, Rob \n     Portman and Rand Paul, introduced the ``Jobs Through Growth \n     Act.'' This legislation marks a departure from a ``government \n     knows best'' approach and instead empowers the private sector \n     to rescue our economy. As the Chamber outlined in its Six-\n     Point Jobs Plan, alleviating regulatory burdens, tax \n     uncertainty, and restoring confidence to invest and grow jobs \n     is the best way to get the country back on track. This bill \n     is a step in the right direction and includes a number of the \n     same broad ideas for creation as the Chamber's plan.\n\n  It goes on to say that ``comprehensive tax reform is critical to job \ncreation.'' They believe that reforming the regulatory process is \nnecessary for businesses to begin hiring again, and they also argue for \nthe expanded drilling offshore.\n  You will hear from various liberal think tanks that we don't create \njobs, that this is not a good thing to do, et cetera. But the fact is \nthe chamber of commerce, which I think well knows about job creation, \nshould be paid attention to.\n  A piece was written in the National Review Online by Douglas Holtz-\nEakin, a noted economist and former head of the OMB. In the interest of \nfull disclosure, he was an adviser of mine. He wrote the following:\n\n       Senate Republicans have just introduced the ``Real Jobs \n     Plan.'' As I've long argued, an effective jobs ``plan'' is a \n     commitment to a sustained environment for long-term growth. \n     The President's failed proposals have repeatedly proven that \n     ``temporary and targeted'' stimulus is insufficient. \n     Moreover, his latest effort displays more interest in \n     politics than growth.\n       Senators McCain, Paul, and Portman have proposed a plan \n     that effectively targets job creation at a time when we \n     desperately need it by incentivizing growth and repealing the \n     job-killing Affordable Care Act and Dodd-Frank law. There is \n     a lot here to like.\n       Still, inevitably, there will be a war of numbers in which \n     progressives trot out numbers from Keynesian business cycle \n     models to argue that the strategy won't work. To anticipate \n     the debate, here are some highlights of the Real Jobs Plan \n     and some estimates of the jobs impact:\n       1. Lower the corporate rate tax to 25 percent, resulting in \n     an additional 581,000 jobs per year, on average.\n       2. Reduce the tax on foreign earnings brought back to the \n     U.S., resulting in 2.9 million jobs.\n       3. Repeal Dodd-Frank, estimated to cost the U.S. 4.6 \n     million jobs by 2015.\n\n  On the so-called Dodd-Frank act, the whole purpose of the Dodd-Frank \nact was to make sure that no institution in America would ever be too \nbig to fail. My friends, tell me that these institutions aren't too big \nto fail. We know they have gotten bigger, and we know they are too big \nto fail. If we went through a similar crisis, we know, because of their \nsize, we would again be forced to use taxpayer dollars to bail them \nout. The fact is that the Dodd-Frank bill has been a complete failure, \nas many of us predicted. One of the reasons is because it didn't \naddress the phasing out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It was the \nhousing crisis that started this collapse, and until the day the \nhousing market stabilizes, we will not begin to emerge from this \nhorrible economic situation America finds itself in today.\n\n       4. Repeal the ACA, estimated to cost the U.S. economy at \n     least 800,000 jobs.\n       5. Lift the offshore drilling moratoria, resulting in 1.2 \n     million U.S. jobs.\n       6. Prohibit the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases, \n     estimated to cost the economy 1.4 million jobs by 2014.\n\n  And, of course, giving the President trade preference authority.\n  Finally, I will point this out in the Wall Street Journal Political \nDiary, October 14, 2011: Finally, a GOP Growth Plan.\n\n       Senators John McCain and Rand Paul [and Rob Portman] have \n     drafted an economic growth blueprint that they hope to be the \n     rallying cry of all congressional Republicans.\n       The White House and congressional Democrats hope to use the \n     Senate rejection of Obama jobs plan this week as a campaign \n     issue against ``do nothing Republicans.'' Senate Democrats \n     have crowed that ``Republicans have no jobs plan of their \n     own,'' but that's not true any longer. Senators John McCain \n     of Arizona and Rand Paul of Kentucky [and Rob Portman] have \n     drafted a comprehensive economic growth blueprint that they \n     hope will be the rallying cry of all congressional \n     Republicans in the weeks ahead. We obtained a copy of the \n     draft document which includes tax cuts, a balanced budget \n     amendment, ObamaCare repeal, and a regulatory freeze. . . .\n       The plan, which would cut corporate tax rates to 25 from 35 \n     is partially paid for by offering a reduced 5 percent tax on \n     repatriated capital. . . .\n       The plan won't get close to the 60 votes necessary in the \n     Senate. But it does establish a polar star for Republicans to \n     head toward. Republicans got a nice lift for the plan when a \n     Chamber of Commerce poll asked 1,300 business owners across \n     the country whether they support the GOP plan of ``permanent \n     tax cuts and less regulation,'' or the Democratic plan of \n     temporary payroll tax cuts and public work spending. More \n     than eight of 10 said they favor the Republican approach.\n\n  As they say, let the games begin. Today, the President of the United \nStates, in his visit to areas of the country that have a lot to do, in \nthe view of many, with the upcoming electoral calendar, attacked our \nplan and attacked it rather vociferously. In fact, I was somewhat taken \naback, since the President and his spokesperson had billed his trip as \na taxpayer-paid visit. In his remarks, the President was very strongly \ncondemning of the plan that we have put forward. In fact, remember, my \ncolleagues and friends, the President made these remarks on a taxpayer \npaid-for, riding-in-a-Canadian-bus visit for the next 3 days. This is \nwhat, on his listening tour, the President said:\n\n       Now it turns out that the Republicans have a plan, too. I \n     want to be fair. They call--they put forward this plan last \n     week. They called it the real American Jobs Act, the real \n     one. That's what they called it, just in case you were \n     wondering. So let's take a look at what the Republican \n     American Jobs Act looks like. Turns out that the Republican \n     plan boils down to a few basic ideas. They want to gut \n     regulations. They want to let Wall Street do whatever it \n     wants. They want to drill more, and they want to repeal \n     health care reform. That's their jobs plan.\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera. So on the taxpayer-paid dime, the President is \nnow traveling and attacking the Republican plan--obviously, I think, \nunfairly.\n  By the way, there is an article dated October 16 by Richard Wolfe in \nUSA Today:\n\n       President Obama will kick off a three-day bus trip through \n     small towns in politically competitive North Carolina and \n     Virginia Monday. But White House officials insist the trip is \n     about jobs, not votes. So much so, in fact, they convened a \n     conference call to reiterate that point several times, \n     pointing out that the trip is fully on the taxpayers' dime, \n     not the Republicans reelection campaign.\n\n  So the President has taken to the road, and he spent a number of \nminutes attacking our plan. I understand that. I think he has, \ncertainly in a political venue, the right and privilege to do that. I \nthink the question might be, though, is that appropriate on the \ntaxpayers' dime, since it is clearly campaigning. I must say again, I \nhave never seen an uglier bus than the Canadian one. He is traveling \naround on a Canadian bus touting American jobs.\n  One of the reasons Americans and I and my colleagues are a bit \nskeptical is because we have seen this movie before. We saw this movie \nbefore, and it feels a bit like something we have heard before. In \nfact, let me read a few quotes. We all know the failure of the last \nstimulus bill. We all know the President and his economic advisers \nsaid, if we passed the last stimulus bill, unemployment would be at a \nmaximum of 8 percent, and it is obviously, we all know, now stuck at \nover 9. They said it would create millions of jobs, but we all know it \ndidn't. They said it would stimulate our economy, and we know it \nhasn't. So let me read a couple quotes. This one was February 10, 2009, \nfrom President Obama:\n\n       It's a plan that will save or create up to four million \n     jobs over the next two years . . . and the jobs of \n     firefighters, teachers, nurses, and police officers that \n     would otherwise be eliminated if we don't provide states with \n     some relief.\n\n\n[[Page S6568]]\n\n\n  This is from President Obama during the middle of 2009:\n\n       We've created and saved, as you said, Joe, at least 150,000 \n     jobs.\n\n  This is a quote from Vice President Biden, where he said in ``18 \nmonths'' stimulus will ``create 3.5 million jobs . . . literally drop-\nkicks us out of this recession.''\n\n       This is a monumental project, but I think it's doable. But \n     I just think we got to stay on top (inaudible) and we got to \n     stay on top of that on a weekly basis. Because this is about \n     getting this out and spent in 18 months to create 3.5 million \n     jobs and do--to set--tee this up so the rest of the good work \n     that's being done here literally drop-kicks us out of this \n     recession and we begin to grow again and begin to employ \n     people again.\n\n  Those were the remarks of the Vice President at a Recover Plan \nImplementation Meeting held on February 25, 2009.\n  My alltime favorite quote is from August 24, 2009, from Vice \nPresident Biden:\n\n       In my wildest dreams, I never thought it would work this \n     well.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       In my wildest dreams, I never thought it would work this \n     well.\n\n  In my wildest dreams, I hope the American people will understand what \nwe are doing with the President's plan and that we will be voting on \npieces that probably even a simple majority of the Senate wouldn't have \nvoted for. It is the same thing they tried in 2009 and 2010 and was \nsteadfastly rejected by the American people in the overwhelming vote \nthat took place last November.\n  What I hope is that once the President gets off the campaign trail, \nwe will sit down and come to an agreement in some areas. All of us \nagree that simplification of the Tax Code is something the American \npeople want and deserve. All of us know we should try to do what we can \nto bring home that $1.4 trillion which is now parked overseas. All of \nus agree that offshore drilling is something we need to accelerate as \nquickly as possible and do it safely. All of us should agree that \nmiddle-income and lower income Americans are the ones who need help the \nmost.\n  While I am here, I would like to point out that one of the key \nelements we spent a lot of time on last year--many hours I spent on the \nfloor of this Senate--was trying to combat the program that is now \nknown as ObamaCare or health reform. We find out now that one of the \nkey elements of this health care reform--which I will politely call \nhealth care reform--was a program called the CLASS Act.\n  The CLASS Act was to provide long-term care for senior Americans, \nwhich is certainly a worthwhile goal. Thanks to a Member of the Senate, \nwho is no longer here, Senator Gregg, a provision was put in that said \nthe reality of the CLASS Act programs had to match the promises as a \nmatter of law. In other words, Health and Human Services had to provide \nan actuarial analysis of insurer solvency throughout the 75-year cost \nof the program. In other words, the Health and Human Services \nDepartment was bound by the amendment put through on the floor by \nSenator Gregg--the former Senator from New Hampshire. So after flailing \naround for 19 months, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nannounced it would shutter a voluntary long-term care insurance program \nthat was included in the health care law and throw the issue back to \nCongress.\n  It is unfortunate we did not have that same provision in the rest of \nthe bill; otherwise, the whole thing probably would have been junked by \nnow. But because of that amendment, the administration has been forced \nto junk the CLASS Act. Let me quote from the Wall Street Journal, which \nreads:\n\n       At a minimum the GOP could begin by repealing the Class \n     program altogether, since its legal authority is still \n     intact. ``One should never leave a partly loaded gun on the \n     table even if most of the chambers are empty or just has \n     blanks,'' writes the American Enterprise Institute's Tom \n     Miller. He also suggests attaching a few of the more \n     destructive provisions and forcing Democrats to defend them, \n     such as Mr. Orszag's Independent Payment Advisory Board of 15 \n     political appointees who have brought unaccountable powers to \n     control health care markets and health care.\n       Our suggestion is for a Gregg-like amendment that applies \n     to the entire health law and not simply Class. If reality \n     can't match the rhetoric that accompanied the bill--about \n     fiscal responsibility, bending the cost curve, keeping your \n     health care if you like your health care and all the other \n     false promises--then, legally, it should be repealed like \n     Class. Call it a truth-in-advertising clause. ObamaCare would \n     collapse in a heartbeat.\n\n  I hope we will begin to debate whether the CLASS Act--which now the \nHealth and Human Services Secretary has announced is undoable--should \nbe repealed from the law itself and whether there are other provisions \nsuch as that which Senator Gregg, in his foresight, was able to force \ninto the bill at the time of its passage.\n  By the way, a little more on the CLASS Act. One of the major reasons \nwhy it was included was to distort the numbers as to how much money \nwould or would not be saved in the passage of health care reform. \nBecause, clearly, for the first early years--since people would be \ncontributing rather than taking out funds because of retirement age--it \nwould appear to have a significant cost savings impact. Now we will be \ntalking about the real cost impact of the health care reform bill.\n  I hope in the weeks ahead we can engage in vigorous debate on how we \ncan move this country forward. There are clearly philosophical \ndifferences between the two sides, but I hope there are areas where we \ncan find common ground.\n  The housing crisis is still with us in America. I noticed an article \nover the weekend in the New York Times that Fannie Mae saw fit to send \na huge number of people to some convention in Chicago on the taxpayers' \ndime. Fannie and Freddie are still responsible for about 90 percent of \nthe mortgages in America--a corrupt institution. Yet Americans, \nincluding those in my State of Arizona, are still badly hurting.\n  I hope we can address the issues that affect this Nation. I hope we \ncan sit down together and work out at least some agreements--such as \nreform of the Tax Code and others--but, at the same time, we need to, \nat some point, address the housing issue in America. Until we do--until \nwe get housing costs stabilized in America--I greatly fear--and I see \nmy colleague from Florida whose State has also been very badly hurt by \nthis housing crisis--until we fix the fundamental problems, I fear we \nwill continue to experience very difficult economic times for our \ncitizens.\n  I note the presence of my colleague--the great astronaut and fine \nSenator--so I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I could spend my whole time \ntalking about the housing crisis--as the Senator from Arizona has so \nappropriately commented--that has hit his State and mine and many \nothers. I happen to agree it is going to be hard for us to recover \neconomically until we can start to work off this huge inventory of \nhouses out there and the dire economic straits it has put the owners of \nthose houses in.\n  It is a truth in America that so often our family assets are in our \nhome. When that home goes away--because you can't sell it or its value \nhas plummeted and the bank is coming after you and you can't get loans \nfor your small business--then people are going to be hurt. That is what \nis happening to our people right now.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question? I know he has \nanother subject he wants to address, but would he yield for a question?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Of course.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't one of the fundamental problems in the housing \ncrisis, in the Senator's State and my State and particularly \nCalifornia, Nevada, and others that were the crest of the wave, that we \nshould have made--and still should be making--an effort to give people \na mortgage they can afford to make the payments on rather than throwing \nthem out of their home or have the home empty?\n  Maricopa County, AZ, has the largest number of vacant homes of any \ncounty in America. I will bet in that top 10 list are counties in the \nState of Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Indeed, one of the areas hardest hit in the \nentire country is southwest Florida, in and around Fort Myers. I note \nthe Senator's comments are very accurate. We need to find a way for \npeople to stay in their homes, afford their payments, and see what that \ndoes not only for the individual homeowner but what it does\n\n[[Page S6569]]\n\nfor the neighborhood. It keeps people in the homes. The weeds don't \nstart growing. The values of the rest of the homes in the neighborhood \ndon't plummet because the house is now vacant and perhaps ransacked. \nThere is kind of a spiral downward when people are forced out.\n  So we need a program that would come in and make the mortgage as \naffordable as the homeowner can work out. Yet we find, in many cases, \nthe banks don't want to do that or there is not a governmental \nincentive for the banks or the homeowner to do that. We have missed out \non that.\n  Several years ago, when this crisis started, I implored the Secretary \nof the Treasury to look at exactly what was happening, and they came up \nwith a program whereby they were going to give some cushion of 5 \npercent of a mortgage that was underwater.\n  In the Senator's State and my State, if a home is just 5 percent \nunderwater, you are rather fortunate because a home today 20, 25, and \n30 percent underneath the value of the first mortgage is not uncommon. \nThat is the problem we have not addressed.\n  There have been some other good things. There are now programs coming \nout on small business, in trying to get money into small business. Even \nthough some of the banks did not want to take the Federal money, even \nthough it went to their capital, we are starting to see some signs of \nlife there. We are starting to see some signs of life, I am told by the \nFlorida Association of Realtors, that sales are occurring all over the \nState, not just certain parts of the State, such as Miami. There is a \nhuge influx of Brazilian investors coming in and absorbing the condo \nmarket. But it is not just Miami, it is the entire State that sales are \noccurring.\n  They are, of course, sales at rock-bottom prices, but they are \nbeginning to occur. We need to accelerate and give assistance to this \nrejuvenation of the real estate market. Until the housing market \nrecovers, we are not going to have an economic recovery out of this \nrecession.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6569-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     LAURA POLLAN, DAMAS DE BLANCO\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I came to the Senate floor \nbecause over the weekend a very noble lady in Cuba passed away of a \nheart attack, and I want to tell you about her.\n  Her name is Laura Pollan. She founded the group Ladies in White, \nDamas de Blanco. She did so to protest the brutal Castro regime in \nCuba, and her protest was specifically the jailing of 75 people in a \ncrackdown on dissidents in 2003, one of which was her husband. Many of \nthose who were imprisoned were married to the ones who became known as \nthe Ladies in White, including Senora Pollan's own husband, Hector \nMaseda.\n  Since 2003, Laura had gathered the group on most weekends in central \nHavana after church. Everybody would wear white and they would hold \ngladiolas, a flower that is typical in warm climates. They would stage \ntheir marches, and they would demand the release of their loved ones, \nsince 2003 when their husbands were jailed.\n  Damas de Blanco defied this brutal dictatorship, the Castro regime. \nFor its human rights work, the European Parliament awarded the group \nthe 2005 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. Just this year, the \nU.S. Government gave Damas de Blanco the Human Rights Defender Award \nfor ``exceptional valor in protecting human rights in the face of \ngovernment repression.''\n  Damas de Blanco succeeded earlier this year--succeeded. In the face \nof this brutal dictatorship, it succeeded when the last of the 75 \nimprisoned were finally released, including Laura's husband. She and \nher husband only had 8 months together before she died of a heart \nattack last week.\n  Despite this group's achievement, Laura Pollan lamented earlier this \nyear that:\n\n       As long as the government is around, there will be \n     prisoners . . . while they've let some go, they've put others \n     in jail. It is a never-ending story.\n\n  Mr. President, it is a never-ending story, and isn't it typical; here \nis a regime that still holds an American citizen there now for 2 years, \nAlan Gross. Alan Gross is in ill health. His daughter here in the \nStates has cancer. Is this regime showing any kind of compassion? Of \ncourse not. Did it show any kind of compassion to those Ladies in White \nand their husbands when they swept in, in the middle of the night, \nscooped them up and put them in prison because they dared to speak out \ntheir free thoughts?\n  It reminds us of another regime, one on the other side of the globe, \nIran, which still imprisons an American, Bob Levinson, a former FBI \nagent. They still deny they have him, and yet there is plenty of \nevidence they do have him. And yet we wait. In Bob Levinson's case, a \nwife and seven children wait, and have waited for years and years.\n  So we say, like Damas de Blanco--just like they said they will \ncontinue to challenge the regime until the day all the Cuban people are \nable to enjoy the blessings of freedom--that is all they want. It is so \nsad that because of the ties between America and Cuba, with so many \nfamilies having been split, with it being only 90 miles away from Key \nWest, there is a brutal dictatorial regime that still imprisons its \npeople. But there is one thing they can't imprison: they can't imprison \ntheir minds and their yearning for freedom.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded and that I be allowed to speak in morning \nbusiness for as much time as I may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, late last week the American taxpayer got \nsome very good news, and that was that the administration announced \nthey were not going to move forward with implementing the CLASS Act. It \nwas a stunning end for something many of us have believed is a fiscal \ntimebomb for our country. They acknowledged it is simply not workable. \nIn fact, HHS Secretary Katherine Sebelius said, ``Despite our best \nanalytical efforts, I do not see a viable path forward for CLASS \nimplementation at this time.''\n  The Washington Post went on to say that ``the Obama administration \ncut a major planned benefit from the 2010 law on Friday, announcing \nthat a program to offer Americans insurance for long-term care was \nsimply unworkable.''\n  The Hill reported that ``HHS officials acknowledged that CLASS fell \napart simply because it was too flawed to salvage.''\n  From Politico: `` . . . a stunning end to a financially troubled \nlong-term care insurance program and a major setback to the health care \nreform law.''\n  Even the New York Times editorialized that ``it was too costly and \nwould not work.''\n  This is good news for the American taxpayer. This is something many \nof us argued was the conclusion that inevitably people would come to, \nwhen this was discussed and debated as part of the health care reform \nbill over a year ago. In fact, on December 4, 2009, I offered an \namendment to repeal the CLASS Act.\n  It was then offered as one of the pay-fors for the President's health \ncare reform bill. At that time, it was said it would generate somewhere \non the order of $70 billion in additional revenue that could be used to \npay for the health care bill. More recent estimates of that number are \nsomewhere in the order of $86 billion that would be generated in the \nfirst 10 years. One of the reasons for that was, of course, people \nwould begin to pay premiums even though they would not start demanding \nbenefits until later. Even at that time, there was tremendous concern \nthat this would run up deficits, blow up deficits in the outyears when \nyou got outside of that 10-year window; that after people were through \npaying their premiums and started demanding benefits, this would get \ninto sort of a downward death spiral and would never pay for itself. \nThat was a conclusion many people were drawing already, at the time, \nthat there was such a rush to pass health care reform through here and \nto come up with ways to pay for it, that\n\n[[Page S6570]]\n\nthis ill-fated program was included. It was interesting because that \namendment I offered back in December 2009 actually had pretty broad \nbipartisan support. At that time, every Republican voted for the \namendment and 12 Democrats as well. We had a majority of Senators--51 \nSenators said in December 2009 that we ought to repeal the CLASS Act \nfrom the underlying health care bill simply because it was not workable \nand it was going to run up deficits in the outyears and everybody knew \nit. Instead, we proceeded and plowed forward, and the health care bill \nwas going to be passed irrespective of concerns that had been raised by \nmany of us but, more importantly, also by people who really study these \nthings, people in the Congressional Budget Office, the Actuary at the \nHealth and Human Services Department. There were a lot of warnings \ngoing forward about this program and what a bad idea it really was.\n  It is time that we be honest with the American people about this \nparticular budget gimmick. I can't help but think that if we had come \nto this conclusion a long time ago, we would have saved some money when \nlooking at whether this could be implemented, whether it could actually \nwork. The inevitable conclusion is that it would not.\n  I want to read for my colleagues something that was stated by the \nActuary at the Health and Human Services Department way back in 2009. \nIn fact, this goes back to July 2009, well before the final vote \noccurred on the health care reform bill, particularly the vote on the \namendment that would have stripped this provision from the health care \nreform bill. The Actuary at the Health and Human Services Department, \nMr. Richard Foster, said:\n\n       I'm sorry to report that I remain very doubtful that this \n     proposal is sustainable at the specified premium and benefit \n     amounts . . . 36 years of actuarial experience lead me to \n     believe that this program would collapse in short order and \n     require significant federal subsidies to continue.\n\n  That was from the Actuary at the Health and Human Services \nDepartment.\n  Later that year, in the August-September timeframe, he said:\n\n       As you know, I continue to be convinced that the CLASS \n     proposal is not actuarially sound.\n\n  I believe these are statements by somebody who had looked closely at \nthis program and had come to the right conclusion way back then--that \nit flat was not going to work. Yet, because of the mad rush to pass \nhealth care reform and to argue to the American people that somehow it \nwas going to be paid for, this particular program was included. It \nclearly was a colossal mistake. Fortunately, it looks as though the \nadministration has concluded the same. Hopefully we can get this killed \nonce and for all so that it doesn't become a drain on our children and \ngrandchildren, which it, of course, would when the bills started to \npile up in those outyears and the deficits started to mount.\n  If you think about the fact that every American today owns about \n$48,000 of the Federal debt--I mean, for most Americans the Federal \ndebt is like having a second mortgage or, for that matter, a first \nmortgage on their homes. They have an enormous amount of debt for which \nthey are responsible. Instead of looking at ways to reduce that debt, \nreduce the size of government, and get spending under control, \nWashington, DC, continues to look for ways to expand government and to \nadd to the amount of debt we are passing on to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Last week, when the announcement was made by the administration that \nthis program is simply not workable and they are not going to implement \nit, it was a huge victory for the American taxpayer and a huge victory \nfor our children and grandchildren--future generations of Americans who \nwould end up having to pay for this. If you think about the fact that \nwe already have somewhere along the lines of $60 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities in other entitlement programs, piling on yet another one \nseems to be digging the hole ever deeper than it already is. What you \ndo not want to do when you are in a deep hole is keep digging, and this \nplan, the CLASS plan, would have kept digging that hole even deeper for \nour children and grandchildren.\n  Interestingly enough, this was the analysis that was done by Health \nand Human Services when they came to the conclusion that it should not \nbe implemented. Now, as you can see, this is a volume that is several \ninches thick, so obviously they looked very carefully at this. \nUnfortunately, they came to that conclusion 19 months later than they \nshould have. But this is what they came up with in terms of concluding \nthat the CLASS program would not work. So, having done that analysis, \none would think the next logical conclusion would be, let's repeal this \npiece of legislation. Let's get this off the books. Yet the \nadministration is still talking about and still somehow wedded to the \nidea that somehow this might work, so they are saying they don't want \nto see it repealed.\n  Well, Senator McCain, my colleague from Arizona, was down here \nearlier today talking about this program and this report, and he is a \ncosponsor, as I am, of a piece of legislation we put forward to repeal \nthe CLASS Act. We will work as quickly as we can to put together \nlegislation, now that we have this report from HHS, that will actually \nmove forward with the intention to repeal this. But it strikes me that \nthis is something most of my colleagues, given what we know now, should \nbe willing to support, and especially given the fact that there were 12 \nDemocrats who voted with the Republicans back in December 2009, to \nconstitute a majority here in the Senate. There were 51 Senators who \nvoted to repeal the CLASS Act from the health care bill back in \nDecember 2009 before all of this analysis came out. So now that we have \nthis analysis in front of us, it seems to me that the logical thing we \nshould do is to move forward with repealing this piece of legislation.\n  It is interesting; when we were debating in the Senate back in \nDecember 2009, many of my colleagues in the Senate said things about \nthe CLASS Act that were very supportive; that they actually, I guess, \nbelieved this was going to work. I will not mention names to protect \nthe guilty, but they called it a breakthrough. Some referred to it as a \n``win-win.'' Others referred to it as ``critical.'' One of my \ncolleagues said: So we get a lot of bangs for the buck, as one might \nsay, with the CLASS Act that we have in this bill. Another one of my \ncolleagues said: One of the critical pieces of the bill is the \nCommunity Living Assistance Services and Supports Act, or the CLASS \nAct. Another one said: The CLASS plan is a win-win. One went so far as \nto suggest that certain colleagues on our side of the aisle who argued \nthat the CLASS plan would lead to a financially unstable entitlement \nprogram that would rapidly increase the deficit--he went on to say that \nwas simply not accurate.\n  There are many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who at \nthe time believed wrongly this was going to work. I hope, now that we \nhave this voluminous copy of the analysis done by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, they will join with us in repealing this \nreally bad piece of legislation and get it off the books once and for \nall. We have 32 cosponsors on a bill that would do that. I hope that \nwe, at the very first opportunity--and perhaps that will be even \nsometime this week--in the legislation we are considering now, could \nhave an amendment that would repeal the CLASS Act so we can put this \nissue to bed once and for all for the American people.\n  It seems to me, with the kinds of year-over-year deficits we are \nrunning--$1.3 trillion, $1.4 trillion deficits--the very least we can \ndo is take something we know is not going to work and focus on those \nthings that actually will work. We ought to be talking right now about \nthat which will reduce government spending, make the Federal Government \nsmaller, expand the private economy, and look at what we can do to \ncreate jobs.\n  I am not suggesting for a minute that the issue of long-term care is \nnot important; it is. There are right ways and wrong ways to deal with \nthat. The CLASS Act represented the very worst way to deal with that; \nthat is, to come up with a program that has been described as a \ndownward death spiral and actually add to the debt we are going to pass \non to our children and grandchildren, knowing full well this program \nwould not pay for itself. It is a farce. It was never going to reduce \nthe deficit. We now have that demonstrated in this analysis that has\n\n[[Page S6571]]\n\nbeen done. So I hope my colleagues here in the Senate on both sides of \nthe aisle will come together and recognize that and repeal once and for \nall this very bad piece of legislation.\n  It was good news when the administration recognized they couldn't \nimplement it, it was not workable. It would be better news for the \nAmerican taxpayers and for future generations of Americans if the \nCongress would repeal this legislation and do it soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Tennessee, I be \nrecognized in morning business.

Mr. President, last month several Republican Senators \ncame to the floor and offered legislation to fix No Child Left Behind, \nthe legislation that was passed nearly 10 years ago to try to address \nour Nation's 100,000 public schools. In that legislation, we sought to \nfix problems with the legislation, not just to create another big \nreauthorization bill. The ideas we had were not all our ideas. They \nincluded many ideas from President Obama and his excellent Education \nSecretary, Secretary Duncan, as well as Democratic and Republican \nMembers of Congress. They included having more realistic goals for No \nChild Left Behind. The original goal set in 2001 would, according to \nSecretary Duncan, create an unworkable situation where 80,000 of the \n100,000 schools might be identified as failing in the next few years.\n  A second goal of our legislation was to move decisions about deciding \nwhether schools and teachers were succeeding or failing out of \nWashington, DC, and back to State and local governments. A lot has \nhappened in the last 10 years in the States--really the last 20 or 25 \nbut especially in the last 10 years. We have better reporting \nrequirements from No Child Left Behind. We have new State common \nstandards, higher academic standards. We have new State tests that have \nbeen created--not here but by the States to do that. And now States are \nworking together to create accountability systems. So there is a much \nbetter chance that States and local school districts can create an \nenvironment where students learn what they need to know and be able to \ndo.\n  Our legislation encourages States to create what I think is the holy \ngrail of public education; that is, principal-teacher evaluation \nrelated to student achievement. I know from experience that is hard to \ndo. In 1983 and 1984, when I was Governor of Tennessee, we became the \nfirst State to pay teachers more for teaching well. It took us a year \nand a half and a huge battle with the National Education Association in \norder to put it in place, but 10,000 teachers became master teachers. \nIt was a good first step. Tennessee is already doing it again.\n  Here is my local newspaper: Evaluation of teachers contentious. There \nis nothing more contentious, and the last thing we need is Washington \nsticking its nose into that, other than to create an environment where \nState and local governments can use Federal money to pay for their own \nState and local programs. We propose consolidating programs, making it \neasier for school districts to transfer Federal money and expand \nchoices and expand charter schools.\n  Now, today, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate education \ncommittee--the HELP Committee, as we call it--have introduced another \ndraft piece of legislation to fix No Child Left Behind. I intend to \nvote to move this bill out of committee, although it is not yet the \nkind of legislation that I would be willing to vote to send to the \nPresident, but it is a good place to start.\n  There is a good deal of agreement in terms of what we want to do in \nour legislation from a few weeks ago and the Harkin-Enzi bill. Among \nthe agreements is moving decisions about whether schools are succeeding \nor failing out of Washington. Another is to encourage principal-teacher \nevaluation without mandating, defining, and regulating it from \nWashington, DC. Another good provision is to encourage but not define \nand mandate and regulate using measures of growth of students--not just \nwhether they achieved something but whether they are making rapid \nprogress toward a goal. The idea is to make that in terms of whether \nschools and students are succeeding.\n  There are many provisions in the Harkin-Enzi bill that have been \nsuggested by both Democrats and Republicans, but there are a number of \nprovisions--not in our legislation--that I don't support, and I am \ngoing to seek to amend them. I have indicated to Senators that I intend \nto offer seven amendments which, in my view, would take out of the \nlegislation provisions that tend to create a national school board. One \nis the so-called achievement gap. One is the so-called highly qualified \nteachers provision. These are all provisions that substitute the \njudgment of people in Washington for that of mayors, local school \nboards, governors, and legislators. So I don't think we need a national \nschool board, and neither do most Americans.\n  Some will say: Well, then, why would you support a bill that you \ndon't entirely agree with? The reason is we have a process in Congress. \nThis isn't like the health care bill a few years ago when we had 40 \nRepublican Senators and Speaker Pelosi was in charge of the House of \nRepresentatives. We now have 47 Republican Senators, we have a \nRepublican House of Representatives, and we need to get started fixing \nthis problem. We need to do something a little different around here. \nInstead of just beating our chests, we need to find a way to put our \nheads together, head toward a reasonable result, come up with a \nsolution, and offer it to the President and to the American people.\n  There is no reason in the world why we can't, with the amount of \nagreement we already have, send to the President by Christmas \nlegislation fixing No Child Left Behind. We should do it because if we \ndon't, Congress's inaction will mean we will transform the U.S. \nEducation Secretary into a waiver-granting czar for 80,000 schools in \nthis country which, according to this law, will be identified as \nfailing.\n  Well, if we were to have an education czar, or if we were to have a \nchairman of a national education school board, Secretary Arne Duncan \nwould be a good one. But I don't think we want one in the United States \nof America. So I think we should act before Christmas in order to avoid \ncreating a waiver education czar, and we should act before Christmas in \na way that does not create a national school board.\n  There is one other suggestion I would make to the authors of this \nbill. In our earlier meetings with the President, Congressman George \nMiller of California, who was a key leader in developing No Child Left \nBehind, said this bill to fix No Child Left Behind ought to be a lean \nbill. I agree with Congressman Miller. The legislation Republicans \nintroduced a few weeks ago totaled 221 pages in its five bills. The \ncomparable section of the Harkin-Enzi draft is 517 pages. I urge us to \nfollow Congressman Miller's advice in the final result and be much more \nsuccinct than that.\n  So despite these concerns, I will vote on Wednesday or Thursday, \nwhenever we finish, in favor of bringing this base bill out of the HELP \nCommittee and on to the Senate floor where we can have full amendments. \nI am going to do my best to improve it in committee and on the Senate \nfloor to make it more like the legislation we introduced a month ago. I \nam going to continue to do that in the conference we have with the \nHouse of Representatives. I think it is time we recognize the American \npeople expect us to step up to major issues, to put our best ideas \ntogether, and come up with a result. We are part way there. There is a \ngood place to start.\n  I thank Senator Harkin and Senator Enzi for the work they have done, \nas well as Representative Kline and Representative Miller, and I thank \nthe President and Secretary Duncan for their attitude. I look forward \nto working with them to come to a conclusion.\n  One last thing: We talk a lot about jobs around here. Every American \nknows better schools mean better jobs, and they all know schools are a \nlot like\n\n[[Page S6572]]\n\njobs. We can't create them from Washington, but we can create an \nenvironment in which people in their own communities, and families and \nStates can create better schools and better jobs. This is a good place \nto start.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter of support which also outlines my objections to the \nlegislation that was introduced today, and a copy of an article from \nthe Maryville Alcoa Daily Times today which reminds us of how difficult \nit is to evaluate teachers fairly and how wise we would be if we \nsatisfied ourselves with creating an environment in which that could \nhappen but did not mandate it, define it, and regulate it from \nWashington, DC.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 16, 2011.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor & \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Tom and Mike: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     participate in discussions about fixing the problems with No \n     Child Left Behind.\n       I support your base bill (the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Reauthorization Act of 2011) as a first step in the \n     right direction that will enable our Health, Education, Labor \n     and Pensions (HELP) Committee to start working now to fix the \n     problems with No Child Left Behind. I will vote to move it \n     out of committee, although it is not yet legislation that I \n     could vote in favor of sending to the President.\n       I have attached a summary of 7 amendments I will offer. \n     Most of these are intended to stop the legislation from \n     creating a national school board that would substitute its \n     judgment for that of governors, state legislatures, mayors, \n     local school board members, parents, principals and teachers. \n     Hopefully, substitute language including these amendments \n     will be the final product of our legislative work.\n       Despite these misgivings, I believe the HELP Committee \n     should start now with this base bill and try to move an \n     improved bill to the Senate floor where there needs to be a \n     full and complete amendment process to further improve it and \n     send it to a conference with the House of Representatives.\n       There is no reason why Congress should not be able to send \n     legislation fixing No Child Left Behind to the President by \n     Christmas. If Congress does not act now, our inaction will \n     transform the U.S. Secretary of Education into a waiver-\n     granting czar over an unworkable law that has identified what \n     he says may be as many as 80,000 ``failing'' public schools, \n     a development even worse than provisions in this draft that \n     would make him a chairman of a national school board. If we \n     were to have such a czar or chairman, Arne Duncan would be a \n     good one, but I do not believe that we should have one in our \n     country.\n       The strengths of the base bill are that it moves most \n     decisions about whether schools are succeeding or failing out \n     of Washington and back to states and communities. It keeps \n     the valuable reporting requirements of No Child Left Behind. \n     It should help to produce an environment in which states and \n     school districts are more likely to create principal teacher \n     evaluation systems related to student achievement. It will \n     encourage schools to recognize growth in student academic \n     achievement as well as grade-level performance. The base bill \n     further includes many good provisions suggested by Secretary \n     Duncan and congressional Republicans, as well as Democrats.\n       The base bill's main weakness is that it contains \n     provisions that would transform the U.S. Secretary of \n     Education into chairman of a national school board. Chief \n     among these problems are federal mandates, definitions and \n     regulations for identifying ``achievement gap'' schools and \n     the ``continuous improvement'' of all 100,000 public schools. \n     Although the draft eliminates the concept of ``Adequate \n     Yearly Progress'' for 95% of schools, these provisions \n     attempt to reinstate it through the back door. In addition, \n     the bill retains in Washington, DC decisions about whether \n     our 3.2 million teachers are ``highly qualified'' or not. It \n     does not sufficiently consolidate programs and actually \n     creates several new ones that have no real chance of ever \n     being funded. And it does little to make it easier for local \n     school districts to transfer and use federal funds more \n     efficiently or to simplify the burdensome Peer Review process \n     for state plans that must be submitted to the U.S. Department \n     of Education.\n       There is one other important flaw: the bill is wordy. It is \n     at least 860 pages. When several of us met with President \n     Obama to discuss fixing No Child Left Behind, we agreed to \n     take Congressman George Miller's advice to produce ``a lean \n     bill.'' The five bills offered last month by Senators \n     Isakson, Burr, Kirk and I, along with several other \n     Republican Senators, totaled 221 pages. The comparable \n     sections of your draft total 517 pages. We can be more \n     succinct than that.\n       Despite these concerns, I will vote in favor of this base \n     bill being reported out of the HELP Committee and look \n     forward to working with you and our colleagues in the Senate \n     and House to improve the bill so that the President can sign \n     it into law this year.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lamar Alexander.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Daily Times (Maryville, TN), Oct. 17, 2011]\n\n     Growing Pains: Blount Schools Strugle With Teacher Evaluation\n\n                          (By Matthew Stewart)\n\n       Blount County Schools have experienced some difficulties in \n     implementing the state's teacher evaluation model, and \n     educators want state lawmakers to give them a voice in the \n     process.\n       ``We don't mind accountability, but it has to be fair,'' \n     said Grady Caskey, who serves as the Blount County Education \n     Association's president. ``The system has to be based on \n     achievable expectations and goals.''\n       Blount County Schools is using the Tennessee Educator \n     Acceleration Model (TEAM), which was developed by the state \n     Department of Education. Alcoa City Schools and Maryville \n     City Schools are using the Teacher Instructional Growth for \n     Effectiveness and Results (TIGER) model, which was developed \n     by the Association of Independent and Municipal Schools,\n       Both Alcoa and Maryville field-tested evaluation models. \n     However, Blount County didn't field-test a model.\n       Many county educators have become frustrated with TEAM's \n     implementation, Caskey said. ``People are throwing up their \n     hands and saying, ``I'm done.'' Teachers are asking more and \n     more about early retirement requirements, We have two \n     seasoned teachers who are retiring mid-year. Several more are \n     considering it. We're losing our best, most experienced \n     teachers.''\n       BCEA has learned about many implementation problems, he \n     said.\n       Blount County's principals haven't set uniform \n     requirements, Caskey said. ``Some are requiring lesson plans \n     for the entire school year. Others are only requiring \n     observation plans, which is what the law actually requires. I \n     recently received an email from a teacher who puts his kids \n     to bed at 8 p.m. then writes lesson plans until midnight or 1 \n     a.m.''\n       Educators also don't have a template for their lesson \n     plans, he said. ``They've got several different versions \n     floating around. It's causing a lot of busy work. I thought \n     the governor said this was going to be less paperwork. We're \n     drowning in it.''\n       Educators need to start talking with lawmakers about the \n     evaluation process, Caskey said. ``TEAM is counterproductive. \n     I know we can identify better ways to improve teachers. \n     Legislators are going to have to change it. Politics got us \n     into this mess, and politics will get us out. Education isn't \n     a business. We're not an assembly line. We're not turning out \n     widgets but humans.''\n\n\n                           students in limbo\n\n       Many educators are also worried about the evaluation model.\n       ``TEAM has some good points,'' said Rebecca Dickenson, who \n     is Eagleton Elementary School's librarian. ``However, it was \n     implemented in a huge hurry without enough explanation for \n     teachers and principals.''\n       ``It's left teachers in limbo with their kids,'' said Mark \n     Williamson, who teaches social studies at William Blount High \n     School. ``Principals are trying their best, but things are \n     constantly changing.''\n       Williamson, a former BCEA president who currently serves on \n     the executive board, thinks the evaluation model has affected \n     his students academically. ``I spent 15 hours working on a \n     lesson plan for my first evaluation. At the end of the day, \n     it took 15 hours away from my kids. I couldn't plan ahead, \n     find updated information or seek out current events such as \n     the Arab Spring, I was trying to do what I needed to do \n     according to the lesson plan.''\n       Teacher morale has been impacted as well, he said.\n       ``I haven't seen my principal as much,'' said Dickenson, \n     who also serves as BCEA's vice president. ``I'm used to her \n     walking through the library and getting the opportunity to \n     see what I'm doing in class. However, she's been inundated \n     with evaluations this year.''\n       Lawmakers need to lessen the workload for observers, she \n     said.\n\n\n                           resolving problems\n\n       School officials are working to address teacher concerns, \n     said Director of Schools Rob Britt. ``It hasn't been \n     implemented consistently across the state. So, you're going \n     to see these things in every system. We're personally \n     experiencing a lot of growing pains.''\n       Britt and Dr. Jane Morton, supervisor of instruction for \n     grades 6-12, organized two forums with teachers before fall \n     break. They gathered input and created a list of nearly 35 \n     concerns.\n       School officials are seeking answers from the state \n     Department of Education, Britt said. ``I know teachers are \n     concerned about TEAM, and I am as well. We're making efforts \n     to try to get answers for teachers and get more direction for \n     principals. We're very sensitive to teacher concerns. It's \n     high stakes, and we're performing our due diligence for \n     them.''\n       School officials are also working to create supports for \n     teachers, he said. ``We want to keep our teachers. We want to \n     support them and help them grow. We're committed as \n     administrators to making it as palatable as possible.''\n\n[[Page S6573]]\n\n       The school district's observers will require more training, \n     Britt said. ``Most are implementing the way that they were \n     trained. The state didn't provide exhaustive training. It was \n     more surface-level, which was a good beginning. However, it \n     wasn't thorough. We need more follow-up in a timely manner.''\n\n\n                              future plans\n\n       The state Department of Education is currently evaluating \n     TEAM.\n       State officials are committed to gathering feedback that \n     will help determine where the evaluation model needs \n     revision, and stakeholders are providing input through \n     several channels.\n       The Tennessee Consortium on Research, Evaluation and \n     Development (TN CRED) is launching a statewide survey in \n     spring 2012 and conducting focus groups throughout the year, \n     State officials are also traveling across the state to meet \n     with stakeholders.\n       The state Department of Education's Advisory Group will \n     bring revision recommendations to Education Commissioner \n     Kevin Huffman, Based on the proposed revisions, the \n     recommendations might need to be brought before the State \n     Board of Education.\n\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Oklahoma \nfor giving me the courtesy of speaking, and I thank him again for the \nwork he has done on the Foreign Relations Committee, Subcommittee on \nEast Asian Affairs, where he is the ranking Republican, and the other \nwork he has done on the Armed Services Committee.\n  Today I rise to speak about the National Criminal Justice Commission \nlegislation which I introduced more than 2 years ago and which the \nleader and the managers of this bill are now going to offer as an \namendment to the pending legislation. First of all, I thank the leader \nand the managers of the bill for calling up this legislation. I also \nthank my principal Republican cosponsor, Senator Lindsey Graham, for \nall the work he has done.\n  There are good national commissions and bad national commissions and \nredundant national commissions and sometimes there are national \ncommissions which are not only needed but vital to the resolution of \nissues we face.\n  I am thinking, as I speak, of the first Commission on Wartime \nContracting which Senator Claire McCaskill and I introduced 4 years ago \nand which resulted in a finding of approximately $30 billion in fraud, \nwaste, and abuse in contracts that had gone to Iraq and Afghanistan and \nwhich provided a model for the way we should be approaching such \ncontracts in the future. I would put this particular national \ncommission in that category. It was put together after much thought and \nmany hearings. It is paid for, it is sunsetted at 18 months, and it is \ndedicated to helping us resolve an issue of very serious national \npurpose.\n  I began on this issue before I came to the Senate--the issue of the \nimbalance in our criminal justice system and the need to bring a \ncomprehensive resolution in terms of how we handle crime and reentry in \nthis country. We have had more than 2\\1/2\\ years of hearings since I \ncame to the Senate. After I introduced this legislation, we met--at \nstaff levels, since I am not on the Judiciary Committee--with \nrepresentatives from more than 100 different organizations across the \ncountry and across the philosophical spectrum.\n  This chart is an indication of the type of support we have received \nfor this commission. I will not read the names, and I don't expect \nanyone viewing the TV screen to be able to read all the names, but this \nis an unusual circumstance. We have organizations as philosophically \ndiverse as the ACLU, the NAACP, the Sentencing Project, the National \nOrganization for Victim Assistance, the ABA Criminal Justice Section, \nthe National Center for Victims of Crime, along with the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the National Sheriffs Association, and the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, which all agree we need \nto step forward and examine our criminal justice system in a \ncomprehensive way, from point of apprehension to point of return, so \nthat we make better use of our assets and make better use of our own \npeople, quite frankly.\n  Today we incarcerate more people than any other country in the \nWestern world or in any known country in the world. We have 2.3 million \npeople in our prisons and jails and another 5 million people on \nprobation or in some way under postcorrectional management. Hundreds of \nthousands of people are being released from jails and prisons every \nyear and reentering society, and at this point we are without a \ncomprehensive structure that will allow those who wish to become \nproductive citizens again the opportunity to have the right kind of \ntransition.\n  At the same time, we have 7 million people under some form of \ncorrectional supervision or in prisons and we don't feel any safer. \nThis is the other beam our analysis has ridden as we looked at this. \nEven today, if we ask Americans, two-thirds of the people in this \ncountry believe crime is more prevalent today than it was a year ago.\n  So we were tasked--we tasked ourselves--with looking at this problem \nto try to figure out how we can do a better job of addressing the issue \nof criminal justice, spending less money. We are now in a situation \nwhere State and local budgets have been stretched to the breaking \npoint. Professor Western of Harvard estimates that annual correctional \nspending right now is about $70 billion, with State spending on \ncorrections increasing 40 percent over the past 20 years.\n  We are witnessing a war on our border with respect to gang warfare. \nSince President Calderon launched an offensive against drug gangs and \ncartels in 2006, tens of thousands of people have died in drug \ntrafficking violence along the border. It is estimated that these \ncartels are now operating in more than 230 cities and towns in the \nUnited States. These entities need to be examined in the context of \ntransnational gang activity as they relate to our criminal justice \nsystem.\n  We are also largely housing our Nation's mentally ill in our prison \nsystem. The number of mentally ill in prison right now is nearly five \ntimes the number of mentally ill in inpatient mental hospitals. Noted \nexperts have cited jails and prisons as the No. 1 holding facility for \nthe mentally ill.\n  So the conclusion we reached, after listening to dozens of \nrepresentatives from different organizations across the philosophical \nspectrum, was that we need to have a long-overdue, top-to-bottom, \nbeginning-to-end examination of how the criminal justice system works \nin the United States from point of apprehension to the decision of \nwhether to arrest. And, if arrested, what sort of port does a person go \ninto? How long should that person be in prison? What should prison \nadministration look like, and how could that be better adapted? What \nmodels do we have out there that can be applied? What should reentry \nprograms look like, and how do we deal with the ever-increasing \nproblems of transnational gangs? We need to examine all of those pieces \ntogether.\n  The last review of this nature that was undertaken was done in 1965 \nby President Lyndon Johnson. So I introduced the National Criminal \nJustice Act, the goal of which is to create a blue ribbon national \ncommission, time sunsetted--18 months--to get the finest minds in the \ncountry together to examine these different pieces and to come back to \nthe Congress with specific recommendations for reforming our national \ncriminal justice system.\n  Just last week, in a meeting of the Senate law Enforcement Caucus, \nPhiladelphia Police Chief Charles Ramsey noted the tremendous influence \nof this last commission's report, which was reported in 1967--44 years \nago--and voiced strong support for the creation of a new commission. We \nare long overdue to look at what works and what doesn't in our criminal \njustice system.\n  This bill has, quite frankly, struck a nerve across the country. I \nhave heard from citizens across all 50 States in support of this \ninitiative. I mentioned\n\n[[Page S6574]]\n\nthe list of supporting organizations, including judges, lawyers, \npolice, public health officials, educators, academics, prisoners, civil \nrights organizations, and people who are simply concerned about making \nour criminal justice system better, more fair, and more adaptable to \nsolving the issues of the true criminal population in the United \nStates.\n  So, again, I express my appreciation to Majority Leader Reid for \nworking with the managers of this bill and bringing this amendment to \nthe pending legislation, and I trust that it will be a \nnoncontroversial, $5 million, paid-for study that will, in the end, \nhelp us resolve the many fallacies that now pervade our criminal \njustice system.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6574-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6574-S6575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LORD'S RESISTANCE ARMY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am here today to clear up a lot of \nmisunderstandings that are floating around the country concerning the \ndecision to have some of our troops--not combat, but some of our \ntroops--go into sections of Eastern and Central Africa to cooperate \nwith about five countries that have been trying, for 25 years, to \neradicate the Lord's Resistance Army and their leader whose name is \nJoseph Kony.\n  It has disturbed me quite a bit over the years that not many people \ncare about Africa. I can remember back when President Clinton was in \noffice that at that time I objected to sending troops into Bosnia and \nKosovo because he was using as a reason to do that ethnic cleansing, \nand I said at that time, here at this desk on the floor: Why is he \nconcerned about ethnic cleansing in Bosnia when on any one given day in \nany one country in Africa--at that time it was mostly in west Africa, \nand I used Sierra Leone as an example--in any one day there are 100 \npeople more who are being ethnically cleansed in Africa than there are \nbeing ethnically cleansed in the same day in Bosnia or in Kosovo. But \nnobody cared.\n  Fortunately, that changed when 9/11 came and people realized there \nwas a serious problem. When our country was attacked, it became evident \nthat we needed to take action against terrorists in the Middle East. As \nthe Middle East was squeezed many of the extremists would move south \nthrough Djibouti, through the Horn of Africa. So, wisely, we decided--\nand it was mostly the decision by the Senate Armed Services Committee, \non which I serve--we would assist Africa in developing five African \nbrigades located north, south, east, west, and central. That has been \nundertaken, not as rapidly as I wish it were, but, nonetheless, that is \nhappening. The recognition there is, as terrorism goes down through \nAfrica, if they are prepared--and I am talking about the Africans--to \nhandle that terrorism and to stop that terrorism as it comes in, then \nwe will not have to send our troops in.\n  That is essentially what happened last week when the President \ndecided to send these troops into the north central part of Africa to \naddress the problem with the Lord's Resistance Army, or the LRA, and \nJoseph Kony.\n  The past few days have been kind of interesting, Rush Limbaugh \nyesterday talked about this issue, and somebody brought it to my \nattention. Even though I disagreed, I do not disagree with him as often \nas some on the other side do. But he made a statement. I am quoting \nnow:\n\n       Now, up until today, most Americans have never heard of the \n     Lord's Resistance Army. And here we are at war with them.\n\n  Well, it is not true.\n\n       Have you ever heard of [them]?\n\n  He talked about it with three people who are always in his studio: \nDawn and Brian and Snerdley.\n\n       Have you ever heard of [the] Lord's Resistance Army, Dawn?\n\n  ``No.''\n\n       How about you, Brian?\n\n  ``No.''\n\n       Snerdley, have you?\n\n  ``No.''\n\n       You never heard of [the] Lord's Resistance Army? Well, that \n     proves my contention, most Americans have never heard of it, \n     and here we are at war with them.\n\n  Let me clarify, and in a minute I will talk about what their mission \nis there. We are not at war with them. In fact, we are specifically \nprecluding our troops from any kind of combat in that area. But I wish \nto put it in proper context as to the significance of this.\n  I have had an opportunity to spend a lot of time in Africa--more than \nany other Member of this U.S. Senate, or any other Member of any other \nSenate even before this. I have had many conversations over the last 15 \nyears with President Museveni of Uganda and his First Lady Janet about \nthe problem.\n  It all started in northern Uganda. In the 1980s Alice Lakwena had a \ndream in which she was told to overthrow the government of Uganda. \nAlice founded the Ugandan ``Holy Spirit Movement'' and led a group of \nrebels against the government. Eventually, Alice was exiled and, her \ncousin, Joseph Kony took over her group. What happened was, Joseph \nKony, who fancies himself a spiritual leader, has gone in and started \nbuilding--you can call them a number of different things: a children's \narmy or the ``invisible'' children--but to go in and build this massive \narmy of young people--I am talking about kids from the age of 12, 13, \n14 years old; young kids--he goes out and abducts them from villages. \nThen they come in, and they teach them how to operate AK-47s, how to \njoin this army he has put together. If they do not do it, or if they \nfail in their training, then they are mutilated.\n  I will show you a chart in the Chamber with a series of pictures. \nThese are young kids. These pictures give you an idea of how young they \nare: 11, 12, 13 years old, with AK-47s. That is what their army looks \nlike. See that little kid there, he is 11 years old. This one in this \nother picture is 12 years old. They are carrying heavy weapons.\n  For the ones who do not do what he tells them to do, they mutilate \nthem. Here is another chart with more pictures. As you can see, they do \nit by cutting off their nose, cutting off their ears, cutting off their \nlips--that is a big thing they do--cutting off their hands.\n  You see this picture right here. His name, by the way, is John \nOchola. He is one we have seen before. They have taken his ears off, \nhis nose off, cut off both of his hands.\n  Here is another picture up here, and one down here. This is a young \nchild. His lip is cut off, his nose is cut off, and his ear is cut off. \nYou can see that. That had just happened. They bandaged him up.\n  Once they are in this army, to go back to their villages and murder \ntheir siblings, and murder their parents. If they do not do it, this is \nthe price they pay.\n  Anyway, we have made the decision to go and help them--and we also \nhave a program that is called train and equip, which I will talk about \nin a minute--but to go in and actually be of assistance to these \ncountries; in this case, taking out this particular maniac who has been \nthere for 25 years.\n  It is not just in Uganda. I went up to Gulu. Gulu is in the northern \npart of Uganda. Senator Mike Enzi was with me at this time. We went up \nand we saw a lot of these kids who came back who had been mutilated. We \nwent down and talked to President Kagame, the President of Rwanda. You \nmight remember, Rwanda, in 1994, is where the greatest, the most \ndevastating murder by genocide in recorded history in Africa took \nplace, killing 800,000 people, using machetes, torturing them to death. \nThey had the same problem down there.\n  Then, if you go over to the DRC, Democratic Republic of the Congo, \nthat is Joe Kabila. Joe Kabila is one who is very much concerned. Of \ncourse, Kinshasa, the capital of the DRC, is way over on the western \nside, and it is several time zones over to the eastern side where \nJoseph Kony was killing these kids at that time. In fact, the major \ncity over there is Goma. We were in Goma shortly before Kony escaped \nand went north to the Central African Republic, and then back up to \nSouth Sudan.\n  I had occasion to be in South Sudan last week. That is a new country. \nIt was an exciting thing to go into a new country and sit down with \ntheir members of Parliament. We talked for a good 2 hours. We had 25 \nmembers of the Parliament of the brand new country, South Sudan, and \nthey told me one of their major concerns right now is getting this guy \nJoseph Kony. He has now\n\n[[Page S6575]]\n\nbeen making runs up into South Sudan and getting these people. So this \nis a major thing that many of these countries have joined in to try to \ndo something about Joseph Kony.\n  Well, anyway, last year, I got a little bit concerned that nothing \nwas happening. One of the reasons--I have to say this, Mr. President--\nnothing much was happening is because if you take these countries--like \nPresident Museveni and President Kagame, these Presidents came out of \nthe bush. I think when they feel they are not able to get one renegade \ngroup such as this, they feel it is kind of a blow to their ego. \nFinally, I was able to get the three of them together--that was Joe \nKabila, President Paul Kagame of Rwanda, and President Museveni of \nUganda--and we were able to get them all to agree to do something to \neradicate this monster. So they are now in a position to do that.\n  That is another reason why our forces serve in a non-combat role. For \nthe U.S. to capture or kill Kony would be a slap in the face to our \nallies. I respect them too much to do so. In 2009, I led a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators to pass into law S. 1067. It was called the Lord's \nResistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009. \nWe had 64 cosponsors. This is the largest number of cosponsors on any \nkind of bill affecting Africa in history. We had these Senators \ncosponsoring the bill, and they all were very excited about it.\n  Let me tell you what the law says. It directs the administration to \ndevelop a regional strategy to ``apprehend or remove'' Joseph Kony, his \ntop LRA commanders, disarm and demobilize the LRA fighters through \npolitical, economic, military, and intelligence assistance, and protect \ncivilians from further attacks.\n  The law is kind of interesting because it specifically precludes us \nfrom entering into any kind of battle. I think that is the most \nimportant thing to talk about today because almost everyone who is \nreporting on this, including my good friend Rush Limbaugh, is talking \nabout that our guys and gals are going to go into combat. No, they are \nnot going to. They are specifically precluded from doing that. So it is \nnot as it is in Libya. It has nothing to do with the War Powers Act \nbecause these are troops that are precluded from attacking except in \nself defense.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee reported out the FY12 Defense \nAuthorization Act, and we specifically--I know this because this is my \nlanguage that we put in--prohibit the U.S. military forces from \nparticipating in combat operations to ``apprehend or remove'' Kony and \nthe LRA. This is my language I put in the bill. So not only are they \nnot going to be in combat, but they are precluded from being in combat. \nThat is what we have right now, and it is before us today.\n  By the way, some people have mistakenly said this guy Kony is a \nChristian, and I want to make sure everyone knows he officially was \ndisavowed by the Catholic Church in Uganda. I will read what a Catholic \nsister of the Comboni Catholic group said, who spent 15 years in Gulu--\nthat is a place where I was some 15 years ago--in northern Uganda. I \nquote. This is a Catholic sister. She said:\n\n       I was in Gulu, North Uganda, when Joseph Kony took the \n     leadership of this group that became famous for its \n     atrocities. I saw people whose lips, mouth, ears, nose, were \n     mercilessly cut without provocation. I still remember the 6 \n     men who came to our premises in Gulu crying, asking for help \n     as 3 of them had their right hand cut off--\n\n  As we saw a minute ago.\n\n     and the other three the right foot [cut off by machetes].\n\n  It was all done by the LRA. I am going on, still quoting this \nCatholic nun:\n\n       . . . people cut into pieces with the machete, burnt alive \n     after smearing their bodies with palm oil, small children \n     locked in the hut and set fire on it [burned alive], babies \n     pounded in the container used to pound the maze. Let us not \n     forget women and girls raped, killed or abducted as sex \n     slaves. . . . a Congolese lady on Christmas Day 2008 lost 17 \n     members of her family who had gone to church for prayer, all \n     killed with the machete.\n\n  This is brutality we have never seen anything like before.\n  I think the other thing that is important to understand is we have \nseveral programs that affect Africa and other places around the world. \nOne is called train and equip authorized by sections 1206, 1207, or \n1208. What we do with train and equip is send people in to teach them \nhow to train people, in this case Africa. We have over a thousand U.S. \nforces right now doing essentially what these 100 who the President \nsent over are there to do. Our military-to-military programs include \ncounterterrorism, border security, maritime surveillance, and all this, \nbut not combat.\n  As I say, No. 1, the thing to remember is, we are already doing this. \nWhat we are doing with the 100 people who are sent over to Africa--we \nhave a thousand there already doing this.\n  Then, secondly, it is something that is very significant in our fight \nagainst terrorism in that area. We are not going to have any of our \ntroops in combat. But this type of thing you see in these pictures \nright here--to see this guy here with his nose cut off, his ears cut \noff, his hands cut off--all of this--this is going on today, right now, \nat this moment, as we are speaking.\n  I stand behind the President in his decision. I do not very often \nstand behind this President, but I do in this case because we passed it \nwithout a dissenting vote. Every Member in here--there is not one who \nvoted against it. So let's keep that in mind, that is the truth about \nwhat is happening now with the LRA. Joseph Kony and the LRA are \nresponsible for one of the longest, most violent, and costly conflicts \never on the continent of Africa.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6575-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of October 13, 2011, under \n``Text of Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased today to support the 2012 \nAgriculture appropriations bill. This is a\n\n[[Page S6576]]\n\nvery austere measure. Almost every category of funding is lower than \nlast year and much lower than the year before. Setting aside disaster \nand security items that we dealt with in debt limit negotiations, \ndiscretionary spending in this bill is $200 million below 2011. \nCompared to 2010, it is $3.2 billion lower. That is equal to a 15-\npercent reduction compared to 2010.\n  In total, discretionary spending is $20.046 billion. That figure \nincludes nearly $300 million in disaster for hurricanes, tornados, \nfloods, droughts, and other natural disasters. All together, \ndiscretionary spending is nearly $2 billion below the President's \nrequest and is consistent with our 302(b) allocation.\n  To achieve savings and develop a balanced bill, Senator Blunt and I \nhad to set priorities. Among them was a goal to protect public health \nand safety, including food safety. We made sure these activities are \nprotected. We provided more than $1 billion for the Food Safety and \nInspection Service so they can maintain current levels of inspection \nfor meat and poultry. The bill includes almost $2.2 billion for the \nFDA, which is an increase of $50 million. Most of this increase is for \nfood safety, and FDA is the only agency or office funded by this bill \nat a higher level than last year.\n  An equally high priority is protecting the most vulnerable Americans \nfrom hunger. The WIC Program, which historically accounts for more than \none-third of all discretionary spending in this bill, is funded at \nalmost $6.6 billion. According to USDA, this level will support current \nparticipation levels. We also protected other domestic feeding \nprograms, including the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which is a \nlifeline for many elderly Americans. We believe it is especially \nimportant during these tough times to maintain nutrition program \nparticipation, and we have done so in this bill.\n  Another priority worthy of protection is agricultural research. \nWithout continued investment, food production in this country and \naround the globe will not be able to keep up with challenges posed by \ngrowing populations, climate change, invasive pests, and other threats. \nAccording to the Economic Research Service, global demand for food will \ngrow 70 to 100 percent by 2050. To meet that demand, our production \ncapacity will have to increase, and these increases will not happen \nwithout sustained emphasis on agricultural research.\n  Senator Blunt and I have worked hard to protect these investments \noften at the expense of other USDA programs. One of the most important \ndiscussions in Congress today revolves around job creation. This bill \nincludes more than $2 billion for rural development loans and grants. \nThese programs help launch and grow small businesses. They help rural \ncommunities build water and sewer lines which, of course, are essential \nto economic development. They help improve small town fire stations and \nhealth care clinics. They support rural housing. These projects are \nimportant, and Senator Blunt and I have provided funding to help \nprotect and create jobs in rural America.\n  Two of our programs, PL-480 and the McGovern-Dole Food for Education \nProgram, fall within the security category of discretionary spending \nand play a very important role in fighting world hunger. Right now, the \nHorn of Africa is under a state of declared famine, and the lives of \nmillions of men, women, and children are at grave risk. Food aid is all \nthat stands between life and death for these people, and I am glad to \nreport that we are able to provide a slight increase in PL-480 above \nlast year. However, we must closely monitor events in Africa and \nelsewhere since the funding levels for these programs in this bill \nremain below the 2010 levels.\n  This bill funds the priorities I have described above as well as \nconservation, marketing, trade, and many others important to the \nAmerican people. In spite of the challenges we face, I believe Senator \nBlunt and I have provided the proper balance for the programs in this \nbill.\n  I thank him for his help and his guidance. This is his first year as \nthe ranking member of this subcommittee, and he has been very helpful.\n  As I said at the outset, this bill is very austere. The choices we \nmade were difficult, but I strongly believe they were the correct ones. \nI urge every Senator to support this bill. I hope we can conclude floor \naction in a timely manner so we can proceed to conference with the \nHouse and send the bill to the President. USDA and FDA are now \noperating on a continuing resolution. We need to provide them with \nfinal spending levels for this fiscal year as soon as we can.\n  Procedurally, we will be considering two appropriations bills in \naddition to Agriculture: the Commerce-Justice-Science and the \nTransportation-HUD bills. Any Senator who has amendments to these bills \nshould work with us to assure that the appropriate chairman and ranking \nmember can be on the floor to respond to amendments that fall under \ntheir jurisdiction.\n  The discretionary programs and activities of USDA and FDA that are \nsupported by this bill include high priority responsibilities entrusted \nto the Federal Government and its partners to protect human health and \nsafety, contribute to economic recovery, and achieve policy objectives \nstrongly supported by the American people. The ability to provide for \nthese measures is made difficult by growing pressure on available \nlevels of discretionary spending as a consequence of the overall public \ndebate on Federal spending, revenues, and size of the Federal debt. \nWhile clearly a part of this overall discussion, the committee notes \nthat discretionary spending has not in recent years been a significant \ncause to the rising debt of the nation. In fact, since 2001, when the \nU.S. government had a budget surplus of $128 billion, the increase in \nnon security domestic spending, when adjusted for inflation and \npopulation growth, has been zero.\n  Too often, the USDA programs funded by this bill are confused with \nfarm subsidies and other mandatory spending more properly associated \nwith multi-year farm bills. In contrast, this bill provides annual \nfunding for programs familiar to all Americans such as protecting food \nsafety through the Food Safety and Inspection Service and the Food and \nDrug Administration, which also plays a vital role in maintaining the \nsafety of the Nation's blood supply and availability of safe and \neffective medical drugs, biologics, and other components of our health \nsystem. This bill also provides funding to fight against the \nintroduction and spread of noxious or infectious and often invasive \npests and disease that threaten our plant and animal health \nenvironments, as well as funding for many other missions of dire \nimportance to the American people.\n  As our economy witnesses increasing shifts of manufacturing capacity, \nand associated jobs, to foreign shores, we must never lose sight that \nthe one area of production which must be protected as inherently \ndomestic is that of our food supply. That does not mean that certain \nfoods need not appropriately rely on import and export markets, but it \ndoes mean that we must never surrender our ability to adequately and \nsafely feed our own people. Without adequate levels of research, \ndevelopment, and regulatory resources, that threat of surrender will be \never present and our natural resource base will remain always at risk. \nAccordingly and in the context of overall pressures on spending and the \ncompeting priorities that the Committee faces, this bill as reported \nprovides the proper amount of emphasis on agricultural, rural \ndevelopment, and other programs and activities funded by the bill. It \nis consistent with the subcommittee's allocation for fiscal year 2012.\n  The bill provides appropriations to support personnel levels for \nevery agency of the Department of Agriculture except for the Forest \nService. The jurisdiction of USDA programs touches on subjects as far \nranging as molecular science relating to an exotic plant disease to \nproviding housing and nutrition assistance to elderly citizens. The men \nand women who carry out these programs are dedicated and play an \nimportant role in providing many of the most vital of services to the \nAmerican people. In general, the funding for the salaries and expenses \nof these agencies has been reduced by 5 percent below last fiscal year. \nThese reductions will require the Department to seek greater \nefficiencies in operations and to manage resources in a manner that \nwill result in the mildest impact on program delivery and the personnel \nof USDA.\n  In spite of an abundance of rhetoric denouncing the presence of \ngovernment\n\n[[Page S6577]]\n\nin our lives, it goes without saying that government plays a vital role \nin assuring the American people a strong sense of security which comes \nin many forms. One of the most important areas of security is the \ninherent ability to provide sufficient supplies of food and fiber. \nThese supplies rely on continuing advances in science and, quite \nfrankly, the importance of research in the areas of agricultural \nscience will become a growing priority for us, and the world, in the \ndecades immediately before us.\n  As mentioned above, a recent report of USDA's Economic Research \nService outlined the importance of sound investments in agricultural \nresearch and the grim prospects in the near future if we ignore the \nwarning signs of combined population growth and declining production \ncapacity. Highlights of that report state the following:\n  By 2050, global agricultural demand is projected to grow by 70-100 \npercent due to population growth, energy demands, and higher incomes in \ndeveloping countries. Meeting this demand from existing agricultural \nresources will require raising global agricultural total factor \nproductivity, TFP, by a similar level. Maintaining the U.S. \ncontribution to global food supply would also require a similar rise in \nU.S. agricultural TFP.\n  Total factor productivity, TFP, the broadest measure of productivity. \nIt compares the total output of a sector to the total land, labor, \ncapital, and material inputs used to produce that output. Increases in \nTFP imply more output is forthcoming from a given level of inputs, or, \nequivalently, fewer inputs are required to produce the same output. \nGrowth in TFP is considered to be an indicator of the rate of technical \nchange in a sector.\n  TFP growth in U.S. agriculture is predicated on long-term investments \nin public agricultural research and development, R Productivity \ngrowth also springs from agricultural extension, farmer education, \nrural inrrastructure, private agricultural R, and technology \ntransfers, but the force of these factors is compounded by public \nagricultural research.\n  The rate of TFP growth, and therefore output growth, of U.S. \nagriculture has averaged about 1.5 percent annually over the past 50 \nyears. Stagnant, inflation-adjusted, funding for public agricultural \nresearch since the 1980s may be causing agricultural growth to slow \ndown, although statistical analyses of productivity growth trends are \ninconclusive.\n  ERS simulations indicate that if U.S. public agricultural R \nspending remains constant, in nominal terms, until 2050, the annual \nrate of agricultural TFP growth will fall to under 0.75 percent and \nU.S. agricultural output will increase by only 40 percent by 2050. \nUnder this scenario, raising output beyond this level would require \nbringing more land, labor, capital, materials, and other resources into \nproduction.\n  Additional public agricultural R spending would raise U.S. \nagricultural productivity and output growth. Raising R spending by \n3.73 percent annually, offsetting the historical rate of inflation in \nresearch costs, would increase U.S agricultural output by 73 percent by \n2050. Raising R spending by 4.73 percent per year, 1-percent annual \ngrowth in inflation-adjusted spending, would increase output by 83 \npercent by 2050.\n  For these reasons, Senator Blunt and I determined that funding for \nagricultural research remains a priority and we simply cannot take the \nrisk of jeopardizing our agricultural production capacity. Today, we \nsee visions of famine in the Horn of Africa. As hard as it is for us \ntoday to imagine famine ever touching this country, the sudden \nemergence of exotic plant or animal diseases coupled with dramatic \nshifts in weather patterns could disrupt our food production capacity \nin ways we would otherwise not imagine with repercussions that would \nsound throughout our economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kohl in \nsupporting this bill, the fiscal year 2012 appropriations bill for \nAgriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and \nrelated agencies. I am glad we are considering appropriations bills on \nthe Senate floor in a manner that will allow us to fully debate \namendments.\n  In addition to funding the Department of Agriculture and the Food and \nDrug Administration, the bill we bring to the floor today also includes \nthe fiscal year 2012 bills introduced by other committees, as Senator \nKohl has already specified; by the Subcommittees on Commerce, Justice, \nScience and Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. For now, \nI will limit my comments just to the agriculture provisions and, of \ncourse, defer to my colleagues, Senator Hutchison and Senator Collins, \non the provisions that relate to the other two bills.\n  Activities funded by the Agriculture bill touch the lives of every \nAmerican every day. These activities include agricultural research, \nconservation activities, housing and business loan programs for rural \ncommunities, domestic and international nutrition programs, and food \nand drug safety.\n  Funding for each of these deserves thorough and thoughtful \nconsideration. Senator Kohl and I have made some difficult decisions in \ndrafting this bill. Aside from disaster recovery efforts, the bill is \n$138 million below last year and represents a responsible approach to \nfunding agricultural priorities as we tighten our belts and live more \nwithin our means.\n  While most programs are reduced by 5 percent, we prioritized those \nprograms that protect the public health and help maintain the strength \nof our Nation's agricultural economy. Agriculture is one of the few \nsectors of our economy that enjoys a trade surplus, and the overall \nstate of the farm economy is currently strong. With the Nation's \nunemployment rate continuing to hover around 9 percent, expanding \nagricultural exports is even more vital, as every billion dollars in \nexports supports an estimated 8,000 American jobs.\n  That is one reason I was pleased we were able to pass the free-trade \nagreements with South Korea, Panama, and Colombia last week. Expanding \naccess to these markets will create an estimated 20,000 agricultural-\nrelated jobs alone. However, expanding access to new markets is only \none piece of the puzzle that maintains our agricultural economy.\n  Our agricultural products are the best in the world. Our producers \nare the best in the world at producing products that are desirable in \nthe global market. This is in part the result of smart investment in \nAmerica's agricultural research infrastructure. That is why I am \npleased this bill places significant emphasis on maintaining research \nprograms and our land grant university system and funding competitive \nresearch programs such as the agriculture and food research initiative. \nThese programs are critical to helping our farmers increase production \nand will expand our Nation's economic growth.\n  Not only does every dollar spent on agricultural research result in a \n$20 return to the U.S. economy, research investments also result in a \nfood supply that is safe, abundant, and affordable. I am also glad that \nthe agriculture bill includes funding to help farmers in communities \nrecover from natural disasters. Missouri has seen unprecedented \ndevastation from both tornados and flooding this year. Funding included \nin this bill for the Emergency Watershed Protection Program and the \nEmergency Conservation Program is necessary to help those areas recover \nand resume their way of life. It is important that we support our \nfarmers as they clear debris, regrade, and rehabilitate their land for \nthe next growing season.\n  I thank Senator Kohl for the bipartisan working relationship we have \non the agriculture subcommittee. This is my first bill as the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, and the chairman has given me every \nopportunity to provide input into the bill. He has done a good job of \nbalancing the priorities of the agriculture subcommittee this year. I \nhope my colleagues join me in supporting the bill that the chairman and \nI present together today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 755 to Amendment No. 738\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendments? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S6578]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 755 to amendment No. 738.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                 amendment no. 755 to amendment no. 738\n\n   (Purpose: To require a report on plans to implement reductions to \n                certain salaries and expenses accounts)\n\n       At the end of title VII of division A, add the following:\n       Sec. 7___.  Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall \n     submit to the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate a report describing plans to implement reductions to \n     salaries and expenses accounts included in this Act.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate the chairman \nand ranking member of the Agriculture appropriations subcommittee for \nthe excellent work they have done and for bringing a bipartisan bill \nbefore the Senate.\n  Shortly, Senator Patty Murray and I will do our opening statements on \nthe fiscal year 2012 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is now \nconsidering the fiscal year 2012 Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment appropriations bill.\n  This bill has been supported by broad bipartisan majorities. The \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations \nsubcommittee has 19 members. That is almost a fifth of the Senate. It \nis one of the largest subcommittees in the Senate.\n  Despite the diversity of views on our very large subcommittee, back \non September 20, we voted unanimously to report the bill to the full \nAppropriations Committee. The next day members of our committee voted \n28 to 2 to report the bill to the Senate.\n  This bill has strong bipartisan support because it addresses \npragmatically the very real housing and transportation needs of \nfamilies across all regions of our Nation.\n  We all realize that middle-class families face many challenges in \nthese troubling economic times. Businesses across the country continue \nto struggle in the aftershocks of the financial and economic crisis \nthat has rocked communities everywhere. Too many workers are struggling \nto get back on the job and far too many families are still fighting to \nstay in their homes. Yet, at the same time, our Federal Government's \ndebt continues to grow.\n  Sensitive to these realities, we put together legislation that funds \ncritical pieces of our Federal Government, while cutting spending in a \nresponsible way. I believe this bill achieves these goals while \ncontinuing to ensure that we are investing in our future and protecting \nthe most vulnerable among us.\n  It was not an easy task. The allocation for housing and \ntransportation programs is 19 percent lower--almost $13 billion less--\nthan the level Congress appropriated in fiscal year 2010. Believe me, \nthe demands for the activities that are funded in this bill have not \ndiminished. If anything, the needs have increased.\n  With unemployment still painfully high, poverty rates are now at \ntheir highest level in almost 20 years. This bill funds a critical \npiece of the safety net--housing assistance and homeless shelters--for \nmillions of families who are one step from the street.\n  This bill is also a principal underwriter of the Nation's \ntransportation network. The investments we included make it possible \nfor people to get to work and get products to market.\n  Investing in our aging transportation system--our highways, aviation, \nand mass transit--is a key factor in making sure America can compete \nand win in the 21st century economy.\n  There are undoubtedly elements in the bill that many will not like. \nThat was unavoidable. But Senator Collins and I had some very clear \npriorities, however, that guided our decisionmaking.\n  We wanted to invest in our transportation system, ensure that it \nremains safe, and protect the poor and disabled who depend on the \nprograms in this bill to keep a roof over their heads, so the bill \nbefore the Senate includes funding to preserve the highway program at \nthe current level of $43.7 billion. This funding will allow communities \nto continue improving our transportation network, while providing \ncritical jobs.\n  It also includes $550 million for the highly competitive TIGER Grants \nProgram for surface transportation projects that make a significant \ndifference in our communities across the country.\n  This program has already helped finance projects in many States \nacross this country, including in Seattle and Spokane in my home State \nof Washington.\n  This bill also provides funding to support FAA's efforts to develop \nits next-generation air transportation system to accommodate growth in \nair travel in future years. It continues Federal support for Amtrak, \nproviding the same level of funding as in fiscal year 2011 to maintain \nthis key element of the transportation grid.\n  We are also investing in transit, providing almost $2 billion to meet \nour commitments to communities that are improving their transit \nsystems. These systems, as we all know, help reduce congestion and \nprovide a critical service to those who rely on them every day to get \nto their jobs and home to their families.\n  Importantly, we continue the Federal oversight that makes travel on \nour Nation's air, road, and rail transportation systems the safest in \nthe world.\n  The bill also provides funding to preserve rental assistance and \naffordable housing for the Nation's low income, including $18.9 billion \nfor the section 8 program, which over 2 million elderly, disabled, and \nlow-income families rely on to ensure they have a safe place to live.\n\n  For those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness, we have \nprovided $1.9 billion for homeless assistance grants. As part of this, \nwe have included $285 million for the Emergency Solutions Grant \nProgram, which is critical to helping the growing number of homeless or \nat-risk families avoid or quickly escape homelessness.\n  I am also very proud that we worked to include $75 million to fund \nover 11,000 new HUD-VA supportive housing, or HUD-VASH, vouchers.\n  Providing permanent housing for homeless veterans and their families, \nincluding veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nwill help us achieve the goal of ending homelessness among our Nation's \nveterans.\n  The bill includes efforts to preserve and revitalize public housing, \nincluding $120 million for the Choice Neighborhoods Initiative, as well \nas the Rental Assistance Demonstration. These programs support \ninnovation and collaboration, including leveraging private sector \nresources. In this difficult fiscal environment, these are tools we \nneed to help protect irreplaceable public housing, which is so \ndesperately needed throughout our country.\n  Finally, the bill includes $1.8 billion to provide disaster relief to \ncommunities where highways, public facilities, and other infrastructure \nhave been damaged by flooding and other disasters.\n  Achieving all these goals required very difficult choices. The bill \nprovides significantly reduced funding for high speed and intercity \npassenger rail grants. It also makes deep cuts to the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant HOME Investment Partnership, and other programs \nI have long supported and I continue to believe in. It wasn't easy to \nmake these decisions, but the real sacrifices will be felt in \ncommunities across our country.\n  The programs funded in our bill support important investments back\n\n[[Page S6579]]\n\nhome. Our constituents will be the ones to see firsthand the impact of \nthese cuts. Unfortunately, these types of painful sacrifices were \nnecessary within the allocation we were provided.\n  In summary, this bill provides assistance to those who need it most, \nand it directs resources in a responsible and fiscally prudent way. It \nis a good bill. It will help commuters, homeowners, the most vulnerable \nin our society, and it helps our economy.\n  This bill has broad bipartisan support because it takes a practical \napproach to addressing the real needs we find in the transportation and \nhousing sectors. I urge all of my colleagues to support the bill and \nhelp us move it rapidly toward passage.\n  Before I yield, I will take a moment to specifically thank Senator \nSusan Collins for her hard work and partnership. This was a very \ndifficult bill to put together. It benefited from her input and from \nthe hard work of her and all of her staff. I thank her for that.\n  With that, I yield for my friend and partner, Senator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, I thank Chairman Murray for her \nexceptional leadership on this bill. It has been a real partnership, a \nbipartisan partnership, to deal with some very difficult issues. You \nsee that with the chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture \nCommittee, as well, and with the third bill that is before us today, \nwhere Senators Mikulski and Hutchison also worked together in a \nbipartisan manner. I think this is a template for how the Senate ought \nto operate, which we need to do more of.\n  I am also very pleased that we are bringing the appropriations bills \nbefore the Senate. I am hopeful we can avoid having some huge omnibus \nbill where no one is too sure of what's in it, who negotiated it, and \nhow different provisions made their way into the bill. That is not a \ngood way to legislate. Instead, bringing these bills before the Senate \nso the Senate can work its will on these important funding bills is the \nappropriate way to proceed.\n  I am very pleased to join my colleagues--particularly the \nsubcommittee chairman, Senator Murray--as we begin floor consideration \nof these three bills. I am very pleased to serve as the ranking member \nof the Transportation, Housing, Urban Development, and Related Agencies \nSubcommittee.\n  Investment in economic development and infrastructure not only \ncreates jobs now, when they are needed most, but also establishes the \nfoundations for future growth. Just as important to our economic \nfuture, however, is reining in Federal spending. Getting our national \ndebt under control must be made a priority governmentwide.\n  In setting priorities for the coming year, this appropriations bill \nstrikes the right balance between thoughtful investment in critical \nprojects in infrastructure and housing programs and fiscal restraint, \nthereby setting the stage for future economic growth.\n  Our bill makes critical infrastructure and development investments \nand meets our responsibility to vulnerable populations, such as our \nhomeless veterans. At the same time, this bill delivers on the promise \nof a responsible budget and recognizes the fiscal reality of an \nunsustainable $14.3 trillion debt.\n  I can assure everyone that in this bill we are doing our part to \nestablish more sustainable spending levels as quickly as possible. The \nproposed nonemergency funding levels for fiscal year 2012 are nearly \n$13 billion below fiscal year 2010. That is a reduction of nearly one-\nfifth in just 2 years. The significant savings represent an \nunmistakable movement in the direction of fiscal sustainability. \nNevertheless, we have done our best to provide the necessary resources \nthat are needed to support ongoing infrastructure investment and \nimportant safety oversight in the programs administered by the \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  For example, we provided funding for the TIGER Grant Program of $550 \nmillion. This will help to build infrastructure projects across this \ncountry that otherwise would not be constructed, and those \ninfrastructure projects translate into real jobs and needed assets for \ncommunities across the country. We all know the link between essential \ninfrastructure and jobs in economic development. After all, if \nbusinesses can't ship their goods or get their needed raw materials in \nan efficient, effective manner, then they are not going to be able to \ncreate and preserve jobs. That is why I see this bill, in many ways, as \nbeing a jobs bill.\n  In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration is provided adequate \nfunding to improve the management of the air traffic control \noperations. There have been troubling recent reports of numerous \noperational errors by controllers which call into question the safety \nof our skies over some of our Nation's busiest airports. In response, \nour bill directs the FAA to implement data-driven performance standards \nto make certain that air traffic towers nationwide are properly \nstaffed. By setting and enforcing these standards, the FAA can be more \nconfident that air traffic controllers have the skills and discipline \nnecessary to fulfill their critical duties.\n  In addition to improved safety oversight, this bill targets funds to \nthe Nation's most critical infrastructure projects. I mentioned the \nTIGER Grant Program. In addition, through the Competitive National \nInfrastructure Investments Program, funding is provided to support \nprojects nationwide that otherwise would not be built. In hopes of \nmaking this funding go even further, we have also increased the \npercentage of funding available to support credit assistance through \nthe TIFIA loan program. On average, a TIFIA loan allows every $1 \nprovided in Federal appropriations to leverage approximately $30 in \nadditional transportation infrastructure investment. That is the kind \nof innovation in infrastructure finance we need to produce a greater \nreturn on our taxpayers' investment.\n  In addition to transportation oversight and infrastructure, our bill \nalso provides critical economic development and housing investments \nthrough the Department of Housing and Urban Development. As with the \nDepartment of Transportation title, balancing key investment priorities \nwith fiscal responsibility required significant and sometimes very \ndifficult reductions in programs that are worthwhile but which we \nsimply cannot afford to fund at the level we would like.\n  Addressing the ongoing challenge of homelessness remains a core \npriority for our subcommittee. Chairman Murray and I share a commitment \nto combating homelessness, particularly for our Nation's veterans. I am \nvery troubled by a statistic I want to share with my colleagues. In 1 \nyear's time, there are more homeless veterans than there are individual \nmilitary members who were killed during the Vietnam war. That is a \ndisgrace. That is something we must change. This bill provides $75 \nmillion for HUD's Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program--the so-\ncalled HUD-VASH Program--to provide housing assistance for an \nadditional 11,000 homeless veterans.\n  I have seen the result of this program in the State of Maine in a \nwonderful apartment complex that has been built specifically to meet \nthe needs of our homeless veterans. It is in Saco, ME, and it is making \nsuch a difference in the lives of those who have served our country and \nyet now find themselves homeless.\n  I also strongly believe in the importance of the Community \nDevelopment Block Grant Program. This is such a popular program in \ncommunities throughout our country. It supports economic growth \nstrategies of communities and enables key investments in their long-\nterm economic growth. It is programs such as the CDBG Program that lay \nthe foundation for future prosperity. We were not able to provide as \nmuch funding, frankly, for this program as I would have liked and as \nSenator Murray would have liked. I hope we can continue to work on it \nonce we get to conference.\n\n  As we head into fiscal year 2012, our economy continues to struggle \nwith high rates of unemployment, with stagnant incomes, and with prices \nthat, in some areas, are starting to rise. Unfortunately, this makes it \nvery difficult for us to fund these programs that are meeting an ever-\ngrowing need. For this reason, it has been all that much more \nchallenging to achieve lowered budget targets. To address this \nchallenge, therefore, our bill includes several measures that are \ndesigned to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of programs at \nHUD.\n\n[[Page S6580]]\n\n  This year, we took very seriously the alarming reports on oversight \ndeficiencies under the HOME program. For example, in an effort to \nensure that funding for the HOME program efficiently achieves its goal \nof delivering affordable housing to those who most need it, we worked \nwith the HUD Office of Inspector General to improve the program's \nregulations to better monitor and assess risks. The bill also directs \nHUD to work with the Office of Inspector General to identify strategies \nthat the Department can implement to address problems at certain \ntroubled public housing authorities and to hold them accountable for \nmismanagement of taxpayer funds. With so many important programs under \npressure to absorb reductions, it is more important than ever to ensure \nthat HUD's programs are free from mismanagement, waste, fraud, and \nabuse.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to join with Senator Murray in \npresenting this legislation to the Chamber. If there is one theme that \nruns throughout our bill, it is practicality. We have tried to take a \nnonpartisan practical approach that asks tough questions but makes sure \nwe are setting priorities for those programs that are most essential to \nthe most vulnerable individuals and families in our Nation. At the same \ntime, we worked very hard to make sure we were funding those programs \nthat were absolutely essential in meeting economic and job-creation \npriorities. It is my hope our colleagues will support our bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate \nthe fiscal year 2012 bill to fund CJS appropriations; that is, the \nDepartment of Commerce, Justice, Science, and related agencies. I wish \nto thank Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell for bringing the CJS \nbill to the floor so we Senators have an opportunity to discuss and \nvote on this important legislation.\n  The CJS bill is the product of bipartisan cooperation. I stand here \ntoday with my ranking member, my colleague, my partner on this bill, \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison. At the outset, I wish to thank her and \nher excellent staff for working hand in hand to advance the cause and \nthe goals we believe in--creating jobs, making sure our streets and our \nneighborhoods are safe, and, at the same time, funding innovation and \ntechnology so America continues to be an exceptional Nation. We have \nworked together, and I thank her for her support and her cooperation.\n  This fiscal year CJS totals $52.8 billion in discretionary spending. \nIt is consistent with the subcommittee's allocation. That allocation is \n$491 billion below 2011. So everybody should hear this. We are almost \n$\\1/2\\ billion below where we were in 2011, and we are $5 billion below \nwhat the President wanted in 2012. When the President said he wanted to \noutbuild, outeducate, and outinnovate, he had a different budget than \nwhat we have today because of the substantial cuts that were made in \nother legislative initiatives.\n  These agencies promote jobs. They also promote security and they \npromote, as I said, American innovation. Let's talk about some of the \nagencies that promote jobs. Let's start with the Department of \nCommerce.\n  I am very proud of the Department of Commerce and its funding for the \nInternational Trade Administration which enforces our trade laws and \npromotes small businesses overseas and also our Economic Development \nAdministration, creating economic growth in our communities and in our \nsmall towns. The National Institutes of Standards works with the \nprivate sector to set the standards for those new products and those \nnew technologies. In the Patent and Trademark Office, we have done a \nlot in innovation. We believe if one invents it, they should be able to \nkeep it. Then, of course, we have our Census Bureau, which makes sure \nevery American counts and every American should be counted--or every \nperson who lives in the United States.\n  We have the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which \npredicts our weather and also protects our marine resources.\n  Then this committee funds the Department of Justice, keeping us safe \nfrom violent crime and terrorism, prosecuting criminals, and also \nfunding State and local police departments, the National Science \nFoundation and NASA, which, again, promote our innovation. This agency \nalso funds the Commission on Civil Rights, upholding citizens' rights, \nalong with the Equal Opportunity Commission, ensuring fairness \nparticularly in the workplace, and the Legal Services Corporation, \nwhich represents the poor. This agency has broad scope, but, again, it \nis America's job to promote jobs, security, and innovation.\n  Within our ever-shrinking funding levels, the CJS bill has priorities \nto save lives, promote jobs, and protect the safety of our citizens.\n  We face two very pressing funding challenges that are critical to \nlife and safety. One is the next generation of weather satellites. It \nis our weather satellites that not only say whether we are going to \nhave stormy weather, but our weather operations also give us early \npredictions for everything from tornadoes to hurricanes. Also, we have \na growing and explosive prison population. Together, looking at just \nthose two, the issue related to an exploding population in prisons, \nmeaning more prisoners, more density in prisons--they require $350 \nmillion more in our budget, and we needed almost $400 million for our \nweather satellites. Meeting their obligations caused us to set other \npriorities, but we did meet our priorities. We provided $2.3 billion to \nsupport our police officers, to keep them safe with bulletproof vests, \nand to make sure they had funds for the latest crime analysis and \nforensic tools. We also funded the Byrne formula grants, which are the \nimportant tools for State and local police operations, at $395 million. \nRegrettably, it is $35 million below last year. We also funded our COPS \nhiring grants but, again, at a reduced level.\n  Then there is Federal law enforcement. Aren't we proud of our FBI? \nLook at what they have done in the last 2 weeks with the take-down of \nthe plot to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador. But the FBI is on the job \nevery day in every way, going after organized terrorists, organized \ncrime, and even predatory lenders and mortgage fraud. They are on the \njob looking out for us. And look how they work hand in hand with DEA, \nour Drug Enforcement Agency.\n  We have the Marshals Service, which, in effect, guards our judges and \nso on at our courthouses, but they are also the guys who go after \nsexual predators. Under the law we have, they are enforced with any \nrunaway or rogue sexual predators.\n  This means we did what we could, but unfortunately we had to cut \nthese agencies by 2 percent. It was with enormous regret that I had to \ndo that, but we are where we are. Cuts do have consequences. I say to \nmy colleagues, cuts do have consequences.\n  Then there is the area of innovation. We have worked hand in glove \nwith the authorizers on the America COMPETES Act. Senator Hutchison is \na member of that committee and one of the promoters of that. The \nAmerica COMPETES Act recommends that we increase funding for NSF and \nother science agencies by 7 percent every year. Well, we would settle \nfor 3 percent every year. This is to come up with the new ideas for the \nnew jobs, for the new products. But what did we have to do? We didn't \nraise it by 7 percent; we didn't raise it by the amount we want; in \nfact, we had to reduce it by 3 percent.\n  All those who would like to pound their chests and go ``hoo-ha hoo-\nha'' on American exceptionalism have to realize that cuts have \nconsequences. But we did work to ensure the fact that we have funded \nthe national space agency at $17.9 billion. It is $1.5 billion below \nthe authorized level, which, again, Senator Hutchison is one of the \nlead authorizers. We did preserve a balanced space program, human space \nflight, space science, also aeronautics, and the development of a \nreliable space transportation system. This means, though, that NASA \nwill be asked once again to do more.\n  We did fund the James Webb Space Telescope, which is the successor to \nHubble. By funding the James Webb Space Telescope, we will ensure \nAmerica's lead in astronomy and in physics for the next 50 years.\n  I am very proud of the fact that a Marylander at Johns Hopkins and \nthe\n\n[[Page S6581]]\n\nSpace Telescope Institute, on the Hopkins campus, just won the 2011 \nNobel Prize for physics--Dr. Adam Riess. When he accepted the Nobel \nPrize, do you know what he said. He said: I could not have done my \nNobel Prize without the Hubble telescope. All my research is based on \nthe Hubble. Then he said: I want to thank the American people for \nsupporting the political leadership that funded the Hubble and kept \nHubble in space during very dark times. We won that Nobel Prize. It is \ngoing to reveal secrets of the universe and secrets of physics that are \ngoing to help us again invent new kinds of things.\n  So our bill does focus on jobs, safety, and innovation. We would have \nliked to have done more, but regrettably we could not. So, Mr. \nPresident, we bring this bill before you.\n  I want to close by saying this. There are many who like to wring \ntheir hands about China, and China is surging ahead. We can't stop \nChina, but we can stop ourselves. And the question is do we want to \nstop ourselves in what we need to do? We need to promote commerce, \ntrade, patents to protect our intellectual property, make sure we have \na standard-setting agency, so if you invent it, you create the \nstandard, so you can sell it around the world. We need to be able to \nsave lives so we can save them not only at NIH in finding cures but \nalso throughout Maryland, the Plains of the United States or in my own \ncommunity. You know when a hurricane is coming, you know when a tornado \nis coming. But right now the Chinese are taking what is our National \nScience Foundation and they are replicating it, and we are, \nunfortunately, forced to keep it at a very modest funding level.\n  So if you want America to continue to be great and you want America \nto continue to be exceptional and you want to create jobs, support the \npassage of the CJS bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise as the ranking member of the \nCommerce-Justice Subcommittee, and I am very pleased that the bill we \nare presenting is a bill Chairman Mikulski and I worked on together. We \ncame together in compromise, but we didn't compromise on the top level \nof spending, and I commend Chairman Mikulski for her leadership in this \nvery important effort. We have a top line that is $491 million below \nthe fiscal year 2011 continuing resolution and $4.9 billion below the \nPresident's request. So we set a very strict top line, but within that \nI believe we worked a good compromise on the competing priorities of \nlaw enforcement, terrorism prevention, research, and competitiveness \nthrough investing in science.\n  I will just say that I relate so much to what the chairman said about \nthe Webb telescope and the importance of that, and that the Nobel Prize \nwinner whom we are so proud to have from America--in astronomy--\nmentioned that was how he was able to do his research makes me so proud \nthat we have made that kind of investment. You will see that in other \nareas where our finest scientists have been supported, and it is the \nkind of research that is not going to be done in the private sector. So \nthis is how we will be able to create something that will provide jobs \nof the future. America is ahead in the world. Our economy is vibrant \nnot because we manufacture better but because we have the ideas for the \nmanufactured products that have kept our economy going for hundreds of \nyears.\n  The chairman has gone over the major funding levels, so I won't go \ninto that, but I do want to point out a few of those that I think are \nimportant.\n  First, in law enforcement, we have worked hard to ensure that law \nenforcement receives the priority funding needed to protect our Nation, \nour communities, our children, and victims of crime.\n  One thing I would like to add is that we have ensured that the FBI \nhas the resources needed to continue the significant increase in their \ncontribution to counterterrorism and working with the CIA and \ncounterintelligence worldwide. This added responsibility commenced \nafter 9/11, and Director Mueller has overseen this, really the largest \ntransition in this agency probably in modern times from really \ntraditional crime fighting to these added missions. I anticipate we \nwill add even more in conference with the House, and I will support \nthat. I think they have become a major contributor to our national \nsecurity and the global security we are all seeking.\n  The language is included also to encourage the Department of Justice \nto maintain its fiscal year 2011 current level of funding focusing on \nthe southwest border. It is $1.9 billion. This is so important as \nviolence continues to spread across our border and the drug cartels \nbecome increasingly emboldened and, unfortunately, sophisticated. So \nthis was something the chairman and I agreed we must keep at the level \nfunding, and we have done so.\n  The El Paso Intelligence Center is another important program that is \none of our first safeguards along the border. This is a national \ntactical intelligence center that supports law enforcement in the \nUnited States, in Mexico, and the whole Western Hemisphere. It is the \nDrug Enforcement Administration's most important intelligence-sharing \nentity focusing on all that is related to the border.\n  Another important program I will point out is the State Criminal \nAlien Assistance Program. We call it SCAAP. SCAAP provides Federal \nassistance to States and localities that are incurring the costs of \nincarcerating undocumented criminal aliens who have been accused or \nconvicted of State and local offenses. This is a Federal \nresponsibility, and county jails and the State prisons should not be \nholding these prisoners without help from the Federal Government \nbecause they are illegal aliens.\n  Lastly, this bill provides significant support for NASA. The diverse \nset of programs that are aimed at the exploration of space and \nunderstanding Earth are so important for our country's future. Senator \nMikulski and I have crafted a bill that balances the needs of science \nwhile also encouraging the vehicles that will take our astronauts to \nthe space station for research and making use of that very important \nscientific station.\n  Our part is part of a national lab, and it was designated as such, \nand then, in the future beyond, it will include the supporting of \nemerging commercial space companies to bring cargo and astronauts to \nthe space station, supporting our investment, taking advantage of the \nopportunities for discovery on the space station, and ensuring that \nNASA will provide for human exploration beyond low Earth orbit.\n  So many of us watched the last shuttle return. Knowing we had no \nvehicle that would take Americans into space under American control for \nat least the foreseeable future was not well regarded in our country, \nand we need to make this commitment. We have made the commitment today \nwith appropriations to ensure that we are going to continue our \npreeminence in space, that we are going to go through low Earth orbit \nand we are going to see what is beyond the Moon in an astroid or Mars, \nsee if there is life there and what we can learn from life that might \nbe enhanced on Earth. So it is important that now we have the heavy \nlift launch vehicle design NASA released last month. It will carry our \nastronauts in the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle to the Moon, the \nastroids, and beyond.\n  Now that this decision has finally been made, we can focus on the \nfuture, and I think Americans expect that from us. NASA has announced \nits commitment to the path Congress has authorized, and now we can \nprovide the funds to accomplish the development of that rocket.\n  So in addition to what the chairman has already mentioned, I am \ncertainly a supporter of America COMPETES. I would like to do much more \nin the science area, the hard science, because I think that is our \nfuture. It is how we create jobs and keep our economy vibrant, having \nthe new products and the new ways to secure more jobs and more economic \nvitality in the technical sector in our country.\n  I am very pleased. I thank the Senator from Maryland and her staff so \nmuch for helping and working with us. They have been great partners. I \ncould not ask for any better. I think we have done a job that was hard \nto do with the lower levels of spending that we all expect and accept, \nbut I think we have been able to cover the priorities well.\n  I wish to end on a lighter note and say my friend, the Senator from \nMissouri, is sitting here. I want to point\n\n[[Page S6582]]\n\nout this will be the last time in the next 10 days that he and I are \ngoing to be on the same side because, of course, the mighty Texas \nRangers are going to meet the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series \nvery shortly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to offer my full support for the \nnomination of Judge Cathy Bissoon to serve as a U.S. district judge for \nthe Western District of Pennsylvania. But before I begin, I would like \nto quickly express my appreciation to my colleague, Senator Casey, whom \nI see across the Chamber at this moment, to thank him for his \ncollaboration in our joint efforts to fill the vacancies on the Federal \nbench from Pennsylvania.\n  As I think many of our colleagues would agree, the confirmation of \nFederal judges is one of the most important constitutional functions of \nany Member of the Senate. Since I was sworn in, Senator Casey and I \nhave worked together on a bipartisan basis to identify and advance \nqualified candidates for the Federal bench. As part of this effort, I \nhave supported President Obama's three district court nominees for \nPennsylvania, even though they were first appointed before I was sworn \nin to the Senate. I am pleased this spirit of cooperation has led to \ntoday's confirmation vote for Judge Bissoon. I remain hopeful we will \nhave a number of confirmation votes in the very near future as Senator \nCasey and I continue to work together to recommend qualified \nindividuals to serve on the Federal bench.\n  A quick couple words about Judge Bissoon. She was nominated last year \nfollowing the recommendations of Senators Casey and Specter and was \nrenominated by the administration in January. Judge Cathy Bissoon has \nhad a distinguished career in the law. She was born and raised in New \nYork City, where she attended Alfred University and graduated summa cum \nlaude with a degree in political science. She earned her law degree \nfrom Harvard University before moving to Pittsburgh to join Reed Smith, \nan international law firm, where she has practiced labor and employment \nlaw in particular. She went on to clerk for Chief U.S. District Judge \nGary Lancaster and later returned to Reed Smith to be a partner in \n2001. Judge Bissoon left private practice in 2008 to assume her current \nposition as magistrate judge for the Western District of Pennsylvania. \nHer strong work ethic, discipline and, in particular, her experience in \nlabor and employment law make her well qualified to preside over cases \nin the Western District of Pennsylvania, a district with a heavy \nemployment caseload.\n  Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to sit down with Judge \nBissoon and learn more about her legal philosophy. She stressed to me \nin that conversation that she understands very well a judge's role is \nto enforce the law as written, regardless of the judge's personal \nbeliefs about that law. Chief Justice Roberts came up with a metaphor \nfor this which has become rather famous, in which he described the role \nof a judge as an official on the playing field but not one of the \nplayers. Judge Bissoon confirmed that is exactly her view of the role \nof a judge, that it is the role of a legislator, branched together with \nthe executive, to pass the law and the role of the judge to enforce the \nlaw impartially. I am confident she understands that role, has \ninternalized that and would bring that, as well as a great degree of \nexperience and judicial acumen, to this very important role. That is \nwhy I am supporting her nomination.\n  Following a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Judge \nBissoon was unanimously approved by the committee back in July. I have \nstrong confidence in Judge Bissoon's ability, and I encourage my Senate \ncolleagues to join me in confirming her as a Federal district judge for \nthe Western District in a vote that will be occurring later this \nevening.\n  In addition to Judge Bissoon's nomination, I would like to briefly \nexpress my support for two other Pennsylvania nominees who were also \nunanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee back in July. I hope \nthey will each receive floor consideration very soon.\n  Mark Hornak, a nominee for the Western District of Pennsylvania, \ngraduated from the University of Pittsburgh, where he was recognized as \na National Merit Scholar. He went on to graduate summa cum laude from \nthe University of Pittsburgh School of Law, where he served as editor-\nin-chief of the Law Review and was awarded the Order of the Coif.\n  Following graduation, he served as a law clerk to the Honorable James \nSprouse, U.S. circuit judge for the Fourth Circuit. Since 1982, he has \npracticed labor and employment law at Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney. \nThroughout Mr. Hornak's career, he has been a careful student of the \nlaw and has demonstrated an intellectual curiosity and commitment to \nintegrity, which I know will serve him well if he is confirmed to the \nbench.\n  Finally, Robert Mariani is a nominee for the Middle District of \nPennsylvania. He graduated cum laude from Villanova University, \nreceived his J.D. from Syracuse University College of Law. Following \ngraduation, he established the law firm of Mariani & Greco, where he \nbegan a career as a civil litigator in the Scranton area and has done \nthat for about three decades.\n  He is a respected member of the Scranton community. He was nominated \nfor a State superior court seat in 1993 by then-Gov. Robert Casey, Sr. \nHe served as a mediator or arbitrator for a variety of legal matters \nand currently is sole shareholder of Robert D. Mariani, P.C., with a \nfocus on employment and labor law. Mr. Mariani's diligence, \nprofessionalism, and knowledge of the law would be an asset to the \nbench.\n  Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to meet separately with both \nMr. Hornak and Mr. Mariani and I am very confident of their intellect, \ntheir experience, their integrity, temperament, commitment to public \nservice, and to their understanding of the proper role of the judge. I \nbelieve these character traits and this range of experience will enable \nthem to serve the people of Pennsylvania. I am, therefore, pleased to \nrise to speak on their behalf and to urge all my colleagues to support \ntheir confirmation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield on that point, he is absolutely \nright. They were reported unanimously from the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee on July 21. They were cleared that day on the Democratic \nside. We were perfectly willing to bring them up and voice vote them \nthat day or the next day or the day after. We were perfectly willing to \nhave a vote in August before we went out. We were perfectly willing to \nhave them voted on in September. We were perfectly willing to have them \nvoted on early, in early October because of the Senator's support and \nSenator Casey's support. For some reason, that was not cleared on the \nSenator's side of the aisle. I will be happy to work with my friend \nfrom Pennsylvania--after all, we each have the same first name--and we \nwill try to clear them. What the Senator said about them is absolutely \ntrue. These are the kind of judges--whether we have a Republican or \nDemocratic President, they would be proud to have them on the bench, \nand I pledge to work with both Senators from Pennsylvania to get them \nthrough.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I thank the chairman.\n  It is my understanding we are going to vote this evening on Judge \nBissoon, and I would certainly enjoy the opportunity to work closely \nwith the chairman to ensure that we could have votes as soon as \npossible on the other nominees.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6583]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6583-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6583-S6587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF CATHY BISSOON TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                    WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Cathy Bissoon, \nof Pennsylvania, to be United States District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the \nnomination of Cathy Bissoon to the Western District of Pennsylvania, \none of 27 judicial nominations reported favorably by the Judiciary \nCommittee and on the Senate's Executive Calendar awaiting a vote. Like \n24 of those 27 nominations, the nomination of Judge Bissoon was \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee, with every Republican \nand every Democrat voting in support. Judge Bissoon is supported by \nboth of her home State Senators, Senator Casey, a Democrat, and Senator \nToomey, a Republican. I am glad we are finally able to vote on this \nnomination nearly 3 months after it was reported. I have heard no \nreason or explanation from the Republican leadership for this delayed \naction.\n  There is no good reason or explanation for the Republican \nleadership's refusal to vote on the other two dozen consensus nominees \nstalled before the Senate, while a judicial vacancies crisis continues \nto affect the Federal courts and hurt the American people. These are \nall nominations that have gone through an extensive process. They were \nconsidered by the White House and vetted before the President nominated \nthem. The White House has worked with the home State Senators, \nRepublicans and Democrats, and each is supported by both home State \nSenators. The FBI has conducted a thorough background review. The ABA's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary has conducted a peer review \nof their professional qualifications. The Judiciary Committee has held \na hearing on each nominee, and each has responded to extensive \nquestioning. When they are then reported unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee, there is no reason for months and months of further delay \nbefore they can start serving the American people.\n  With Republican agreement, we could vote not just on one district \ncourt nomination, but on all 27 of the nominations reported by the \nCommittee. I trust that the Senate will be allowed to confirm \nadditional judicial nominations this week, before the upcoming recess, \nso that we can begin to build on the agreement by the Senate leadership \nin September to finally have votes on long stalled judicial nominees. \nVotes on 4 to 6 nominations are what is required every week throughout \nthe rest of this year if we are to bring down a judicial vacancy rate \nthat remains at nearly 11 percent, with 90 vacancies on Federal courts \naround the country.\n  Senator Grassley and I have worked together to ensure that each of \nthe 27 nominations on the Senate calendar was fully considered by the \nJudiciary Committee after a thorough but fair process. We have worked \nhard to ensure that the Committee continues to makes progress on \nnominations. Our cooperation and work on the Committee makes the \ncontinuing extensive and unexplained delays in the Senate's \nconsideration of judicial nominations even harder to understand.\n  These delays are damaging to the Federal courts and the American \npeople who depend on them. A recent report by the nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service found that we are in the longest period \nof historically high vacancy rates in the last 35 years. The number of \njudicial vacancies has been at or above 90 for well over 2 years. We \nmust bring an end to these needless delays in the Senate so that our \nFederal courts can better serve the American people.\n  More than half of all Americans--almost 170 million--live in \ndistricts or circuits that have a judicial vacancy that could be filled \ntoday if the Senate Republicans just agreed to vote on the nominations \nnow pending on the Senate calendar. As many as 25 States are served by \nFederal courts with vacancies that would be filled by these \nnominations. Millions of Americans across the country are harmed by \ndelays in overburdened courts. The Republican leadership should \napologize to the American people or at least explain why they will not \nconsent to vote on the qualified, consensus candidates nominated to \nfill these extended judicial vacancies.\n  In recent letters to the Senate Majority Leader and Republican \nleader, ABA President Bill Robinson highlighted the problems created by \nthese excessive vacancies on the Federal courts, writing:\n\n       Filling existing vacancies on the federal bench has become \n     a matter of increasing urgency. Across the nation, federal \n     courts with high caseloads and longstanding or multiple \n     vacancies have no choice but to delay or temporarily suspend \n     their civil dockets due to Speedy Trial Act requirements. \n     This deprives our federal courts of the capacity to deliver \n     timely justice in civil matters and has real consequences for \n     the financial well-being of businesses and for individual \n     litigants whose lives are put on hold pending resolution of \n     their disputes.\n       Nothing less than a sustained, concerted, and cooperative \n     effort will be sufficient to make discernible progress in \n     reducing the longstanding and dangerously high vacancy rate \n     on the federal courts. And, as important, nothing less will \n     assure litigants--businesses and aggrieved individuals \n     alike--that our federal courts have sufficient judges to hear \n     their cases in a timely and thorough fashion.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of Mr. Robinson's October 13 \nletters to the Senate leaders be included at the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The Presiding OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Those of us serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee are \nmaking this kind of ``sustained, concerted, and cooperative effort.'' \nRegrettably, that effort is not duplicated by the Senate, because the \nSenate Republican leadership continues to object, stall and delay \nconsideration of these much-needed judges.\n  This is not a partisan issue. Two weeks ago in a hearing before the \nJudiciary Committee, Justice Scalia agreed that the extensive delays in \nthe confirmation process are already having a chilling effect on the \nability to attract talented nominees to the Federal bench. Chief \nJustice Roberts has also described the ``persistent problem of judicial \nvacancies in critically overworked districts.'' Hardworking Americans \nare denied justice when their cases are delayed by overburdened courts. \nWhile people appearing in court are waiting years before a judge rules \non their case, they feel they are being forced to live the old adage \n``justice delayed is justice denied.''\n  I have heard Republican Senators come to the floor purporting to \njustify their delays by selectively pointing to past instances in which \nDemocratic Senators opposed a handful of President Bush's most \nideological nominations. Their misguided attempt to go ``tit for tat'' \nand settle a political score on nominations ignores the realities of \nthe crisis in judicial vacancies created by their delays. They ignore \nthe fact that President Obama's current nominees are not divisive, \nideological picks, but consensus, qualified nominees who are being \nblocked across the board for no good reason.\n  Senate Republicans also ignore the actual record on nominations \nestablished by Senate Democrats in considering President Bush's \nnominations. In the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee during \nPresident Bush's first 2 years in office, the Senate proceeded to \nconfirm 100 of his judicial nominees. In stark contrast, it has taken \nus twice as long--34 months--to confirm just over 100 of President \nObama's judicial nominations. In President Bush's first term we \nconfirmed a total of 205 Federal circuit and district court judges. As \nof today, we have almost 100 confirmations of President Obama's circuit \nand district court nominations to go in order to match that total \nduring the next 12 months. Given the obstruction and delays during \nthese first 3 years of President Obama's administration, we have a lot \nof ground to make up and\n\n[[Page S6584]]\n\nneed to get started if the Senate is to be as productive as we were \nduring President Bush's first term.\n  Democrats did not go ``tit for tat'' on nominations during President \nBush's first years in office. Even though Senate Republicans pocket \nfilibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominations \nand refused to proceed on them while judicial vacancies skyrocketed to \nmore than 110, we proceeded. As I have noted, we confirmed 100 in 17 \nmonths during President Bush's first 2 years. Now, however, Senate \nRepublicans have not built on that progress and bipartisan cooperation \nbut have returned, instead, to their practices of obstruction in order \nto hold judicial vacancies open, rather than confirm the nominations of \na Democratic President. And as a result, judicial vacancies have \nskyrocketed, again. At this point in President Bush's first term we had \nconfirmed 162 Federal circuit and district court judges, and the \nvacancy rate was down to 5 percent, with 46 vacancies. Vacancies are \nnow twice as high with a vacancy rate of nearly 11 percent and \nvacancies again at 90, where they have been for well over 2 years.\n  This is not the way to make real progress. In the past, we were able \nto confirm consensus nominees more promptly, often within days of being \nreported to the full Senate. They were not forced to languish for \nmonths. The American people should not have to wait weeks and months \nfor the Senate to fulfill its constitutional duty and ensure the \nability of our Federal courts to provide justice to Americans around \nthe country.\n  There is no good reason for the Republican refusal to consent to \nvotes on three circuit court nominations which were favorably reported \nby the Judiciary Committee many months ago. We should be able to have a \ndebate and vote on the nomination of Caitlin Halligan, the superbly \nqualified nominee to the ninth seat on the D.C. Circuit reported by the \nJudiciary Committee over seven months ago. She is a highly-respected \nappellate litigator who has excelled in private practice and public \nservice, including 6 years as Solicitor General of the State of New \nYork, and her nomination has the strong support of law enforcement and \na number of prominent conservative lawyers. With a new vacancy on that \ncourt, it is now more than one-quarter vacant. Four of President Bush's \nD.C. Circuit nominees were confirmed to that Court, twice filling the \ntenth seat and once filling the eleventh seat. There is no reason we \ncannot now confirm President Obama's first D.C. Circuit nominee to fill \nthe ninth seat.\n  There is also no reason for the Senate to have been required by \nRepublican objection to have skipped the nominations of Stephen \nHigginson of Louisiana to the Fifth Circuit and Christopher Droney of \nConnecticut to the Second Circuit. Each has been nominated to fill a \njudicial emergency vacancy and each was reported unanimously by the \nCommittee three months ago and before the nomination being considered \ntoday. In fact the Senate has only been allowed to consider 5 circuit \ncourt nominations this entire Congress. This stands in sharp contrast \nto the 17 circuit court nominations in 17 months that we confirmed when \nI chaired the Judiciary Committee in 2001 and 2002 and President Bush \nwas in the White House.\n  The delays which have led to the damaging backlog in judicial \nnominations are compounded by attempts by Senate Republicans to use \ninvented controversies to damage qualified nominees. The decision by \nthe entire Republican caucus to vote against the nomination of Alison \nNathan to the Southern District of New York last week reminded me of \nthe shameful party line vote which defeated President Clinton's nominee \nof Justice Ronnie White of Missouri in 1999. Even though Alison \nNathan's nomination had been reported in July with the support of half \nof the Republican members of the Committee, last week those Senators \nflipped their votes and all Republican Senators voted as a bloc against \nconfirming her to the Federal bench. That was extraordinary. \nFortunately, they did not prevail and Judge Nathan, an accomplished, \nimpressive nominee, was confirmed. She deserved better treatment by \nSenate Republicans, not their party line opposition.\n  Today the Senate finally considers the nomination of Cathy Bissoon. \nShe will make a superb addition to the Federal bench. She is already \nwell-known on the court to which she is nominated, having served as a \nMagistrate Judge for the Western District of Pennsylvania since 2008, \nwhen she became the first Hispanic woman appointed to that role. She \nalso clerked for Judge Lancaster of the Western District following law \nschool. Judge Bissoon worked in private practice for 14 years at Cohen \n& Grigsby and Reed Smith in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Both of \nPennsylvania's Senators support her nomination. Senator Casey, in \nparticular, has worked very hard to help us get to this day. The \nJudiciary Committee favorably reported Judge Bissoon's nomination \nwithout dissent in July. When confirmed, she will be the first Hispanic \nwoman to serve the Western District of Pennsylvania as a Federal judge.\n  I hope we can consider additional judicial nominations this week to \naddress the serious judicial vacancies crisis on Federal courts around \nthe country that has persisted for over 2 years. We can and must do \nbetter for the nearly 170 million Americans being made to suffer by \nthese unnecessary Senate delays.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                     American Bar Association,\n\n                                    Chicago, IL, October 13. 2011.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Republican Leader McConnell: I am writing on behalf of \n     the American Bar Association to commend you on the \n     confirmation of ten judges during the past two weeks. Your \n     agreement with Senator McConnell allowed a higher number of \n     judges to be confirmed than in any prior month this Congress. \n     Moreover, your scheduling of the first six nomination votes \n     on the same day was a welcome departure from the general \n     pattern observed this Congress of considering only one or two \n     nominees at a time. We strongly encourage you to continue to \n     schedule same-day votes on multiple nominees throughout the \n     rest of the session. Nothing less than a sustained, \n     concerted, and cooperative effort will be sufficient to make \n     discernible progress in reducing the longstanding and \n     dangerously high vacancy rate on the federal courts. And, as \n     important, nothing less will assure litigants--businesses and \n     aggrieved individuals alike--that our federal courts have \n     sufficient judges to hear their cases in a timely and \n     thorough fashion.\n       Filling existing vacancies on the federal bench has become \n     a matter of increasing urgency. Across the nation, federal \n     courts with high caseloads and longstanding or multiple \n     vacancies have no choice but to delay or temporarily suspend \n     their civil dockets due to Speedy Trial Act requirements. \n     This deprives our federal courts of the capacity to deliver \n     timely justice in civil matters and has real consequences for \n     the financial well-being of businesses and for individual \n     litigants whose lives are put on hold pending resolution of \n     their disputes.\n       The effect of the recent confirmations on the overall \n     vacancy rate amply attests to the need for continued \n     bipartisan action to achieve progress. On September 7, the \n     day after the Senate's first confirmation vote since its \n     return from the August recess, there were 91 vacancies on the \n     federal bench. Despite the recent confirmation of ten judges, \n     there are 92 vacancies on the bench today because of recent \n     retirements and a death. Regrettably, this outcome is not an \n     aberration or product of selective statistical reporting; \n     even though the Senate has confirmed from one to seven judges \n     every month this Congress, the vacancy rate continues to \n     hover around 10 percent--right where it has been for the past \n     24 months.\n       However, if the Senate were to confirm by the end of this \n     month the 29 nominees currently pending on the floor who were \n     reported from the Judiciary Committee by bipartisan voice \n     vote, the vacancy rate would drop to approximately seven \n     percent, absent unanticipated events. That would be a real \n     accomplishment.\n       We urge you to build on your recent success by continuing \n     to reach agreements to schedule multiple nominees for votes \n     on the same day at regular intervals throughout the remainder \n     of this session. Given the long-term backlogs, it is \n     important that confirmations outpace attrition and that the \n     Senate has the opportunity to achieve significant success in \n     reducing the vacancy rate and providing the federal judiciary \n     with the judges it needs to evaluate each case on its merits \n     and dispense timely justice to all.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Wm. T. (Bill) Robinson III,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on the \nnomination of Cathy Bissoon to be U.S. District Judge for the Western \nDistrict\n\n[[Page S6585]]\n\nof Pennsylvania. Today's vote marks the 49th judicial confirmation this \nyear and the 11th in just 2 weeks.\n  In committee we continue to achieve great progress as well. Eighty-\nfour percent of the judicial nominees submitted this Congress have been \nafforded hearings. We have reported 77 percent of the judicial \nnominees. We have another hearing scheduled for later this week, our \n16th nomination hearing of this year. In total, the committee has taken \npositive action on 85 of the 98 nominees submitted this Congress, or 87 \npercent.\n  Let me say just a few words about the nominee we are considering \ntoday.\n  Judge Bissoon graduated summa cum laude from Alfred University with a \nbachelor of arts in 1990. In 1993, she earned her juris doctorate from \nHarvard Law School. Judge Bissoon began her career at Reed Smith in \nPittsburgh, PA, and then clerked for Judge Gary Lancaster of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n  Following her clerkship, Judge Bissoon returned to private practice \nat Reed Smith where she worked primarily with employment and labor \nlitigation. Judge Bissoon also served as the Firmwide director of \ndiversity and as the firmwide practice group leader of Reed Smith's \nemployment practice group. From 2007 to 2008, Judge Bissoon continued \nto practice employment and labor law as the Director and Department \nhead of the labor group at Cohen & Grigsby.\n  In August 2008, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nPennsylvania appointed Judge Bissoon as a U.S. magistrate judge.\n  Judge Bissoon received a unanimous ``Qualified'' rating from the ABA \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary.\n  I support this nomination and congratulate her on her professional \naccomplishments.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I see the senior Senator from Pennsylvania wishes to \nspeak. I will yield to him in a moment.\n  First, I ask consent that I speak briefly about the Transportation \nand Highway appropriation bill the Senate is going to next be debating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I want to thank the subcommittee chair, Senator Murray, \nand the ranking member, Senator Collins, for all the assistance they \nprovided to me on several issues that are important to Vermont, \nespecially in the wake of Hurricane Irene's massive devastation a few \nweeks ago. I have talked on the floor many times about what happened in \nVermont with Hurricane Irene.\n  I was born in Vermont. I have never seen anything like this. It \nreminds me of the story my grandparents told me of a flood in the early \n20th century. We have seen roads, bridges, businesses, homes, farms all \nover the State wiped out, with repair estimates topping nearly $900 \nmillion.\n  My wife and I have gone all over the State. I have gone with the \nGovernor, adjutant general, and others, seeing things that literally \nbrought me to tears in our beautiful State. Getting hit like that, it \nis very clear, as I have talked to the people working, that everybody \nhas pitched in. Whether they are from the town that got hit or the next \ntown over that might not have been hit, everybody has pitched in.\n  It is clear in our little State of 660,000 people we are stretched to \nthe limit. If we don't have adequate Federal disaster recovery aid, \nVermont will not have the resources needed to rebuild the lifelines \ndestroyed--the homes, roads, and businesses represented in the daily \nlives of so many Vermonters and their communities.\n  Several Federal disaster programs are woefully underfunded. The \nhighway administration emergency relief fund has less than $140 million \nin reserves. It has a backlog of more than $2 billion to repair \nprojects from previous disasters, including $700 million from Vermont. \nHUD had no funding available to provide Community Development Block \nGrant funding to help our State rebuild. So I pushed hard for the $1.9 \nbillion in emergency highway funding and for the vital State waivers \nthat allow States to access the crucial repair work they need without \noverly restrictive cost sharing. I talked to the Governor, Senator \nSanders, Congressman Welch, other State and municipal officials about \nVermont's rebuilding needs.\n  The Governor was down here last week. We sat in my office to talk \nabout the rebuilding needs. These waivers are always at the top of the \npriority list or our State is going to be devastated.\n  There are also in this bill provisions that will permanently shift \ntrucks from overburdened State secondary roads, some of which are now \ndirt roads because of the flooding. They wind through many downtowns \nacross our State's interstate highways. This will especially help \nVermont businesses and communities that are struggling most from the \nlarge number of State and local roads heavily damaged by Irene. I was \nglad to work with Senator Collins to include the Vermont provision and \nany similar provision for Maine. Again, bipartisan cooperation has \nsucceeded.\n  We included $400 million in emergency CDBG funding. It is a critical \ndownpayment to address housing needs of those hurt by Irene and the \nflooding this past spring. We have to do this right away. It will be \nsnowing in Vermont in a matter of weeks. Today is a beautiful day. I \nhave been there long enough to know, if you don't like the weather, \nwait a minute, it will change. We have to get people back in their \nhomes. Vermonters are working hard to make the necessary funding, but \nwe need this. We need this help.\n  As a Vermonter said to me: Senator, it appears we can spend unlimited \namounts of money to rebuild roads and bridges in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nand they just blow them up. Can't we find even a small portion of that \nmoney to rebuild roads and bridges and homes in America by Americans \nfor Americans? And Americans will protect them.\n  I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania, and I \nyield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the nomination \nof Judge Cathy Bissoon, and I ask unanimous consent to speak for no \nmore than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I first of all want to thank Senator Leahy, \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for working with both parties \nto move these nominations along. I also want to thank Senator Toomey, \nmy colleague from Pennsylvania, for his work and cooperation in moving \nour Pennsylvania judicial nominees forward. I am grateful for his help \nand cooperation.\n  I rise to speak about Judge Cathy Bissoon, who is a daughter of \nBrooklyn, NY. She was born there and became a Pennsylvanian after law \nschool. Cathy Bissoon is of Hispanic origin. Her mother was from the \nWest Indies and her dad was from Puerto Rico.\n  When she was 4 years old and living in the Williamsburg section of \nBrooklyn, her father was stabbed to death in a park blocks from her \nhome. Her mother remarried and her family moved to Queens. As I \nmentioned before, she moved to Pittsburgh after law school. This is a \nremarkable American story. It is an American story of economic \nachievement, of overcoming obstacles, and of striving for excellence.\n  Her educational background is stellar as well. She received her \njurist doctorate degree in 1993 from Harvard Law School, after \nreceiving her degree in political science summa cum laude in 1990 from \nAlfred University in Alfred, NY.\n  A quick summary of her career is as follows:\n  Her service as a U.S. magistrate judge for the Western District of \nPennsylvania, a position that she held in the Court's Pittsburgh \ndivision since the year 2008.\n  From 2007 until her appointment to the bench, Judge Bissoon was in \nprivate practice in Pittsburgh as a director of the law firm of Cohen & \nGrigsby, where she served as the head of the labor and employment \ngroup.\n  Previously she was a partner in the law firm of Reed Smith from 2001 \nto 2007 and an associate in that same firm beginning in 1993.\n  So she has a long record of service as a lawyer and advocate and \nsomeone whose career has been marked by distinction in the law as well \nas a judge.\n  She also served as the Reed Smith law firm director of diversity. It \nwas a diversity initiative she developed to recruit, retain, and \npromote minority lawyers.\n\n[[Page S6586]]\n\n  From 1994 to 1995 she was a law clerk for the Honorable Gary L. \nLancaster of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nPennsylvania.\n  This is a nomination that has not only received bipartisan support, \nbut it is a nomination I think we can all be proud to advance and vote \non today.\n  I urge all my colleagues to give an affirmative vote to Judge \nBissoon.\n  I know we are limited to time. As my colleague, Senator Toomey, \nmentioned a couple of moments ago, we will be moving, we hope, soon to \nthe consideration of two other nominees, and I want to make some \ncomments for the Record for both of those.\n  Mark Hornak was born in Homestead, PA. He received his law degree \nsumma cum laude in 1981 from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law \nand graduated second in his class and was editor-in-chief of the \nUniversity of Pittsburgh Law Review.\n  He received his undergraduate degree cum laude in 1978 from the \nUniversity of Pittsburgh and was a member of Omicron Delta Kappa \nHonorary Society, a National Merit Scholar, and on the dean's list.\n  He has been a partner in the law firm of Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney \nsince 1982 where he specialized in media, defense, governmental \nrepresentation, and is a member of the firm's executive committee.\n  As I said before, I will include other references to his career as a \nlawyer and advocate. I have known Mark for a long time. I know him to \nbe a person of integrity and someone who would serve our State with \ndistinction in the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n  Finally, someone I have known for over 20 years, Robert David \nMariani. Bob has been in practice as a civil litigator in my hometown \nof Scranton for some 34 years. His educational background is equally as \ndistinguished as our other nominees. He received his law degree cum \nlaude in 1976 from Syracuse University College of Law and his \nundergraduate degree in 1972 from Vilanova University, also cum laude.\n  Since 2001, he has been the sole shareholder in the law firm of \nRobert D. Mariani P.C. He has been an instructor for 5 years in the \nUnion Leadership Academy Program sponsored by Penn State University, \nand was sole proprietor in his own law firm from 1993 to 2001. Of \ncourse, he was a partner in the same firm, or a similar firm by the \nname of Mariani & Greco from 1993.\n  When my father served as Governor of Pennsylvania, he nominated Bob \nto fill a vacancy on the Pennsylvania Superior Court. It was a great \nhonor. I know how high his standards were. Bob Mariani comes to this \nappointment with great distinction, a long and distinguished career in \nthe law, and I know he will be a great judge in the Middle District of \nPennsylvania.\n  I will conclude by saying I could say more about Judge Bissoon, Mark \nHornak, and Bob Mariani, but their record will be amplified by written \ncommentary of their achievements, and I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a more thorough summary of their qualifications \nat this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Cathy Bissoon\n\n       Birthplace: Brooklyn, New York.\n       Hispanic, mother from the West Indies, father was Puerto \n     Rican.\n       When she was 4 years old and living in Williamsburg, \n     Brooklyn, her father was stabbed to death in a park blocks \n     from her home.\n       Her mother remarried and her family moved to Queens.\n       Moved to Pittsburgh after law school.\n       Education: Received her J.D. in 1993 from Harvard Law \n     School, and her B.A. Political Science (summa cum laude) in \n     1990 from Alfred University in Alfred, New York.\n       Career:\n       Serves as United States Magistrate Judge for the Western \n     District of Pennsylvania, a position she has held in the \n     Court's Pittsburgh Division since 2008.\n       From 2007 until her appointment to the bench, she was in \n     private practice in Pittsburgh as a director of the law firm \n     of Cohen & Grigsby, where she served as the head of the Labor \n     & Employment Group.\n       Previously was a partner in the law firm of Reed Smith from \n     2001 to 2007 and an associate at the same firm beginning in \n     1993.\n       Served as Reed Smith's Director of Diversity for six years, \n     a diversity initiative she developed to recruit, retain and \n     promote more minorities.\n       From 1994 to 1995, she was a law clerk to the Honorable \n     Gary L.

I will be back to talk to the substance of my amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise this evening to discuss an \namendment numbered 757 that I have offered with my colleague from \nColorado, Senator Mark Udall, that would protect the flexibility of \nschools to serve healthy vegetables in the National School Lunch and \nSchool Breakfast Programs. This is a bipartisan amendment that we are \noffering. It is cosponsored by Senators Crapo, Risch, Snowe, Ayotte, \nWyden, Johanns, Nelson of Nebraska, Mikulski, and Hoven.\n  Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture proposed a rule \nthat would limit servings of a certain category of vegetables that \nincludes white potatoes, corn, peas, and lima beans. It would limit \nthem to a total of one cup per week in the National School Lunch \nProgram.\n  The proposed rule would also ban this category of vegetables \naltogether from the School Breakfast Program. Our bipartisan amendment \nwould prevent the Department of Agriculture from moving forward with \nthis arbitrary limitation. I am concerned the proposed rule would \nimpose significant cuts on schools and would limit the flexibility they \nneed to serve nutritious, affordable meals to their students.\n  For those who are less familiar with this issue, let me give my \ncolleagues some background. Current law already requires the School \nLunch and School Breakfast Programs to follow the most recent dietary \nguidelines for Americans. Last year, the USDA released the newest \ndietary guidelines that call for all Americans of all ages to eat more \nvegetables.\n  The 2010 dietary guidelines list four nutrients of concern. They are \npotassium, dietary fiber, calcium, and vitamin D. The guidelines state \nthat dietary intake of these four nutrients are low enough to be of \npublic health concern for both adults and children.\n  Since USDA is concerned about a lack of these nutrients in the \nAmerican diet, it would make sense for the Department to promote good \nsources of these critical nutrients. Yet the USDA's proposed rule would \nactually limit vegetables that are good sources of these nutrients. \nUSDA should not limit their availability but instead should encourage \ntheir healthy preparation.\n  For example, here are some nutritional facts about potatoes that are \noften overlooked. Potatoes have more potassium than bananas, a food \ncommonly associated with this nutrient. Potatoes are cholesterol free, \nlow in fat and sodium, and can be served in countless healthy ways. In \nfact, a medium baked potato contains 15 percent of the daily \nrecommended value of fiber--that is one of those nutrients of concern--\n27 percent of the daily recommended value for vitamin B6, 28 percent of \nthe daily recommended amount of vitamin C. This is a great nutritional \nbargain at about a nickel per serving.\n  I am going to go on and discuss the rest of the problems with this \nrule and the solution, but I know my colleague from Colorado is under a \ntime constraint. So at this point I am going to yield to him, my \npartner in this endeavor, for his statement. Then I will reclaim the \nfloor and continue with my discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin.) The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank the Senator from Maine for her \ngraciousness and for her leadership on this important amendment that \nshe and I brought to the floor. Clearly, the 2012 Agriculture \nappropriations bill that will direct the USDA to provide adequate \nflexibility to schools to deliver students nutritious school meals \nwhile effectively managing costs is very important. But we have to do \nit in the right way. I want to share my thinking on what the right way \nis.\n\n[[Page S6588]]\n\n  In January of this year the USDA issued a proposed rule for \nnutritional standards in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast \nPrograms that would limit total servings of certain vegetables--most \nnotably potatoes, corn, green peas, and lima beans--to one cup per week \nand eliminate potatoes from school breakfasts.\n  I have heard from school lunch providers in Colorado that this \nrestriction will result in significant challenges for food service \noperations through increased costs, reduced flexibility, and decreased \nschool meal participation. This is especially concerning for them in my \nState, and I think as the Senator from Maine has pointed out, all over \nour country because school districts are facing increasingly tight \nbudgets.\n  Many children from Colorado and across the Nation depend on school \nmeal programs to keep them nourished and ready to learn. That is why it \nis important for school meals to include healthy food options while \nalso allowing sufficient flexibility to school meal providers to help \nbuild a foundation for healthy eating going forward.\n  In order to achieve this goal, a very worthy goal, it is important \nthat we implement the bipartisan child nutrition reauthorization the \nCongress passed last year. In order to ensure that implementation is \nsuccessful for both kids and schools, it is important the USDA takes \ninto consideration the insights and the experiences of those who are in \nthe school cafeterias every day across America serving meals to our \nchildren. These are well-trained and qualified individuals who see our \nchildren, our students, on a daily basis. They know their parents, and \nthey very well may be parents of students themselves.\n  Here is what they are saying. I will read to you from a letter the \nColorado School Nutrition Association sent me recently regarding this \nproposed rule:\n\n       We believe it is a realistic and attainable goal to create \n     meal plans that meet the current dietary guidelines for \n     Americans while allowing schools the flexibility to manage \n     cost and maintain student participation. Improved nutrition \n     is a vital aspect of our nation's health, one which we \n     heartily support, and we believe it can be accomplished \n     without significant damage to the programs we are trying to \n     improve and without additional strain on local schools.\n\n  That is what the Collins-Udall amendment intends to do. It would \ndirect the USDA to not set maximum limits on the frequency that schools \ncan serve any one fruit or vegetable while allowing schools to continue \nto moderate portion size appropriately. Our amendment will also ensure \nthat schools have the flexibility to serve healthy fruits and \nvegetables in a manner consistent with guidelines established jointly \nby the USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services, called the \nDietary Guidelines for Americans.\n  Some wonder why Senator Collins and I have taken such issue with this \nproposed rule. Yes, we both do come from potato-producing States. We \nboth believe potatoes have gotten a bad rap. The truth is, when \nprepared properly, the potato can provide critical nutrients to \nstudents that will help them lead healthy lives and be ready to learn \nin the classrooms.\n  In some areas, increased flexibility to serve this nutritious and \navailable vegetable can actually help schools manage costs so they can \nafford to purchase other more expensive vegetables. Where I believe \nschool meal providers, potato producers, and health advocates can agree \nis that this issue is less about any one vegetable and more about the \npreparation of the vegetable. Anything can be fried or drowned in any \nnumber of fats available to us as consumers. Let's be honest.\n  Even Agriculture Secretary Vilsack agreed in testimony before the \nSenate Agriculture Appropriations Committee that it is not the potato, \nit is the way in which potatoes are being prepared and provided. We \nshould be encouraging schools to prepare potatoes and other fruits and \nvegetables appropriately, not limiting their flexibility and \npotentially increasing their cost unnecessarily.\n  I have spent a good portion of my time in Congress working to promote \nphysical activity, getting children and families into the great \noutdoors and reducing the amount of time children spend in front of the \nTV and video games. Through my Healthy Kids From Day One Act and the \nNational Kids to Parks Initiative I have focused on getting kids to eat \nhealthier and become more active.\n  Another way we promote healthy lifestyles is making sure kids have \naccess to needed nutrients and balanced meals. That is why Congress \ndirected the USDA to ensure that all fruits and vegetables are part of \nFederal food nutrition programs, particularly the school meal programs.\n  I believe, and I know Senator Collins believes, there is a balance we \ncan find, a balance that preserves needed flexibility for our cash-\nstrapped schools but also preserves guidelines that will ensure our \nkids are getting the best nutrients possible in their school meals, \nincluding from the potato.\n  So instead of pointing fingers, we need to provide commonsense \nsolutions that help school kids and their parents make wise choices \nthat in turn will make a healthier America.\n  A healthy country is a strong country. I believe this amendment is an \nimportant tool to ensure that our schools can be an active and \neffective participant in ensuring our children are healthy, well cared \nfor, and ready to become the next leaders in our goal of winning the \nglobal economic race.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine for yielding time to me. I look \nforward to working with her, to reaching a successful conclusion, and \nto our amendment being agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for his \nexcellent remarks. Both of us share the goal that all Americans share \nfor our children--making sure they get a healthy diet. For many \nchildren, it is so critical that the School Lunch and School Breakfast \nPrograms provide that diet.\n  Unfortunately, in many ways USDA's rule does not comply with the \ndietary guidelines which recognize that Americans of all ages tend to \nbe short on two particular nutrients, potassium and fiber, and potatoes \nare abundant in providing those.\n  When we think of potassium, most of us think of bananas. In fact, as \nthis chart shows, a potato actually has far more potassium than a \nbanana. Indeed, ironically, the Dietary Guidelines for all Americans \nincludes an appendix exclusively listing foods that are rich in \npotassium. A baked potato is the first vegetable listed because it is \nsuch an excellent source of potassium.\n  Potatoes can also serve as vehicles for other vegetables. I recently \ndiscussed this issue with the director of school nutrition for two \ncommunities in Maine, York and Kittery. Her name is Doris Demers. She \ntold me the kids in her school system rave about the baked potato bar, \nwhere they can load baked potatoes with broccoli, shaved carrots, \nchives, salsa, vegetarian chili, beans, and many other healthful items. \nDoris also pointed out to me that this is a particularly popular option \nfor students who are vegetarians, and they are seeing an increasing \nnumber of students who are vegetarians in their school system.\n  Yet if this rule were to go into effect, a school serving a medium \nbaked potato on Monday would be prevented from serving a full portion \nof potatoes or corn at any other lunch during that week. Think how \nabsurd that result is. These two vegetables--corn and potatoes--are \ncentral to a variety of dishes, such as soups, stews, chowders, and \nShepherd's pie.\n  One food service director told me of her school's attempt to get \nchildren to eat fresh whole foods rather than heavily processed foods. \nThus, she developed a farm to school program in cooperation with a \nlocal farmer.\n  The students went out into the field, picked the corn, husked it \nthemselves, and were served the corn for lunch, enjoying the experience \nof consuming wholesome, locally grown food. Yet, as she pointed out to \nme, the USDA's proposed rule would prevent her from serving an ear of \nfresh corn one day of the week and a baked potato another day of the \nsame week. That is an utterly absurd result. That is why people get so \nfrustrated with some of the regulations that come out of Washington.\n  I am also very concerned about the impact on the School Breakfast \nProgram. It is a voluntary program, unlike the School Lunch Program. \nSome school districts could be forced to drop out of the School \nBreakfast Program\n\n[[Page S6589]]\n\nas a direct result of this rule because it could increase costs by up \nto 50 cents per breakfast. If we start multiplying that across all the \nbreakfasts served by these school systems, we are soon talking about \nreal money. This would be a disaster if schools chose to terminate \ntheir participation in the School Breakfast Program for those students \nwho rely on this program. Only Washington could impose a rule that \npurports to improve school nutrition but actually causes schools to \ndrop out of the very program that is supposed to provide that \nnutrition.\n  In fact, many of our colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus in \nthe House have written to Secretary Vilsack expressing ``concerns \nregarding the new costs the proposed rule would impose on schools \neducating the highest percentage of low-income students.'' The letter \ngoes on to note:\n\n       For many low-income children, the best, if not all, of \n     their nutrition comes from programs (the USDA) administers.\n\n  The letter points out that many schools simply ``do not have the \nresources that may be diverted to meet such large cost increases.''\n  Research has shown us time and again that eating a healthy breakfast \nis critical to academic success. Eating breakfast also provides \nsignificant health benefits, as we all know. Not eating breakfast is \nassociated with excess body weight, especially among children and \nadolescents, and consuming breakfast has been associated with weight \nloss and improved nutrition.\n  I hope USDA will listen to the concerns voiced by the professionals \nwho manage these programs. The School Nutrition Association opposes \nthis restriction and ``believes that consumption of an array of fruits \nand vegetables should be encouraged,'' not limited.\n  The following organizations are opposing the USDA's proposed rule \nbecause it would increase costs and limit their flexibility: the \nAmerican Association of School Administrators, the National School \nBoards Association, the Council of Great City Schools, and the National \nAssociation of Elementary School Principals.\n  In my State, the Maine Department of Education, the Maine PTA, the \nMaine School Management Association, and the Maine Principals \nAssociation have all expressed their support for our amendment and \ntheir opposition to the USDA's ill-conceived rule. These groups \nrepresent school administrators, superintendents, school boards, and \nprincipals. They know; they oversee the school food service programs, \nand they understand the difficulties and costs this rule would cause. \nThe American Association of School Administrators, for example, wrote \nto express support for our amendment saying:\n\n       The overly prescriptive nature of the requirements for \n     providing fruits and vegetables increases the cost of meals \n     so drastically that school districts implementing the \n     changes, even receiving the higher reimbursement rate, would \n     still be covered for less than half of the incurred expenses.\n\n  The fact is, the proposed rule would impose significant and needless \ncosts on our Nation's school districts at a time when they can least \nafford it.\n  Listen to what the cost of this rule is estimated to be by the \nDepartment of Agriculture: The USDA estimates that this rule could cost \nas much as $6.8 billion over the next 5 years. The lion's share of that \ncost is going to fall on State and local agencies.\n  The costs associated with the proposed rule would also affect working \nfamilies who rely on the school meal programs. As the National \nAssociation of Elementary School Principals wrote me:\n\n       USDA's proposed nutritional guidelines will force schools \n     to raise paid meal prices.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of organizations in support be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I hope our colleagues will take a closer \nlook at this bipartisan amendment that Senator Udall and I are \noffering, with the support of many colleagues.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nCollins and Senator Udall to raise the concern of nutrition guidelines \nin our schools. This amendment aims to clarify school nutrition \nstandards to ensure that they appropriately reflect the USDA's Dietary \nGuidelines for Americans.\n  As you may know, on January 31, 2011, U.S. Department of Agriculture \nSecretary Tom Vilsack and Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services Kathleen Sebelius announced the release of the 2010 \nDietary Guidelines for Americans, the Federal Government's evidence-\nbased nutritional guidance to promote health, reduce the risk of \nchronic diseases, and reduce the prevalence of obesity through improved \nnutrition and physical activity. However, just 2 weeks prior, on \nJanuary 13, 2011, USDA released a proposed rule to improve nutrition \nrequirements for the National School Lunch Program and the School \nBreakfast Program to align them with the 2005 ``Dietary Guidelines for \nAmericans.''\n  This was bureaucratic confusion exemplified. Why not delay the \nproposed rule for our Federal meal programs by 2 weeks and instead \nrelease it to reflect the most recent nutrition guidelines that were \nissued on January 31? While I understand and agree with the necessity \nand desire to update the nutrition standards in schools, wouldn't it be \nmore effective to utilize the most recent, science-based guidelines to \nreflect those recommendations?\n  In my home State of Maine, like most in the Nation, we find ourselves \nstruggling with an obesity epidemic. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control, today in the United States, 64 percent of adults and \n28 percent of high school students are either overweight or obese. \nEqually, if not more disturbing, are the statistics revealing that only \n23 percent of adults and 21 percent of high school students eat at \nleast five servings of fruits and vegetables daily.\n  With more than 31 million children currently participating in the \nNational\n\n[[Page S6590]]\n\nSchool Lunch Program and more than 11 million participating in the \nNational School Breakfast Program, I believe that good nutrition within \nour Nation's schools is more important than ever. And that is all the \nmore pressing, given that many children consume at least half of their \ndaily calories at school, and for many students participating in these \nprograms, the food served at school may be the only food they regularly \neat.\n  For that, and many other reasons, I stand here today in support of \nSenate amendment No. 757. Specifically, the amendment would ensure that \nFederal school meal programs will be permitted to provide fruits and \nvegetables consistent with the most recent dietary guidelines.\n  Specifically, the recently proposed rule to improve nutrition \nrequirements for the National School Lunch Program and the School \nBreakfast Program would limit the total servings of starchy vegetables, \nincluding the white potato, to one cup per week and completely \neliminate those vegetables from school breakfasts. I am particularly \ndisturbed by this recommendation because they actually contradict the \nrecently published 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, as well as \nthe 2005 Dietary Guidelines they are supposed to reflect.\n  Our most recent national Dietary Guidelines--those released this past \nJanuary--simply state that ``intake by Americans of some nutrients is \nlow enough to be of public health concern. They are potassium, dietary \nfiber, calcium, and vitamin D.'' As you may know, there are few fruits \nor vegetables that contain the levels of potassium in potatoes. In \nfact, a medium potato--5.3 oz with the skin--is not only a good source \nof potassium, but also contains significantly more potassium--200 mg \nmore--than its nearest rival, the banana.\n  Additionally, one serving of potato has as much fiber as broccoli and \nprovides 13 percent of the daily recommended value. In an attempt to \ncombat these deficiencies the 2010 Dietary Guidelines recommend that \nall Americans, including school age children, consume 5 cups of starchy \nvegetables a week. This is an increase in recommended consumption from \nthe recommendations of the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for 3 cups of \nstarchy vegetables per week. And yet the proposed rule would limit the \ntotal number of servings of starchy vegetables to one cup per week in \nour school lunch program, which is entirely inconsistent with the 2005 \nand 2010 Dietary Guideline recommendations.\n  I believe that it is clear that potatoes are a nutrient powerhouse, \nand the fact that the white potato offers 13 percent of a child's daily \npotassium requirements for less than 5 cents per serving provides \nfurther support for keeping potatoes in school meals, especially during \nchallenging budgetary times. The Federal Government should allow our \nstruggling schools to make fiscally responsible choices that offer the \nmost nutritional return on investment. In fact, USDA has estimated that \nthe proposed meal plan will increase school lunch costs by $6.8 billion \nover 5 years, and it cannot be denied that a significant part of this \nincrease is due to the limit on potatoes. Limiting starchy vegetables \nto 1 cup per week will increase costs by approximately 5.6 percent with \npossible adverse affects on nutritional quality.\n  It has been well documented that, currently, nine out of ten \nAmericans are not achieving vegetable and fruit consumption \nrecommendations. I am disappointed that during such a time, that the \nUSDA would propose rules denying our nation's youth access to nutrient-\nrich foods as part of the National School Lunch and School Breakfast \nprograms.\n  And let me just say before the issue is raised that no one is arguing \nin favor of a diet based on french fries. The truth is--to combat the \nwave of obesity and promote more healthy food choices we must promote \nfood items that present a diverse set of vitamins and minerals. No \nmatter how they are prepared, potatoes are currently included in \nhealthy school meal plans to meet national dietary guidelines. Yet many \nAmericans seem to believe all potatoes served in schools are in the \nform of deep fried french fries.\n  This may have been the case at one time, but today, according to our \nown school food service administrators, most potatoes served in schools \nare baked, not fried. Like 80 percent of schools nationwide, the deep \nfryers in York and Kittery, ME schools, for example, were removed years \nago. As the school nutrition director of those schools, Ms. Doris \nDemers informed me recently that, in her 18 years working in school \nnutrition, she has never seen fryers in a Maine school nutrition \nprogram. When prepared properly, the potato is packed with nutrition \nand is a cost-effective option for the school lunch and breakfast \nprograms.\n  While I will continue to endeavor with my colleagues to support \nimproved nutritional standards for all Americans, I am concerned that \nmany throughout our nation cannot help but get confused about which \nguideline they should try to follow. For these reasons, I respectfully \nrequest that my colleagues join me in encouraging USDA to be consistent \non their nutritional advice to the American public--of all ages.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This is a bill that I introduced a couple weeks ago \nalong with Senators Leahy, Gillibrand, Menendez, Franken, and \nKlobuchar. I thank them. It is called the SSI Extension for Elderly and \nDisabled Refugees Act of 2011.\n  The Senate just passed this bill. I believe that is because it is a \ntruly worthy piece of legislation. It accomplishes three incredibly \nimportant objectives at the same time. First, the bill ensures that \napproximately 5,600 disabled refugees will not lose their life-\nsustaining benefits that are their only safety net protecting them from \nhomelessness, illness, and other effects of extreme poverty.\n  Many of these disabled refugees are people who have aided American \ntroops overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan and risked their lives for the \nAmerican cause. Others are victims of torture and human trafficking.\n\n  The bill continues the Bush administration policy of making sure this \nvulnerable group does not lose its only lifeline to stay afloat. But \nunlike past legislation, the second fact about the bill is it is fully \npaid for. It is paid for by imposing a $30 fee on individuals applying \nfor the diversity visa lottery program. Each year, hundreds of \nthousands of people apply to be one of the 50,000 selected to enter the \nUnited States. This program has had great success enriching the \nAmerican economy with immigrant businesses from countries that are not \ntraditionally represented in our immigrant pool. The one problem with \nthe program is that applying for a lottery ticket is free, and \nconsequently the program has recently been compromised by third parties \nfraudulently filing applications for monetary gain. The State \nDepartment has told me by charging a $30 fee to apply, we will \ncompletely eliminate this misconduct.\n  Finally, the third positive aspect of this bill is by setting the fee \nat $30, the Congressional Budget Office--our nonpartisan budget \nscorekeeper--projects we will actually reduce the deficit by $24 \nmillion.\n  In short, this bill hits the trifecta. It helps a very small and \ntargeted group of the most vulnerable and needy disabled individuals we \ntraditionally have helped, including many who helped us--helped our \ntroops--in both Afghanistan and Iraq and have come here on the refugee \nprogram. Second, it eliminates the misconduct in the diversity visa \nprogram, because once the $30 fee is imposed, the gamesmanship of those \nwho are gaming the system to make money will disappear. And finally, it \nreduces the Federal deficit by $24 million.\n  Because this bill is a win, win, win for all sides, I ask my \ncolleagues in the House take up and pass the bill immediately. The \nbenefit for the folks we are talking about expired on October 1. If the \nHouse does not act soon, we will not be able to undo the irreparable \nharm that will soon be done to these most vulnerable of individuals \nwhen they begin missing checks.\n  Again I want to thank my cosponsors, and particularly Senators Leahy \nand Grassley, chairman and ranking member of the relevant Judiciary \nCommittee, as well as Senators Baucus and Hatch of the Finance \nCommittee, and Senators Cornyn and Sessions of the Budget Committee, \nand Senator Cornyn, who is my ranking member on the Immigration \nSubcommittee, for allowing this bill to pass.\n  I also thank Senator Coburn for working with me to improve this bill. \nAnd, last but not least, I thank Senator Paul, who worked with me over \nthe last 2 weeks to address his concerns in a manner we both think will \nallow us to get more information to make the refugee program safer and \nmore efficient.\n  We will soon be doing something very good by passing this bill, by \ngetting it signed into law, and I hope the House will move quickly and \ndecisively to see that happens as quickly as possible.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6591-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6591-S6592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMBATING PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE EPIDEMIC\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the \nprescription drug abuse epidemic sweeping my State and the Nation. The \nrampant abuse and trafficking of prescription drugs represents a major \nthreat to public health and to law enforcement. In recent years, more \nOhioans have died from prescription drug overdoses than car accidents--\nlegal prescription drug overdoses, obtained illegally in many cases.\n  In 2008, statistics show oxycodone and other prescription drugs--\nnamely morphine-based drugs, such as Oxycontin and Percocet--caused \nmore overdoses in Ohio that year than heroin and cocaine combined. \nSimply put, prescription drug abuse is one of the\n\n[[Page S6592]]\n\nfastest growing drug problems in the Nation, resulting in ever \nincreasing rates of robberies and other attendant crimes.\n  Yesterday, I was in the Cleveland suburb of Fairview Park at Ohliger \nDrugs. That store has been a target in the last couple of years. I \nspoke with Tom Ohliger, the fourth generation owner of this drugstore, \nand he described being held up at gunpoint on more than one occasion.\n  There is a new report showing drug users and addicts are now \ntargeting seniors for help getting pain killers to feed their \naddiction. There is also a rise in the outright theft and stealing of \nthese drugs. We are seeing over and over on newscasts and in newspapers \nacross the State stories of addicts and criminals targeting pharmacies \nto obtain pain killers and prescription drugs.\n  Last month, in Parma--another Cleveland suburb--a man claiming to \nhave a weapon made off with more than $14,000 worth of prescription \npain killers before he was apprehended by the police.\n  That is why I worked with Senator Schumer and others on the \nStrengthening and Focusing Enforcement to Deter Organized Stealing and \nEnhance Safety--SAFE DOSES--Act. The bill would use Federal \nantiracketeering laws to arm law enforcement with the tools to stop and \nprosecute pharmaceutical theft and robberies.\n  Last year, as we toughened penalties for theft, we also cracked down \non the fraud and trafficking of prescription drugs. It also, of course, \ndealt with the human side of counseling, in education, to help people \nbreak that addiction.\n  Also last year, I convened a first-of-its-kind roundtable in southern \nOhio, where the problem has been most acute in my State, with Federal \nand local law enforcement, community activists, elected officials, and \nmembers of the medical community. They raised a concern with criminal \nmanipulation of Ohio's Medicaid Program, which spends upward of $800 \nmillion on prescription medicines.\n  While most prescription pain medicines are used as prescribed--after \nsurgery, after some kind of accident, often in the case of people with \nintense pain from some kind of acute illness--criminals too often have \ndefrauded the Medicaid system and fleeced Ohioans and America's \ntaxpayers by acquiring multiple prescriptions and filling them at \nmultiple pharmacies. That is why I introduced legislation to require \nall States to establish Medicaid ``lock-in'' programs to crack down on \nthe use of Medicaid cards to obtain and illegally sell these \nprescription drugs.\n  This bill would prevent drug abusers from acquiring excess legal \nprescription drugs, though they are not doing it legally--which they \nmay abuse or illegally resell--by barring them from visiting multiple \ndoctors and pharmacies.\n  It means high-risk prescription drug users would be placed in the \nprogram and they would only get Medicaid assistance when they are \nlimited to one physician and one pharmacy. States would also identify \nprescription drugs that are dispensed under Medicaid and represent a \nhigh risk of overutilization. Nearly 20 States have adopted similar \nprograms.\n  South Carolina's Medicaid lock-in program targeted high-use \nbeneficiaries and resulted in a 43-percent decrease in the total number \nof proscribed prescription pain medications.\n  Consider Scioto County, on the Ohio River. In this Ohio river town, \nprescription drugs cause 9 of every 10 fatal drug overdoses. In nearly \ntwo-thirds of those cases, the individuals involved did not have \nprescriptions, indicating they obtained the drugs illegally.\n  Recently, the Government Accountability Office audited the Medicaid \nProgram in the 5 largest States and found 65,000 cases in which \nMedicaid beneficiaries visited 6 or more doctors and up to 46 different \npharmacies to acquire prescriptions. This same report found some 1,800 \nprescriptions written for dead patients and 1,200 prescriptions \n``written'' by dead physicians. The numbers are staggering.\n  In southeast Ohio it has been particularly tragic. Old factory towns \nand rural communities have become havens for prescription drug abuse. \nAcross the country, communities are struggling to find ways to respond \nand develop strategies to reduce the diversion and abuse of \nprescription drugs.\n  Out of the often sad stories, there are successes. Last month, I was \nin Portsmouth, in Scioto County, which I mentioned earlier, at the \nSecond Chance Counseling Center. It has received critical Federal \nresources--not a lot of dollars but critical dollars--for a job \nretraining program for those recovering from abuse. The center is about \nsecond chances, combating the epidemic with the focus on recovery and \nrehabilitation--helping Ohioans with the resources they need to be the \nproductive citizens they want to be.\n  This past July I was at the Amethyst Family Treatment Residence in \nColumbus, with the Director of the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy, Gil Kerlikowske. We talked about the administration's \ncomprehensive prescription drug strategy and ways FDA can crack down on \nthe abuse. The staff at the residence--such as health professionals, \nlaw enforcement officials, and community activists--described the \nstories of victims and families they represent. I met with many of \nthose people who were going through these programs and are getting \ntheir lives back in order.\n  Prescription drug abuse and crime is nonpartisan. It is an issue of \nlife and death in too many parts of our Nation, and especially in my \nState. I wish to share three brief letters describing how this is a \nhuman tragedy above all else. It is a law enforcement issue, it is a \ncounseling of substance abuse issue, and it is an education issue, but \nfundamentally it is a human tragedy, with the addiction people have \nexperienced coupled with the crime that is often committed and \ncompounded with the defrauding of taxpayers.\n  Let me read three stories from letters that were sent to me from my \nState. The first is from a rural county, one from sort of a medium-\nsized county, and one from a large urban county.\n  David from Union County writes:\n\n       Our son David was a college graduate, 42 years old, a \n     father, and a husband for 18 years. He abused prescription \n     drugs because of a motorcycle accident 10 years earlier. He \n     was a 3 year clean drug addict because of all the support he \n     was given by so many caring individuals. He was pursuing his \n     master's degree with a 4.0 average, but in spite of all of \n     this, he passed away last May due to an accidental overdose \n     of oxycotin. We need to protect family members from the \n     heartbreak [and] pain that we are suffering because our son \n     made a bad mistake.\n\n  Amy, from Stark County, the Canton area, writes:\n\n       In our extended family, we have a close family member who \n     has become addicted to prescription drugs. The problem has \n     become so bad for our individual family member that she has \n     sought illegally obtained prescription drugs from dealers \n     from two counties away. I always believed that drug abuse was \n     something committed by rebellious, high-risk teenagers and \n     young adults. But prescription drug abuse is something that \n     can happen with much older adults who would ``know better.''\n\n  And then Tara from Lucas County--the Toledo area.\n\n       Through my previous job as the director of an anti-drug \n     coalition, I personally witnessed many families fall apart \n     because of prescription drug abuse. I will never forget the \n     day I visited my dear friend at the hospital because her 16 \n     year old son had overdosed on oxycontin. The average citizen \n     needs to be educated about proper disposal of their drugs, \n     and parents need to be made aware of this issue. Better \n     policing and controls around the transportation and \n     distribution of prescription drugs is definitely a key step; \n     however, we can all raise the importance over educating \n     ourselves, our schools, and our children about how to keep \n     this issue from persisting.\n\n  As I said, it is about law enforcement, it is about drug treatment, \nand it is about education. It is about all these things to end these \nhuman tragedies that cost taxpayer dollars, that inflict criminal \nactivity on innocent pharmacists and others, and that create so much \ntragedy for so many of my State's families and so many American \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6592-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6592-S6593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, in large and small communities across our \ncountry, way too many Americans find themselves placed in danger by the \nvery people who are supposed to love and protect them--their families. \nEach year, more than 2 million women are victims of domestic violence \nacross our\n\n[[Page S6593]]\n\ncountry. In Kansas, an estimated 1 in 10 adult women will suffer from \ndomestic abuse this year.\n  I am here this evening to try to give a voice to the hopeless--to \nthose who have often been too afraid to speak for themselves. Domestic \nviolence is not just a problem for women; children and men are all too \noften its victims as well. Throughout October, during Domestic Violence \nAwareness Month, we are especially mindful of these victims and the \nurgent need to put an end to the cycle of violence.\n  I imagine many Americans may assume that domestic violence does not \noccur in their neighborhoods or among their friends, with those with \nwhom they are acquainted. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Domestic \nviolence does not discriminate by race, gender, age group, education, \nor social status. Three years ago, citizens in my hometown of Hays, KS, \nlearned of the tragic death of a young woman from domestic violence.\n  Today, I wish to share with you the story of Jana Lynne Mackey. I \nshared Jana's story with my colleagues when I served in the House of \nRepresentatives, but it bears repeating because it is a solemn reminder \nof the urgent need to put an end to this so-called silent crime that \nplagues hundreds of thousands of homes across our country.\n  Jana was born in 1982 in Harper, KS, and spent her childhood in Hays. \nShe was an active member of 4-H, an athlete, and a talented musician. \nUpon graduation from high school, Jana completed a bachelor's degree, \nwhere she discovered her passion--advocating on the behalf of others.\n  She went on to pursue a law degree from the University of Kansas and \nfought for equality and social justice through her work with countless \norganizations, including volunteer work in Lawrence, KS, at the GaDuGi \nSafeCenter, a shelter that aids victims of sexual assault and domestic \nviolence. But 3 years ago, on July 3, 2008, at the young age of 25, \nJana's own life was taken by domestic violence.\n  More than 1,100 people gathered at Jana's memorial service to \ncelebrate her life. In her death, Jana's parents, Curt and Christie \nBrungardt, started the Eleven Hundred Torches Campaign to encourage \n1,100 people to carry on Jana's torch. Since its creation, the campaign \nhas attracted more than 1,100 volunteers who now make a difference in \nlives across the country through civic engagement and voluntarism. Yet \nthere is so much more that must be done.\n  Throughout our country, an estimated one in four women still suffers \nabuse during their lifetime. Domestic violence brings fear and \nhopelessness and depression into the lives of every victim. But we must \nnot only work to end this silent crime; also, we must care for those \nwho are the victims. By volunteering at a local shelter, speaking out \nwhen you become aware of domestic violence or making a donation to a \nlocal organization, every citizen can find a way to get involved and \nmake a difference.\n  This October, and throughout the year, let us be mindful of the \nvictims of domestic violence and do our part to help break the cycle \nand bring hope to those who suffer. Let each of us be a torch to see \nthat we bring about an end to domestic or family violence.\n  The tragedy of Jana's death is a rallying cry, calling each of us to \nmake a difference in the lives of others.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have said on a number of occasions that \ntrade is an incredibly important part of our economy, especially in my \nhome State of Iowa. For this reason, I am a longtime supporter of \npolicies designed to open foreign markets to our Nation's exports \nthrough new trade agreements. I have fought to break down the barriers \nthat many other countries have erected to block our exports, and I have \nsought to reduce the practices by which many of them seek to compete \nunfairly in world markets.\n  However, trade is more than just the shipment of goods and services \nacross borders. Trade policy and the impacts of trade also have wide \nranging consequences for workers and the environment inside the trading \ncountries. Properly designed, our trade policy can expand opportunities \nand promote the welfare of workers in both the United States and \nabroad. Ill-designed trade policy can have the opposite effect as well.\n  For this reason, I have to express my strong opposition to the free \ntrade agreement with Colombia. Simply put, Colombia is one of the most \ndangerous countries in the world to be a trade unionist. According to \nColombia's National Labor School, ENS, in the last 25 years, over 2,800 \nColombian trade unionists have been killed. According to the AFL-CIO, \n23 trade unionists have been assassinated this year alone in Colombia, \nincluding 16 since the conclusion of the labor action plan, which I \nwill speak more about later. The ENS also reports that over the last 10 \nyears, Colombian trade unionists have faced almost 4,000 death threats.\n  While some improvements have been made in recent years, the Colombian \ngovernment has not sought to hold those responsible for these brutal \ncrimes. According to the International Labor Organization's, ILO, High-\nlevel Tripartite Mission to Colombia, ``the majority of trade unionist \nkillings have not yet been investigated nor have the perpetrators, \nincluding the intellectual authors of these crimes, been brought to \njustice.'' ENS data indicates that since 1986, only 6 percent of the \ncases brought to trial have resulted in any convictions.\n  The current Colombian government led by President Santos has made \nsome progress. I believe that the Colombian action plan related to \nlabor rights that the Obama administration negotiated with the Santos \nadministration is a step in the right direction. If the changes that \nthe Santos administration have begun making are continued, and the \nlabor action plan is fully implemented and enforced, Colombia will have \nmade significant progress to addressing many of my concerns.\n  But given all that I have described earlier, it would be \nirresponsible of us to rush into a free trade agreement before we see \nthe results of this endeavor. Unfortunately, while the labor action \nplan requires the Colombian government to issue new laws, regulations, \nand reports, there is no mechanism to ensure that these policies will \nbe effective at improving the living and working conditions of \nColombians. The only follow-up mechanism included in the labor action \nplan is a series of meetings to take place in 2012 and 2013. After \n2013, those meetings may cease to occur.\n  Even more, should Colombia not meet its obligations under the labor \naction plan or take future action that is contrary to the labor action \nplan, only some portions may be subject to the binding dispute \nsettlement procedures in the text of the agreement. The limited \nenforceability of the action plan further cautions against moving \nforward too hastily, as we will not have enough leverage to ensure that \nfundamental labor rights are respected once the agreement is \nimplemented. As my colleagues may remember, the side agreement to the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement is ultimately meaningless and \nunenforceable.\n  One of the goals of our trade policy must be to further the \ninternationally recognized right of workers to organize. Supporting the \nrights of workers\n\n[[Page S6594]]\n\nto organize freely, bargain collectively, and live safely is not just \ngood for workers abroad, but it helps workers in the United States as \nwell.\n  The United States simply cannot compete in a global race to the \nbottom when it comes to labor standards. Our workers are some of the \nmost highly skilled and productive workers in the world. But they \nsimply cannot compete against countries that make things more cheaply \nbecause they don't respect the rights of their workers, have safe \nworkplaces, or pay their workers a living wage. Unfortunately, this \nagreement will not help us further that goal.\n  I would like to raise a second significant concern I have about the \nColombia Free Trade Agreement. As many of my colleagues know, I have \nbeen working on reducing abusive and exploitative child labor around \nthe world for nearly two decades. I first introduced a bill on this \nissue in 1992. According to the best estimates by the International \nLabor Organization, ILO, there are 215 million child laborers between \nthe ages of 5 and 17 who are engaged in today's global economy.\n  Of these 215 million child laborers, 115 million are engaged in \nhazardous work. These 115 million powerless children are working in \nmines, in fishing operations and on coffee plantations. It is appalling \nthat this is still occurring in the 21st century. These children are \nrobbed of their childhoods. Many are denied an education and any hope \nfor a brighter future. They will grow up illiterate and exploited, \ncreating a wellspring of future social conflict and strife.\n  We have made some progress over the years by funding programs for the \nremediation of child laborers through our contribution to the ILO's \nInternational Program for the Elimination of Child Labor, IPEC. In \n2000, I successfully amended the Trade and Development Act with a \nprovision directing that no trade benefits under the Generalized System \nof Preferences, GSP, be granted to any country that does not live up to \nits commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. I required \nthat the President submit a yearly report to Congress on the steps \nbeing taken by each GSP beneficiary country to carry out its \ncommitments to end abusive and exploitative child labor.\n  I want to explain clearly to my colleagues what I mean when I refer \nto abusive and exploitative child labor. It is not children who work \npart-time after school or on weekends. There is nothing wrong with \nthat. That is not the issue. What I am referring to is the definition \nset out by ILO Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor. This \nis not just a Western, or a developed-world, standard. It is a global \nstandard that has been ratified by 174 countries. It has been ratified \nby Colombia. The United States was the third country in the world to \nratify this convention.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Labor's Findings on the Worst Forms \nof Child Labor that was released this month, states up front that \nColombia, ``has not provided adequate resources to the National \nStrategy to Eradicate the Worst Forms of Child Labor. Children continue \nto work in agriculture, including forced coca cultivation, and in \nmining.'' The report further finds that children are forced to work in \ndomestic service, are sexually exploited, transport illegal drugs, and \neven are used by armed militants as child soldiers.\n  In addition to these shocking practices, eight Colombian products \nappear in the 2011 List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced \nLabor, also released by DOL this month. These products include coffee, \nsugarcane, and gold.\n  Unfortunately, the implementing legislation now before the Senate for \nfree trade with Colombia actually would take us, and the world, a step \nbackward when it comes to protecting children. That is right. This free \ntrade agreement with Colombia, which replaces GSP provisions in \ngoverning trade between our two countries, will take us backward with \nrespect to abusive and exploitative child labor.\n  Under GSP, the President now must report to Congress annually \nregarding Colombia's child labor practices, and if Colombia is not \nmeeting the obligations that it undertook as a signatory to the ILO \nConvention, if Colombia is not acting to eliminate the worst forms of \nchild labor, then trade sanctions are available to us to require \nenforcement of internationally recognized standards. That is so that \nour companies, and our workers, are not subjected to the unfair \ncompetition that abusive labor practices allow. Under this new \nimplementing legislation for free trade with Colombia, on the other \nhand, if it is enacted, neither of those things I just mentioned will \nbe true.\n  Our trade negotiators should not be weakening protections that we in \nCongress put in place to ensure that free trade can be consistent with \nrespect for international child labor standards. Supporting abusive and \nexploitative child labor abroad does not help create jobs in America. \nJust the opposite, it hurts that effort. Our workers and our local \nbusinesses should not be competing with the worst forms of child labor \nabroad.\n  As a result, I strongly believe that we need to put the break on this \nflawed trade agreement. It is time for us to begin passing fair trade \nagreements that promote good quality jobs both here and abroad and work \nto end the worst forms of child labor. This agreement does not meet \nthat test.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6594-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PRESIDENTIAL COIN PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor this weekend's \npassing of my friend Elouise Cobell--an extraordinary Montanan, \nAmerican and American Indian. I am proud to have nominated her for the \nCongressional Gold Medal. As a role model for every American child, she \ndeserves that highest honor.\n  Elouise Pepion Cobell was a star--truly a guiding light that will \nalways lead the way for all Americans who fight for justice and \nfairness. Elouise's tireless leadership set this Nation on a new \ncourse, and what she accomplished reminds us that any person in any \npart of this country has the power to stand up and right a wrong, no \nmatter how difficult it may be.\n  Sharla's and my thoughts and prayers are with Elouise's husband \nAlvin, her son Turk, and her entire family. We join the Blackfeet \nNation and all Montanans in mourning, honoring and celebrating the life \nof an extraordinary Montanan. Future generations will learn about \nElouise Cobell's legacy and they will be inspired to follow her lead. \nShe will always be remembered as an American hero.\n  I have many memories of Elouise. I first met her when I was a State \nSenator. I knew what she was working on but I never imagined she would \never get as far as she did. Not many people in this world have the \ndetermination in them that Elouise had. From those early days, until \njust a few weeks ago, I talked to her numerous times. She had been \nfighting the Federal Government in court for a decade, and wouldn't \ntake ``no'' for an answer. She knew what she wanted, and wanted it \nyesterday.\n  After I finally convinced her I wanted to help, our relationship \nchanged. We became friends working together on a common goal; a \nsettlement that was fair and balanced. And believe me, as my friend, \nshe was not afraid to call me and tell me what she thought and how to \nget things done.\n  But I will never forget talking to her on the afternoon of November \n19, 2010. The Senate had just approved the Cobell Settlement. Our bill \npaved the way to send her settlement to President Obama for his \nsignature. She\n\n[[Page S6595]]\n\nknew it would mark the end of her historic battle. I called to make \nsure she knew the good news. That tougher-than-nails woman was sitting \ninside her home in Browning, while fierce Montana winds dropped the \ntemperature to 17 degrees below zero. Thirty years of determination \nflowed through the tears in her eyes. She was happy. She was relieved. \nShe was thankful.\n  It was in 1996 that she took a deep breath, gritted her teeth, and \nfiled an historic lawsuit seeking justice on behalf of herself and \n500,000 individual American Indians. At that time, all she wanted was \nan accounting for what they were owed. Her decision changed her life \nand the lives of every American Indian for generations to come. Her 15-\nyear court battle resulted in the largest settlement with the \ngovernment in American history.\n  Throughout the years, through painful criticism and generous support, \nshe relentlessly led the charge against government mismanagement. She \nwas unyielding in her pursuit of justice for one of this Nation's most \nvulnerable populations. After battling the Federal Government for \nnearly 30 years, President Obama signed into law the $3.4 billion \nsettlement of the lawsuit that Congress approved earlier that year. At \nthe signing ceremony, President Obama said, ``It's finally time to make \nthings right.''\n  After all, the government had mismanaged the lands in question for \n123 years.\n  Above everything else, history will remember Elouise Cobell for \nbringing justice to her community. She demonstrated perhaps the \ngreatest strength--and asset--in Indian Country: kinship. As the years \nwore on, she fought harder for her family community.\n  When Montana elected me to the U.S. Senate, Elouise wasn't far behind \nme in Washington. She told me that many of the members she represented \nwere elderly. The longer this case drags on, fewer of them will see the \njustice they deserve.\n  That is why I was disappointed earlier this month when a Washington \ncourt allowed several appeals of the case to move forward.\n  For many reasons over the years, Elouise Cobell earned recognition as \na respected leader and role model. She walked in two worlds. Born on \nthe Blackfeet Reservation on November 5, 1945, she was one of eight \nchildren. She was a great granddaughter of Mountain Chief, one of the \nlegendary leaders of the Blackfeet Nation.\n  She and her husband operated a cattle ranch, and she founded the \nfirst Land Trust in Indian Country. For 13 years, she served as co-\nchair of the Native American Bank and as a trustee for the National \nMuseum of the American Indian. She served as trustee for the Nature \nConservancy of Montana.\n  She was executive director of the Native American Community \nDevelopment Corporation. In 2004, the National Center for American \nIndian Enterprise Development bestowed upon her the Jay Silverheels \nAchievement Award.\n  Elouise remained true to her local community and to her cultural \nidentity. But she also achieved success at the highest levels of non-\nIndian society. Elouise graduated from Great Falls Business College and \nattended Montana State University, where she received an honorary \ndoctorate. In 2011, Dartmouth College awarded her an honorary degree of \nDoctor of Humane Letters. The President of Dartmouth told her: ``You \nfought a David and Goliath battle and won.''\n  Her story of courage is an inspiration to Native people and indeed to \nall Americans. She demonstrated that our legal system is strong enough \nto protect even the most vulnerable, and this nation, the most powerful \non earth, keeps the promises we make.\n  She was a remarkable woman. Montanans and I will miss her dearly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6595-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6595-S6596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMENDING SENATOR BOB DOLE\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I had the distinct privilege to \nparticipate in a ceremony recently in Topeka, KS, to honor our dear \nfriend and longest serving Republican leader here in this Chamber, \nSenator Bob Dole. Kansas Governor Sam Brownback conceived of the Kansas \nWalk of Honor, located right outside the Kansas Capitol, to commemorate \nand honor important Kansans. It is only fitting that the plaque that \nbears Bob Dole's name is the first to christen the Walk of Honor. \nSenator Dole's contributions and history is interwoven in the hallowed \nhalls of the Senate. With that rich history, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record his comments, along with mine, from the Walk \nof Honor event.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Remarks of Senator Pat Roberts\n\n\n                          Kansas Walk of Honor\n\n                            (Sept. 30, 2011)\n\n       I am honored and privileged to be here with you today to \n     celebrate the Kansas Walk of Honor and to commemorate my good \n     friend, Kansas Native Son, and WWII hero, Bob Dole. Bob Dole \n     is a living legacy. As a member of the Greatest Generation, \n     his incredible history is well known to fellow Americans \n     nationwide. It is only fitting that he is the first honoree \n     of the Kansas Walk of Honor.\n       As a statesman, Bob Dole's reach is far and wide. His \n     legislative achievements are legion and in many cases, \n     unknown and unheralded. On Bob's list of accomplishments are \n     some big ticket items such as, the 1983 Social Security \n     Reforms, the Americans with Disability Act, the Voting Rights \n     Act, just to name a few. He also worked across the aisle with \n     the likes of liberal George McGovern, as seen by their \n     bipartisan work on nutrition programs.\n       Bob set the bar high as the longest serving Republican \n     Senate Majority Leader. He was known as a pragmatic \n     Midwesterner who was respected on both sides of the aisle and \n     a master consensus builder. He led by example, encouraging \n     fellow members to express their convictions without hostility \n     and allow for disagreement without declaring war on the floor \n     of the Senate.\n       But his work didn't stop there. After his service in public \n     office, Bob served our nation in a different capacity; \n     honoring our nation's veterans. Simply put, the World War II \n     Memorial would not exist were it not for Senator Bob Dole. I \n     was proud to be a part of the ceremony to recognize Bob's \n     tireless support of America's veterans and the World War II \n     Memorial. It is largely through his efforts, advocacy, and \n     fundraising that the World War II Memorial stands proudly on \n     the National Mall.\n       The man was and is amazing; his record of public service, \n     this memorial, the Honor Flights and Wounded Warriors \n     programs. The World War II Memorial has become wonderfully \n     unique; a Mecca not really expected or predicted--where \n     veterans whose heroic efforts and sacrifice preserved our \n     freedoms--now come by the thousands.\n       Bob, your record is unmatched. We thank you.\n       But, hold on, I've got another job to do and that is to \n     move this ceremony along at a fast clip. As we all know, the \n     now Governor Brownback's previous job was riding shotgun with \n     me in the Senate. Sam followed in the footsteps of today's \n     honoree to continue the level of commitment and service to \n     our great state.\n       Sam, I remember the first campaign rally we attended \n     together. The featured guest speaker, Senator Phil Gramm of \n     Texas introduced me as one who made significant changes in \n     the House of Representatives and then introduced Sam as: \n     ``One who not only wants to change things but to make the \n     right changes.''\n       That remains true as you've taken the reins back here in \n     the heartland. And now it is my pleasure to turn over this \n     lectern to the indomitable Kansas Governor, Sam Brownback.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Remarks of Senator Bob Dole\n\n\n       Kansas Walk of Honor, Kansas State Capitol, Topeka, Kansas\n\n                            (Sept. 30, 2011)\n\n       Over the years I've had all sorts of recognitions but \n     nothing that means as much as this one. Hollywood may have \n     its Walk of Fame, but in Kansas we have a Walk of Honor. That \n     tells you a lot about this place and its values. Fame is \n     fleeting, unsubstantial, first cousin to celebrity. Fame \n     gives you five minutes on the Today Show or maybe--if you're \n     sufficiently mobile--a shot at Dancing with the Stars. I'm \n     still waiting for my invitation. In the mean time I've been \n     telling Elizabeth to work on her Fox Trot.\n       Fame comes like a prairie squall, and lasts as long. Honor, \n     on the other hand, is the work of a lifetime--more, it's the \n     seed of character planted in one generation and bearing fruit \n     for as long as there are people who practice the old virtues \n     of decency and self-denial, love of country and the \n     neighbor's concern for those in distress. Sixty years have \n     passed since I first entered this building the greenest of \n     lawmakers--a somewhat banged up 2nd Lieutenant studying law \n     at Washburn and hoping that my hero Dwight Eisenhower could \n     be persuaded to run for president.\n       Now there's a definition of honor. In fact, honor is a \n     quality that often goes unrecognized. It exists outside the \n     headlines. It thrives quietly in our classrooms and church \n     pews, on our playing fields, and, yes, in these halls where \n     our democracy plays out--wherever Kansans put service before \n     self, keeping faith with all those who have made this the\n\n[[Page S6596]]\n\n     greatest state in the greatest nation on earth.\n       My debt to those Kansans can never be repaid. But it can be \n     honored--every time I try, in some small way, to emulate the \n     compassion and generosity of my friends and neighbors in \n     Russell, multiplied over the years by countless acts of \n     kindness, and culminating today in this ceremony. A long time \n     ago, long before anyone could remotely imagine Bob Dole in a \n     Walk of Honor, I took inspiration from a song called ``You'll \n     Never Walk Alone.'' My whole life, up to and including today, \n     has been a validation of that song. And the greatest honor of \n     my life has been to share that walk with my fellow Kansans--\n     the most honorable people I know.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6596-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BRUCE AKERS\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Bruce H. Akers, \nmayor of Pepper Pike, OH, for many years of outstanding leadership and \nservice to the Greater Cleveland community. Mayor Akers has done \nremarkable work during his distinguished career as a leader in the \nbusiness and civic community to improve the quality of life for his \nfellow citizens. On Thursday, October 20, 2011 the Cuyahoga County \nMayors and Managers Association will honor Mayor Akers with the George \nV. Voinovich Public Service Award.\n  Mayor Akers' work as a civic leader started more than 50 years ago \nwhen he began his career in banking with National City Bank. Although \nMayor Akers retired in 2000 as senior vice president for civic affairs \nat KeyBank, he has continued his vigorous efforts to serve his \ncommunity as a civic volunteer and local elected officeholder. \nThroughout the years, Mayor Akers has held leadership positions in \norganizations such as City Year of Cleveland, Park Works, the Chagrin \nValley Inter-Governmental Council, The Salvation Army of Greater \nCleveland, and United Way Services. He was also one of the founders of \nBusiness Volunteers Unlimited. In June of 2000 he completed 30 years as \na member of the National Board of Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America \nand is currently a member of its National Advisory Council.\n  Mayor Akers has had a distinguished political career, beginning with \nhis work as a precinct committeeman in 1960. Since that time, he has \nserved on the staff of Cleveland mayor Ralph J. Perk, as a Pepper Pike \ncouncilman, and as president of the Cuyahoga County Mayors of Managers \nAssociation. He was appointed in 2008 to serve on the nine-member \nCommission on Cuyahoga County Government Reform and has been integral \nin recent years to the reform and transformation of the new charter \nform of government in Cuyahoga County. This year, Bruce Akers will \nretire from elected office after serving five terms as Mayor of Pepper \nPike, OH.\n  For his commitment to public service and the many contributions he \nhas made to Pepper Pike and the Greater Cleveland community, I would \nlike to recognize and thank Mayor Bruce H. Akers for his years of \nservice and wish him well as he continues his many civic endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6596-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING ROLLIN POST\n\n Mrs. BOXER Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor the \nlife of Rollin Post, an award-winning Bay Area journalist, who passed \naway on October 3, 2011, following complications from Alzheimer's \ndisease. Throughout his career, Rollin made extraordinary contributions \nto journalism, public affairs, and the Bay Area community he so \npassionately served. I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife Diane \nPost and their three children and five grandchildren.\n  Born in New York City in May 1930, Mr. Post was the son of New York \nState Assemblyman Langdon Post and Janet Kirby Post; and grandson to \nPulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist Rollin Kirby. After a \nchildhood in New York, Tucson, and southern California, Rollin briefly \nattended San Francisco State College before enlisting in the U.S. Army. \nHe later enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he \ngraduated in 1952 with a bachelor of arts in political science. \nFollowing graduation, Rollin returned to southern California to work at \nCBS radio and then as a writer at the local CBS television affiliate.\n  Rollin Post's passion for broadcast journalism brought him back to \nthe Bay Area, where he took a job at KPIX in 1961. Over the course of \nnearly 40 years, he remained a staple on local news broadcasts, \nfocusing exclusively on matters relating to politics and public affairs \nand establishing himself as a highly respected and engaging reporter, \ncommentator, and interviewer. Together with his long-time colleague and \ncohost, Belva Davis, Mr. Post developed several enduring television \nprograms such as ``A Closer Look'' and ``California This Week.''\n  During his storied career, Rollin Post covered nine Presidential \nelections and interviewed many important figures in local, State, and \nnational politics. He was so well known as a journalist that Robert \nRedford cast him to play himself in the 1972 film ``The Candidate.'' He \nalso received many well-deserved honors and awards for his work, \nincluding recognitions from the Society of Professional Journalists and \nthe National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences.\n  Outside of his work in journalism, Rollin served as a volunteer for \nseveral organizations, including Common Cause and the Institute of \nGovernmental Studies at his alma mater, UC Berkeley. He was also a \nlifelong baseball fan and an avid outdoorsman, relishing opportunities \nto take his family camping and hiking.\n  I extend my heartfelt condolences to Rollin's family, friends, and \nformer colleagues. He will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6596-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING THE JEWISH FEDERATION'S NEW HOME\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

This undertaking will expand and improve educational \nopportunities for countless students for generations to come. It is a \nnotable achievement that has been made possible through the \npersistence, dedication, and cooperation of a committed group of \nfaculty, staff, and administrators at Northampton Community College.\n  Northampton's newest campus, which impressively spans over 200,000 \nsquare feet, includes a workforce development training center, an \nenrollment center building, and a student life building. Given our \ncountry's current economic climate and staggering unemployment rate, \nwhat Northampton Community College has managed to accomplish today is \nnothing short of remarkable.\n  Northampton Community College is a public, comprehensive community \ncollege that serves more than 36,000 students per year with its main \ncampus in Bethlehem, PA. Currently, there are more than 16,000 students \nenrolled in their credit programs and an additional 21,000 who are \ninvolved in workforce training, adult literacy, or youth classes.\n  This new campus in Monroe County highlights Northampton's dedication \nto Pennsylvania and higher education in America. Northampton's strong \ncommitment to preparing its students for the demands of today's economy \nis reflected in the new campus. Their new workforce training center is \nforecasted to train 1,000 new, incumbent, and displaced workers in the \nfirst 5 years of\n\n[[Page S6597]]\n\nits existence. Northampton also offers many degree programs \nspecifically designed to meet the needs of industries in the region. In \n2012 it is estimated to create 541 new jobs, $15.9 million in new \neconomic revenue activity, and $2.8 million in tax revenue.\n  Northampton continues to lead the pack in higher education and has \nproven to be a model for community colleges across the country. The \nfaculty, staff, and administration, under the leadership of President \nArt Scott, put students first. This new campus is evidence of this \ninstitution's steadfast commitment to preparing students for the 21st \ncentury economy.

Mr. President, on Friday, October 7, the Nobel \nPeace Prize for 2011 was awarded to three distinguished women for their \ncourageous efforts to promote peace and democracy. President Ellen \nJohnson Sirleaf of Liberia, her compatriot and peace activist Leymah \nGbowee, and prodemocracy campaigner Tawakkol Karman of Yemen join the \nranks of the chosen few whose dedication to peace is acknowledged by \nthe international community.\n  President Johnson Sirleaf, Africa's first democratically elected \nfemale head of state, has helped Liberia recover from 14 brutal years \nof civil war. Taking office in 2006 after a lengthy exile, she led her \nnation to greater peace and security, while transforming Liberia in the \neyes of the world.\n  Ms. Gbowee, a founding member of the Women in Peacebuilding Network, \nmobilized over 3,000 Muslim and Christian women to hold nonviolent \nprotests that helped bring an end to Liberia's civil war. Her efforts \ndemonstrate that the desire for peace and the power to effect change \ntranscend ethnic, religious, and gender divides.\n  Ms. Karman has for years been a vocal champion of human rights in \nYemen. In 2005, she founded a group called Women Journalists Without \nChains. Since then, she has braved physical threats and harassment to \nadvance the cause of freedom in her country. And this year, she has \nemerged as one of the leaders of Yemen's nonviolent democratic \nuprising. As the first Arab woman to receive a Nobel prize, her \nselection honors all of the mothers, daughters, and sisters across the \nMiddle East who have been standing for their rights alongside their \nfathers, sons and brothers.\n  In the history of the Nobel Peace Prize, very few women have received \nthis high honor. The choice of the selection committee this year is \nmore than a recognition of the strength and courage of these women; it \nis a clear and resounding testament to the idea that women's rights are \nimportant, that it is smart policy to promote gender equality, and that \nsocieties are better off when all of their members--women included--can \nsafely exercise their fundamental rights and become drivers of economic \nsecurity and political opportunity.\n  Let's take this moment to remember another Nobel Peace Prize winner, \nDr. Wangari Maathai, who passed away just days before this year's \nannouncement. Dr. Maathai led the Green Belt Movement with tenacity and \nvision, transforming Kenya's landscape and women's lives. She and the \nwomen who are honored this year leave an indelible mark on our social \nconsciousness. I want to congratulate President Johnson Sirleaf, Ms. \nGbowee, and Ms. Karman on their selection and to thank them for their \nservice to their communities and commitment to uphold global standards \nof human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6597-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO WARRANT OFFICER JAY T.

It is a miracle that wasn't the end of Jay \nright then and there.\n  Known as an extraordinarily skillful and talented pilot by his peers, \nJay somehow safely landed what was left of the helicopter. Relatively \nspeaking, Jay was OK, but one of the infantrymen on the vehicle was \nbadly wounded.\n  After removing his fellow soldier from the wreckage, Jay then went \nback into a burning helicopter under intense fire from the enemy to \nretrieve the first aid kit and began to care for his wounded friend.\n  Knowing he needed to get to a safer area, Jay carried the wounded \nsoldier on his back through the jungle and waited until help arrived.\n  After the episode, Jay's superior officer wrote, ``His gallant \nactions and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest \ntraditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon \nhimself, his unit, and the United States Military.''\n  I couldn't agree more. Jay's bravery stands as a fine example of the \ncharacter of our men and women who have fought for and defended this \ncountry. Those who wear the uniform today still display that same \ncourage in far away places, just as Jay did that day in Vietnam.\n  Without their sense of duty to our country, we would not enjoy the \nfreedoms we have today. It is of the highest calling to provide for the \ncommon defense, as the preamble of our Constitution makes clear. I am \nawed by their sacrifice.\n  Today, I am honored to congratulate Jay T. Lane for earning the \nSilver Star. It is well deserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6597-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING MAYOR JERRY WASHBURN\n\n Mr. LEE.

Mr. President, today, I honor the \nlife and legacy of the great Pueblo Indian Historian, Joe Simon Sando. \nJoe was one of New Mexico's leading historians and the preeminent \nexpert on Pueblo History. He passed away at the age of 88 on September \n13, 2011, after a lifetime of dedication to education, history, and \ncultural preservation.\n  Joe Sando taught, published and lectured throughout the world about \nthe history and culture of the Pueblo People. His numerous publications \nand educational efforts brought to life the vibrant history of the \nPueblo People while also acknowledging the ever changing and current \nculture of the pueblos.\n  Joe's own story started in Jemez Pueblo in northern New Mexico where \nhe grew up speaking Towa. He later learned English, the language of his \nextensive publications, when he attended the Santa Fe Indian School. \nWhen World War II raged into the lives of Americans, Joe Sando bravely \nharkened to the call for service, joined the Navy, and served out the \nwar on the decks of aircraft carriers.\n\n[[Page S6599]]\n\n  After his military service, Joe obtained an education degree from \nEastern New Mexico University and taught at the Albuquerque Indian \nSchool. He later went on to attend graduate school at Vanderbilt \nUniversity in Tennessee and become an instructor at the University of \nNew Mexico. Teaching Pueblo history at UNM, and ethnohistory at the \nInstitute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, Joe Sando quickly became \nthe dominant expert in pueblo history and culture. In 1986, he helped \ncreate the Institute for Pueblo Indian Studies at the Indian Pueblo \nCultural Center and did not retire until 2003 at the age of 80.\n  Joe Sando said, ``As a Pueblo man of Jemez, I feel that the Indian \npeople have a duty and a challenge to write their own history.'' Sando \naggressively took up this challenge writing and contributing to \nnumerous books about his culture and history from the distinct and not \noften published perspective of a tribal member. Joe felt that ``the \ntraditional Pueblo history should be revealed, as the Pueblo Indians \nthemselves know it,'' and that is exactly how he wrote it, from the \npueblo perspective.\n  Joe Sando's contribution to society was not limited to his extensive \neducational efforts. He was also a generous and dedicated public \nservant. He was the first chairman of the All Indian Pueblo Housing \nAuthority and the first chairman of the State Judicial Council. He also \nserved on the Statuary Hall Commission and on the board of Americans \nfor Indian Opportunity.\n  Joe was also widely honored. He was the 2005 recipient of the \nSouthwestern Association for Indian Arts Lifetime Achievement Award. In \n2007 he received an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of \nNew Mexico, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the All Indian \nPueblo Council. For his writing, he received the Bravo Award for \nLiterary Excellence, Outstanding Alumnae of Eastern New Mexico \nUniversity, State Heritage Preservation Award, Excellence in the \nHumanities Award, Lifetime Achievement Award of Indian Librarians and \nIndian History Teachers, and the Eugene Crawford Memorial Peace Pipe \nAward.\n  Mr. Sando was a friend to every pueblo, and had an extensive \nknowledge of genealogies and individuals from each pueblo. He could \nform a personal connection with anyone as he also determined a familial \nconnection, using his impressive memory of families and clans.\n  But perhaps Joe Sando's story is better told through the history he \ntaught and loved. The history of the Pueblo People is a vibrant part of \nour nation's story.\n  For centuries immemorial, the Pueblo People occupied the Southwest. \nThe ancestors of the Pueblo People were guided by deity from place to \nplace and finally they were brought to a land where they would be safe \nfrom the catastrophes of natures. This vast area of the Southwest, much \nof which is still occupied by the 20 remaining pueblos, was given to \nthe ancestors of the Pueblo People at the beginning of time.\n  In their vast open lands of mesas, mountains, and plains, pueblo \nsociety developed around the systematic raising of food, especially \ncorn, making hominy, succotash, cornbread, cornmeal mush, tortillas, \nand tamales. Also cultivated were chile, squash, pumpkins, beans, and a \nmyriad of other products. Various dances were held according to the \nseasons, prayer dances and thanksgiving dances, and the ancient people \nwere warned to respect and obey the laws of nature and the orders of \ntheir leaders who would guide them spiritually and socially. Guidelines \nfor well-ordered living were established and lead to centuries of \ncultural development and continued community success.\n  Through the centuries, several individual pueblos emerged and three \ndistinct language groups developed, Zuni, Keresan, and Tanoan with \ndialects of Tiwa, Tewa, and Towa. These languages continue to be spoken \nin the remaining 21 pueblo tribes.\n  In 1539 Europeans entered the Pueblo World and by the end of the \ncentury the Spanish were planning a permanent settlement in the pueblo \nregion. The tentative interactions and exchange of knowledge and goods \nquickly turned to anger and distrust as taxes were leveed on the Pueblo \nPeople and the expressions of the pueblo culture were oppressed.\n  In 1598 the All Indian Pueblo Council was organized to coordinate \ninteractions between the pueblos and the Spanish Governor, Juan de \nOnate. This council of pueblo leaders continues today as a functional \nsymbol of tribal sovereignty, pueblo unity, and government-to-\ngovernment relations.\n  But despite the council's formation and efforts, tensions escalated \nbetween the Spanish and Pueblo People. One distinctive event in 1680 \nlead to the first American Revolution. Religious and political pueblo \nleaders were accused of ``sorcery'', and were imprisoned, publicly \nhumiliated, whipped, and some even hung. Po'pay, from the Pueblo of \nOhkay Owingeh, was one of these leaders taken from his village, \nhumiliated, and lashed. And as tradition has it, Po'pay rose from this \noppression to unite the pueblos to drive the Spanish from Pueblo lands \nin 1680. We honor Po'pay's fight for justice and his mark on history \ntoday in our capitol, where a statue of Po'pay stands as one of the \nhonored leaders in the National Statuary Hall Collection.\n  In a matter of years after the Pueblo Revolution some pueblos \nwelcomed the Spanish back, while others continued to wage conflict. \nFinally, in 1706, an alliance between the Pueblo People and the Spanish \nwas established to help protect against raids from the outside. Since \nthen, a culture of mutual respect and interdependence has emerged and \ncontinues today.\n  More than a century after this alliance was established, the treaty \nof Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican American war and moved the US \nborder south of the pueblos. Later, President Lincoln formally \nrecognized the authority of the pueblo governors under the United \nStates Government, and today pueblo leadership continues to conduct \ngovernment-to-government interaction with the United States. In New \nMexico we continue to learn about and appreciate the culture and \nhistory of the Pueblo People, and celebrate as new leaders, like Joe \nSando, continue to emerge.\n  Joe Sando recognized his call to share the history of the Pueblo \nPeople. He said that, ``Every now and then some readers tell me that I \nwas mandated to tell the world about the Pueblo Indians. That may be \ntrue.'' Today we record Joe Sando's story in the United States \nCongressional Record to honor him for taking up the call to tell the \nworld about the Pueblo People, a story integral to our national history \nand ever-changing culture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6599-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6599-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/17/senate-section/article/S6599-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6599-S6600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 358.

Mr. President, I rise today to advocate for increasing \nMedicare efficiency and effectiveness by introducing the Strengthening \nMedicare and Repaying Taxpayers, SMART, Act of 2011 with my colleagues, \nSenators Portman, Ben Nelson, and Burr.\n  The SMART Act initiates common sense changes to the Medicare \nSecondary Payer, MSP, system, as a means of achieving that efficiency \nand effectiveness. This system kicks in whenever a Medicare beneficiary \nis injured and another party accepts responsibility to pay for the \ncosts associated with that injury, making Medicare the ``secondary \npayer.'' For example, if a Medicare beneficiary is injured when she \nslips in a store the store reimburses her for the costs of the injury. \nIn this scenario the store becomes the party responsible for paying the \ncosts associated with the injury, and if Medicare pays any of the costs \nassociated with the injury, it has to be reimbursed. The purpose of \nthis system is to ensure that Medicare does not pay claims that a third \nparty is liable for. Although seemingly obvious, the system currently \non the books is set up in manner that is unnecessarily burdensome to \nall parties involved in these claims.\n  At the heart of the problem is the lack of financial disclosure by \nthe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS. Under the current \nMSP system, CMS does not calculate the MSP amount owed to the Trust \nFund until after a claim has settled, making it impossible for the \nparties to factor that amount into the settlement process. Even after \nthe claim has been settled and reported to Medicare, it can take months \nfor the parties to find out how much money is actually owed in \nreimbursement.\n  Does this make any sense at all? Of course not. The beneficiary has \nno idea what portion of the settlement will be left after the payment \nis made to Medicare, the third party responsible for the bill has no \nway of knowing whether or not the amount settled upon will be \nsufficient to fully reimburse Medicare, and the Medicare Trust Fund is \ndenied much needed funds because of the uncertain settlement process.\n  It is clear that the repercussions of our inefficient MSP system are \nwidespread. Individual beneficiaries and businesses large and small are \nleft in the dark. On top of that, State and local governments that \nsettle personal injury and worker compensation claims also fall victim \nto these long, drawn out settlements which costs a significant amount \nof money at a time when budgets are especially tight.\n  The legislation my colleagues and I are introducing today provides a \nstraightforward and commonsense solution. The SMART Act would create a \nmore effective and efficient MSP process for all parties involved, \nwhile speeding the return of Medicare Trust Fund dollars. This \nlegislation will improve the flow of information so that beneficiaries \nand companies may determine how much money is owed to the Trust Fund \nbefore they settle a claim. This change will enable parties to \ncalculate the MSP amount they owe and reimburse Medicare directly, and \nit will provide CMS with tools to ensure that Medicare is fully \nreimbursed.\n  Medicare beneficiaries and businesses will no longer be forced to \nplay this real life version of ``Price is Right,'' where Medicare plays \nthe Bob Barker/Drew Carey role and the other parties are forced to \nguess at how much is owed.\n  The SMART Act will also preserve taxpayer resources by ensuring that \nMedicare does not spend more money pursuing these cases than the claim \nis actually worth. There have been reports of MSP demands as low as \n$2--CMS should not be spending more money on postage than the Medicare \nTrust Fund will receive in reimbursement. Surely we can create a \nsensible threshold that will protect Medicare's interest and prevent \nparties from gaming the system without wasting government money chasing \ndown elderly beneficiaries to collect a handful of quarters.\n  In addition to streamlining the MSP system the SMART Act will protect \nconsumers by eliminating the requirement for businesses to collect \nSocial Security Numbers or Medicare numbers during the claims process. \nThis is in line with a recently launched Medicare campaign which \nencourages beneficiaries not to give out these numbers as an important \ntool in fighting health care fraud and identity theft. We should not be \nsending seniors mixed messages or punishing businesses that are unable \nto obtain this information, despite their best efforts, from \nunderstandably reticent seniors.\n  The SMART Act will provide much needed clarity to the MSP system and \nwill relieve the burden that is currently placed on all parties \ninvolved in the process.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1718\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nStrengthening Medicare and Repaying Taxpayers, SMART, Act with Senators \nWyden, Burr and Ben Nelson. This bi-partisan effort will help \nstrengthen and protect Medicare by ensuring greater reliability and \nefficiency of Medicare reimbursements. The SMART Act proposes common-\nsense solutions to problems in the current Medicare Secondary Payer, \nMSP, system, at no cost to the American taxpayer. With Washington's sky \nhigh debt and deficit, we need to do everything we can to ensure that \nvital entitlement programs, such as Medicare, are cost effective and \nworking for the very people they were designed to help.\n  Under the MSP program, if a Medicare beneficiary is injured by a \nthird party and a settlement is pursued as a result of that injury, the \nthird party is responsible for paying for the individual's medical \nexpenses. If Medicare, now the ``secondary payer,'' pays any of the \ncosts associated with the injury, it is entitled to reimbursement.\n  Numerous problems exist with the current MSP system; each of these \nare addressed by the SMART Act.\n  Under current law, Medicare does not have a pathway to disclose their \nMSP amount until after a case has been settled or adjusted--which \ncreates an uncertainty that impedes beneficiaries and third parties \nfrom reaching a legal settlement. This legislation creates a process \nthat allows the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, to \ndisclose this information before settlement, so it can be factored into \nthe settlement.\n  Second, Medicare often spends more money pursuing an MSP payment than \nthey actually receive in payment. This bill requires that Medicare no \nlonger pursue MSP claims that do not cover their own expenses.\n  Additionally, the MSP system requires complex and extensive reporting \nrequirements from those who settle a claim involving Medicare. If all \nrequired information is not 100 percent accurate and on-time, the \ncompany is fined $1,000 per claim, per day. The SMART Act provides CMS \nwith leeway to issue smaller fines and provides safe harbor to protect \ncompanies that make\n\n[[Page S6604]]\n\ngood faith efforts to comply fully and on-time.\n  Furthermore, under these requirements, claim beneficiaries must \nsubmit their Social Security numbers or Health Insurance Claim Numbers, \nMedicare Numbers, to the settlement company so they can be reported to \nCMS, generating serious privacy concerns. This legislation directs \nMedicare to establish an alternative method of identifying individuals, \nto mitigate concerns about identity theft and Medicare fraud.\n  Finally, there is currently no clear statute of limitations on MSP \nclaims. This bill sets a 3-year statute of limitations for most claims.\n  The SMART Act is a common-sense bi-partisan bill that will make the \nMSP system work more efficiently, reduce unnecessary burdens and waste, \nand speed the repayment of amounts owed to the Medicare Trust Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1719. A bill to clarify that schools and local educational \nagencies participating in the school lunch program under the Richard B. \nRussell National School Lunch Act are authorized to donate excess food \nto local food banks or charitable organizations; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise to introduce legislation which \nwould provide clarification to schools and school districts that wish \nto donate excess food to food banks and charitable organizations.\n  In 1996, Congress passed the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food \nDonation Act to encourage the donation of food and grocery products to \nnonprofit organizations such as homeless shelters, soup kitchens and \nchurches for distribution to needy individuals. The law limits the \nliability of donors to instances of gross negligence or intentional \nmisconduct. However, because the law does not explicitly include \nschools as having limited liability, many schools and school districts \nhave been hesitant to donate excess food.\n  This legislation would amend the Richard B. Russell National School \nLunch Act to clarify that schools and local education agencies \nparticipating in the school lunch program under the act are authorized \nto donate excess food to local food banks or charitable organizations. \nIt would clarify that schools and local education agencies making \ndonations would be exempt from civil and criminal liability to the \nextent provided under the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act.\n  Schools interested in donating excess food would be encouraged and \nbetter informed with the passage of this legislation. The Secretary of \nEducation would provide schools with guidance to assist schools with \nfood donations.\n  Given the current economy and high unemployment rate, more and more \nindividuals are becoming dependent on food banks and charities. This \nlegislation would help to address the needs of those living in poverty \nby increasing support for food donations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1719\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Russell National School Lunch \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1758) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(l) Food Donation Program.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Each school and local educational agency \n     participating in the school lunch program under this Act may \n     donate any food not consumed under such program to eligible \n     local food banks or charitable organizations.\n       ``(2) Guidance.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall \n     develop and publish guidance to schools and local educational \n     agencies participating in the school lunch program under this \n     Act to assist such schools and local educational agencies in \n     donating food under this subsection.\n       ``(B) Updates.--The Secretary shall update such guidance as \n     necessary.\n       ``(3) Liability.--Any school or local educational agency \n     making donations pursuant to this subsection shall be exempt \n     from civil and criminal liability to the extent provided \n     under the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1791).\n       ``(4) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `eligible \n     local food banks or charitable organizations' means any food \n     bank or charitable organization which is exempt from tax \n     under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1722. A bill to improve early education, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Early \nLanguage Proficiency Act, legislation critical to preparing young \nchildren across our country to be successful in school.\n  Studies have shown that children who participate in pre-kindergarten \nprograms are less likely to be held back a grade, show greater learning \nretention and initiative, have better social skills, are more \nenthusiastic about school, and are more likely to have good attendance \nrecords.\n  Experts agree that an early education experience is one of the most \neffective strategies for improving later school performance. The \nNational Research Council reported that prekindergarten educational \nopportunities are critical in developing early language and literacy \nskills and preventing reading difficulties in young children.\n  This bill is a step forward in making a national commitment to giving \nall children access to high quality pre-kindergarten programs that have \nbeen proven to have a solid impact on a child's success later in school \nand in life.\n  The Early Language Proficiency Act, would authorize pre-kindergarten \nEnglish language instruction as an allowable use of Federal funding. \nWith over 5 million English language learning students nationwide, 1.5 \nmillion of who reside in my home State of in California, allowing \nschool districts to use Federal funds to prepare young English learners \nfor grade school is critical.\n  In addition, this legislation will help local school districts use \nfederal funds to provide prekindergarten services to all young children \nthey serve. Although school districts may already use Federal funds \nfrom Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act for early \neducation, many school districts are either unaware of or are uncertain \nof how to use this authority. The Early Language Proficiency Act would \nensure that states provide proper guidance to local schools about how \nto use Title I funds to educate pre-kindergarteners.\n  The future of our Nation's economy depends on the next generation of \nworkers, and high-quality early childhood education is key to preparing \nthem for their careers. In the long run, pre-kindergarten programs pay \nfor themselves. Decades of research have proven that early education \nprograms yield between $7 to $16 for every dollar invested.\n  Ensuring that all students start school ready to learn is essential \nto ensuring that we meet our goal of having the best-educated workforce \nand the highest proportion of college graduates in the world by 2020. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1726.

Res. 294\n\n       Whereas on October 17, 1829, the Chesapeake and Delaware \n     Canal became operational with the joint support of the \n     Federal Government and the States of Delaware, Maryland, and \n     Pennsylvania;\n       Whereas the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal has served the \n     economy of the Chesapeake and Mid-Atlantic regions for 182 \n     years, first as a lock-system canal and in the 20th century, \n     as a free-flowing waterway;\n       Whereas the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal Museum recognizes \n     and celebrates the history of the Canal and the role of the \n     Canal in the economic development of the United States from \n     the early 19th century through the date of approval of this \n     resolution;\n       Whereas the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal is 1 of only 2 \n     commercially viable sea level canals in the United States and \n     is vital to the Ports of Wilmington, Baltimore, and \n     Philadelphia, as well as the broader United States economy;\n       Whereas the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal is 1 of the \n     busiest working waterways in the world, with more than 25,000 \n     vessels passing though the Canal each year;\n       Whereas the Philadelphia District of the Corps of Engineers \n     has responsibly managed the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal \n     since 1933, including regularly dredging the Canal, \n     maintaining existing bridges and roadways, and managing \n     maritime traffic;\n       Whereas in 2005 and 2006, public workshops were held to \n     solicit ideas and comments from local residents regarding \n     potential recreational uses along the Chesapeake and Delaware \n     Canal;\n       Whereas in March 2006, the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal \n     trail concept plan was completed by the working group \n     recommending the creation of a recreational trail along both \n     banks of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal to be used by \n     walkers, joggers, cyclists, and equestrians;\n       Whereas the Federal Government and the State of Delaware \n     have worked together to provide funding to build the first \n     phase of the recreational trail along the banks of the \n     Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, with construction set to begin \n     in the spring of 2012;\n       Whereas the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal is surrounded by \n     more than 7,500 acres of public land, creating a unique and \n     safe environment for recreationists, families, students, \n     anglers, hunters, nature enthusiasts, and others to \n     participate in outdoor activities;\n       Whereas the recreational trail along the Chesapeake and \n     Delaware Canal has the potential to provide a common link to \n     communities across the States of Delaware and Maryland from \n     Chesapeake City to Delaware City;\n       Whereas plans for Phase I of the recreational trail call \n     for 9 miles of improved trail along the Chesapeake and \n     Delaware Canal from Delaware City to Summit Marina, Delaware, \n     including the construction of parking areas and comfort \n     stations;\n       Whereas public participation has been an integral part of \n     the development of the recreational trail along the \n     Chesapeake and Delaware Canal and the plan enjoys broad \n     support from local communities, stakeholder groups, and \n     Federal and State officials; and\n       Whereas construction of the trail will create jobs and \n     bring economic activity to communities along the Chesapeake \n     and Delaware Canal while encouraging health and wellness \n     through outdoor engagement: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 182nd anniversary of the opening of \n     the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal;\n       (2) celebrates the history of the Chesapeake and Delaware \n     Canal as a facilitator of trade and economic development in \n     the Chesapeake and Mid-Atlantic regions;\n       (3) honors the ongoing role that the Chesapeake and \n     Delaware Canal plays in supporting commerce by linking the \n     Delaware River and Chesapeake Bay to ports around the world;

SPECIAL PERMITS.\n\n       Section 60118(c)(1) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(1) Issuance of waivers.--\n       ``(A) In general.--On application of an owner or operator \n     of a pipeline facility, the Secretary by order may waive \n     compliance with any part of an applicable standard prescribed \n     under this chapter with respect to the facility on terms the \n     Secretary considers appropriate, if the Secretary determines \n     that the waiver is not inconsistent with pipeline safety.\n       ``(B) Considerations.--In determining whether to grant a \n     waiver, the Secretary shall consider--\n       ``(i) the fitness of the applicant to conduct the activity \n     authorized by the waiver in a manner that is consistent with \n     pipeline safety;\n       ``(ii) the applicant's compliance history;\n       ``(iii) the applicant's accident history; and\n       ``(iv) any other information or data the Secretary \n     considers relevant to making the determination.\n       ``(C) Effective period.--A waiver of one or more pipeline \n     operating requirements shall be reviewed by the Secretary 5 \n     years after its effective date. In reviewing a waiver, the \n     Secretary shall consider any change in ownership or control \n     of the pipeline, any change in the conditions around the \n     pipeline, and other factors as appropriate. The Secretary may \n     modify, suspend, or revoke a waiver after such review under \n     subparagraph (E).\n       ``(D) Public notice and hearing.--The Secretary may act on \n     a waiver under this section only after public notice and an \n     opportunity for a hearing, which may consist of publication \n     of notice in the Federal Register that an application for a \n     waiver has been filed and providing the public with the \n     opportunity to review and comment on the application. If a \n     waiver is granted, the Secretary shall state in the order and \n     associated analysis the reasons for granting it.\n       ``(E) Noncompliance and modification, suspension, or \n     revocation.--After notice to a holder of a waiver and \n     opportunity to show cause, the Secretary may modify, suspend, \n     or revoke a waiver issued under this section for failure to \n     comply with its terms or conditions, intervening changes in \n     Federal law, a material change in circumstances affecting \n     safety, including erroneous information in the application, \n     or any other reason. If necessary to avoid a significant risk \n     of harm to persons, property, or the environment, the \n     Secretary may waive the show cause procedure and make the \n     action immediately effective.''.\n\n     SEC. 20. BIOFUEL PIPELINES.\n\n       Section 60101(a)(4) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' after the semicolon in subparagraph \n     (A);\n       (2) by redesignating subparagraph (B) as subparagraph (C); \n     and\n       (3) by inserting after subparagraph (A) the following:\n       ``(B) non-petroleum fuels, including biofuels that are \n     flammable, toxic, or corrosive or would be harmful to the \n     environment if released in significant quantities; and''.\n\n     SEC. 21. CARBON DIOXIDE PIPELINES.\n\n       Section 60102(i) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(i) Pipelines Transporting Carbon Dioxide.--The Secretary \n     shall prescribe minimum safety standards for the \n     transportation of carbon dioxide by pipeline in either a \n     liquid or gaseous state.''.\n\n     SEC. 22. STUDY OF THE TRANSPORTATION OF TAR SANDS CRUDE OIL.\n\n       Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Transportation shall complete a \n     comprehensive review of hazardous liquid pipeline regulations \n     to determine whether these regulations are sufficient to \n     regulate pipelines used for the transportation of tar sands \n     crude oil. In conducting this review, the Secretary shall \n     conduct an analysis of whether any increase in risk of \n     release exists for pipelines transporting tar sands crude \n     oil. The Secretary shall report the results of this review to \n     the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \n     Senate and the Committees on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure and on Energy and Commerce of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 23. STUDY OF NON-PETROLEUM HAZARDOUS LIQUIDS TRANSPORTED \n                   BY PIPELINE.\n\n       The Secretary of Transportation may conduct an analysis of \n     the transportation of non-petroleum hazardous liquids by \n     pipeline for the purpose of identifying the extent to which \n     pipelines are currently being used to transport non-petroleum \n     hazardous liquids, such as chlorine, from chemical production \n     facilities across land areas not owned by the producer that \n     are accessible to the public. The analysis should identify \n     the extent to which the safety of the lines is unregulated by \n     the States and evaluate whether the transportation of such \n     chemicals by pipeline across areas accessible to the public \n     would present significant risks to public safety, property, \n     or the environment in the absence of regulation. The results \n     of the analysis shall be made available to the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the \n     Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure and on Energy \n     and Commerce of the House of Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 24.
