The clerk will read the joint \nresolution by title for the second time.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 41) expressing the sense of \n     Congress regarding the nuclear program of the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would object to any further proceedings \nwith respect to this joint resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection having been heard, the \nbill will be placed on the calendar.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, back in 1963, when Congress passed the Equal \nPay Act, women at that time were working year-round and took home about \n59 cents for every dollar paid to their male coworkers doing the same \njob. While passage of that landmark legislation helped narrow the pay \ngap, today American women still only take home 77 cents on the dollar \ncompared to their male colleagues for doing the exact same job.\n\n[[Page S3670]]\n\n  Jane, who works in a job, gets 77 cents, while Jack, who also works \nat that job, gets $1. That is why women are concerned about how they \nare being treated. It is simply not fair that any woman working the \nsame hours at the same job should make less money.\n  Often these inequities stretch over decades, and many women don't \neven know they are victims. It took one Las Vegas woman 15 years to \nfind out she made $20,000 per year less than her male colleagues \nalthough she did the same work and worked just as hard. That is $20,000 \na year over 15 years. She was paid about 66 cents on the dollar \ncompared to her male coworkers despite being a top sales associate with \na Las Vegas payroll company.\n  Over the decade and a half she worked there, her employers cheated \nher out of literally hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of pay. \nWhy? Because she is a woman. Her story, though, has a happy ending. She \ngot a lawyer, settled out of court, and has now gone on with her own \nsuccessful business.\n  But many victims don't have that happy ending. Many victims of years \nor even decades of gender-based pay discrimination have nothing to be \nhappy about. The average woman who works full time, year-round in \nNevada makes $7,300 less than a man doing the same job. I am sure, Mr. \nPresident, it is about the same in Connecticut.\n\n  Although the wage gap has narrowed in the last half century since \nCongress declared women are entitled to equal pay for equal work, \ngender discrimination remains a serious problem in the workplace. That \nis why Democrats overcame the Republican obstructionism last Congress \nto pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. It was the second thing we \ndid in a very productive Congress.\n  Why did we do it? Lilly Ledbetter had worked for years and years \ndoing the same job as her male counterparts until she finally found out \none day they were being paid a lot more money than she was for doing \nthe same work. So she went to court. The court said the statute of \nlimitations had run out.\n  The Presiding Officer is one of the most gifted lawyers we have in \nthe Senate. He was a long-time attorney general in the State of \nConnecticut and understands the law very well. Lilly Ledbetter's case \nwas so unfair because she didn't bring her case soon enough. She didn't \nknow she was being cheated. They said people have a certain period of \ntime to bring up this matter--I think it was 3 years. Even though it \nhad been well more than a decade she had been working there, she was \nout of luck.\n  So we passed the Lilly Ledbetter Pay Act. I met her on a number of \noccasions and, boy, she has a lot of spunk in her. And rightfully so \nbecause a lot of people would not have fought. She took her case to the \nU.S. Supreme Court and she lost there. That is why we had to do \nsomething legislatively.\n  This law, the Lilly Ledbetter legislation, makes it possible for \nvictims of gender discrimination to successfully challenge unequal pay \neven if the indiscretion has been going on for years.\n  Despite that achievement in the last Congress, there is a great deal \nof work to be done to ensure that American women earn comparable pay \nfor a day's work. It is crucial that we pass the bill that is now \nbefore this body, the Paycheck Fairness Act. It is common sense. It \nwould give workers stronger tools to combat wage discrimination, bar \nretaliation against workers for discussing salary information, and help \nensure more adequate compensation for victims with gender-based pay \ndiscrimination.\n  I am fortunate that I have five children. My oldest is my daughter. \nShe was a good student and a wonderful daughter. No one could be a \nbetter daughter than my daughter Lana. She graduated from college, and \nshe came to Washington to spend some time with her parents before she \ndecided what she wanted to do permanently. She went around looking for \na job on Capitol Hill.\n  The first question every person she interviewed with asked was, Do \nyou type? Can you imagine that? She could type. How do you start a \ndebate with that? They asked her that because she is a woman. Women get \nan unfair shake in modern-day America, and we are trying to do \nsomething about it.\n  We want workers to have stronger tools to combat wage discrimination. \nWe want to bar retaliation against workers for discussing salary \ninformation. Some people get fired because they have gone around and \nfound out that a man working the same job as them makes a lot more \nmoney than they do. They get fired for just telling another employee \nwhat they made.\n  We also want this paycheck fairness bill to pass because it would \nhelp ensure more adequate compensation for victims of gender-based pay \ndiscrimination. Today women make up nearly half of the workforce, and \nan increasing number of women are the primary wage earners for their \nfamilies.\n  When I went to law school in Washington--a good school, George \nWashington University--I can only recall one woman in our class. There \nmay have been two or three, but I don't think so. Now over half the \nwomen in law schools in America are women. There is no reason that a \nwoman graduating from law school should get paid less than a man \ngraduating from law school when they are doing the same work.\n  Today women make up nearly half of the workforce. As I said, an \nincreasing number of women are the primary wage earners for the family. \nWe can tell that by what is going on in college. More than half of the \nstudents in college are women. So this problem affects women, children, \nand families across the country. And it really does.\n  With the economy struggling and families stretching every dollar, \nclosing the pay gap is more important than ever. No woman working to \nsupport herself or her family should be paid less than a male \ncounterpart. They are doing the same job, so they should be paid the \nsame.\n  Some employers have taken advantage of women, knowing they would work \nfor less. It might be a single parent, and they have said: We don't \nhave to pay her what we pay him. Now with all of this going on, with \nthe examples I have given, the Republicans are filibustering this bill. \nThey will not even let us vote on it. But what else is new? They have \nfilibustered even what they agree with. They don't agree with this. \nThey don't want women to make the same amount of money, so they are \nfilibustering this bill--they are filibustering even letting us get on \nthe bill. They are filibustering what is called a motion-to-proceed \nrule that I think needs to be changed in this body, and it will \nsomeday.\n  They are filibustering the Paycheck Fairness Act. This legislation \nwould help even the playing field for women in the workplace. If it \nseems unbelievable that the Republicans would block such a commonsense \nmeasure. Consider their track record in this Congress. Republicans have \nblocked legislation to hire more teachers, cops, firefighters, and \nfirst responders. They blocked that. They stalled important jobs \nmeasures such as the aviation bill. The FAA bill had 22 extensions. \nThey finally got it done, but it was so hard. The FAA was closed down \non one occasion for a week.\n  The highway bill has been stalled for months. It is in conference \nnow. They opposed legislation to restore basic fairness to our Tax \nCode. What does that mean? We agree with the American people. About 80 \npercent of the American people believe someone who is making more than \n$1 million a year should pay more than somebody making $100,000 a year. \nBut not our Republican friends. So they opposed legislation to restore \nbasic fairness to our Tax Code. They twice derailed attempts to stop \ninterest rates on student loans from doubling which put affordable \neducation at risk for 7 million students.\n  What I am saying is if we don't get something done by the end of this \nmonth, the interest on a large number of student loans--the so-called \nStafford loans--will grow from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. It will \ndouble. They have stopped that twice.\n  They put women's lives at risk by holding the Violence Against Women \nAct in limbo on a hypertechnical issue. When I say ``hypertechnical,'' \nI mean just that. They would not let us go to conference on what we had \npassed and done here because it had a tax measure in it. By Washington \nstandards, almost no money, a few million dollars. I know that is a \nlot, but is it a reason to stop this bill? Of course not.\n  They launched a series of attacks on women, their access to health \ncare, and\n\n[[Page S3671]]\n\neven contraception. They have amassed an impressive record of \ndestruction, of being on the wrong side of almost every issue. \nUnfortunately, it seems that the Paycheck Fairness Act may have two \nstrikes against it. No. 1, it will be good for women and good for the \neconomy, so Republicans are going to oppose it. Paycheck fairness is \nright for the country, but it appears Republicans will wind up on the \nwrong side of this issue as well. They will send the message to little \ngirls across the country that their work is less valuable because they \nhappen to be born female.\n  Little kids are so impressionistic. I hope everybody in this country \nsaw the picture that appeared in major newspapers around the country \nlast week.\n  There is a man who served as a U.S. marine at the White House. It is \nan important job--helping to provide security to the White House. It is \ntraditional for Democratic Presidents and Republican Presidents. When \nthe marine finishes their tour, the President brings that person and \ntheir family into the Oval Office to say thanks and goodbye. Well, the \nman who came in and who is represented in these pictures had a wife and \ntwo children, including a cute little 5-year-old boy all dressed up \nwith a tie. The President asked the boys if they had a question. The 5-\nyear-old had a big brother who was 9 or 10 years old. The little boy \nhad a question, demonstrating the honesty of a 5-year-old.\n  The President couldn't hear him the first time. He said: What did you \nsay?\n  The little boy said: Is your hair like mine?\n  He is a little African-American boy.\n  Is your hair like mine?\n  I am sure this little boy--I don't know, but I am sure people had \nquestioned his hair, and he wanted to know if the President of the \nUnited States had hair just like his.\n  So the President leaned over and said: You can feel it.\n  When he felt the President's hair, he said: It is just like mine.\n  Doesn't that speak volumes about little children? That is what I am \ntalking about. This little boy knew that even though his hair was \ndifferent than everybody's hair whom he went to school with, he could \nbe President just like the man whose hair he was able to feel.\n  What I have said here today is that it appears Republicans wind up on \nthe wrong side of this issue we have talked about--paycheck fairness--\nsending the message to little girls across the country that their work \nis less valuable because they happen to be born female. I hope the \nRepublicans will change. They are not going to--we all know that--but \nhope springs eternal.\n  Will the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  Mr. REID. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                        Presidential Leadership\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to start out this afternoon by \ncalling attention to what appears to be a pretty serious disconnect \nover at the White House between the President's legislative advisers \nand his political team.\n  For weeks, President Obama has been running around ginning up college \nstudents and late-night television audiences over an impending interest \nrate change on college loans, pointing the finger at Republicans. But \nnot only are Republicans supportive of solving this problem, we are the \nonly ones who actually passed legislation to do so. House Republicans \npassed a bill weeks ago that would have preserved current rates, and \nlate last week Speaker Boehner, Leader Cantor, Senator Kyl, and I sent \na joint letter to the President proposing multiple solutions to the \nproblem that were thoughtfully and carefully designed to gain the \nPresident's support. In fact, the solutions were based on the \nPresident's own proposals.\n  Let me say that again. We sent a letter to the President advocating \ncontinuing the current rate for another year and proposed pay-fors that \nhe himself has endorsed. So one can imagine how surprised we were to \nsee one of the President's political advisers say on one of the Sunday \nshows yesterday that Republicans in Congress are sitting on our hands \nand an op-ed this morning by the Education Secretary saying that \nCongress isn't lifting a finger to resolve the problem.\n  So let's be very clear about all of this. Republicans in Congress are \nthe only ones actually working to solve the student loan issue. Unless \nthe President isn't having his mail forwarded to him on the campaign \ntrail, he knows it as well as I do.\n  I couldn't help but notice that the President is on a fundraising \nblitz in Manhattan today. No doubt it is easier to walk into these \nevents when one has a good piece of fiction to sell about Republican \nobstructionism. But the President's campaign rhetoric is increasingly \nat odds with reality. On the student loan issue, at least, it is \nRepublicans who have been working on a solution and the President who \nhas been totally AWOL. All he has to do is pick up the phone and tell \nus which one of his own proposals he will accept. It is that easy. But \nthe truth is that the President doesn't really want to solve this \nproblem. He seems to prefer the talking point, as disingenuous as it \nis.\n  Speaking of talking points, it has been suggested by some on the \nPresident's political team that Republicans are rooting for economic \nfailure. That is absolutely preposterous. If Republicans wanted \nfailure, we would support this President's misguided policies.\n  But the larger point is this: We will never solve any of these \nproblems we face while the President continues to put his need for \ncampaign rhetoric ahead of finding bipartisan solutions. And whether it \nis pretending that small-ball, Post-it note-quality proposals would \nhave a major impact on the economy or pretending that Republicans, who \nare the only ones actually working on bipartisan solutions, are somehow \nsitting on our hands, he is doing a major disservice to the American \npeople.\n  For the good of the country, it is time for the President to take yes \nfor an answer. It is long past time for the President to lead.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Avoiding Sequestration\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I would like to address some of the \nrecent press chatter that attempts to paint Republicans as closet \nKeynesians because we oppose the massive defense cuts that are \ncontained in the Budget Control Act--the automatic sequestration or \nacross-the-board cuts that occur unless Congress acts to avoid that \nbefore the end of this year.\n  The implication is that if we make economic arguments against these \nautomatic cuts; namely, that they will result in massive job losses, we \nundercut our arguments against the President's stimulus spending, which \nis ostensibly created in order to stimulate consumer demand and \ntherefore increase spending, which is supposed to get us out of the \neconomic doldrums we are in. I wish to make two points in response.\n  First, of course, eliminating more than 1 million defense-related \njobs, which is what will happen if the automatic sequestration occurs, \nwill obviously hurt the economy. It will obviously result in job \nlosses, and many people will suffer. That is what a George Mason \nUniversity study said this $492 billion in cuts will contribute to. In \nfact, the same point was made in a CBO study that was released a couple \nof weeks ago. How could such massive job losses not do economic harm? A \nmillion jobs--jobs in both the private and public sectors--comprise a \nsubstantial part of our economy. In fact,\n\n[[Page S3672]]\n\njust in my State of Arizona, there are about 33,200 private-sector jobs \nat risk if these automatic defense cuts were to take place.\n  But--and this is my second point--most Federal spending, certainly \nincluding defense spending, is for purposes other than stimulating the \neconomy. I support spending for national security because it is \nnecessary for the Nation, not because it also happens to provide jobs. \nAnd that is the way it is with a lot of Federal spending. We support \nthe programs because they satisfy a need, and certainly the No.1 need \nof those of us in the Congress and the President is to provide for the \nnational defense. So we spend what we think is necessary each year to \nprovide for the national defense. The fact that also can create some \njobs is a side benefit, if you will, in an economic sense, but it is \nnot the reason we do the spending in the first place. If that spending \nis cut way back, however, there is no question that jobs will be lost, \nand I think that is worth pointing out in the context of a discussion \nabout economic recovery.\n  What I would not do is support unnecessary spending on defense or \nanything else just to create more government-supported jobs, just for \nthe sake of stimulating the economy. The taxpayers don't have enough \nmoney to contribute to the Federal Government for that purpose. We \nshould spend what is necessary and no more. So supporting existing \ndefense jobs is very different from supporting redistributionist \ngovernment stimulus spending for jobs there is no demand for and on \ngovernment payments for things such as food stamps and other transfer \npayments that don't necessarily translate to new jobs but simply move \nmoney around. The difference, really, is how you spend the money.\n  Just to reiterate, Republicans support defense jobs because they \nproduce something essential to our national security and the things \nthey relate to--intelligence and making equipment and weapons and so \non. The jobs that produces are incidental to the primary reason we \nsupport those jobs.\n  Keynesians support redistributionist government stimulus spending \nbecause they think government spending boosts jobs and economic growth \nby increasing consumer demand, as I said. But this zero-sum thinking \nmay result in the redistribution of resources from one group of \nAmericans to another but doesn't necessarily result in any net new \nproduction or economic growth.\n  It is said, for example, that we could pay people to dig holes and \nthen fill them up again and we would have created jobs but we wouldn't \nhave created any productivity or growth for the economy per se. \nUnfortunately, very often the group left paying the bill is the very \ngroup of people we rely upon to create the new jobs--in this case, the \ntaxpayers, especially small business folks, whom we call upon to create \nthe jobs coming out of the recession. The real trade-off is between \ngovernment jobs and jobs created in the private sector. Leaving more \nmoney with the job creators in the private sector enables them to \ncreate those jobs. Taking more of it away and sending it to Washington \nfor Washington to redistribute takes away from job creation.\n  As I have noted many times, the last 3-plus years have shown we can't \nspend our way to economic growth and prosperity; that is, we--the \nFederal Government--can't spend our way to growth and prosperity \nbecause the money we spend either has to come from taxpayers or be \nborrowed and eventually be paid back by taxpayers. The stimulus was \nsupposed to keep unemployment below 8 percent, but we have just marked \nthe 40th straight month of unemployment higher than 8 percent--above 8 \npercent. I think such outcomes demonstrate why Republicans oppose these \nKeynesian spending policies. They simply don't work. If they did, we \nwould be rolling in dough right now after four consecutive trillion-\ndollar deficit spending sprees.\n  To set the record straight, Republicans are not arguing that the \nDepartment of Defense is a jobs program. It is necessary for our \nnational defense. That is why we spend the money. We are not saying we \nare going to fix the economy by undoing the defense cuts under the \nsequestration. We are not even saying defense-related jobs are the most \nimportant sequester-related issue. What we are saying is that defense \ncuts are very dangerous for our national security, and if they go \nthrough, not only is our safety jeopardized, but we may have more than \n1 million newly unemployed Americans. That is not a desirable outcome, \nand that is worth talking about. That is something we must keep in mind \nas this debate goes forward.\n  In conclusion, I renew my call to my Democratic colleagues and to our \nHouse colleagues to get together--Republicans and Democrats, House and \nSenate--to do something we all know is in the best interest of the \ncountry: avoid the automatic sequestration, half of which applies to \ndefense--we are all for a strong national defense--and half of which \napplies to all the other discretionary spending programs. All those \nthings will suffer if we don't reprioritize our spending and our \nreductions in spending as opposed to allowing this to happen across the \nboard.\n  We do that by finding offsets we can agree upon in a way that will, \nas I said, set the priorities and enable the departments of government \nthat have to plan for the future to do so in an intelligent way rather \nthan simply knowing at the end of the year they are all going to have \nto have an across-the-board cut that isn't in anyone's best interest.\n\n  It is not as if we are suggesting doing away with the savings that \nwould result from sequestration, which is $109 billion for next year. \nWell, believe me, there is $109 billion in the $3-plus trillion \nspending we will be doing here. There certainly is $109 billion in \nsavings we can achieve, and there have been several proposals already \nas to how that can be done. And it can be done without losing Federal \njobs, it can be done without negatively impacting the economy, and it \nneeds to be done under the law because Congress promised that we would \nsave that $109 billion next year. It is just a matter of whether we \nwill do so intelligently, making the decisions we can make--and that \nour constituents expect us to make--in an intelligent way, setting \npriorities, or whether we will simply succumb to the notion that we \ncan't make a decision, so we will let it happen across the board.\n  Just to give an illustration, how would you like to be a Navy admiral \nwho hears the words: Here is your 80 percent of a submarine, admiral. \nIt doesn't work that way. If we need the submarine, we need to pay for \n100 percent of the submarine and cut somewhere else. That is all we are \nsuggesting. We need to do that while the planning can be done for next \nyear; otherwise, we are going to have a very inefficient and Draconian \ncut coming up that is not going to benefit anyone.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues, let's find a way to get together, find \nthose savings, and get that done before we get toward the end of the \nyear, when the departments can do the planning we will be asking them \nto do.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me first of all express my \nappreciation to the majority. I understand I am to be given some 40 \nminutes after the vote at the conclusion of the remarks by Senator \nBrown of Ohio. I have a subject that is very significant, and it is one \nI cannot do while being interrupted. So I appreciate starting this \nperiod off after the recess being able to express my concern over what \nI refer to as President Obama's war on fossil fuels and specifically \ntoday on coal. I look forward to that sometime around the 6 o'clock \nhour.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise to support the Paycheck Fairness\n\n[[Page S3673]]\n\nAct that we are going to have a chance to vote on tomorrow. I hope my \ncolleagues will support the effort of my colleague Senator Mikulski in \nallowing S. 3220 to move forward. I congratulate my colleague Senator \nMikulski for her incredible leadership on behalf of women's issues. She \nhas done that throughout her entire career, and we knew she would be in \nthe forefront of this effort for paycheck fairness. I am proud to stand \nshoulder to shoulder with her in this fight for basic justice in our \nNation, to provide equality of pay in this country based upon a \nperson's work and not a person's gender.\n  It builds on the Equal Pay Act of 1963 that was signed by President \nKennedy. Yes, 1963 was the year Congress first spoke and said we are \ngoing to have equal pay for equal work in America, that America would \nshow leadership internationally to say: Let's end discrimination \nagainst women in the workplace.\n  That legislation fought sex discrimination in employment wages, \nincluding the fact that such discrimination not only depressed wages \nand living standards for female employees, but it affected our entire \nlabor resources here in America, holding back the development of our \ncountry. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers \nfrom engaging in discrimination against their employees based on \ngender.\n  Today, women still face a pay gap. In 1963, women made 59 cents for \nevery $1 made by a man. Those were the numbers in 1963. Today, women \nmake just 77 cents for every $1 made by a man for equal work or \ncomparable duties. That means a woman has to work 4 days to get 3 days' \npay. That is not acceptable. I understand we have made some progress \nsince 1963, but one would think that within a 50-year span we could \nhave done better.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act will allow us to reach our goal of equal \npay for equal work. Estimates indicate that the wage gap costs women, \non average, $434,000 over their careers. While I am pleased we are \nmaking progress, this progress is just too slow, and we need to move \nmore aggressively to close this pay gap in the year 2012.\n  Congress took another important step forward for equal rights for \nwomen by passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The legislation \nallows plaintiffs to sue for wage discrimination based on each new \ndiscriminatory paycheck they receive. In this case, Congress overturned \na decision of the U.S. Supreme Court which held that women were only \nallowed to sue their employers within 180 days after the discrimination \nbegan, even if the women were not aware the discrimination was \noccurring, as a result of not knowing their coworkers' wages.\n  Quite frankly, I think the Supreme Court decision defies logic. How \ncan someone possibly bring a case within 180 days if they do not know \nabout the discriminatory pay differential? Congress did the right \nthing. But basically we held the line on allowing enforcement rather \nthan advancing what we need to, to make sure we have an effective \nremedy for discrimination against women in our workplaces.\n  That is exactly what the Paycheck Fairness Act does. It provides for \nan effective enforcement so women, in fact, can hold their employers \nresponsible if the disparity is based upon their gender, which should \nnot be in America.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act would require employers to show pay \ndisparity is truly related to business justifications and job \nperformance and not gender. It prohibits employer retaliation for \nsharing salary information with coworkers. Under current law, employers \ncan sue and punish employees for sharing such information. In addition, \nthis legislation strengthens remedies for pay discrimination by \nincreasing compensation women can seek.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act also would strengthen the ability of the \nDepartment of Labor to help women achieve pay equity by requiring the \nDepartment of Labor to enhance outreach and training efforts to work \nwith employers to eliminate pay disparities and to continue to collect \nand disseminate wage information based on gender.\n  The purpose of this act is to avoid discriminatory pay, not to sue \nemployers after the fact. Therefore, this bill, the Paycheck Fairness \nAct, is well balanced in providing remedies, yes, if, in fact, an \nemployer is discriminating on pay based on gender but to provide help \nto employers so they can take the appropriate steps to make sure, in \nfact, their workforce is fairly paying their employees.\n  The legislation makes clear that employers are liable only for wage \ndifferentials that are not bona fide factors. Bona fide factors include \nitems such as education, training or experience and must be job related \nand consistent with business necessity. Employees will also be able to \nargue that employers should use alternative employment practices that \nwould serve the same business purpose without producing the wage \ndifferential.\n\n  The legislation is crafted to avoid any undue burden on small \nbusinesses. I think the Presiding Officer and I both understand the \nimportance of small businesses with the work we do on the Small \nBusiness Committee. This act is delayed from taking effect until 6 \nmonths after its passage so the Labor Secretary and EEOC can develop \ntechnical assistance materials to assist small businesses in complying \nwith the new law, and the agencies are charged with engaging in \nresearch, education, and outreach on the new law.\n  The EEOC is charged with issuing regulations to provide for the \ncollection of pay information from employers. The law specifically \nstates that these regulations should ``consider factors including the \nimposition of burdens on the employers, the frequency of required data \ncollection reports . . . and the most effective format for data \ncollection.''\n  We have heard about the cumulative information: Why can't we simplify \nit? Why can't we combine it? Why can't we be sensitive to small \nbusinesses? The Paycheck Fairness Act in our language makes it clear \nthese regulations must be sensitive to the special needs of small \nbusinesses to make sure, in fact, this bill provides an effective \nremedy without excessive burdens on the business community.\n  In my own State of Maryland, the gender pay gap is 14.6 percent, \naccording to the Joint Economic Committee. In Maryland, women's median \nweekly wage for full-time workers is $822, while men's is $962. That is \nnot right. In Maryland, over one-third of married, employed mothers are \ntheir families' primary wage earner. Maryland women contribute, on \naverage, over 40 percent of family wages and salary income to their \nhouseholds. It is time for women who live in Maryland--or who live in \nany State in our Nation--to get fair pay for the work they do.\n  I have the opportunity to chair the subcommittee on the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee that deals with international development \nassistance. I have worked very closely with Secretary of State Clinton \nto deal with gender issues internationally.\n  We have discovered something that should be pretty obvious, but it is \nsomething that is very telling. The way a nation treats its women will \nvery much be a barometer as to how well that nation is doing--how well \nthey are doing with economic growth, how stable their government is. \nThe United States has been a leader in working with countries around \nthe world to treat women right, to do land reform so that the women who \nwork the fields also own the property they are working, to make sure \nthey share fairly in the fruits of their labor. We have been a leader \ninternationally. I am proud of the progress we are making. I am proud \nof what Secretary Clinton and President Obama have done in showing the \nworld that it is in a nation's interests to make sure women are \nproperly dealt with, that they have proper education, that they are \nincluded in the system for education, for health care, for job \ntraining, for all of those issues, and are treated fairly when it comes \nto the economic rewards for the work they do. But it starts with us \ndoing what is right in America.\n  Fifty years is too long for women to wait for equal pay after \nCongress took action in 1963. As a father and grandfather of strong, \nintelligent women, pay equity is a personal issue for me. I want my two \ngranddaughters to know that when they grow up, they will be paid fairly \nfor the work and not 77 cents for every dollar of their male \ncounterparts.\n  I am proud to stand with Senator Mikulski in this fight to finally \nensure that equal pay for equal work becomes\n\n[[Page S3674]]\n\na reality for all women and men. I am pleased that this legislation is \nendorsed by a large number of organizations that have been in the \nforefront of fighting for equal justice in America. It is time to act \nand pass the Paycheck Fairness Act.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/04/senate-section/article/S3674-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3674-S3677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF TIMOTHY S. HILLMAN TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                     THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Timothy S. Hillman, of \nMassachusetts, to be United States District Judge for the District of \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today, the Senate will vote on the \nnomination of Timothy Hillman to fill a judicial vacancy in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts. Judge Hillman has the \nstrong bipartisan support of his home state Senators. His nomination \nwas reported with a near unanimous vote of 17 1 by the Judiciary \nCommittee nearly 3 months ago, with the only objection coming from \nSenator Lee's customary protest vote. I thank the majority leader for \nhis work in securing a vote on Judge Hillman's nomination.\n  I would note, however, that we have passed over consideration of four \nother nominees who are all listed on the executive calendar ahead of \nJudge Hillman. Those nominees--Andrew Hurwitz for the Ninth Circuit, \nJeffrey Helmick for the Northern District of Ohio, Patty Shwartz for \nthe Third Circuit, and Mary Lewis for the District of South Carolina--\nare all extremely well qualified, have the support of their home state \nSenators, were reported favorably out of the Judiciary Committee, and \ndeserve an up-or-down vote. I hope we will have a vote on them soon.\n  Judge Hillman could and should have been confirmed back in March when \nthe Majority Leader first filed cloture on his nomination. While I \nregret that he was not part of the original agreement reached by the \nMajority Leader and the Republican leader for a floor vote, I am glad \nthat an agreement was reached to consider his nomination today. Once we \nvote on Judge Hillman, we need to agree to vote on the 15 other \njudicial nominees stalled on the Executive calendar because there are \nstill far too many vacancies plaguing our courts today.\n  The Congressional Research Service recently released a report about \nthe treatment of President Obama's judicial nominations that confirms \nwhat we already know--that Senate Republicans have held President \nObama's nominees to a different and unfair standard. For example, 95 \npercent of district court nominees in President George W. Bush's first \nterm were confirmed, while only 78 percent of President Obama's \ndistrict court nominees have been confirmed.\n  President Obama's nominees are also being delayed and forced to wait \nfar longer on the Senate floor than President Bush's nominees. The \nmedian wait time for President Obama's district nominees after having \nbeen reported favorably out of Committee is more than 4 times longer \nthan for President Bush's district nominees. The median wait time for \nPresident Obama's circuit nominees is 7.3 times longer than for \nPresident Bush's circuit nominees.\n  The simple fact is that the Senate is still lagging far behind what \nwe accomplished during the first term of President George W. Bush. \nDuring President Bush's first term we reduced the number of judicial \nvacancies by almost 75 percent. When I became Chairman in the summer of \n2001, there were 110 vacancies. As chairman, I worked with the \nadministration and Senators from both sides of the aisle to confirm 100 \njudicial nominees of a conservative Republican President in 17 months.\n  Senate Democrats continued when in the minority to work with Senate \nRepublicans to confirm President Bush's consensus judicial nominations \nwell into 2004, a Presidential election year. At the end of that \nPresidential term, the Senate had acted to confirm 205 circuit and \ndistrict court nominees. In May 2004, we reduced judicial vacancies to \nbelow 50 on the way to 28 that August. Despite 2004 being an election \nyear, we were able to reduce vacancies to the lowest level in the last \n20 years. At a time of great turmoil and political confrontation, \ndespite the attack on 9/11, the anthrax letters shutting down Senate \noffices, and the ideologically-driven judicial selections of President \nBush, we worked together to promptly confirm consensus nominees and \nsignificantly reduce judicial vacancies. By working together, we \nlowered vacancy rates more than twice as quickly as Senate Republicans \nhave allowed during President Obama's first term.\n  In October 2008, another presidential election year, we again worked \nto reduce judicial vacancies and were able to get back down to 34 \nvacancies. I accommodated Senate Republicans and continued holding \nexpedited hearings and votes on judicial nominations into September \n2008.\n  By comparison, the vacancy rate remains nearly twice what it was at \nthis point in the first term of President Bush. While vacancies were \nreduced below 50 by May of President Bush's fourth year, in June of \nPresident Obama's fourth year they remain in the mid-70s. They remained \nnear or above 80 for nearly 3 years. We are more than 30 confirmations \nbehind the pace we set in 2001 through 2004. Of course, we could move \nforward if the Senate were allowed to vote without further delay on the \n16 judicial nominees ready for final action. The Senate could reduce \nvacancies below 60 and make progress.\n  The recently released CRS Report also notes that in five of the last \neight Presidential election years, the Senate has confirmed at least 22 \nnominees after May 31. Because of how far we are lagging from President \nBush's record of confirmations, we should be working to exceed those \nnumbers. We can start today by confirming Judge Hillman and the other \n15 judicial nominees ready for final Senate action. Another five \njudicial nominees were ready for final Judicial Committee action in May \nbut held over by Committee Republicans. Those five nominees should be \nvoted out of the Committee this Thursday. In addition, we are holding a \nhearing for another three judicial nominees this Wednesday. With \ncooperation from Senate Republicans the Senate could make real progress \nand match what we have accomplished in prior years.\n  Timothy Hillman was rated unanimously well qualified by the ABA's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary, the highest possible \nrating. He has been a federal magistrate judge on the court in which he \nhas been nominated for nearly 6 years. Prior to his service as a \nmagistrate judge, Judge Hillman served for 15 years as a state court \njudge on the Massachusetts Superior Court and the Massachusetts \nDistrict Court. He has also spent significant time in private practice \nand several years of experience as an Assistant District Attorney in \nthe Worcester County District Attorney's Office.\n  Judge Hillman is a respected and experienced jurist in Massachusetts. \nHis nomination has the strong support of both his home state Senators, \nSenator John Kerry and Senator Scott Brown, who introduced him to the \nJudiciary Committee at his hearing in February.\n  Senator Brown said of Judge Hillman:\n\n       We have in Judge Hillman somebody who is greatly respected \n     in Massachusetts and especially in the Worcester area through \n     his innovation and integrity and dedication to fairness. He \n     is really to be commended, and I want to thank he and his \n     wife for, obviously, putting up with the process. And I am \n     going to do everything in my power to encourage my colleagues \n     to make sure that we get a vote on this right away, because \n     Massachusetts needs a jurist like him right away to do the \n     people's business, and that is so critically important.\n\n\n[[Page S3675]]\n\n\n  While this vote on Judge Hillman is hardly ``right away,'' as Senate \nRepublicans have continued to needlessly stall his nomination for close \nto 3 months now, it is finally occurring. This consensus nomination is \nanother example of a judge's confirmation being delayed needlessly for \nmonths and months for no good reason or purpose other than delay. Given \nJudge Hillman's qualifications and significant bipartisan support, he \nshould be confirmed easily.\n  After today, we still have much more work to do to help resolve the \njudicial vacancy crisis that has persisted for more than 3 years. When \nthe Majority Leader and the Republican leader came to their interim \nunderstanding in March, it resulted in votes on 14 of the 22 judicial \nnominations then awaiting final consideration. Because the arrangement \ntook months to implement what the Senate could have done in hours, the \nbacklog of judicial vacancies and judicial nominees continues. Today, \nwe have 16 judicial nominees awaiting action. Let us do what we did on \nNovember 14, 2002, when we confirmed 18 of President Bush's judicial \nnominations on a single day.\n  Our courts need qualified Federal judges, not vacancies, if they are \nto reduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their \nday in court. It is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who turn to \ntheir courts for justice to suffer unnecessary delays. When an injured \nplaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her medical expenses, \nthat plaintiff should not have to wait 3 years before a judge hears the \ncase. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they \nshould not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute.\n  We need to work to reduce the vacancies that are burdening the \nFederal judiciary and the millions of Americans who rely on our Federal \ncourts to seek justice. Let us work in a bipartisan fashion to confirm \nthese qualified judicial nominees so that we can address the judicial \nvacancy crisis and so they can serve the American people.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today, the Senate turns to another \njudicial nomination, that of Timothy Hillman, to be U.S. district judge \nfor the District of Massachusetts. I support this nomination.\n  We continue to confirm the President's nominees at a brisk pace. In \nfact, with today's confirmations, we will have confirmed 147 of this \nPresident's district and circuit court nominees.\n  Let me put that in perspective for my colleagues. We also have \nconfirmed two Supreme Court nominees during President Obama's term. The \nlast time the Senate confirmed two Supreme Court nominees was during \nPresident Bush's second term. And during President Bush's entire second \nterm, the Senate confirmed a total of only 120 district and circuit \ncourt nominees. We have confirmed 27 more nominees for President Obama \nthan we did for President Bush in a similar time period.\n  Judge Hillman received his B.A. from Coe College in 1970 and his J.D. \nfrom Suffolk Law School in 1973. He began his legal career in 1974 as a \nstaff attorney at Murphy & Pusateri. In 1975 he became an assistant \ndistrict attorney, where he prosecuted criminal cases for Worcester \nCounty. During this time, he also conducted limited private practice, \nwhich centered on drafting wills, representing clients in real estate \ntransactions, and representing plaintiffs in motor torts. He left the \nD.A.'s office in 1978 and represented criminal defendants in private \npractice until 1988. He also represented multiple municipalities in \nthis stretch of time as either city solicitor or town counsel. While \nworking in these capacities, he represented the municipalities in \ncourt, gave legal advice to their boards and elected officials, and \ndrafted and reviewed legal documents.\n  In 1995 Judge Hillman was appointed to be associate judge of the \nGardner District Court, and he became presiding justice there in 1997. \nFrom 1998 to 2006 Judge Hillman was a judge for the Massachusetts \nSuperior Court, an appointed position. In 2006 Judge Hillman was \nappointed to be a U.S. magistrate judge for the U.S. District Court for \nthe District of Massachusetts, Worcester Division. As a magistrate \njudge, he manages and tries civil cases with the consent of the \nparties, both jury and nonjury. He is also responsible for the \ninitiation and management of criminal felonies, not including trial, \nand all aspects of criminal misdemeanors.\n  The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated \nhim as ``well qualified'' for this position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, may I inquire as to how \nmuch time remains for the two sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Fifteen minutes per side? How much time \nremains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, is this controlled time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, there is 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. The Senator, my colleague, is able to speak on Republican \ntime, I believe.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct\n  Mr. KERRY. If he wants to go first, I am happy for him to go ahead.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I will defer to the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank my colleague for his courtesy. I am perfectly \nhappy to wait and listen to his comments.\n  We have a sort of Alphonse and Gaston thing going back and forth.\n  Madam President, I thank Chairman Leahy for his work on the Judiciary \nCommittee in helping bring this nomination to the floor, and, \nobviously, Senator Brown and I are here, having worked together to \nchoose this nominee and to send his name to the White House. We are \nvery grateful, both of us, to President Obama for acting favorably on \nthis nonpartisan recommendation which we made, and we are grateful to \nthe other members of the Judiciary Committee who approved the \nnomination and brought it to the floor expeditiously so we can fill a \nvery important vacancy in Massachusetts.\n  I think both of us believe the President could not have nominated a \nmore qualified individual than Judge Hillman. He is already a judge, as \nwe know, but a broad segment of the judicial community in Massachusetts \nagrees with us completely. Senator Brown and I agreed on a team made up \nof some of the top lawyers in our State who would get together and \nscreen these candidates before we even view them, and so this candidate \ncomes with the endorsement of the Massachusetts Bar Association, the \nWorcester Bar Association, the Hampden Bar Association, and the backing \nof this nonpartisan search committee that gave us several names to \nevaluate. We sat down and interviewed the judges, and I think both of \nus are extremely pleased with the results.\n  In Judge Hillman, we see what President Obama has recognized--a \nthoughtful, fair, honest jurist who has a long record of public service \nas counsel to several municipalities in Massachusetts and as a \nmagistrate judge in Worcester.\n  There is not going to be any learning curve for Judge Hillman if he \nis confirmed by the Senate this afternoon. Serving on the District \nCourt in Worcester would be an enormous capstone to his decades of \ntireless public service, and I know he will bring his signature brand \nof thoughtful deliberation to the Worcester District. I am very \ngrateful for his many years of public service.\n  As the current Presiding Officer of the Senate knows, having been a \nformer Governor who has made her own nominations, it is tough to get \nlawyers nowadays who are willing to give up the compensation of the \nprivate sector to come and work for very little in a tireless public \nway. So I wish to recognize Judge Hillman's family--his wife Kay, and \nhis children Zachary, Molly, and Patrick--for their contributions \ntoward his ability to be able to share his life in public service with \nall of us.\n  I ask my colleagues to support his nomination this afternoon, Judge \nTimothy Hillman, to the U.S. District Court of Worcester, MA.\n\n[[Page S3676]]\n\n  I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, I appreciate the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts setting up that process. We have worked hand \nin hand to try to develop a nonpartisan, unbiased process. Quite \nhonestly, I was deeply impressed with the way we were able to handle it \nand get some truly qualified candidates. It was good to work with my \ncolleague, and I look forward to doing it again. I rise also to endorse \nthe nomination of Judge Timothy Hillman to the U.S. District Court for \nthe District of Massachusetts.\n  As many of you know, when I was a young man, I had a run-in with the \nlaw. It was a judge named Samuel Zoll who set me straight and served as \na role model for me. No doubt Judge Zoll served as a role model for \nmany young men and women in Massachusetts. My experience shows the \nability of judges to do good in their communities.\n  Today we are considering the nomination of a judge who will make the \nWorcester, MA, area a better place. I know that for a fact, as Senator \nKerry pointed out. Judge Hillman is a man of integrity who will make us \nproud as the next Federal judge in Massachusetts. He will have a chance \nto shape young people's lives, much like Judge Zoll did for me.\n  Before I say a few words about Judge Hillman's background, once \nagain, I thank Senator Kerry. We have in place a process I would \nrecommend to other Senators so they can get good jurists in their own \nStates. We worked very closely on that nomination.\n  I wish to also thank the judicial nominating committee we comprised. \nWe have, as was said, some of the most respected and experienced \nattorneys in Massachusetts trying to bring something very special to \nour State, and that is a balanced judiciary. The attorneys on the panel \ncame from all walks of life and different areas of our State, and the \njudicial nominating committee reviewed many applications and \ninterviewed nearly every applicant, took their assignment very \nseriously, and we are both deeply appreciative of their time and \neffort.\n  Ultimately, this bipartisan committee made several recommendations, \nand Senator Kerry and I then interviewed each and every one of them. It \nwas clear during his interview that we were immediately impressed by \nhis poise and intellect. Clearly, he understands the proper role of a \njudge and is deeply committed to achieving justice.\n  In his interview, he lived up to his reputation as a thoughtful and \nthorough jurist with deep ties to the community, which makes it even \nall the more fitting that he will remain in Worcester to do good for \nthe people of Worcester. They respect him as one of their own and trust \nthat he will serve them well.\n  Since Senator Kerry and I recommended Judge Hillman to President \nObama, we have received an outpouring of support for Judge Hillman from \nthe Worcester bar and its residents, and we are both thankful for that. \nHis legal background also makes him uniquely qualified for this \nposition. He is currently a magistrate judge in Worcester, MA. In that \nrole he has been indispensable to the Federal judiciary in \nMassachusetts. If confirmed he will seamlessly integrate with the other \nmembers of the District of Massachusetts courts.\n  The bar in Worcester has a tremendous amount of confidence in him, as \nboth Senator Kerry and I do as well. They know when they appear before \nthe judge, they are going to get a fair shake and that he has a sharp \nlegal mind.\n  In addition to his role as magistrate judge, he generously gives a \nsignificant amount of his time to bar activities. For example, in 2008, \nin partnership with the U.S. Probation Office, Judge Hillman \nestablished a Federal reentry court program called RESTART for high-\nrisk ex-offenders who have been released from prison. Judge Hillman's \ngoal in establishing RESTART was to reduce recidivism and to focus on \nemployment skills for ex-offenders. Judge Hillman should be proud that \nonly after a few years, RESTART is becoming a national model for \nreentry courts, and for that we are also thankful.\n  In 2009 he was appointed as the national cochair of a group of judges \nand support staff who are responsible for the design and implementation \nof the next generation of the Federal courts case management and \nelectronic filing system.\n  Prior to his service as a magistrate, he served as a State trial \ncourt judge for 16 years. Before becoming a judge, Judge Hillman spent \n14 years in private legal practice, giving that up, as Senator Kerry \nreferenced, to do good public service. He served as town councilman to \nthree towns also in Massachusetts. So it is rare to find a nominee with \nthe diversity of experience of Judge Hillman.\n  It will actually also affect the people in the Presiding Officer's \nState who work in Massachusetts--and I would encourage and seek the \nPresiding Officer's vote as well. For that reason, he is a superb \nchoice.\n  In closing, I enthusiastically support Judge Hillman's nomination as \na Federal judge. I will be standing right up there encouraging each and \nevery Member of both sides of the aisle to see if we can get him \nthrough almost unanimously.\n  I have had the opportunity to support a stellar candidate to the \nFederal bench before, and I am excited to do it again. I thank Senator \nKerry once again for the process. We have appointed two great judges to \nthe judicial bar back home, and it is good for Massachusetts.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I believe there is a vote due at this \nhour, is there not? I ask for the yeas and nays with respect to the \nHillman nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in 25 days, the cost of attending \ncollege, a trade school, a university, or a 2-year community college \nwill increase for some 380,000 students in my State of Ohio. It is \nbecause without congressional action--something which we have tried to \nfix repeatedly on the floor of the Senate--interest rates for Stafford \nloans are scheduled to double on July 1.\n  Now, this was done 5 years ago. Bipartisanly, we were able to do \nthis. President Bush signed legislation by a Democratic Congress--a \nDemocratic House, a Democratic Senate--to freeze interest rates on \nStafford subsidized loans for American college students for 5 years at \n3.4 percent. That expires July 1, and it is something we need to do, we \nhave tried to do. It has repeatedly been batted down by threats of a \nfilibuster.\n  That is why today I met with students in Toledo, at Owens Community \nCollege. Jakki, CJ, and Megan all have dreams to attend, first, Owens, \nand then to move on to 4-year institutions. But they rely on Stafford \nloans to afford their tuition and other expenses.\n  I have been to Cuyahoga County Community College meeting with \nstudents. I have been to Hiram College visiting students on their \ngraduation day. I have been to the University of Cincinnati. I have \nbeen to Ohio State. I have been to Wright State University in Dayton \nspeaking to students.\n  They understand if we do not act, future college graduates will see \nan average of about $1,000 in extra interest fees per student per \nStafford loan.\n  My colleague Jack Reed, a Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Harkin, \nand I have introduced the Stop the Student Loan Interest Rate Hike Act, \nwhich would keep college affordable for more students.\n  The act is fully paid for by closing a corporate tax loophole. We \nwant to pay for this. We do not want to add to the debt of college \nstudents. We do not want to add to their personal debt by allowing this \n3.4-percent interest rate to double.\n  I would like to make this more personal, if I could, and read some \nletters from students in Ohio schools. These higher interest rates \naffect students personally, of course. It also affects the families who \nare helping to pay for their college tuition in many cases. It also \naffects the community. We know, looking back at the 1940s, 1950s, \n1960s, and 1970s, the GI bill enabled literally millions of \nindividuals--millions of young Americans who had fought for their \ncountry in World War II or Korea or in successive military \ninvolvements--to go to school and to afford their college tuition. What \nthat meant was not just helping those students and their families. It \nhelped raise the level of prosperity for the entire country because \nthose were people who got to go to school. It meant they could start \nbusinesses and buy homes and get better jobs and give back a lot to our \ncommunities.\n  That is the same thing that will happen if we can lock in these 3.4-\npercent interest rates. It will mean students who might not have been \nable to buy a car or might not have been able to start a business or \nmight have been more reluctant to start a family--they are less likely \nto do that if we cannot lock in these interest rates.\n  Before yielding the floor to Senator Inhofe, I would like to share \nthree letters my office received recently, starting with Kasey from \nUnion in Miami County, OH. Miami County is just north of Dayton.\n\n       Going to college was never a question for me--there was an \n     unspoken understanding that it would happen.\n       Unfortunately, my parents could not afford to pay for \n     college for all of their children, particularly after [we \n     faced] foreclosure in 2007.\n       At 17, I faced responsibility for covering the $10,000 per \n     year gap of paying for George Washington University.\n       Over the past four years, I have taken out the maximum \n     allowed in student loans--both subsidized and unsubsidized. I \n     have held a federal work study job since October of my \n     freshman year. Because both of my parents were unemployed at \n     the time, I was forced to take out PLUS loans. This still \n     left me with a gap, and I had to ask my parents to spend a \n     significant portion of their retirement fund to allow me to \n     finish my degree.\n       At 21 years old, I have more than $42,000 in loans to \n     repay. I have received a world class education thanks to the \n     opportunities provided to me by my scholarships, student \n     loans, Pell grants and federal work study programs.\n       Students should not be punished for following the American \n     Dream. There is a huge emphasis on the importance of \n     education, but the soaring costs of private and public \n     universities is making it harder and harder for my \n     generation.\n       Doubling the interest rates on loans is not the solution. \n     Making education harder to pay for will shut doors for \n     students like me, and college will inch back toward being a \n     privilege of the wealthy.\n       I have worked part time since I was 15, I did well in high \n     school to win a substantial scholarship, I have maintained my \n     grades in college to keep that scholarship, I have taken \n     advantage of work study programs, and I have every intention \n     of paying back my student loans in full as I enter the world \n     of full time employment.\n       Please do not make it harder to pursue the American Dream.\n\n  Waylon from Fairborn, Greene County, near Springfield. The city of \nXenia is nearby, outside of Dayton.\n\n       I am deeply concerned about the thought of an increase in \n     student loan interest.\n       I am currently a student at Antioch University Midwest \n     taking classes to pursue my license to become an Intervention \n     Specialist. I also have two children who are finishing up \n     their sophomore years in college at the end of May.\n       My sons, as well as myself, have student loan debt and an \n     increase in the rates would certainly have a diminishing \n     affect on affording an already higher tuition rate at the \n     college itself.\n       Hasn't it been a big push for the people in our country to \n     become more educated equating to a more resourceful and \n     competitive country?\n       How will this ever be attained without an affordable \n     education?\n       Gaining higher, more competitively paying jobs would also \n     equate to more taxes being paid!\n       Isn't that what we should be looking at?\n       I believe that there is a disconnection between what people \n     in Washington want--a more educated country and how they are \n     willing to get it.\n\n  Sarah, from Dayton, writes:\n\n       I started college in fall 2003. As a foster youth fresh \n     from emancipating, I took out student loans because I don't \n     have any family that can help me pay for college.\n       9 years, 2 Bachelor of Arts (one in Criminal Justice and \n     the other in Social Science Education . . . ) and an almost \n     complete Master of Arts degree later not only am I $100,000 \n     in debt with student loans I am still unable to find a job.\n       Since I am overqualified for jobs at places like McDonald's \n     (who take one look at my application and reject it) and \n     underqualified for positions using either of my degrees, I am \n     forced to look outside of Ohio for jobs that will allow me to \n     at least use my 1 2 years of secretary experience so that I \n     have the salary to start paying on these loans.\n       My student loans are hindering not only my ability to \n     possibly finish my Master's degree but also to potentially \n     purchase a home and find a position near my family.\n       When I graduate I will not be able to move back home since \n     my parents were the state so I will have to find a position \n     outside what I went to school for and probably for minimum \n     salary or even minimum wage just so\n\n[[Page S3678]]\n\n     I do not end up homeless. I may even have to look overseas to \n     find work.\n       I have hopes that the government will see stories like mine \n     from people who have risen above their circumstances and are \n     able to go to college to make their lives better and not be \n     statistics and actually do something to help us.\n\n  These stories, obviously, speak for themselves. We are certainly \nleaving our children with far too much debt. Ten years ago we had a \nbudget surplus, until this government--the House and Senate and the \nPresident in the last decade--made terrible mistakes and blew a hole in \nthe Federal budget. We do not want to also leave them increased debt \nfrom student loans. My wife was the first person in her family to go to \ncollege, to Kent State University. She graduated with almost no debt, \neven though her family was not really able to help her much, because \nthe State government was more involved, the Federal Government was more \ninvolved, and tuition was lower.\n  It is a moral question to me to make sure we can freeze these \ninterest rates. We have no business saddling a more onerous debt burden \non the young men and women of our country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/04/senate-section/article/S3678-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3678-S3679]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2012\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, it has been more than a month since the \nSenate came together to pass the Violence Against Women Reauthorization \nAct of 2012. This bill, commonly referred to as VAWA, reflects the \ntradition of bringing together people from both political parties to \nwork with professionals in the field and address the needs of victims--\nall victims. More than two-thirds of the Senate, including 15 \nRepublicans, voted for this common sense legislation. It is a rare feat \nin the Senate these days, as the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, \nbut it demonstrates that the Leahy-Crapo reauthorization bill is about \nsaving lives, not partisan politics.\n  Few laws have had a greater impact on the lives of women in this \ncountry than the Violence Against Women Act. Because of this law, the \ndays of dismissing domestic and sexual violence crimes with a joke or a \nshrug are over. The resources, training, and law enforcement tools \nprovided by VAWA over the past 18 years have transformed the criminal \njustice and community-based responses to abuse. It gave support and \nprotection to victims who for generations had been blamed, humiliated, \nand ignored.\n  I had hoped the House Republicans would follow our demonstration of \nbipartisanship by moving forward with the Senate-passed VAWA \nreauthorization bill. Instead, the Republican leadership in the House \nchose to proceed with a bill that doesn't reflect the core values of \nVAWA.\n  I mention its core values because we worked--both parties in this \nbody--to reflect what is most important in VAWA. The House Republican \nbill does not include protections for all victims. It takes away \nexisting protections that have proven effective in preventing domestic \nand sexual violence. In short, the House bill is not VAWA.\n  Regrettably, the House Republican leadership would not even allow a \nvote on the bipartisan Senate-passed bill, which truly does do the job. \nThey would not allow open debate regarding the relative merits of the \ndifferent versions of the bill--ours, which protects all victims, and \ntheirs, which rolls back protections. Had the House had the opportunity \nto vote on the Senate-passed bipartisan bill, I believe the President \nwould have signed it and it would now be law. Nearly two dozen House \nRepublicans, along with most Democratic Members, voted against the \nrestrictive House bill.\n  It is not surprising that the House Republican bill failed to gain \nsupport among those who actually work with victims, the people who see \nthese victims on a daily basis in all parts of the country. When \nchallenged on the House floor to name any law enforcement or victim \nadvocacy organization that supported the House Republican bill, their \nlead sponsor could not name a single one. Why? More than 320 \norganizations that work with the victims of domestic and sexual \nviolence opposed that bill.\n  By contrast more than 1,000 local, State, and national organizations \nsupported the bipartisan Senate bill, including hundreds of law \nenforcement, victim advocates, and faith-based groups. Why? Because in \nour bill, we worked at it. We did it the old-fashioned way--Republicans \nand Democrats working together after months of discussion with \nstakeholders from across the country and all political persuasions from \nthe right to the left. The provisions in our bill that protect battered \nimmigrant women, Native women, and the most vulnerable among us who \nhave had trouble accessing services were recommendations from those \nvery professionals who work with crime victims every day. The \nbipartisan Senate bill is intended to respond to the changing, unmet \nneeds of victims and to prevent future acts of domestic and sexual \nviolence. Instead of picking and choosing, as they tried to, among who \nwould get protection, we came up with a simple fact. We said a victim \nis a victim is a victim. If somebody has been victimized, the police \ndon't go and say: Can we help this battered person, maybe even murdered \nperson? We might be able to get involved in this, provided they are not \nan immigrant or provided they are not a Native American or provided \nonly if they are straight. That is not the way it works.\n  I still have nightmares over some of the crime scenes I visited at 2 \nand 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning when I was a prosecutor and I saw \npeople who had been badly battered, badly injured. I never heard a \npolice officer say: Before we go any further on this, what category \ndoes this battered victim fall into? Because unless they fall into one \nof these specific categories--such as the House bill had--we can't do \nanything for them. No, no police officer ever said that in my presence \nnor in anybody else's presence.\n  It was law enforcement who educated us on the importance of the U \nvisa to keeping our streets safe and encouraged us to support a modest \nimprovement to this program. The enhanced consultation provisions in \nthe bill were included after domestic and sexual assault coalitions and \nother victim advocacy groups told us that they wanted to coordinate \ntheir activities in a more effective way with VAWA state administrators \nand Federal agencies. Victim service providers also told us that the \nLGBT community experiences violence at the same rate as the broader \ncommunity but faces a serious lack of available services. It was the \nNative American community that informed us about the epidemic of \ndomestic violence in tribal communities and the need to increase local \nprosecution of these crimes. It is unacceptable that nearly three out \nof five Native American women have been assaulted by their spouses or \nintimate partners, yet the percentage of these cases that are \nprosecuted is appallingly low. That is why our bill provides law \nenforcement with additional tools to combat domestic and sexual \nviolence in Tribal communities.\n  The Senate has already considered and soundly defeated a conscripted \nversion of the bill, like the House Republicans' version, that would \nnot help all victims. We voted 37 62 against the Hutchison-Grassley \namendment last April. This was not a case where an amendment did not \nobtain a supermajority of more than 60 votes. The votes against it were \nbipartisan and more than 60. I do not understand why the House \nRepublican leadership has gone to tremendous lengths to avoid debating \nand voting on the bipartisan Senate-passed VAWA reauthorization bill.\n  The House Republican leadership has refused to consider two House \nbills that mirror the Leahy-Crapo bill, including one introduced by a \nRepublican. They also raised a procedural technicality as an excuse to \navoid debating the Senate bill, even though the Speaker of the House \nhas the ability to waive that technicality and allow the House to move \nforward to consider the bipartisan Senate bill.\n  The Majority Leader tried to move this forward 2 weeks ago by \nproposing a way to resolve the technical objection by House Republicans \nto considering the bipartisan Senate-passed bill, but the Republican \nleader objected.\n  Frankly, victims should not be forced to wait any longer. They will \nnot benefit from the improvements made by the bipartisan Leahy-Crapo \nbill, unless both Houses of Congress vote to pass this legislation. The \nproblems and barriers facing victims of domestic and\n\n[[Page S3679]]\n\nsexual violence are too serious for Congress to delay. Domestic and \nsexual violence knows no political party. Its victims are Republican \nand Democrat, rich and poor, young and old. Helping these victims, all \nof them, should be our goal.\n  I will continue to work with our leadership in the Senate to come up \nwith a solution that can move us past this impasse and send back to the \nHouse a Violence Against Women Act reauthorization bill that protects \nall victims. We know we can do that because the Senate has already \npassed such a bill. I am still hopeful that the House will do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/04/senate-section/article/S3679-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3679-S3680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO CAROL MARTIN GATTON ACADEMY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, Kentucky received quite an honor \nrecently when the Carol Martin Gatton Academy of Mathematics and \nScience in Kentucky, an elite public high school that draws students \nfrom all over the Commonwealth, was named the No. 1 public high school \nin the United States by Newsweek Magazine. Think about that, Madam \nPresident--out of more than 20,000 public high schools in the Nation, \nthe top-ranked one is in Kentucky.\n  The Gatton Academy is in Bowling Green, KY, specifically, and it is a \nspecial place. First opened in 2007 and funded by the Kentucky General \nAssembly, the Gatton Academy is the Commonwealth's only State-supported \nresidential high school with an emphasis on math and science. Bright, \nhighly motivated students come from across the State and stay on \ncampus, taking college-level courses at Western Kentucky University.\n  Dr. Julia Roberts, a good friend of mine and the executive director \nof the academy, worked hard for many years to see the school become a \nreality. How wonderful for her that her vision has been realized. This \nhonor is a recognition that she truly deserves for her steadfast \ncommitment to help Kentucky's finest students blossom and reach their \nfull potential.\n  Here is a quote from Dr. Roberts that summarizes the school's \nmission:\n\n       The United States has emphasized proficiency or grade-level \n     learning to the exclusion of nurturing the talents of \n     advanced learners. A promising future for our country is \n     closely tied to the development of talent in science, \n     mathematics, languages arts, the social sciences, and the \n     arts. The purpose of the Gatton Academy is to extend learning \n     opportunities for gifted students who live in all parts of \n     Kentucky.\n\n  I also must recognize Dr. Tim Gott, director of the Gatton Academy, \nwithout whose hard work the school surely would not have been able to \nrise to the top. In fact, the Gatton Academy tops Newsweek's list of \npublic high schools this year after ranking fifth in 2011. That is \nquite a jump up in 1 year, thanks in part no doubt to the indefatigable \nwork of Dr. Gott.\n  ``It's just wonderful to be able to celebrate Kentucky students,'' \nDr. Gott says. He also adds, ``This recognition would not have been \npossible without the full partnership we have with Western Kentucky \nUniversity.''\n  The Newsweek rankings that put Gatton Academy on top were based on \nmeasurements such as graduation rates, college enrollment, average ACT \nand SAT scores, and advanced placement tests per student, as well as \nscores. This year, the school's average ACT score was 31.2 out of a \npossible 36, and its average SAT score was 2,010 out of a possible \n2,400. In addition, over half of the school's students studied abroad \nlast year, and 91 percent of recent graduates participated in a \nresearch project sponsored by a university mentor.\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask at this time that my colleagues in \nthe Senate join me in recognizing the Carol Martin Gatton Academy of \nMathematics and Science in Kentucky and its great contribution to the \nsuccess of Kentucky and the Nation. The students at Gatton are the \nfuture leaders and success stories of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Newsweek article naming the Carol \nMartin Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science in Kentucky as the \ntop-ranked public school in the Nation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, May 20, 2012]\n\n  Kentucky Academy Tops the Chart: Newsweek Ranks Kentucky Academy as \n                       America's Top High School\n\n\nWhat does it take to be the best public high school in America? Daniel \n            Stone reports from the top-seeded Gatton Academy\n\n                           (By Daniel Stone)\n\n       To call the Gatton Academy of Mathematics and Science a \n     high school, you'd have to suspend an element of reality. \n     You'll find no football games, pep rallies, or dismissal \n     bells on the Kentucky campus. Instead you'd find couches \n     designed for study halls and white boards scribbled with \n     advanced math. Last week, one student even walked around \n     campus in a T-shirt proclaiming, ``Extreme science: What a \n     rush.''\n       Welcome to Gatton. Or as administrators affectionately call \n     it, the crucible--a place with admittedly high pressure, but \n     where every student succeeds. The school has another title, \n     too: America's best public high school, according to \n     Newsweek's 2012 ranking of the top 1,000. On every metric \n     used--test scores and graduation and college matriculation \n     rates--Gatton sets the nation's curve.\n       The school, about 100 miles south of Louisville in verdant \n     Bowling Green, Kentucky, is a public school with selective \n     admission based only on past academic performance--a key \n     quality that separates Gatton from other public schools, \n     which are mostly mandated to seek economic and racial \n     diversity.\n       Once students are in, they're given broad autonomy to \n     pursue subjects that interest them: They befriend their \n     instructors and conduct scientific research. During semester \n     breaks, the school helps students study abroad. Last winter, \n     the offerings were Western Europe and Costa Rica.\n       It is, you might note, a bit like college.\n       That's precisely the idea. Back in 2007, generous funding \n     from the Kentucky statehouse brought Gatton to life. The \n     facility, a five-story building about the size of one \n     football field, was built for 126 lucky and ambitious minds. \n     Students live on campus in dorms and eat with their friends \n     in dining halls. They see their parents only once a month. \n     Most of their classes are college level, literally, which \n     they take on the adjacent campus of Western Kentucky \n     University. ``We see ourselves as an atypical high school. \n     We're trying to break the mold of what high school could \n     be,'' says Tim Gott, who directs the school's academic \n     programs.\n       Gatton was designed under the Early College Model, a \n     concept devised by researchers at the University of North \n     Texas (UNT) in the 1970s. They wanted to end traditional high \n     school after tenth grade to push students into a college \n     environment sooner. ``The idea was to zip them through the \n     educational process,'' says Richard Sinclair, one of the \n     early researchers of the model. Sinclair now runs the Texas \n     Academy of Math and Science, a school similar to Gatton, \n     albeit twice its size, that's located on the UNT campus. \n     About seven schools exist under the model, most of them in \n     the South. Despite the high cost--Gatton's yearly budget for \n     126 pupils is $2.6 million--state legislatures tend to like \n     the idea because it gets hungry minds out of school faster, \n     turning them into taxpayers and industry leaders.\n       To understand just how different Gatton is, try to name \n     another high school that has a living room. Or students who \n     have pet names for their math classes (multi, diffie). Some \n     high-schoolers pin posters with the latest movie or \n     heartthrob; in one break room at the end of Gatton's dorm \n     hall is a floor-to-ceiling crossword puzzle--the one from \n     SkyMall magazine--that's about half full. When Newsweek \n     visited last week, senior Jordan Currie picked up the clue \n     list. ``370 across is kingdom!'' she shouted. ``Someone fill \n     it in!''\n       Ambition, in other words, is a sort of currency, and the \n     only one that really matters. In the five years since the \n     school opened, some of its students have already completed \n     law school, begun dentistry and pharmacy programs, and \n     started doctoral degrees. (The school's everybody-knows-your-\n     name mentality has already produced seven marriages.)\n       Of seven students who agreed to be interviewed, all said \n     they wouldn't stop studying until they had their Ph.D.s. Some \n     are already on their way. Andrea Eastes, who graduated this \n     year, spent her senior year studying DNA, specifically in \n     pursuit of a cure for tuberculosis. ``Everything you need to \n     take tissue cultures is in here,'' she says matter-of-factly, \n     just a few steps away from a canister of liquid nitrogen.\n       Gatton has its share of the usual adolescent issues, too. \n     Some students stress over their studies, others over friends \n     and romance. The school employs a full-time school \n     psychologist to work through these issues, and occasionally \n     more serious ones too, like broken families or eating \n     disorders. ``Every student comes to me for something,'' says \n     Christopher Bowen, Gatton's Converse-wearing psych counselor. \n     ``It's almost like, if you're not coming to see me, then we \n     think something's wrong.''\n       Gatton has received nods from high places. Kentucky Sen. \n     Mitch McConnell, the Senate's minority leader, stopped by \n     once to marvel; when he got back to Washington, he submitted \n     a statement into the Congressional Record exalting the \n     school.\n       But Gatton's administrators admit it's not a model for \n     every school. You need to have students who really want to \n     excel before you\n\n[[Page S3680]]\n\n     can turn them into Steve Jobses. Unlike Gatton, most schools \n     have stragglers.\n       The key, says Gott, the school's director and a longtime \n     public-school teacher, is to add relevance to education. \n     Maybe every student can't study advanced engineering, but \n     there's something--from music to metalworking--that interests \n     every young person and answers the ``when will I ever use \n     this?'' question.\n       What's more, infusing more glory into education couldn't \n     hurt. ``Everywhere in this country we celebrate basketball \n     and football talent,'' says Julia Roberts, the school's \n     executive director, who petitioned the Kentucky statehouse \n     for 10 years to invest in Gatton. ``The talent we really need \n     to celebrate is math and science.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/04/senate-section/article/S3680-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE TEMPORARY BANKRUPTCY JUDGESHIPS EXTENSION ACT OF 2012\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, we have averted a crisis in the \nbankruptcy court system. It may have been a quiet crisis--one few \nAmericans talked about--but it was real nonetheless. Although it is all \ntoo rare in Washington these days, on this issue, we found a way to \nwork together and deliver a solution. I am proud to say that on May 25, \nPresident Obama signed into law legislation I authored to extend 29 \nexpiring temporary bankruptcy judgeships in 19 judicial districts.\n  With this new law, some of our Nation's busiest bankruptcy courts--\nthose in Nevada and Delaware and New York and Michigan and Florida and \nso many other States--will finally be able to replace a sitting \nbankruptcy judge if he or she resigns or dies in office.\n  Especially in times of economic recovery and uncertain growth, our \nbankruptcy courts perform a vital restorative role for our Nation's \neconomy. Bankruptcy courts can give individuals, many of whom are \nvictims of our great recession, a clean slate to start fresh. They give \ncorporations that can't pay their bills an opportunity to restructure \ntheir debts and continue in operation, rather than shuttering their \noffices and factories, multiplying the pain by putting Americans out of \nwork.\n  Bankruptcy offers relief for creditors as well by providing an \norderly distribution of the debtor's estate. Without bankruptcy, the \ndebts of past mistakes, miscalculations, and misfortune will remain on \nthe balance sheets, unpaid and yet unpayable.\n  Over the past 20 years, Congress has created dozens of temporary \nbankruptcy judgeships to meet the needs of our growing population and \noccasional economic downturns. Perhaps these judgeships were created on \na temporary, rather than permanent, basis out of some sense of enduring \noptimism--optimism that we one day will have a significantly smaller \nneed for our bankruptcy courts that we had when they were created. In \nfact, the caseloads in several of the districts authorized in the past \nhave declined and those judgeships have been allowed to expire. This \nnew law, however, is about districts where the caseloads remain high \nand which cannot afford to lose even a single authorized judgeship.\n  According to the judges I hear from, as well as from the nonpartisan \nJudicial Conference of the United States, which is headed by Chief \nJustice Roberts, these judgeships simply must be reauthorized--and now \nthat the Temporary Bankruptcy Judgeships Extension Act is law, they \nhave been.\n  This legislation passed the House and Senate unanimously because it \nis good policy. It is pro-growth, pro-opportunity, and pro-justice. The \nCBO has scored it to be paid for and it is so bipartisan that it is \nnonpartisan.\n  I am grateful for the willingness of my colleagues to compromise and \nhelp find a mutually acceptable solution to head off a looming crisis \nin our bankruptcy courts. The amendment that permitted passage of this \nlegislation is a one-time accommodation that provides additional fee \nrevenue to the Judiciary so that this bill will not lead to increased \ndemands on appropriators. It also reaffirms that Congress, in \nlegislating on these temporary judgeships in the future, ought to do so \nonly after carefully examining their continued need and our ability to \npay for them.\n  I know my colleagues on both sides of the aisle did not get \neverything that they wanted in this legislation, but my confidence in \nthis institution has been buoyed by the ability of both sides to \nrecognize the greater good at stake and find their way to this deal.\n  I want to thank Leader Reid, Senator Durbin, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Coburn, the group of 12 bipartisan cosponsors, and all those \nwho have worked constructively to help enact this very simple and very \nimportant law.\n  In particular, I thank President Obama, for with his signature, we \nhave taken an important step toward delivering to the American people \nthe fair, speedy, and accessible bankruptcy court system they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/04/senate-section/article/S3680-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3680-S3681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COMMANDER WESLEY A. BROWN\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I wish to commemorate the life of \nretired Navy LCDR Wesley Anthony Brown, who passed away on May 22, \n2012, at the age of 85. Lieutenant Commander Brown was the sixth \nAfrican American to attend and first to graduate from the U.S. Naval \nAcademy in 1949, where he excelled as a notable student and athlete. \nLieutenant Commander Brown went on to have a distinguished career in \nthe Navy Civil Engineer Corps and retired in 1969 after serving 20 \nyears. Lieutenant Commander Brown is survived by his wife, Crystal \nBrown; two daughters, Wiletta Scott and Carol Jackson; two sons, Wesley \nJr., and Gary; and seven grandchildren. I would like to take a moment \nto remember his life and what his accomplishments meant not just for \nthe African American midshipmen who followed him at the Naval Academy, \nbut also for our military and for our Nation.\n  Lieutenant Commander Brown was born on April 3, 1927 in Baltimore, \nMD. He was the only child of William and Rosetta Brown. He grew up in \nWashington, D.C., and graduated from Dunbar High School, where he \nshowed strong proficiency for math and a profound interest in the Navy. \nIn fact, he worked on afternoons and evenings as a junior clerk for the \nNavy and during his senior year in high school he served as the Cadet \nCorps Battalion Commander. He later wrote an article in the Saturday \nEvening Post: ``I've been thinking about the Navy since I was about 8 \nor 10 since the time I pinned the photograph of the old USS Lexington \non my bedroom wall. I arranged my high school studies to get as much \nmath and science as possible.'' This dedication and love of the Navy \nlasted throughout Lieutenant Commander Brown's life.\n  Lieutenant Commander Brown was the first in his family to attend \ncollege. He first enrolled at Howard University before being nominated \nby Harlem Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. to attend the U.S. Naval \nAcademy (USNA) in 1945. Five young African American men had entered \nUSNA before Lieutenant Commander Brown, but they all left within a year \nbecause they could not endure the brutal hazing from hostile \nclassmates. Lieutenant Commander Brown recalled that his first year at \nthe Academy was ``tough,'' being subject to the constant torrent of \nracial epithets, taunts, and excessive demerits from upperclassman who \nwanted to see him fail the Naval Academy. Other midshipmen refused to \nsit next to him, room with him, or even allow him to join the choir. He \nonce told an interviewer that he thought about quitting every day. Yet, \nhe endured.\n  Lieutenant Commander Brown did have a few supporters at the Naval \nAcademy. There were a handful of fellow midshipmen who were friendly to \nhim in spite of threats from other classmates. One of them who visited \nhis dorm room to chat and encourage him to ``hang in there'' was future \npresident Jimmy Carter, an upperclassman and teammate on the Academy's \ncross-country team at the time. In a speech President Carter gave at \nthe Naval Academy last year, he mentioned Lieutenant Commander Brown. \nPresident Carter remarked that Midshipman Brown had a significant \nimpact on his views on the issue of race in America. He called his \nencounter with Wesley Brown at USNA ``my first personal experience with \ntotal integration'' and said, ``A few members of my senior class \nattempted to find ways to give him demerits so that he would be \ndischarged, but Brown's good performance prevailed.''\n  Although African Americans had served and fought in our wars since \nthe American Revolution, the Armed\n\n[[Page S3681]]\n\nForces remained segregated by units until President Truman integrated \nthe military services by executive order in 1948. There was intense \nresistance against any attempts to integrate the military academies and \nonly a half dozen or so African Americans had graduated from West Point \nby the time Lieutenant Commander Brown was commissioned as the first \nAfrican American graduate of the Naval Academy.\n  After Lieutenant Commander Brown graduated from the Naval Academy in \n1949, he was commissioned into the Navy Civil Engineer Corps. Prior to \nthat, he served honorably in World War II and after he graduated, he \nserved in Korea and Vietnam. As a Navy civil engineer, he also built \nhouses in Hawaii, roads in Liberia, waterfront facilities in the \nPhilippines, and a seawater conversion plan in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba \nbefore retiring from the Navy in 1969. Lieutenant Commander Brown \ncontinued his professional life working for the New York State \nUniversity Construction Fund, the Dormitory Authority of the State of \nNew York, and Howard University before retiring in 1998. He also served \nas chairman of District of Columbia Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton's \nService Academy Selection Board.\n  In spite of the challenges Lieutenant Commander Brown faced at the \nNaval Academy, he maintained a close connection to the school \nthroughout his life and served as a member of the Naval Academy Alumni \nAssociation Board of Trustees. And in 2008, USNA honored Lieutenant \nCommander Brown by dedicating a new athletic facility in his name, a \ndecision I supported while I served in the House of Representatives and \nsince I have become a United States Senator. The Wesley A. Brown Field \nHouse was the first and only building dedicated to a living alumnus \nand, in his honor, the building hosts an annual track and field \ninvitational. During the dedication of the building on the banks of the \nSevern River, ADM Michael Mullen, then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, stated, ``He fought a war his whole life for all of us to \nimprove who we are as individuals, who we are both as a Navy and a \nnation. It was his noble calling and it was his call to service and \ncitizenship that led to lasting change in our Navy and in our nation.'' \nIn another tribute to this pioneer, a consortium of minority Naval \nAcademy alumni established the Lieutenant Commander Wesley A. Brown '49 \nHonor Scholar scholarship in 2007 which awards up to $5,000 annually to \nfour individuals who are accepted into any 4-year university in \nMaryland.\n  Although we have come a long way since Lieutenant Commander Brown's \ndays as a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy, our Armed Forces and \nNation are still challenged with discrimination based on race, gender, \nreligion, and the other attributes of heterogeneity that make up this \ngreat country. While minority and female students may walk freely \nthrough our military academies without the audible taunts and slurs, we \nknow that some of them face hazing and harassment behind closed doors \nbecause of who they are. While I know that Department of Defense \nleaders have a zero-tolerance policy regarding discrimination and \nharassment in their Service Academies, commands and units, that is not \nenough. I call on them to go a step further and redouble their efforts \nto communicate to those who currently serve and those who will serve \nour Nation in the future what makes our military the greatest force in \nhistory: the fact that our Armed Forces reflect the rich diversity of \nAmerica. We owe it to Lieutenant Commander Brown and others like him \nwho bravely endured racism and discrimination to pave the way so that \nothers could serve honorably, too, and accomplish exceptional \nachievements on behalf of our country. Therefore, let Lieutenant \nCommander Brown's life be a testament to how his strength, courage, and \nhumility through adversity not only transformed the people around him \nbut profoundly affected the Naval Academy and our Nation. Today, \nminorities comprise more than 20 percent of the brigade of midshipmen \nand many of these young men and women have stated that Lieutenant \nCommander Brown was their inspiration. All Americans are fortunate to \nhave had Lieutenant Commander Wesley Anthony Brown's selfless service \nand example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/04/senate-section/article/S3681-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COMMANDER MICHAEL GEORGE DULONG\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Madam President, today I wish to \ncongratulate LCDR Michael George Dulong of Brockton, MA on his \nretirement from the U.S. Navy. Lieutenant Commander Dulong dedicated \nmore than 24 years of his life to serving our Nation as a Navy SEAL. I \nam privileged to recognize Michael's accomplishments today, and \nMassachusetts is fortunate to have a man like Michael who has served in \nour Navy and defended our Nation.\n  The grandson of a World War II Normandy beacher and the son of a \ndecorated Vietnam-era 101st Airborne Division veteran, at an early age \nMichael chose to serve our Nation. He enlisted in the Navy at the age \nof 16 through the Delayed Entry Program and completed the Navy's basic \nschool of electronics and electricity, followed by the basic underwater \ndemolitions/SEAL training in Coronado, CA. He would go on to spend 8 \nyears in the enlisted ranks serving in three platoons within SEAL Team \n8 at Naval Base Little Creek in Norfolk, VA.\n  As a team member on SEAL Team 8, Michael deployed in support of \nOperation Desert Shield and Desert Storm, as well as numerous other \nspecial operations deployments throughout the Mediterranean and Persian \nGulf. Needless to say, as part of our Nation's premier special \noperations forces, Michael was integral to his Team's success and \nperformed exceptionally in some of the most challenging and austere \nconditions around the world.\n  Michael would go on to earn his bachelor's degree while \nsimultaneously serving on SEAL Team 4 in the Navy Reserve, followed by \nsuccessful completion of Officer Candidate School in Pensacola, FL. \nAfter completing his training, Michael was commissioned as an ensign on \nactive duty and was assigned to SEAL Team 1. There Michael would deploy \nas the assistant platoon commander for two SEAL platoons in support of \nOperations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. Michael always led from \nthe front and inspired SEALs under his command throughout his career \nand did so again in combat following September 11.\n  Throughout numerous deployments around the world in support of the \nglobal war on terrorism, Michael received countless awards and \npromotions in the Navy. He would go on to serve in various assignments \nin the U.S. Southern Command area of responsibility with the Naval \nSpecial Warfare Unit 4 in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, \nColombia, combating narco-terrorism, the U.S. Embassy in Guyana as the \nJoint Special Operations Commander, as well as platoon commander of \nSEAL Team 4. His final assignment brought Michael and his family to our \nNation's Capital, at the Washington Navy Yard, where he served as the \nprogram manager for the SEAL Delivery Vehicle acquisition program.\n  Michael has dedicated his life to serving our country, and we owe him \na debt of gratitude for his service. Even in retirement, I am confident \nthat Michael will continue to serve his Nation. On behalf of all \nMassachusetts residents and all Americans, I am proud to thank Michael, \nhis wife Michaelle, son Gabriel, and daughter Eva for their service to \nthe Nation and the Navy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/04/senate-section/article/S3681-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3681-S3682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING THE MACOMB ACADEMY OF ARTS & SCIENCES\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, a few weeks ago I met a remarkable group \nof young people. They call themselves the Fighting Pi, and they are the \nFIRST Robotics Competition team from the Macomb Academy of Arts & \nSciences in Armada, MI.\n  FIRST is an annual, international robotics competition for high \nschool students. Teams have 6 weeks to design, build, and test robots \nto compete in a game, which changes every year. For this year, teams \ncompeted in the ``Rebound Rumble,'' which required them to design \nrobots capable of shooting small basketballs into baskets as high as 8 \nfeet off the ground.\n  This competition demands many things of its teams. They must \ndemonstrate the ability to plan and work\n\n[[Page S3682]]\n\ntogether, to follow a budget, and to meet demanding timelines. They \nmust master complex technical fields such as computer-assisted \ndrafting, electrical engineering, radio control systems, pneumatic \nsystems, and sensors and signals. So the intellectual demands are \ngreat.\n  But just as great is the demand for vision for the foresight to look \nat a stack of diagrams and a pile of electronic parts and see what it \ncan all become.\n  Thirty-six teams from Michigan traveled in April to St. Louis for the \nnational championship, the Fighting Pi among them. Representing \nMichigan were three teams from Bloomfield Hills, two from Detroit, two \nfrom Ann Arbor, two from Grandville, two from Pontiac, and teams from \nAllen Park, Auburn Hills, Berkley, Birmingham, Clarkston, Fremont, \nHolland, Hopkins, Lansing, Milford, Niles, North Oakland County, \nNorthville, Novi, Okemos, Ortonville, Richmond, Rochester Hills, \nSterling Heights, Temperance, Waterford, and Zeeland. All of them have \nreason to be proud of their accomplishments.\n  But I want to especially thank the Fighting Pi, whose members and \nadult leaders were kind enough to spend an hour with me a few days ago. \nAt the Michigan State Championships, the Fighting Pi had won the \nprestigious State Engineering Inspiration Award. I was deeply impressed \nby the vision, enthusiasm, and brainpower of the Fighting Pi during my \nvisit. They demonstrated to me their robot design, and they let me \ndrive a robot around a little. They helped me understand the technical \naspects of their work and the intense planning and preparation and \nstaying power required.\n  In addition to their robotics responsibilities, team members \nparticipate in public service. Team members volunteer regularly at \nRonald McDonald House, where they help the families of ill or injured \nchildren. They participate in local adopt-a-road and adopt-a-trail \ncleanup programs. And they have raised money for St. Jude's Children's \nResearch Hospital and Toys for Tots among other worthy charities. They \nare, in their schoolwork, their robotics work, and their volunteer \nwork, exceptional young people.\n  Americans spend a lot of time worrying about the next generation.

Madam President, a few weeks ago I met a remarkable group \nof young people. They call themselves the Fighting Pi, and they are the \nFIRST Robotics Competition team from the Macomb Academy of Arts & \nSciences in Armada, MI.\n  FIRST is an annual, international robotics competition for high \nschool students. Teams have 6 weeks to design, build, and test robots \nto compete in a game, which changes every year. For this year, teams \ncompeted in the ``Rebound Rumble,'' which required them to design \nrobots capable of shooting small basketballs into baskets as high as 8 \nfeet off the ground.\n  This competition demands many things of its teams. They must \ndemonstrate the ability to plan and work\n\n[[Page S3682]]\n\ntogether, to follow a budget, and to meet demanding timelines. They \nmust master complex technical fields such as computer-assisted \ndrafting, electrical engineering, radio control systems, pneumatic \nsystems, and sensors and signals. So the intellectual demands are \ngreat.\n  But just as great is the demand for vision for the foresight to look \nat a stack of diagrams and a pile of electronic parts and see what it \ncan all become.\n  Thirty-six teams from Michigan traveled in April to St. Louis for the \nnational championship, the Fighting Pi among them. Representing \nMichigan were three teams from Bloomfield Hills, two from Detroit, two \nfrom Ann Arbor, two from Grandville, two from Pontiac, and teams from \nAllen Park, Auburn Hills, Berkley, Birmingham, Clarkston, Fremont, \nHolland, Hopkins, Lansing, Milford, Niles, North Oakland County, \nNorthville, Novi, Okemos, Ortonville, Richmond, Rochester Hills, \nSterling Heights, Temperance, Waterford, and Zeeland. All of them have \nreason to be proud of their accomplishments.\n  But I want to especially thank the Fighting Pi, whose members and \nadult leaders were kind enough to spend an hour with me a few days ago. \nAt the Michigan State Championships, the Fighting Pi had won the \nprestigious State Engineering Inspiration Award. I was deeply impressed \nby the vision, enthusiasm, and brainpower of the Fighting Pi during my \nvisit. They demonstrated to me their robot design, and they let me \ndrive a robot around a little. They helped me understand the technical \naspects of their work and the intense planning and preparation and \nstaying power required.\n  In addition to their robotics responsibilities, team members \nparticipate in public service. Team members volunteer regularly at \nRonald McDonald House, where they help the families of ill or injured \nchildren. They participate in local adopt-a-road and adopt-a-trail \ncleanup programs. And they have raised money for St. Jude's Children's \nResearch Hospital and Toys for Tots among other worthy charities. They \nare, in their schoolwork, their robotics work, and their volunteer \nwork, exceptional young people.\n  Americans spend a lot of time worrying about the next generation. We \nworry over our dinner tables, in our conversations at work, and in this \nvery Chamber. There are plenty of reasons to worry. But we should not \nlose sight of the reasons for optimism. Every day, all over this great \ncountry, young people are accomplishing extraordinary things. They are \nstudying hard, learning new skills, and even building sophisticated \nrobots. They are preparing to write the next chapter in the American \nstory, and I have no doubt it will be as stirring as the story so far.\n  So let me extend my congratulations and my gratitude to the students \nof the Fighting Pi, and the students who helped them on their way: team \nmembers Michael Graham, Melissa Mikolowski, Nicholas Fitzsimons, Eric \nBytner, Trevor Goolsby, Alysa Brice, Zeke Fetty, Michael Scaglione, \nSteven Scaglione, Stephen Kline, Kurt Wieber, Andrew Graham, Amanda \nFulghum, Michael Patrick, Laurel Payne, Collin Tobey, Riley Yaxley, \nEric Tobey, Jack Sabelhaus, Andrew Binkowski, Lauren Grobbel, Alex \nKesek, Sabrina Tibaudo, Ron Kyllonen, Vince Ragap, Rachel Kosek and \nKrystal Diel; and adults Craig Roys, Tom Line, Richard Wahl, Craig \nTobey, Shawn Graham, Judy Tobey, Michael Mroz, Andrea Mroz, Paul \nGianferrara, John Antilla, Jacob Caporuscio, and Eric Kosek.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/04/senate-section/article/S3682-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REMEMBERING DR. FRED MARGOLIN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring the memory of Dr. Frederick Margolin, my former neighbor \nin Greenbrae, CA. After a 3-year battle with ALS, Fred passed away \npeacefully on May 10, 2012, surrounded by his beloved family.\n  Fred Margolin was born in New York in 1936 and raised in Florida. \nAfter graduating from the University of Miami Medical School in 1960, \nhe interned at Los Angeles County Hospital and served for 2 years as an \nAir Force medical officer in Germany, before returning to California, \nwhere he lived for the rest of his life.\n  Following his residency at the University of California, San \nFrancisco, Dr. Margolin practiced radiology at California Pacific \nMedical Center from 1968 to 2007 and served as chairman of the \nDepartment of Radiology from 1978 to 1992. He was the founder of the \nBreast Health Center and served as its medical director from 1984 to \n2007. Widely recognized as a national leader in radiology and breast \ncancer screening, he was honored as a fellow of the American College of \nRadiology and the Society of Breast Imagining. In 2001, he was selected \nas one of America's Best Doctors for Breast Care.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Dr. Margolin worked not only to \nprovide the best possible care to his patients but to extend access to \ncare to poor women and underserved populations.\n  Fred was a devoted family man who adored Myrna, his wife of 54 years. \nTogether they traveled the world, often on cruises with close friends, \nand each year they took their children and grandchildren to Mexico for \na family vacation.\n  Dr. Fred Margolin will be deeply missed by his patients, colleagues, \nfamily, and friends. On behalf of the people of California and the \npatients and communities he served so well, I send my gratitude and \ncondolences to Fred's wife Myrna; their children, Jody Margolin Hahn, \nElizabeth Brett Garon, and Lawrence Harry Margolin; and their seven \ngrandsons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/04/senate-section/article/S3682-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DANNY BARE\n\n Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, today I wish to honor Danny Bare \nof Batavia, OH. Mr. Bare is retiring from his position as Executive \nDirector of the Clermont County Veterans' Service Commission on May 31, \n2012.\n  Mr. Bare began his career in the military in 1967 as a member of the \nU.S. Army. He served one year in Vietnam and was injured twice in one \nday. For his bravery, he received a Purple Heart, a Bronze Star, and \nthe Army Commendation Medal of Valor.\n  After his service in the military, Mr. Bare went on to have a 30 year \ncareer at First National Bank of Cincinnati, married his wonderful \nwife, Connie, and raised his family in Batavia. He served on the \nBatavia School Board for four years, including two years serving as \npresident. He also served his community as a Batavia Township Trustee \nand Clermont County Board of Elections director.\n  Mr. Bare became executive director of the Veterans' Service \nCommission in 2007. He is credited with implementing outreach programs \nto educate veterans on the many benefits for which they are eligible. \nMr. Bare helps to ensure that veterans are able to obtain employment, \nmedical services, and any other services they may need. His dedication \nto his country and his community are admirable.\n  Mr. President, I would like to recognize Mr. Danny Bare on his \nretirement from a lifetime of public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/04/senate-section/article/S3682-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3682-S3683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. ED COULTER\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, Dr. Ed Coulter was once told by a \ncolleague in the education field that most individuals spend their \nlives helping, tweaking, making something better, but seldom having the \nchance to create. Ed grasped on to that last word and has spent the \nlast 17 years of his professional career doing just that: creating \nsomething remarkable for the community and town of Mountain Home. On \nJune 30, 2012, Ed Coulter will serve his last day as chancellor of \nArkansas State University Mountain Home, ASUMH, and today I wish to \nthank him for his dedication to public education in Arkansas and his \ncommitment to the people of Mountain Home.\n  Ed's love of learning and teaching goes back to an early age. At age \n10, his parents, Bill and Evelyn Coulter, purchased a resort on Lake \nHamilton in Hot Springs, AR. Ed found an early thrill in teaching by \nhelping countless resort guests learn how to ski and enjoy the water. \nThis love of teaching and his parents' encouragement to acquire a \nquality education led Ed to enroll at Ouachita Baptist University, OBU, \nin Arkadelphia. It was here that Ed met his first wife, the late Fran\n\n[[Page S3683]]\n\nDryer of Mountain Home. Ed would graduate magna cum laude with a \nbachelor of science in education, and the very next year he would also \ngraduate from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville with his \nmaster's in education.\n  Needing 3 years of professional experience before continuing his \neducation, Ed served as a junior high principal in Mountain Home before \nultimately obtaining his doctorate degree. With the degree in hand, Ed \nand Fran returned to Arkadelphia and OBU, a place they would call home \nfor the next 25-five years. In this span, Ed served as assistant to the \npresident and also as the vice president for administration. The latter \nposition taught Ed a great deal about budgeting, fundraising, and \nbuilding new buildings. These skills would come in handy when Ed was \ncalled back to Mountain Home in 1995 as chancellor of ASUMH.\n  Mountain Home long had dreamed of providing a high-quality education \nto its community and north central Arkansas. Truly a community effort, \na group of dedicated citizens raised enough funds in the 1970s to \npurchase a church building to serve as the school. Ed's job as \nchancellor would be to take the school from this church building where \nhe and Fran were married, and transform it into a modern university. \nWith 78 acres of land purchased in a nearby field, Ed set a vision for \nthe new campus and started the task of making that vision become a \nreality.\n  Seventeen years later, ASUMH has expanded from a small community \ncollege to a thriving institution that today serves over 1,500 people. \nEd's tenure as chancellor will be remembered for the rapid expansion of \nthe campus; however, Ed's impact extends far beyond the physical \nbuildings. Due to his leadership at ASUMH, thousands of students and \nMountain Home have been forever changed by having a first-class \nuniversity in the local community.\n  As Dr. Ed Coulter starts the next chapter of his life, I know \nArkansas State University Mountain Home and the Arkansas education \ncommunity will miss his leadership and guidance. I thank him for his \nmany decades of service to the people of Arkansas, and I wish him all \nthe happiness as he and his wife Lucretia travel and enjoy time with \ntheir 13 grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/04/senate-section/article/S3683-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COUNCIL FOR A LIVABLE WORLD\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, on June 6 the Council for a \nLivable World will celebrate its 50th anniversary. In a time when our \ncountry continues to face a host of global threats, it is important \nthat we recognize the vital work that the Council for a Livable World \ncarries out each and every day to mitigate these threats, and to make \nour world a more peaceful, a more livable place.\n  The Council for a Livable World was founded in 1962 by nuclear \nphysicist Leo Szilard and other scientists. Szilard, of course, is \nfamous for advocating for the creation of the Manhattan Project that \nhelped create the first atomic weapon. In the aftermath of WWII, he, \nand others that saw the destructive power of atomic weapons became \nconcerned about their use and spread.\n  Although times have changed since then--Russia has replaced the \nSoviet Union, the Cold War is over--the threat of nuclear catastrophe \nis still ever-present. Terrorists seek these weapons of mass \ndestruction, and nefarious regimes such as North Korea continue to \nthreaten the world with their own nuclear weapons. The Council \nrecognizes this continuously changing threat environment and believes \nthat it is short-sighted and counterproductive to continue relying on \nCold War measures, such as an overwhelming nuclear arsenal that could \ndestroy the world many times over.\n  As former Council Chairman Senator Gary Hart said, ``you must \nproperly understand what security is and how it is to be achieved, or \nall the military spending in the world will not make you more secure.'' \nThose words rang true then, and they continue to ring true now.\n  The Council for a Livable World believes, like I do, that the United \nStates must work toward a ``world free of nuclear weapons.'' They \nexpressly advocate for deep reductions, and the eventual elimination, \nof nuclear weapons.\n  This advocacy leads to real, tangible results, and not just results \nin the nuclear weapon reductions arena. Some notable accomplishments \ninclude the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and \nIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, Conventional Forces in Europe, and \nthe first Strategic Arms Reduction treaty; establishing a U.S. nuclear \ntesting moratorium in 1992; limiting the deployment of the MX missile; \neliminating funding for the nuclear ``Bunker Buster,'' and ratification \nof the New START Treaty in 2011.\n  So I hope everyone will join me today in recognizing the Council for \na Livable World and the important work that they do to make our world a \nbetter place. Congratulations on the past 50 years and good luck in the \n50 years that lay ahead. Maybe by then our children will be living, \nfinally, in a world free of nuclear weapons.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/04/senate-section/article/S3683-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 5, 2011, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on May 29, 2012, during the adjournment of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Harris) had signed the \nfollowing enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 2415.

A joint Memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Idaho urging the President and Congress to award the \n     Medal of honor to an Idaho native and Army veteran; to the \n     Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial No. 7\n\n       We, your Memorialists, the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate of the State of Idaho assembled in the Second Regular \n     Session of the Sixty-first Idaho Legislature, do hereby \n     respectfully represent that:\n       Whereas, on May 15, 2005, Idaho native Army Sergeant Chris \n     Tschida and the three crew members of his tank were \n     patrolling route ``Michigan'' between Ramadi and Fallujah in \n     the Al Anbar Province of Iraq while conducting operations \n     under Operation Iraqi Freedom; and\n       Whereas, Sgt. Tschida, along with his loader, were standing \n     watch in the gun turret, watching for enemy activity while \n     the tank driver and a Lieutenant were inside the tank \n     preparing for a mission later that night. The loader shifted \n     his body and accidentally knocked his water bottle down \n     inside the tank and while lowering himself inside the tank to \n     pick up the water, an insurgent used the opportunity to \n     attack by throwing two enemy grenades inside the tank; and\n       Whereas, Sgt. Tschida could hear the grenades fall in the \n     tank and instantly found one, yelling ``grenade!'' to his \n     crew members while retrieving one grenade to put into the \n     tank's breach to absorb the blast. In this process, the \n     grenade exploded and amputated Sgt. Tschida's left hand. \n     Moments later the second grenade exploded inside the tank, \n     severely wounding Sgt. Tschida and two of the other crew \n     members; and\n       Whereas, still conscious, Sgt. Tschida began assessing the \n     damage inside the tank, but was unable to see because of the \n     smoke and fire caused by the grenade. Sgt. Tschida attempted \n     to key the microphone on his radio to call for support and \n     report the enemy attack when he noticed his left hand was \n     missing. Sgt. Tschida wrapped the stump of his hand into his \n     shirt and began checking the status of his tank and fellow \n     soldiers. At first glance Sgt. Tschida saw his Lieutenant \n     slumped over and unconscious with his head resting on the .50 \n     caliber sight. The Lieutenant was bleeding heavily from his \n     eye socket and appeared to be dead; and\n       Whereas, Sgt. Tschida then noticed his loader, hanging \n     half-way out of the tank's turret, missing both legs from the \n     knees down. Sgt. Tschida shook his Lieutenant to see if he \n     was alive, at which time the Lieutenant let out a gasp of air \n     that confirmed he was not dead; and\n       Whereas, an evaluation of the tank also confirmed the \n     ammunition bay had been busted open from the grenade blast \n     and the tank ammunition was at risk of catching fire and \n     exploding. Knowing he and his fellow soldiers were not safe \n     inside the tank, Sgt. Tschida pulled himself out of the hatch \n     and then began pulling his loader out of the tank. Once his \n     loader was safely out of the tank, Sgt. Tschida began pulling \n     his Lieutenant out of the commander's hatch of the tank. Once \n     both soldiers were safely out of the tank, Sgt. Tschida began \n     administering first aid by tying a tourniquet on both of the \n     loader' s legs and by stuffing a field bandage inside of the \n     eye socket of the Lieutenant to stop the bleeding from his \n     head; and\n       Whereas, while caring for both soldiers, Sgt. Tschida did a \n     security check of his area. At this time an enemy insurgent, \n     believed to be the one who attacked Sgt. Tschida' s tank, \n     engaged Sgt. Tschida while he was administering first aid to \n     his fellow soldiers. Sgt. Tschida was able to repel the enemy \n     assault with his M9 service pistol, killing the hostile \n     force; and\n       Whereas, knowing they were in imminent danger, Sgt. Tschida \n     attempted to get the driver of the tank to respond to his \n     commands, but the soldier was in shock and unresponsive. \n     After beating on the hatch and pleading with the driver to \n     respond, the driver opened the driver 's hatch and began \n     receiving commands from Sgt. Tschida. At this time, Sgt. \n     Tschida commanded the driver to return them and the tank with \n     its munitions back to the nearest security gate to get help. \n     Sgt. Tschida then shielded both soldiers with his body on the \n     surface of the tank until they arrived at a safe location; \n     and\n       Whereas, all four crew members, including Sgt. Tschida, \n     survived the injuries they sustained on May 15, 2005, and the \n     tank was returned and repaired for future use. To this day, \n     Sgt. Chris Tschida has not received recognition or accolades \n     for his heroism and steadfast leadership on May 15, 2005. \n     Now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S3685]]\n\n       Resolved, by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Sixty-first Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that we \n     urge President Barack Obama, in the name of Congress, to \n     award Retired Sergeant Chris Tschida the Medal of Honor for \n     distinguishing himself through conspicuous gallantry and \n     intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call \n     of duty, or the highest appropriate recognition; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to President Barack Obama, \n     the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives of Congress, and the congressional delegation \n     representing the State of Idaho in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM 91. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to support the 259th Air Traffic Control Squadron \n     Louisiana National Guard and urging the Louisiana \n     congressional delegation to take action to reverse the \n     planned disbanding of the squadron; to the Committee on Armed \n     Services.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 55\n\n       To memorialize the Congress of the United States to support \n     the 259th Air Traffic Control Squadron Louisiana National \n     Guard and urge the Louisiana congressional delegation to take \n     action to reverse the planned disbanding of the squadron.\n       Whereas, the 259th Air Traffic Control Squadron is uniquely \n     staffed to support large scale military training operations \n     that are launched from Alexandria International Airport to \n     Fort Polk which are essential to the world class military \n     training at Fort Polk; and\n       Whereas, three of the last four presidents have used the \n     services and assets of the ATC squadron to safely access Fort \n     Polk and Central Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, the 259th Air Traffic Control Squadron has also \n     safely controlled the air access of numerous United States \n     flag officers, foreign dignitaries, foreign military \n     officers, governors and members of congressional delegations \n     during important visits in support of Fort Polk operations; \n     and\n       Whereas, this exceptional unit has consistently achieved \n     rating of excellent in their performance evaluation and \n     currently leads the nation in keeping its staff strength at \n     or near one hundred percent; and\n       Whereas, the 259th Air Traffic Control Squadron has played \n     a key role in disaster relief efforts such as Hurricane \n     Katrina, when it worked to control the airspace over New \n     Orleans in the aftermath of the country's biggest natural \n     disaster; and\n       Whereas, this unit has been called on and has responded in \n     an exemplary manner to requests from other states when they \n     were struck by disasters; and\n       Whereas, little or no input was considered from the Air \n     National Guard Headquarters, the Adjutant General of the \n     Louisiana National Guard, the Louisiana Air National Guard \n     Commander, the Louisiana congressional delegation, the \n     governor, the United States Army or England Airpark before \n     the Department of Defense proposed to disband the unit in \n     order to achieve budget cuts; and\n       Whereas, the 259th is composed of 110 proud, patriotic \n     Louisiana citizens bravely serving their country during \n     perilous times who are now being told their mission is over \n     and their service is no longer needed; and\n       Whereas, disbanding of the 259th ATC will weaken Fort Polk, \n     Alexandria International Airport, England Airpark and the \n     state of Louisiana: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana hereby \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to use all of \n     its powers of oversight to reverse this catastrophic decision \n     by the Department of Defense to disband a vital, smooth \n     operating, and badly needed unit such as the 259th Air \n     Traffic Control Squadron in order to cut military spending, \n     especially in these times of war, world conflict, and danger \n     from dictators and terrorists; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana requests the \n     governor and the appropriate agencies to take such action as \n     they deem necessary to support the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation in its effort to save the 259th Air Traffic \n     Control Squadron; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives, to \n     each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States \n     Congress and to the governor of the state of Louisiana.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM 92. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing the United States \n     Congress to take such actions as necessary to encourage the \n     National Marine Fisheries Service, the Gulf of Mexico Marine \n     Fisheries Council, and the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries \n     Management Council to adopt a weekend-only fishery management \n     regime for red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico for 2012; to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 10\n\n       To memorialize the United States Congress to take such \n     actions as are necessary to encourage the National Marine \n     Fisheries Service, the Gulf of Mexico Marine Fisheries \n     Council, and the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Management Council \n     to adopt a weekend-only fishery management regime for red \n     snapper in the Gulf of Mexico for 2012.\n       Whereas, it is the responsibility of the National Marine \n     Fisheries Service, an agency in the National Oceanographic \n     and Atmospheric Administration, through the Gulf of Mexico \n     Marine Fisheries Council and the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries \n     Management Council, to manage and regulate marine species \n     located in the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, this management and regulation includes a \n     determination of the sustainability of each species and \n     preservation of the sustainability through the setting of \n     take limits, individual fishing quotas, and opening and \n     closing seasons; and\n       Whereas, red snapper is a highly sought-after fish and, \n     through the years has been one of the most popular fish for \n     restaurants but is currently one of the most highly regulated \n     fisheries due to the fact that in the late 1970s and early \n     1980s, the population spawnings were not as strong as had \n     been expected; and\n       Whereas, in an effort to protect the fishery, regulations \n     were instituted that limited the number of fish that could be \n     taken and set the minimum and maximum sizes; and\n       Whereas, although these regulations have resulted in an \n     increase in the number of red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico \n     and in an overall increased health of the red snapper \n     populations, because of the past experience with unexpected \n     spawning difficulties, NOAA Fisheries continues to maintain \n     tight rein on the red snapper fishery and continues to \n     implement stringent regulations on the taking of red snapper \n     in the Gulf with those regulations for 2012 involving an open \n     season of only forty days; and\n       Whereas, a forty-day season for red snapper will be \n     devastating particularly to the charter fishing industry \n     whose clientele are eager for the experience of fishing for \n     and landing Louisiana's famed and highly sought after red \n     snapper; and\n       Whereas, the charter industry in the state of Louisiana is \n     an industry, like so many others across coastal Louisiana, \n     that has been hard hit in recent years by hurricanes, record-\n     setting riverine flooding, and the BP oil disaster in the \n     Gulf; and\n       Whereas, one of the options discussed while determining the \n     2012 management regime was a weekend-only fishery which would \n     elongate the period of time within which red snapper could be \n     caught to nearly the entire summer, thus enabling the charter \n     fishing industry, largely a weekend-only industry, more \n     opportunities to ply their trade, book their charters, and \n     increase the income to an already hard-hit industry; \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to encourage the National Marine Fisheries \n     Service, the Gulf of Mexico Marine Fisheries Council, and the \n     Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Management Council to adopt a \n     weekend-only fishery management scheme for red snapper for \n     2012; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation and the heads of the National Marine Fisheries \n     Service, the Gulf of Mexico Marine Fisheries Council, and the \n     Gulf of Mexico Fisheries Management Council.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM 93.

and\n       Whereas, the United States and Canada are each other's \n     largest single export market; and\n       Whereas, millions of jobs in both the United States and \n     Canada depend on the trade and investment flowing across the \n     border between the two countries; and\n       Whereas, Canada is one of Idaho's top trading partners, \n     based on 2010 data, and our companies and industries depend \n     on integrated cross-border supply chains and production \n     processes; and\n       Whereas, on February 4, 2011, the Prime Minister of Canada \n     and the President of the United States issued a declaration \n     on a Shared Vision for Perimeter Security and Economic \n     Competitiveness, which called for a joint action plan; and\n       Whereas, the United States and Canada established a Beyond \n     the Border Working Group composed of representatives from the \n     relevant departments and offices of their federal governments \n     to develop the action plan and be responsible for its \n     implementation; and\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\n       Whereas, the Beyond the Border Action Plan was released in \n     December of 2011; and\n       Whereas, the Beyond the Border Action Plan details methods \n     for the United States and Canada to work together to enhance \n     joint security and accelerate the legitimate flow of people, \n     goods and services through four areas of cooperation: (1) \n     addressing threats early; (2) trade facilitation, economic \n     growth and jobs; (3) cross-border law enforcement; and (4) \n     critical infrastructure and cybersecurity; and\n       Whereas, on February 4, 2011, the Prime Minister of Canada \n     and the President of the United States announced the creation \n     of the United States-Canada Regulatory Cooperation Council to \n     increase regulatory transparency and coordination between the \n     two countries; and\n       Whereas, the initial Joint Action Plan of the Regulatory \n     Cooperation Council was released in December of 2011; and\n       Whereas, the Action Plan on Regulatory Cooperation will \n     help reduce barriers to trade, lower costs for consumers and \n     business and create economic opportunities on both sides of \n     the border through the alignment of regulatory approaches in \n     the areas of agriculture and food, transportation, health and \n     personal care products, chemical management, the environment \n     and other cross-sectoral areas, while not compromising our \n     health, safety or environmental protection standards; and\n       Whereas, Idaho has much to gain from the development of \n     joint strategies and integrated approaches to enhance \n     security and efficient trade between Canada and the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Sixty-first Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that the \n     President, Executive Branch Agencies and Congress work \n     together to see that the Beyond the Border Action Plan on \n     Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness and the \n     Action Plan on Regulatory Cooperation are carried out and \n     that the United States' appointees to the Beyond the Border \n     Working Group, the Regulatory Cooperation Council, and the \n     United States' agencies responsible for implementing the \n     action plans have the resources necessary to assist in \n     realizing the goals of the action plans, and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States, the Secretary of the United States Department \n     of State, the United States Attorney General, the Secretary \n     of the United States Department of Homeland Security, the \n     Secretary of the United States Department of Commerce, the \n     Secretary of the United States Department of Transportation, \n     President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives of Congress, and the congressional delegation \n     representing the State of Idaho in the Congress of the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM 97.

A concurrent memorial adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Arizona requesting Congress to propose, and to \n     submit to the several states for ratification, a balanced \n     budget amendment to the United States Constitution; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     House Concurrent Memorial 2007\n\n       Whereas, the federal public debt now exceeds $15 trillion, \n     or $50,000 for every man, woman and child in America; and\n       Whereas, the federal public debt now exceeds the gross \n     annual output of the entire United States economy; and\n       Whereas, this fiscal irresponsibility at the federal level \n     is endangering economic opportunity now and for future \n     generations; and\n       Whereas, the federal government's unlimited borrowing \n     ability raises serious questions about fundamental principles \n     and responsibilities of government. The profound consequences \n     for the nation and its people that potentially could result \n     from unchecked borrowing make it an appropriate subject for \n     limitation by the Constitution of the United States; and\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States vests the \n     ultimate responsibility to approve or disapprove \n     constitutional amendments with the people, as represented by \n     their elected state legislatures. Opposition by a small \n     minority has repeatedly thwarted the will of the people that \n     a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution be submitted \n     to the states for ratification.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1. That the Congress of the United States expeditiously \n     pass and propose to the legislatures of the several states \n     for ratification an amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States requiring that, in the absence of a national \n     emergency, the total of all federal appropriations made by \n     the Congress for any fiscal year not exceed the total of all \n     estimated federal revenues for that fiscal year.\n       2. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this Memorial to the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, each Member of Congress from the State of \n     Arizona and the Secretary of State and the presiding officer \n     of both houses of the legislature in each state in the union.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM 99. A joint Memorial adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Idaho urging Congress to authorize an additional \n     United States District Court Judge for the District of Idaho; \n     to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial No. 4\n\n       We, your Memorialists, the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate of the State of Idaho assembled in the Second Regular \n     Session of the Sixty-first Idaho Legislature, do hereby \n     respectfully represent that:\n       Whereas, Congress admitted Idaho to the Union in 1890, soon \n     thereafter created the United States District Court for the \n     District of Idaho with one United States District Judge, \n     created a second United States District Judge in 1954, but \n     has not created any other United States District Judges for \n     the Idaho federal court since then; and\n       Whereas, Idaho's population has grown from approximately \n     600,000 in 1954 to over 1.5 million as of the 2010 census; \n     and\n       Whereas, the District of Idaho has the fewest federal \n     district judges of any of the judicial districts in the Ninth \n     Circuit, with the exception of Guam and the Northern Mariana \n     Islands; and\n       Whereas, Alaska with a 2010 census population of 710,231, \n     Montana with a 2010 census population of 989,415, South \n     Dakota with a 2010 census population of 814,180 and Wyoming \n     with a 2010 census population of 563,626 each have three \n     federal district judges even though their populations are \n     significant1y smaller than the population of Idaho; and\n       Whereas, Idaho is the 14th largest state with an area of \n     83,570 square miles, and its federal district judges are \n     required to travel throughout this large and far-flung state \n     to four designated and distant locations to conduct hearings \n     and trials in both criminal and civil cases; and\n       Whereas, Idaho's United States District Court had 170 \n     pending criminal and civil cases in 1954, and had 942 pending \n     criminal and civil cases of September 2011; and\n       Whereas, although the Idaho federal court has magistrate \n     judges, civil litigants with cases before the court \n     frequently exercise their right to have a United States \n     District Judge assigned to their cases, only district judges \n     may try felony criminal cases, speedy trial requirements and \n     the size of the criminal case load cause delays in civil \n     cases pending before Idaho's district judges, and complex \n     cases can tie up district judges for\n\n[[Page S3688]]\n\n     months at a time, all of which have forced the Idaho federal \n     court to increasingly rely on out-of-state federal district \n     judges as shown by the 96 percent increase in visiting judge \n     hours in 2008; and\n       Whereas, the United States District Court for Idaho is \n     recognized within the federal judicial system, by Idaho's \n     lawyers and by the citizens of Idaho as an exemplary court \n     comprised of judges and staff making enormous efforts and \n     sacrifices to meet the demands of its caseload and doing so \n     in a highly competent fashion; and\n       Whereas, notwithstanding the extraordinary and laudable \n     efforts of the United States District Court for the District \n     of Idaho to meet the demands of its caseload, the resources \n     available to it are inadequate, and the resulting situation \n     has created an unsustainable burden on the court, delayed \n     justice, hindered the rights of the people of Idaho, and \n     hindered the economy of our state; and\n       Whereas, the people of Idaho have needed a third federal \n     district judge for a very long time and in 2002 Senate Joint \n     Memorial 110 was adopted by the Second Regular Session of the \n     56th Idaho Legislature urging the Congress of the United \n     States to authorize an additional United States District \n     Court Judge and the staff necessary to assist in the handling \n     of the District of Idaho's increasing caseload, but, to date, \n     Congress has failed to act; and\n       Whereas, a properly resourced and properly functioning \n     judiciary is a fundamental and core governmental function \n     essential to the preservation of the people' s rights and \n     their freedom: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Sixty-first Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, That we \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     authorize an additional United States District Court Judge \n     and commensurate staff for the District of Idaho to assist in \n     handling current and anticipated caseloads in the District of \n     Idaho;

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nprohibit the use of public funds for political party conventions, and \nto provide for the return of previously distributed funds for deficit \nreduction; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, members of Congress are debating fewer \nbills, casting fewer votes, and holding fewer hearings. Meanwhile, \nimportant government agencies including the Department of Defense and \nthe Government Accountability Office are being targeted by Congress for \nspending reductions.\n  What Congress has not considered cutting is the budget for its own \nsummertime parties.\n  On June 4, 2012, I introduced bipartisan legislation to eliminate \ntaxpayer subsidies for political party conventions in the elections \noccurring after December 31, 2012. Additionally, the bill would allow \nPresidential Election Campaign Fund, PECF, funds dispersed before \nDecember 31, 2012, to be returned to the U.S. Treasury for the purpose \nof deficit reduction.\n  Despite our $15.6 trillion national debt, political parties received \na $36.6 million check, $18.3 million per party, from taxpayers to pay \nfor the costs of political conventions occurring this summer. The funds \nthat are used to cover the conventions come from the PECF.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, ``Federal law places \nrelatively few restrictions on how PECF convention funds are spent, as \nlong as purchases are lawful and are used to `defray expenses incurred \nwith respect to a presidential nominating convention.' '' The money is, \nafter all, essentially being used to throw a party.\n  Beside funding the event itself, the money is used to pay for \nentertainment, catering, transportation, hotel costs, ``production of \ncandidate biographical films,'' and a variety of other expenses. These \nevents will be weeklong parties paid for by taxpayers, much like the \nhighly maligned General Services Administration conference in Las \nVegas.\n  The $15.6 trillion debt cannot be eliminated over night. But \neliminating taxpayer subsidies for political conventions will show \nstrong leadership to getting our budget crisis in control.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this \ncommonsense legislation to demonstrate for once and all the party is \nover when it comes to travel and meetings paid for by the taxpayers.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for the opportunity to speak on the \nSenate floor today in support of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/04/senate-section/article/S3688-5", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3688-S3689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 476--HONORING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE LATE FANG \n         LIZHI TO THE PEOPLE OF CHINA AND THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Kyl, Mr. McCain, Mr. \nMenendez, and Mr. Webb) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n[[Page S3689]]\n\n                              S. Res. 476\n\n       Whereas the Chinese scientist and democracy advocate, Fang \n     Lizhi, passed away at his home in Tucson, Arizona, on April \n     6, 2012;\n       Whereas Fang Lizhi was born in February 1936 in Beijing, \n     China;\n       Whereas, in 1952, Fang Lizhi enrolled in the Physics \n     Department of Peking University, where he met his future \n     wife, Li Shuxian, and joined the Chinese Communist Party in \n     1955;\n       Whereas, in 1955, Fang Lizhi openly questioned the lack of \n     independent thinking in China's education system and, in \n     1957, drafted a letter with Li Shuxian and other associates \n     proposing political reform;\n       Whereas Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian were sentenced to hard \n     labor in 1957 and 1958, respectively, as victims of China's \n     Anti-Rightist Campaign;\n       Whereas, during China's Cultural Revolution, Fang Lizhi and \n     other faculty members and students of the University of \n     Science and Technology of China were sentenced to \n     ``reeducation through labor'' in a coal mine and a brick \n     factory;\n       Whereas, after he was again freed from confinement, Fang \n     Lizhi emerged as China's leading astrophysicist and wrote the \n     first modern Chinese-language cosmological studies, although \n     the theory of general relatively contradicted Communist \n     dogma;\n       Whereas, when he was appointed as vice president of the \n     University of Science and Technology of China in 1984, Fang \n     Lizhi initiated a series of reforms intended to democratize \n     the management of the university and enhance academic \n     freedom;\n       Whereas, in the winter of 1986 1987, when Chinese students \n     across China protested on behalf of democracy and human \n     rights, the Government of China fired Fang Lizhi from his \n     post at the University of Science and Technology of China and \n     subsequently purged him from the Communist party;\n       Whereas when, in the wake of his purge, excerpts from Fang \n     Lizhi's speeches were distributed by authorities in China as \n     examples of ``bourgeois liberalism,'' his writings became \n     tremendously popular among Chinese students;\n       Whereas, in February 1989, Fang Lizhi published an essay \n     entitled ``China's Despair and China's Hope,'' in which he \n     wrote, ``The road to democracy has already been long and \n     difficult, and is likely to remain difficult for many years \n     to come.'';\n       Whereas, in this essay, Fang Lizhi also wrote that ``it is \n     precisely because democracy is generated from below--despite \n     the many frustrations and disappointments in our present \n     situation--I still view our future with hope'';\n       Whereas, in the spring and early summer of 1989, Chinese \n     students gathered in Tiananmen Square to voice their support \n     for democracy, as well as to protest corruption in the \n     Chinese Communist Party;\n       Whereas Fang Lizhi chose not to join the protests at \n     Tiananmen Square in order to demonstrate that the students \n     were acting autonomously;\n       Whereas, from June 3 through 4, 1989, the Government of \n     China directed the People's Liberation Army to clear \n     Tiananmen Square of protestors, killing hundreds of students \n     and other civilians in the process;\n       Whereas, the Government of China issued arrest warrants for \n     Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian after the Tiananmen Massacre, \n     accusing the pair of engaging in ``counterrevolutionary \n     propaganda'' and denouncing Fang as the ``instigator of chaos \n     which resulted in the deaths of many people'';\n       Whereas, on June 5, 1989, Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian were \n     escorted by United States diplomats to the United States \n     Embassy in Beijing;\n       Whereas, between June 1989 and June 1990, United States \n     diplomatic personnel under the leadership of Ambassador James \n     R. Lilley sheltered Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian at the United \n     States Embassy in Beijing, despite the many hardships it \n     imposed on the mission;\n       Whereas, at a November 15, 1989, ceremony awarding Fang \n     Lizhi the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award, Senator \n     Edward M. Kennedy said of Fang ``What Andrei Sakharov was in \n     Moscow, Fang Lizhi became in Beijing.'';\n       Whereas, on June 25, 1990, Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian were \n     allowed to leave China for the United Kingdom and then the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, in 1992, Fang Lizhi received an appointment as a \n     professor of physics at the University of Arizona in Tucson, \n     where he continued his research in astrophysics and \n     advocating for human rights in China;\n       Whereas, in the years since June 4, 1989, a new generation \n     of Chinese activists has continued the struggle for democracy \n     in their homeland, working ``from below'' to protect the \n     rights of Chinese citizens, to increase the openness of the \n     Chinese political system, and to reduce corruption among \n     public officials; and\n       Whereas, with the passing of Fang Lizhi, China and the \n     United States have lost a great scientist and one of the most \n     eloquent human rights advocates of the modern era: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) mourns the loss of Fang Lizhi;\n       (2) honors the life, scientific contributions, and service \n     of Fang Lizhi to advance the cause of human freedom;\n       (3) offers the deepest condolences of the Senate to the \n     family and friends of Fang Lizhi; and\n       (4) stands with the people of China as they strive to \n     improve their way of life and create a government that is \n     truly democratic and respectful of international norms in the \n     area of human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/04/senate-section/article/S3689-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                      COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 462) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 462\n\n       Whereas National Foster Care Month was established more \n     than 20 years ago to bring foster care issues to the \n     forefront, highlight the importance of permanency for every \n     child, and recognize the essential role that foster parents, \n     social workers, and advocates have in the lives of children \n     in foster care throughout the United States;\n       Whereas all children deserve a safe, loving, and permanent \n     home;\n       Whereas the primary goal of the foster care system is to \n     ensure the safety and well-being of children while working to \n     provide a safe, loving, and permanent home for each child;\n       Whereas there are approximately 408,000 children living in \n     foster care;\n       Whereas there were approximately 254,000 youth that entered \n     the foster care system in 2010, while over 107,000 youth were \n     eligible and awaiting adoption at the end of 2010;\n       Whereas children in foster care experience an average of 3 \n     different placements, which often leads to disruption of \n     routines and the need to change schools and move away from \n     siblings, extended families, and familiar surroundings;\n       Whereas youth in foster care are much more likely to face \n     educational instability with 65 percent of former foster \n     children experiencing at least 7 school changes while in \n     care;\n\n[[Page S3690]]\n\n       Whereas children of color are more likely to stay in the \n     foster care system for longer periods of time and are less \n     likely to be reunited with their biological families;\n       Whereas foster parents are the front-line caregivers for \n     children who cannot safely remain with their biological \n     parents and provide physical care, emotional support, \n     education advocacy, and are the largest single source of \n     families providing permanent homes for children leaving \n     foster care to adoption;\n       Whereas children in foster care who are placed with \n     relatives, compared to children placed with nonrelatives, \n     have more stability, including fewer changes in placements, \n     have more positive perceptions of their placements, are more \n     likely to be placed with their siblings, and demonstrate \n     fewer behavioral problems;\n       Whereas an increased emphasis on prevention and \n     reunification services is necessary to reduce the number of \n     children that are forced to remain in the foster care system;\n       Whereas more than 27,900 youth ``age out'' of foster care \n     without a legal permanent connection to an adult or family;\n       Whereas children who age out of foster care may lack the \n     security or support of a biological or adoptive family and \n     frequently struggle to secure affordable housing, obtain \n     health insurance, pursue higher education, and acquire \n     adequate employment;\n       Whereas foster care is intended to be a temporary \n     placement, but children remain in the foster care system for \n     an average of 2 years;\n       Whereas volunteers, guardians, mentors, and workers in the \n     child-protective-services community play a vital role in \n     improving the safety of the most valuable youth and work hard \n     to increase permanency through reunification, adoption, and \n     guardianship;\n       Whereas due to heavy caseloads and limited resources, the \n     average tenure for a worker in child protection services is \n     just 3 years;\n       Whereas on average, 8.5 percent of the positions in child \n     protective services remain vacant;\n       Whereas States, localities, and communities should be \n     encouraged to invest resources in preventative and \n     reunification services and postpermanency programs to ensure \n     that more children in foster care are provided with safe, \n     loving, and permanent placements;\n       Whereas Federal legislation over the past 3 decades, \n     including the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of \n     1980 (Public Law 96 272), the Adoption and Safe Families Act \n     of 1997 (Public Law 105 89), the Fostering Connections to \n     Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 (Public Law 110 \n     351), and the Child and Family Services Improvement and \n     Innovation Act (Public Law 112 34) provided new investments \n     and services to improve the outcomes of children in the \n     foster care system;\n       Whereas May is an appropriate month to designate as \n     National Foster Care Month to provide an opportunity to \n     acknowledge the child-welfare workforce, foster parents, \n     advocacy community, and mentors for their dedication, \n     accomplishments, and positive impact they have on the lives \n     of children; and\n       Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children \n     have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, \n     regardless of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes National Foster Care Month as an opportunity \n     to raise awareness about the challenges faced by children in \n     the foster care system, acknowledging the dedication of \n     foster care parents, advocates, and workers, and encouraging \n     Congress to implement policy to improve the lives of children \n     in the foster care system;\n       (2) encourages Congress to implement policy to improve the \n     lives of children in the foster care system;\n       (3) supports the designation of May as National Foster Care \n     Month;\n       (4) acknowledges the special needs of children in the \n     foster care system;\n       (5) recognizes foster youth throughout the United States \n     for their ongoing tenacity, courage, and resilience while \n     facing life challenges;\n       (6) acknowledges the exceptional alumni of the foster care \n     system who serve as advocates and role models for youth who \n     remain in care;\n       (7) honors the commitment and dedication of the individuals \n     who work tirelessly to provide assistance and services to \n     children in the foster care system;

Madam President, first of all, let me thank the Senator \nfrom Ohio for allowing me to interrupt him for my unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  This month, the Senate will have the opportunity to put a stop to the \nsecond most expensive EPA regulation in history, the rule known as \nUtility MACT. It is kind of confusing. Let me share with everyone what \nit means: MACT--and we better learn it now because we are going to hear \nit more and more--it is M-A-C-T. That means Maximum Achievable \nControlled Technology. In other words, the EPA comes along and makes a \nregulation where there is no technology that will accommodate the rule. \nSo that is what it is all about. That is what the Obama EPA calls it so \nthe people will not know what it is and how much it costs. It is the \nfirst step--we are talking about Utility MACT--it is the first step to \nkill coal in the United States.\n  Right now, we in this country depend upon coal for 50 percent of our \nelectricity. One can just imagine what will happen to our energy costs \nas well as millions of lost jobs. I have introduced a joint resolution \nto kill it. By voting for my resolution, S.J. Res. 37, Members of the \nSenate can prevent the Obama EPA from causing so much economic pain for \nAmerican families. It requires only a majority vote in the Senate and \nthe House. It would have to be signed by the President.\n  People say: Why would the President sign a bill that would stop his \nEPA from overregulating? I would suggest that right before the \nelection, he does not want to go on record as causing that many job \nlosses and that much damage to our economy.\n  Utility MACT is the centerpiece of President Obama's effort to kill \ncoal. Utility MACT is specifically designed to close down existing coal \nplants, while the Obama EPA's greenhouse gas regulations are \nspecifically designed to prevent any new coal plants from being built. \nSo we are going to shut down the coal plants that are there now and \nprevent new coal plants from being built.\n  Keep in mind, 50 percent of our energy comes from coal. The goal \nbehind these policies is not surprising. But what is surprising is that \nwhile President Obama goes around pretending to be for an all-of-the-\nabove approach on energy--let's make sure we understand what that is. \nAn all-of-the-above approach was the Republicans' idea. It was: We are \nfor all of the above. We are for nuclear energy. We are for fossil \nfuels, coal, gas, oil, renewables, solar, everything else.\n  That is what ``all of the above'' means. The President has been \nsaying\n\n[[Page S3691]]\n\nhe is for an all-of-the-above approach on energy, while members of his \ngreen team administration cannot help but tell the truth about what is \ngoing on in the EPA. The Presiding Officer remembers several weeks ago \nwhen I came to the Senate floor to bring attention to a video of EPA \nregion 6 Administrator Al Armendariz admitting that the EPA's general \nphilosophy is to crucify and make examples of oil and gas companies.\n  We remember that, do we not? He said--and it was on a video, his \nvoice with himself speaking to a group of people, including giving \nadvice to those who were subordinates to him. He said: You have to do \nwhat the Romans did years ago when they would go around the \nMediterranean. They would go into different areas in Turkey, and they \nwould crucify the first five people they would see and leave them to \ndie, dangling on a cross, in order to get them to submit to him.\n  Today, I would like to highlight another video. It is a video of the \nEPA region 1 Administrator Curt Spalding, admitting that the Obama EPA \nconsciously and deliberately made the choice to wage war on coal. I am \ngoing to quote exactly what he said so everyone can have the full \neffect of it. He said:\n\n       But know right now, we are, we are struggling. We are \n     struggling because we are trying to do our jobs. Lisa Jackson \n     has put forth a very powerful message to the country. Just \n     two days ago, the decision on greenhouse gas performance \n     standard and saying basically gas plants are the performance \n     standard which means if you want to build a coal plant you \n     got a big problem. That was a huge decision. You can't \n     imagine how tough that was. Because you got to remember that \n     if you go to West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and all those \n     places, you have coal communities who depend on coal. And to \n     say that we just think those communities should just go away, \n     we can't do that. But she had to do what the law and the \n     policy suggested. And it's painful. It's painful every step \n     of the way.\n\n  Again, I am quoting the region 1 Administrator Curt Spalding in a \nstatement he made. That is an exact quote. Let me repeat the key parts \nof Administrator Spalding's quote for emphasis. He said, ``If you want \nto build a coal plant you got a big problem.'' Even more stunning, he \nis admitting that the Obama EPA's decision to kill coal was painful \nevery step of the way because West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and all the \ncoal States depend on coal development for their jobs, their \nlivelihoods.\n\n  I had occasion to be in West Virginia and in Ohio and see and speak \nface to face with people who are third-, fourth-generation workers in \nthe coal mines. Those people are scared to death that coal will be \nkilled. Here it is in front of us right now. They are going to kill \ncoal anyway.\n  Trust me, Administrator Spalding and President Obama, it is far more \npainful for those who will lose their jobs and have to pay skyrocketing \nelectricity prices than it will be for you.\n  Spalding's statement that ``if you want to build a coal plant you got \na big problem'' reminds us a lot of President Obama's own statement \nabout coal in 2008, when he was not so afraid to explain his real \nintention. Remember, he said--and this is a quote by the President in \n2008. ``If you want to build a coal-fired power plant you can, it's \njust that it will bankrupt you.''\n  That was 2008. Sure enough, he is bringing that to reality. He is \nmaking every effort. Of course, this war on coal comes from the same \nadministration that put the ``crucify them'' Administrator Armendariz \nin charge of the biggest oil-and-gas-producing region in the country. \nIn fact, crucifixion philosophy is so obvious now that even the \nsomewhat left-leaning Washington Post said that the Obama EPA is \n``earning a reputation for abuse.''\n  But I think Kim Strassel of the Wall Street Journal put it best when \nshe said that Armendariz was ``a perfect general for Mr. Obama's war \nagainst natural gas and on the front lines of President Obama's battle \nto end fossil fuels and affordable energy.''\n  As this most recent video of region 1 Administrator Spalding \nconfirms, there are plenty of green generals such as Armendariz going \ninto battle for the Obama EPA. We have several more videos of EPA \nofficials making similar statements. I am not going to talk about them \ntonight. I will talk about those at a later date because today I would \nlike to focus my remarks specifically on President Obama's war on coal \nand what Members of this body will choose to do about it.\n  The fundamental question before the Senate will be whether my \ncolleagues will have the courage to stand up to President Obama and put \nthe brakes on his abusive, out-of-control EPA that has openly admitted: \nIf you want to build a coal plant, you have a big problem or if they \nare going to stand with President Obama and his administration's \n``crucify'' agenda.\n  One of the most interesting and telling aspects of President Obama's \ndisingenuous attempt to rebrand himself as a supporter of fossil fuels \nis that he never mentions coal. He does not even pretend. In fact, up \nuntil very recently, President Obama's campaign Web site had a section \ndevoted to the President's goals for every energy resource except coal.\n  Only after facing intense criticism and disappointing primary results \nin coal States, which just happened recently--I think we are all aware \nof that--the Obama campaign attempted quietly to add a clean coal \nsection to its site.\n  Apparently, President Obama's definition of clean coal is no coal. In \nhis 2013 budget request, the President cut funding for coal research \nand development at the National Energy Technology Lab by nearly 30 \npercent. This is at the same time EPA has proposed greenhouse gas \nstandards for coal-fired powerplants that require carbon capture and \nsequestration. We refer to that as CCS. It is a technology that is not \nready to operate on a commercial scale.\n  On one hand, we have Obama issuing standards in which utilities \ncannot comply without using CCS; on the other hand, we have them \nhandicapped in that very technology. In other words, what he is saying \nis that we have emissions standards for coal technology where there is \nno technology. There are standards required for emissions where there \nis no technology that will accommodate that request.\n  We are going to see it in other areas too. This is coal. I am \nconcentrating just on coal tonight. After cap and trade was thoroughly \nrejected by the American people and defeated in a Democratically \ncontrolled Congress, President Obama promised that he would not give up \nin his efforts to stop coal development. He also said:\n\n       Cap-and-trade was just one way of skinning the cat. It was \n     a means, not an end. I'm going to be looking for other means \n     to address this problem.\n\n  He has found other ways to skin the cat--by imposing regulations that \nhave exactly the same effect of killing coal. I do not have time to go \ninto every action EPA has taken, but I would like to highlight a few of \nthe key coal-killing regulations. Front and center, of course, is \nUtility MACT. Utility MACT is a rule which sets strict standards that \ncannot be met, which means that along with EPA's other air rules, up to \n20 percent of America's coal-fired capacity will be shuttered and \naround 1.6 million jobs will be lost.\n  That is initially. Carry that on through, considering that coal \nsupplies 50 percent of our energy in this country, it is going to far \nexceed that, starting off with 50 percent of America's coal-fired \ncapacity will be shut down. Utility MACT's pricetag is second only to \nthe Obama EPA's greenhouse gas regulations, which are designed to \nprevent any new coal plants from being built in this country.\n  Similar to the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, these regulations \nwill cost $300 to $400 billion a year and destroy over 2 million jobs. \nIt may even cost more if the courts throw out the EPA's tailoring rule. \nIt kind of gets into the weeds. It is a little bit complicated.\n  What they are attempting to do is the regulations that they were \nunable to do through legislation. We had several bills over a 12-year \nperiod to try to impose cap and trade. That cap and trade cost would be \n$300 billion to $400 billion. The tailoring rule is one where if EPA \ndoes it through regulation, doing the same thing, imposing cap and \ntrade on the American people, it will not cost $300 billion to $400 \nbillion a year, but it will be far more because it will have to reach \nthe standards of the Clean Air Act. That would be regulating those \nemitters with 250,000 tons of emissions a year. Every school, church, \nrestaurant, and coffee shop\n\n[[Page S3692]]\n\nwould now have to be regulated and would be put out of business by the \nEPA.\n  EPA is also waging this war on the permitting front. We have been \ntracking this problem for a long time. A lot of people recognize when \nthe Obama EPA was trying to shut down the gulf, they said: We are not \ngoing to do it because of public pressure. But then they refused to \nissue permits.\n  As my EPW minority report from January 2010 showed, the EPA was \nobstructing 190 coal mining permits, putting nearly 18,000 jobs at \nrisk. That was 2\\1/2\\ years ago and not much has improved.\n  Last November a report by the Office of Inspector General I requested \nconfirmed that EPA, through its own actions, had been deliberately and \nsystematically slowing the pace of permit evaluations for new plants in \nAppalachia. These findings were concerning enough that the inspector \ngeneral did a follow-up review. And again in February of this year, 2 \nyears later, the Office of Inspector General found EPA did not have a \nconsistent official recordkeeping system that was exacerbating permit \ndelays. Not only has EPA continued to stall the permitting process, \nthey are trying to stop permits that were already granted.\n  In January 2011--and this is significant--EPA took the drastic \nunprecedented step of revoking a lawfully issued mining permit the Bush \nArmy Corps of Engineers had granted to Spruce Mine, which is a project \nin Appalachia. Fortunately, the courts recognized EPA's overreaching in \nthis case.\n  On March 23, 2012, the U.S. district court ruled that EPA exceeded \nits authority, and as the judge said,\n\n       EPA's claim that it can veto a permit issued by the Army \n     Corps of Engineers is a stunning power for an agency to \n     arrogate itself.\n\n  That is a Federal judge's quote.\n  After 4 years of this aggressive barrage of rules designed to kill \ncoal, many in the heartland, States that rely heavily on coal, are not \namused.\n  Just last month 24 State attorneys general, including one-quarter of \nall Democratic State attorneys general, filed a suit to overturn \nUtility MACT because of the devastating effects it will have on jobs in \ntheir States and their economies. These are Democrats from Arkansas, \nKentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, West Virginia, and Wyoming. In other \nwords, it appeared that Democratic AGs from several States are trying \nto save coal while the Democratic Senators from those same States are \ncarrying out President Obama's war on coal.\n  What is happening in West Virginia? The State government just \nsponsored a 3-day forum last week on ``EPA's war on coal.'' This is in \nWest Virginia.\n  Larry Puccio, the Democratic Party chairman in West Virginia, said:\n\n       A lot of folks here have real frustration with this \n     administration's stance on coal and energy.\n       Recently, on a West Virginia radio show, Cecil Roberts, the \n     President of the United Mine Workers of America, famously \n     said that EPA Administer Lisa Jackson ``shot [the coal \n     industry] in Washington just as the Navy Seals shot bin \n     Laden.'' As Roberts expanded:\n       We've been placed in a horrendous position here. How do you \n     take coal miners' money and say let's use it politically to \n     support someone whose EPA has pretty much said, ``You're \n     done''?\n\n  It doesn't get any stronger than that. These are all Democrats. Let's \nnot forget West Virginia is the State where President Obama lost \nseveral counties in a primary to a convicted felon not long ago.\n  Kentucky is weighing in. As Politico reported, President Obama lost \nan ``uncommitted'' vote in 38 counties representing the Kentucky Coal \nCoalition and won just 44 percent of over 49,000 votes. He only carried \n14 of the 38 coal counties, and overall carried the State as a whole \nwith just 58 percent of the vote.\n  In Arkansas, President Obama won the primary with less than 60 \npercent of the vote.\n  In Ohio, it was the same story. When Vice President Biden visited the \nState recently, he was faced with over 100 workers who would lose their \njobs because of this administration's aggressive regulatory regime. \nTheir message to the administration is ``Stop the war on coal.''\n  These States have good reason to be concerned. Let's look at how \nUtility MACT will impact some of the most coal-dependent States.\n  In Arkansas, 40 percent of their electricity is produced by coal.\n  Louisiana has the ninth cheapest electricity in the Nation, $100 \nmillion in payroll.\n  In Michigan, 60 percent of their electricity is produced by coal. \nThey are tenth in coal use.\n  Missouri, which is a big one, 80 percent of their electricity is \nproduced by coal. They are sixth in coal use.\n  Montana, 60 percent of its electricity, fifth in coal production.\n  North Dakota, 85 percent of electricity is produced by coal. They are \nninth in coal production.\n  Ohio is a big one, with 85 percent of electricity, and more than \n19,000 jobs are at stake because of this Utility MACT.\n  Pennsylvania, 52 percent of their electricity is produced by coal, \nand they are fifth in coal use; Tennessee, 62 percent of the \nelectricity.\n  Virginia, more than 31,000 jobs, and they are 13th in coal \nproduction; West Virginia, second in coal production, with more than \n80,000 jobs.\n  These are real jobs that we lost State by State. That is how this is \na big deal. I will go into detail as to why Utility MACT would be \ndevastating. Just put this rule in perspective.\n  Even Democratic Representative John Dingell, who has been in the \nHouse many years--I served with him in the House many years ago, and he \nwas the author of the Clean Air Act Amendments--said that Utility MACT \nis ``unparalleled in its size and scope'' and that it ``presents a set \nof new regulations with possible wide-reaching impacts on the way our \ncountry generates and consumes electricity.'' Now, that was \nRepresentative Dingell over in the House of Representatives, a \nDemocrat.\n  Utility MACT has an unprecedented price tag. EPA puts the cost of \ntheir rule at nearly $10 billion a year. That is interesting because no \none else's is that low. Other sources project that it will cost \nconsiderably more, making it the second most expensive rule in the \nAgency's history. This is second only to global warming's cap-and-\ntrade, which would be about a $300 billion to $400 billion tax \nincrease, so double that.\n  Now, this is something I always do because in my State of Oklahoma, \nwhen we start talking about billions and trillions of dollars, I like \nto see how it will affect our families in Oklahoma. So a $300 billion \nto $400 billion tax increase, which is what it would have been if they \nhad been successful in passing cap-and-trade and what it will be if \nthey do it by regulation, you can double that. This tax increase would \ncost the average family who pays Federal income tax in my State of \nOklahoma over $3,000 a year. And, of course, you don't get anything for \nit because even Lisa Jackson, Obama's Administrator of the EPA, \nadmitted that if we pass cap-and-trade, it would not reduce our overall \nemissions because the problem isn't here in the United States; it is in \nMexico and it is in China and in other countries around the world. So \nthe Utility MACT we are talking about today would tax each family over \nand above cap-and-trade.\n  Further, the rule will shut down 20 percent of America's coal-fired \npower capacity. This will inevitably result in higher electricity \nprices for every American. Simply put, it is a supply-and-demand \nsituation. I think we all understand that. There is not a person who is \nwithin earshot of me, anyway, who didn't learn back in grade school and \nelementary school what supply and demand means. It means if you shut \ndown the coal plants, the energy remaining will cost a lot more.\n  It is not just me saying this. Here is what the Chicago Tribune \nreported on May 18: that in 2015, ``electric bills are set to be about \n$130 more than they are today.'' Now I am talking to everyone out there \nwho has electricity. The electric bills are set to be about that much \nmore.\n  The Chicago Tribune went on to say that prices have already \nsignificantly risen in the heartland. I will quote the article again:\n\n       Prices were higher in northern Ohio and the Mid-Atlantic \n     region at $357 per megawatt, and $167 per megawatt \n     respectively.\n\n  Now, let's look at the jobs. Utility MACT and other EPA regulations \non the electric power sector have resulted\n\n[[Page S3693]]\n\nin over 24,000 megawatts of announced powerplant retirements located in \n20 States. According to the National Economic Research Associates, \nUtility MACT would destroy between 180,000 and 215,000 jobs in 2015. \nAnd with other new EPA regulations on the electric power sector, the \neconomy stands to lose approximately 1.65 million jobs by 2020.\n  Manufacturers will be particularly hard hit due to their reliance on \nlow-cost electricity and because of their dependence on natural gas as \na raw material as both electricity rates and natural gas prices \nincrease. According to Nucor Steel, a 1-percent increase in electricity \nrates will cost the firm $120 million. These extra costs would endanger \n1 million manufacturing jobs outside of the coal and utility \nindustries.\n  Utility MACT will also have a negative ripple effect. To bring up one \nexample, in Avon Lake, OH, the closure of the local GenOn powerplant \nwill cost the school system 11 percent of its budget annually. Besides \nthe 80 high-quality jobs lost at the plant and many indirect job losses \nin the community, the city will have fewer resources for its \nparamedics, firefighters, schools, and everything else. This story will \nbe replicated in communities across America.\n  Now, for a couple of myths about this, people try to say it is not \nsurprising that instead of taking credit for the dire results of this \ncoal-killing agenda in an election year, the Obama administration is \nclaiming that lower natural gas prices are the reason utilities are \nswitching from coal to natural gas. That is absolutely wrong. There is \none problem with that. While President Obama poses in front of the \npipelines in my State of Oklahoma pretending to be a friend of oil and \nnatural gas, he is giving marching orders to his administration to do \neverything possible to end hydraulic fracturing.\n  To get back in the weeds a little here, hydraulic fracturing is a \nprocess to get oil and gas out of tight formations. In fact, you can't \nget 1 cubic foot of natural gas out of a tight formation without using \nhydraulic fracturing. I am pretty familiar with that process because \nthat was started in my State of Oklahoma way back in 1949. There has \nnever been a documented case of groundwater contamination by using \nhydraulic fracturing. But this is what he is trying to do--to kill the \noil and gas by doing away with hydraulic fracturing.\n  Remember, I mentioned earlier that Armendariz was the only one caught \non tape admitting that the EPA's general philosophy was to crucify and \nmake examples of oil and gas companies, specifically targeting \nhydraulic fracturing. If the crucifixion scandal isn't enough of a \nrevelation in this war on natural gas, remember the Sierra Club, which \nrecently gave the President its most enthusiastic endorsement, just \nrolled out its newest campaign called ``Beyond Gas,'' a spin-off of its \ndecade-old campaign ``Beyond Coal.'' That was 10 years ago that the \nSierra Club talked about its campaign to phase out coal-fired \npowerplants.\n  Sierra Club executive director Michael Brune explained:\n\n       As we push to retire coal plants, we're going to work to \n     make sure we're not simultaneously switching to natural-gas \n     infrastructure. And we're going to be preventing new gas \n     plants from being built wherever we can.\n\n  So it is not just coal, it is coal and all other fossil fuels. So \nthose people who think somehow they can say, well, we are going to \npromote natural gas--which they are not doing because they are trying \nto stop hydraulic fracturing--they don't realize that is a fossil fuel. \nIt may have taken Nancy Pelosi 6 months to realize natural gas is a \nfossil fuel, but everybody knows that today.\n  So natural gas supplies may be plentiful now, but the Obama \nadministration's ``crucify them'' agenda on oil and gas development is \ndesigned to change that. Its whole purpose is to decrease access to \nthese resources through increased regulations from the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n  Another myth is the public health myth. I want to address that \nbecause that is being perpetrated by Utility MACT proponents, and it \nhas to do with their public health argument. The truth is that the \nhealth benefits EPA claims are exaggerated and misleading. That is \nbecause EPA's analysis showed that over 99 percent of the benefits of \nthe rule we are talking about--a Utility MACT rule--come from reducing \nfine particulate matter, not air toxics. Of course, fine particulate \nmatter is already regulated under the National Ambient Air Quality \nStandards. In fact, 90 percent of Utility MACT's purported particulate \nmatter benefits occur in air already deemed safe by the NAAQS program.\n  Not only is the EPA double miscounting benefits, it is also dismally \nfailing the cost-benefit test. The Agency itself admits that Utility \nMACT will cost an unprecedented $10 billion to implement. We think it \nis going to be more than twice that, but they say $10 billion. They \nalso admit that the $10 billion it costs will yield a mere $6 million \nin direct benefits. That means, by the EPA's own statement, they admit \nthe best-case scenario yields a ludicrous cost-benefit ratio of 1,600 \nto 1.\n  In reality, Utility MACT will harm the public by increasing \nunemployment--a well-established risk factor for elevated illness and \nmortality rates. In addition to influences on mental disorders, \nsuicide, and alcoholism, unemployment is also a risk factor in \ncardiovascular disease and overall decreases in life expectancy. \nFurther, higher electric bills act like a regressive tax, hurting the \npoor and the elderly most by diverting funds they would otherwise have \nfor food, rent, and medical care to pay for more expensive electricity.\n  To be sure, those who won't feel any of this economic pain are \nPresident Obama's Hollywood elites.\n  I know that my environmental friends are already accusing me of \nallowing mercury to go into the air. So today I would like to remind \nthem that it was the Republicans who first put forth a real plan to \nreduce mercury emissions from powerplants.\n  In 2002 and 2003, Republicans were in the majority. At that time, I \nwas the chairman of the committee that had regulation over the air, and \nwe were working to pass the Clear Skies bill, which was the most \naggressive initiative in history to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, \nnitrogen oxide, and mercury--SOX, NOX, and \nmercury. In fact, this bill would have reduced mercury emissions by 70 \npercent by 2018. So in just 6 years from now, we would already have had \na 70-percent reduction in what I call real pollutants--SOX, \nNOX, and mercury.\n  Now, what happened? Why did it fail? It failed because they wanted to \ninclude greenhouse gases. They wanted to include CO2. And at \nthe expense of losing those reductions that were mandated in \nSOX, NOX, and mercury, they said: Well, if we \ncan't have CO2, we don't want it at all.\n  So why did Clear Skies fail in 2005? Then-Senator Obama served with \nme in the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and it was \nhis vote that killed the bill. As Senator Obama himself admitted:\n\n       I voted against the Clear Skies bill. In fact, I was the \n     deciding vote despite the fact that I'm a coal state and that \n     half of my state thought I'd thoroughly betrayed them because \n     I thought clean air was critical and global warming was \n     critical.\n\n  That was then-Senator Barack Obama.\n  Clear Skies apparently didn't cause enough pain. It reduced real \npollutants. It didn't address President Obama's pet cause of climate \nchange. It did not achieve the goal they really wanted to impose; that \nis, ending coal.\n  So now, instead of having a reasonable and effective mercury \nreduction plan already in place and working for the American people, \nPresident Obama wants to implement EPA's Utility MACT in order to kill \ncoal.\n  The bottom line is that we still need coal, and all those who dream \nof doing away with it will not be able to escape the reality that coal \nwill continue to provide much of our electricity for the foreseeable \nfuture. So we need to be implementing policies that improve air quality \nwithout destroying coal and millions of good American jobs and imposing \nskyrocketing electricity costs on every American. That is why my \nresolution to stop Utility MACT is so crucial.\n  Contrary to what critics are saying, this resolution does not prevent \nthe EPA from regulating mercury under the Clean Air Act. It simply \nrequires that the EPA go back to the drawing board to craft a rule with \nwhich utilities can actually comply--a rule that\n\n[[Page S3694]]\n\ndoes not threaten to end coal in America and American generation but \nhelps utilities to reduce emissions without having to shut their doors.\n  The House, led by Congressman Fred Upton, recently passed bipartisan \nlegislation to rein in the Utility MACT, with 19 Democrats supporting \nthe measure. So now it is time for the Senate to act.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that this resolution will \nprobably be the vote for coal for the year, so this is our one chance. \nMany of my Democratic colleagues have gone on record saying that they \nwant to rein in the Obama EPA. The senior Senator from Missouri is one \nof them. She said, back home, that she is determined to hold the line \non the EPA. Does that mean she and other Senate Democrats who have made \nsimilar statements will vote to stop the centerpiece of Obama's war on \ncoal? Apparently not.\n  Today I talked a lot about Utility MACT. Let's be sure we understand \nwhat it means. One more time: Utility MACT is a rule by the EPA to end \ncoal in America and cause electricity rates to skyrocket. That is a \nstatement that even the President said, that the electric rates would \nskyrocket. My resolution, S.J. Res. 37, will allow Members of the \nSenate to stop the Obama EPA. It is as simple as that.\n  I can remember when we passed the CRA, the Congressional Review Act. \nIt is interesting because the Congressional Review Act was one which \nrecognized that sometimes things are out of control, the EPA and other \nparts of the administration. So if it is something where you get a \nsimple majority of Members saying: This is outrageous, and we need to \nstop it, we can do it by passing a CRA--a Congressional Review Act. \nThat is what S.J. Res. 37 is, and that is our only chance to stop this.\n  So a vote on my resolution would clearly demonstrate to the American \npeople which Senators will hold on and stand with their constituents \nfor jobs and affordable energy and which Senators want to kill coal in \nfavor of President Obama's radical global warming agenda that will be \ndevastating to people. To borrow a phrase from Administrator Spalding: \nTo choose the latter will be painful--painful every step of the way for \ntheir constituents. And I hope they make the right choice.\n  So I would just repeat that this is the last chance you have to stop \nthe administration from killing coal. This is the vote of the year in \nterms of the effort to stop the killing of coal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/04/senate-section/article/S3694-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
