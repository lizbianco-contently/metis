Mr. President, the Senate yesterday took the first step \ntoward repealing wasteful taxpayer subsidies to oil and gas companies. \nI was pleased my Republican colleagues joined Senate Democrats to move \nthis debate forward.\n  The country deserves to hear the truth about double dipping--double \ndipping--by oil companies. They take taxpayer money with one hand and \nraise gas prices with the other hand. There has never been a more \nperfect illustration of this than what has happened recently. The \ncountry deserves to hear the truth about these oil companies.\n  But do not be fooled by last night's bipartisan vote. Senate \nRepublicans would never, ever side with American taxpayers against Big \nOil. It is against their nature. It is against their political \nphilosophy, as indicated by the numerous votes they have taken against \nthis. They proved it yesterday with rhetoric. They proved exactly what \nI have said. They proved it last year with nearly a party-line vote \nagainst legislation to hold back handouts to oil companies that were \nmaking record profits then.\n  The records have been broken. There is a handful of those oil \ncompanies--one handful--that last year made $137 billion.\n\n[[Page S2040]]\n\n  Despite this rhetoric of the Republicans, Americans understand it \nwill take more than a bumper-sticker slogan to stop the pain at the \npump. We have to reduce the Nation's reliance on foreign oil. But we \ncannot drill our way to energy independence. We are doing better. We \nhave done so well during the Obama years. Every year he has been \nPresident, production has gone up and the use of oil has gone down.\n  We must continue looking for responsible new domestic oil sources. \nBut we must also invest in the clean energy technologies of tomorrow to \ncreate good jobs for today.\n  Repealing almost $24 billion in wasteful subsidies to oil companies \nwould pay for these clean energy investments--with money left over to \ndo something about the deficit.\n  America has less than 2 percent of the oil reserves in the world but \nconsumes more than 20 percent of the world's oil supply each year. So \ndrilling on American soil alone will not solve our reliance on foreign \noil.\n  Last year America used a lower percentage of foreign oil than at any \ntime in almost two decades, thanks to President Obama's policies. \nDomestic oil production, I repeat, has increased every year during the \nObama administration. Meanwhile, American dependence on foreign oil has \ndecreased each year. Yet prices at the pump have continued to rise.\n  Here is why. For every penny the price at the pump goes up, the major \noil companies--there are five of them--make an additional $200 million \nin profits each quarter. So let's say that again. For every penny you \npay extra at the gas pump, these five oil companies make $200 million.\n  Well, it does not take a lot of math to understand that gas prices \nhave risen 62 cents this year, so take $200 million times 62 and you \nhave a huge amount of billions of dollars. Every time a penny is added \nto your purchase of a gallon of gas, oil companies make $200 million. \nSo--62 cents--they have made billions this year.\n  Last year they raked in $137 billion in profits, and they are on pace \nfor another record-breaking year of astronomical profits. So it is \nbeyond ridiculous when Republicans argue oil companies need billions in \ntaxpayer subsidies each year.\n  Middle-class families are struggling. Oil companies that last year \nraked in $261,000 a minute, 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year, are \nnot struggling.\n  Mr. President, listen to this again. Oil companies last year raked in \n$261,000 a minute, 24 hours a day, no weekends off, no holidays. They \ndid it 365 days of the year. They are not struggling at all and that, \nof course, is a gross understatement. That is why this matter is now \nbefore the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2040-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             IRAN SANCTIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. On another topic that is extremely important, Mr. \nPresident, I have talked about how obvious it is America needs to \nreduce its reliance on foreign oil. But if anyone needs another reason, \njust look at the regimes that benefit from the global addiction to oil.\n  For example, Iran. Iran uses profits from global oil sales to support \nits terrorism around the world, its nuclear weapons program. So it is \ncritical the Senate act now--and act quickly--to further tighten \nsanctions against Iran. These sanctions are a key tool as we work to \nstop them from obtaining nuclear weapons, threatening Israel, and \nultimately jeopardizing U.S. national security.\n  This country is so fortunate to have the person who is leading the \nCentral Intelligence Agency: GEN David Petraeus. I had the good fortune \nyesterday to spend an hour with him. He is a good man. He understands \nwhat is going on in the world.\n  We must be vigilant, as we are, about what is going on in Iran. I \nrepeat, we must act now--and act quickly--to further tighten sanctions \nagainst Iran. These sanctions are a key tool as we work to stop them \nfrom obtaining nuclear weapons, threatening Israel and further \nterrorizing other parts of the world.\n  The only way to get sanctions in place now is to take up a bipartisan \nbill that passed unanimously out of the Senate Banking Committee. I \nwould like and I am going to move to this. My staff has alerted the \nRepublican leader I am going to ask consent soon to move forward on \nthis unanimously reported bill out of the Banking Committee.\n  Unfortunately, I have been told my Republican colleagues will object \nto moving forward with these new sanctions because they want to offer \nadditional amendments. I have Democrats who want to offer additional \namendments also, but we do not have the time to slow down passage of \nthis legislation.\n  Let's move to the next step. When we put this away, we are not going \nto be finished with Iran. There are a number of Democrats, I repeat, \nwho also wish to offer amendments to this bill, but in an effort to get \nsanctions in place now, Democrats have agreed to streamline the process \nand refrain from offering their amendments.\n  We cannot afford to slow down the process. Passing this bill now will \nhelp prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. And that is a goal \non which we should all agree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2040-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the tragic death \nof Trayvon Martin and the larger issue of racial profiling. On Monday I \nspoke about this issue at the Center for Urban Families in Baltimore. \nJoining me were representatives from various faith and civil rights \ngroups in Baltimore, as well as graduates from the center's program.\n  This weekend we saw numerous rallies take place across the United \nStates, including rallies called Million Hoodie Marches where \nindividuals wore hoodies in solidarity with Trayvon Martin.\n  I was touched by what President Obama said on Friday about this case. \nHe said:\n\n       If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon. And I think every \n     parent in America should be able to understand why it is \n     absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of \n     this. I think all of us have to do some soul searching to \n     figure out how something like this happened.\n\n  That is why I am so pleased that the Justice Department, under the \nsupervision of Attorney General Eric Holder, has announced an \ninvestigation into the avoidable shooting death of Trayvon Martin on \nFebruary 26, 2012. As we all know from the news, an unarmed Martin, 17, \nwas shot in Sanford, FL, on his way home from a convenience store by a \nneighborhood watch volunteer.\n  I am pleased that the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department \nwill join the Federal Bureau of Investigation in investigating the \ntragic, avoidable shooting death of Trayvon Martin. In particular, I \nalso support the Justice Department's decision to send the Community \nRelations Service to Sanford to help defuse tensions while the \ninvestigation is being conducted.\n  I join all Americans in wanting a full and complete investigation \ninto the shooting death of Trayvon Martin to ensure that justice is \nserved. There are many questions we need the Justice Department to \nanswer. One is whether Trayvon was the victim of a hate crime by \nZimmerman. One is whether\n\n[[Page S2041]]\n\nTrayvon was a victim of racial profiling by the police. In other words, \nwas Trayvon targeted by Mr. Zimmerman because he was Black? Was Trayvon \ntreated differently by local law enforcement in their shooting \ninvestigation because he was Black and the aggressor was White? Would \nthe police have acted differently with a White victim and a Black \naggressor?\n  The Department of Justice has the authority to investigate the \npotential hate crime as well as whether this is a pattern or practice \nof misconduct by local law enforcement in terms of applying the law \nequally to all citizens and not discriminating on the basis of race. \nTom Perez is the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights \nDivision of the Department of Justice. I want to make sure we have both \nFederal and State investigations that ultimately prosecute offenders to \nthe fullest extent of the law as well as make any needed policy \nchanges, particularly to local police practices and procedures.\n  Trayvon's tragic death also leads to a discussion of the broader \nissue of racial profiling. I have called for putting an end to racial \nprofiling, a practice that singles out individuals based on race or \nother protected categories. In October of last year, I introduced \nlegislation--the End Racial Profiling Act, S. 1670--that would protect \nminority communities by prohibiting the use of racial profiling by law \nenforcement officials.\n  The bill would prohibit State and local law enforcement officials \nfrom using race as a factor in criminal investigations, including in \n``deciding upon the scope and substance of law enforcement activity \nfollowing the initial investigatory procedure.''\n  The bill would mandate training and provide grants on racial-\nprofiling issues and data collection by local and State law \nenforcement.\n  Finally, the bill would condition the receipt of Federal funds by \nState and local law enforcement on two grounds. First, under this bill, \nState and local law enforcement would have to ``maintain adequate \npolicies and procedures designed to eliminate racial profiling.'' \nSecond, they must ``eliminate any existing practices that permit or \nencourage racial profiling.''\n  The legislation I introduced is supported by the NAACP, the ACLU, the \nRights Working Group, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human \nRights, and numerous other organizations. I look forward to the April \n18 advocacy day these civil rights groups are planning on Capitol Hill \nto lobby on racial-profiling issues and raise awareness about this \nissue and the legislation I have introduced.\n  Racial profiling is bad policy. Given the state of our budgets, it \nalso diverts scarce resources from real law enforcement. Law \nenforcement officials nationwide already have tight budgets. The more \nresources spent on investigating individuals solely because of their \nrace or religion, the fewer resources we have to actually deal with \nillegal behavior.\n  Racial profiling has no place in modern law enforcement. The vast \nmajority of our law enforcement officers who put their lives on the \nline every day handle their job with professionalism, diligence, and \nfidelity to the rule of law. However, Congress and the Justice \nDepartment can and should still take steps to prohibit racial profiling \nand finally root out its use.\n  The 14th amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees equal \nprotection of the law to all Americans. Racial profiling is important \nto that principle and should be ended once and for all. As the late \nSenator Kennedy often said, ``Civil rights is the great unfinished \nbusiness of America.'' Let's continue to fight here to make sure we \ntruly have equal justice under law and equal protection of law as \nguaranteed by our Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2041-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2041-S2042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, today I rise to speak about the subject \nour Nation is focused on as the Supreme Court takes up some of the \nconstitutional provisions of the health care law that was passed a \ncouple of years ago in this body.\n  Obviously, the courts will decide whether the law that was passed is \nconstitutional. There are a number of challenges. That will take place \nby the end of June, according to what we hear.\n  Secondly, there is an election process underway where the candidates \nrunning for the Republican nomination have talked about the things they \nwill do in the event they are elected as it relates to the health care \nbill.\n  I want to talk about the fact that regardless of the Supreme Court \nand regardless of what may happen in the electoral process, I have yet \nto meet a person on either side of the aisle--and maybe today will be \nthe first time--who believes this bill can work as it was passed. What \nthat leads me to say is that regardless of what happens, I think most \nof us are aware that the financial data that was used to put together \nthis bill is flawed, and the fact that it is flawed, it will not work \nover the longer haul.\n  For the same reasons I railed against the highway bill for breaking \nthe Budget Control Act we just put in place last August, I voted \nagainst this bill--the fact that we used 10 years' worth of revenues \nand 6 years' worth of costs, which greatly exacerbates the problem in \nthe outyears; the fact that we took $529 billion in savings from \nMedicare to create this problem and yet left behind the issue we deal \nwith in this body almost every year and a half, which is the \nsustainable growth rate that we deal with with physicians; and then, \nthirdly, the fact that we placed an unfunded mandate on States.\n  The State of Tennessee has actually been highly progressive as it \nrelates to health care. In the State of Tennessee, dealing with \ncitizens who are in need, we created a program called TennCare. It went \nthrough lots of problems but over the last several years has been \nfunctioning in a stable way. But what this bill did was mandate to the \nState of Tennessee that in order to keep the Medicaid funding that \nfunds TennCare, the State has to, on its own accord, match Federal \ngrants with over $1.1 billion in costs. So from 2014 to 2019, what this \nbill does is mandate that the State of Tennessee use $1.1 billion of \nits own resources to expand the Medicaid Program to meet the needs this \nbill has put in place.\n  This is the point of my being on the floor here today. Again, I do \nnot know of anybody here who believes this bill will cost only what was \nlaid out as we debated. As a matter of fact, we have had so many \npeople--the McKenzie Group and others--who have laid out how many \nprivate companies in our country will basically get rid of their health \ncare and put people out on the public exchange. And the cost of that is \ngoing to be tremendous.\n  Our own former Governor, a Democrat, who has spent a lot of his \nlifetime in health care on health care issues, projected that the State \nof Tennessee, if it decided that it wanted to put its own employees out \non the public exchange, could save $160 million--by putting its \nemployees away from its own health care plan and out on the exchanges. \nObviously, I doubt that is something States are going to do. But his \npoint is this: In a free market system, people are going to respond \nbased on what is best for their company and what is best for their \nemployees.\n  If you look at the subsidy levels that this bill lays out--up to 400 \npercent of poverty--they are massive subsidies. We are talking about \npeople who are earning over $78,000 a year. So when you look at the \nsubsidies this bill has put in place, what employers are going to \nquickly find, especially because we put a subsidy in place on the one \nhand and on the other hand, because this bill lays out the type of \ncoverage companies have to have in place--there are attributes that \ncause those costs to rise, and we have already seen that happening \nthroughout our private sector; I think that is undeniable--what is \ngoing to happen is the companies are going to say: We would be better \noff paying the $2,000 penalty. Our employees get these massive \nsubsidies, by the way, that are paid for by all taxpayers in America.\n  What that means is that there are going to be far more people on \nthese public exchanges than ever were anticipated when this bill was \nbeing put in place.\n  My point is that the bill, when it was being constructed, used 10 \nyears' worth of revenues and 6 years' worth of cost, and that made it \nneutral. Anybody can see that in the outyears that is obviously going \nto create a tremendous\n\n[[Page S2042]]\n\nproblem, a fiscal problem for this government, for our country. But the \nproblem is that when it was laid out, the amount of people who were \nthen thought would go on the plan was much lower than is actually going \nto be the case.\n  Again, I think what you are going to see throughout our Nation, if \nthis bill stays in place as it is, is a massive exodus by private \nemployers from the health care business. What that is going to do is \nput them on these public exchanges with the subsidies, and, in fact, \nwhat it is going to do is drive up the cost even more than people ever \nanticipated.\n  So this is my point. There is going to be a Supreme Court judgment \nthis June. None of us knows what it is going to be. We have pundits on \nthe left who say they are confident the bill is going to stay in \nplace. We have pundits on the right who say they are confident, \nconstitutionally, it is going to be overturned. We will have an \nelection in November that may change the course of history as it \nrelates to this bill.\n\n  Even if those two events have no effect on this bill, I wish to come \nback to my base premise, which is that there is no possible way this \nbill is going to work as it was laid out during the debate. There is no \nway the projections that were laid out as to what the cost of this bill \nis going to be are going to be what the actual costs are.\n  What I say is, regardless, this body is going to be pressed with \nreplacing this legislation with something that makes common sense. \nThere was actually a lot of bipartisanship, prior to us passing this \npiece of legislation, about what those commonsense measures should be. \nWe ended up instead with something that was far more sweeping, \nsomething most Americans find offensive, something that, no question, \nwill cause this Nation tremendous fiscal distress.\n  My point is, yes, we are going to be watching this June as the \nSupreme Court rules. Yes, we are going to pay attention to the \nelections in November. Regardless of those outcomes, it is my belief \nthis body will have to come together and put into place a different \npiece of health care legislation that actually fits the times and the \nAmerican people and allows the freedom of choice the people are \naccustomed to and is built on premises that will cause our country to \nbe fiscally sound. I stand ready to work with people on both sides of \nthe aisle when that time comes to make that happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the harsh realities of the health care \nreform law are coming home to roost.\n  My State is bracing for the impact of the so-called affordable care \nact.\n  Under the health care reform law, enrollment under an expanded \nMedicaid Program is projected to increase in my State of Mississippi by \nas much as 44 percent in 2014. Thousands of people will be forced onto \nthe Medicaid rolls. The legislature in my state is wrestling with \nserious budget pressures from the cost of the Medicaid Program.\n  Mississippi has the highest Federal matching assistance percentage in \nthe country at approximately 75 percent. But over the course of the \nnext 10 years, our State match requirement will increase by $127 \nmillion each year for a total of $1.3 billion by the year 2020. Our \nState's budget can't handle that burden. Other States are facing \nsimilar constraints.\n  The affordable care act is essentially taking aim at State \ngovernments. The maintenance-of-effort requirements for the Medicaid \nProgram are particularly restrictive. They inhibit a State's ability to \nspend taxpayer money wisely, and they ignore the inherent problems \nwithin the Medicaid Program. Mississippi faces the prospect of \nexpending all of its resources keeping up with an unfunded mandate that \nincreases its dependency on the Federal Government, while being forced \nto cut other important services, such as education.\n  In addition, physician services cannot keep up with the demands of an \nexpanded Medicaid population. This law does nothing to address the \ndecreasing physician participation rates and quality-of-care issues \nthat are rampant in the Medicaid Program.\n  Another charge to States in these difficult fiscal times is the \ncreation of health insurance exchanges. My State's efforts to develop \nan exchange began well before the affordable care act was enacted, and \nthe State is on track to set up a health insurance exchange by the \nJanuary 2014 deadline. We are committed to creating an exchange that \ncan serve Mississippians well, but the state needs flexibility in order \nto do that. The Mississippi Department of Insurance is working to avoid \ndefaulting to a federally-run exchange, but bureaucratic red tape \nthreatens to hinder their progress. I am concerned that the deadlines \nput forth in the affordable care act are unrealistic due to the amount \nof time and resources that are required for such a large project.\n  These are just a few of the problems the affordable care act poses \nfor my State and others as well. It is proving to be an increasingly \nexpensive statute that is making health care more costly for \nindividuals, businesses, and State governments. It is my hope that \nrelief can be found at the Supreme Court to avoid the potentially \ndevastating impact of this law.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to, or perhaps 1 or 2 minutes over, 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2042-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2042-S2045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this week there is plenty of drama \nunfolding at the Supreme Court, the stately building across the street \nfrom where we now stand. The Justices are deliberating inside the \nbuilding. There is a lot of shouting and clamoring outside. That is to \nbe expected. But I am here today to encourage all of us to pause for a \nminute and to step back from the hype and think about what the broader \nhealth care reform means to so many Americans, not just the citizens \nthe Presiding Officer and I represent but Americans across this \ncountry.\n  I do think, because I believe strongly that the rhetoric surrounding \nthe issues has become so polarizing, many people routinely overlook the \nprofound ways the law has already made life better to so many \nAmericans. Let's remember why we started down this path of health \nreform at all.\n  Let me say for the record this is a path that has been well trodden \nover the years by both Democrats and Republicans--in fact, over the \nlast century--but we had never managed to enact meaningful reform in \nour system. Yes, we added on some extraordinary things such as \nMedicare, Social Security, and Medicaid, but reform of the system we \nhad not done. So we rejoiced in what happened in the mid-1960s, but \nthat doesn't help us in terms of the overall disposition of the system.\n  When we renewed this debate about how to fairly make sure everyone in \nthe country could get the health care they needed, we actually, at the \ntime as we started, had 46 million uninsured Americans. To be uninsured \nis not pleasant; it is a fearful condition. Employers had been dropping \ncoverage for a decade due to skyrocketing health care costs. People \nwere losing their jobs and with them their coverage. Even those who had \ncoverage were being saddled with horrendous bills, and they were thrust \ninto bankruptcy even though many of them thought they had coverage that \nwas protecting them financially. They did not, but they thought they \ndid.\n  Some of those with preexisting conditions could not get back into the \nsystem at any cost whatsoever. Preexisting conditions are something \npeople have--tens and tens of millions of Americans have those.\n  Americans thought our system was broken and unfair, and they thought \nit was time to finally achieve our shared goal of access to care and a \nmore affordable system. That was sensible.\n\n[[Page S2043]]\n\n  Let's start by looking at part of the law that protects those with \npreexisting conditions. As I just mentioned, there are about 133 \nmillion Americans, individual Americans, who live every day with \nchronic illnesses--or they fail to live--because of chronic illnesses.\n  What happens to them when insurance companies refuse to cover their \nillnesses even while the insurance companies are collecting premiums \nfrom them? That is called rescission. It is a dirty trick the insurance \ncompanies have been doing to us in America for years. This law stops \nthat.\n  Before health reform, millions of Americans, including children, \ncould be denied the health care they needed due to a preexisting \ncondition. They might have had asthma. I had asthma until I was 12 \nyears old. I wasn't worried about insurance, I gather, or maybe I \ndidn't get sick, but anyway I couldn't have gotten insurance in those \ndays because I had a preexisting condition.\n  If a woman has a C-section, she has a preexisting condition. If \nsomeone has acne, that person can have a preexisting condition. If \npeople have almost anything, they can have a preexisting condition if \nthe insurance company says they do, so they just cut them off. It is \ncalled rescission. They cut them off even though they are paying \npremiums. That is unfair.\n  I want to talk about what this has meant to real people every day. It \nmeans people have lived in fear of losing their employer-sponsored \ncoverage or even leaving a job to start their own business for fear \nthat they could not get coverage. It meant if somebody did get \ncoverage, the insurance company could just carve out their condition. \nIn other words, they could just get rid of them, dump them.\n  What is the practical implication of this insurance company abuse? \nConsider this: People could get coverage if they had cancer, but the \ncancer would not be covered. Not good. And the preexisting condition \ndoesn't have to be as complex as cancer. Insurance companies could deny \ncoverage for something as simple as allergies.\n  Before health reform, insurance companies could even deny coverage to \na woman if she was a victim of domestic violence and had to be treated. \nThat is unimaginably cruel, but it was a fact.\n  That is no more. Under the health reform law preexisting conditions \nwill no longer be a barrier to quality affordable health care. That is \nover. They cannot do it. It is against the law--the law which so many \nare trying to repeal.\n  Is there anyone here who would like to go back to the old days, those \ngood old days when individuals, including millions of children, were \npunished for things they couldn't possibly control? They were subject \nto devastating medical costs without the benefit of insurance--or their \nfamilies were. I don't think people would want to go back there, but, \nof course, that is what will happen if we abandon all of this.\n  Let's talk now about another piece of this great effort that also is \noften overlooked, and it is the coverage of young adults under the age \nof 26. I know that is a particular matter the Presiding Officer likes \nabout this bill.\n  In the past, many young adults in my State and everywhere have gone \nwithout health insurance as they made their way into the world after \ngraduation. That is a ticklish time. Most of these young adults are not \nslackers, as they have sometimes been called. Many simply start out in \nlow-wage or part-time jobs that typically do not offer health coverage. \nBecause they were over the age of 18, and therefore technically adults, \nthey were not able to maintain coverage under their parents' health \ninsurance plan.\n  This meant many young adults would forfeit basic things such as \ncheckups or put off seeing a doctor when they had health problems in \nthe hope it would go away. But that is no way to live, particularly not \nwhen 15 percent of young Americans suffer from a chronic health \ncondition such as depression or diabetes--yes, that young--and not when \na staggering 76 percent of uninsured adults report not getting needed \ncare because of cost.\n  Before health reform young adults represented one-third of our \nNation's uninsured population. People always think of young people as \nhealthy. Not so. They take risks. They end up in the emergency room \noften. Think about how many young adults and their families are so much \nin a better position. Why is that? That is because the law now allows \nyoung adults, with no coverage of their own, to pay premiums and to \nstay on their parents' health insurance policy up to their 26th \nbirthday. This applies even if they no longer live at home, if they are \nno longer a student or they are no longer dependents on their parents' \ntax returns. In other words, they have coverage up to the age of 26.\n\n  As a result, over 2.5 million young adults gained coverage they did \nnot have before--that is a fact today--including more than 16,000 young \nadults in West Virginia. Those families have the peace of mind that \ntheir families will be financially protected should an injury or an \nillness occur.\n  It is important to know that young people suffer a lot of mental \nhealth conditions, maybe a little bit more than the rest of the \npopulation. We don't think about that because they are young and \ntherefore always ebullient. No, they are young and often troubled, \ntrying to figure out what life holds for them. These conditions cause \nthem problems, they need insurance, and they can get it.\n  So right off the bat, parents such as Sam Hickman from West Virginia \nare able to get young adult coverage. Isn't our country a better \nplace--it would seem to me--when people have the security of knowing \nthey are covered in case of illness or injury. To me, it just makes \nsense; maybe more important, to the people it brings peace of mind.\n  It is not all. The law provides access to free preventive health \nservices and easier primary care, as well as increased financial \nassistance for students through new scholarships and loan repayment \nprograms to build a stronger health care workforce. That is a major \npart of this bill.\n  In West Virginia, as the Presiding Officer knows, and all across the \ncountry, particularly in rural areas, we have a shortage of various \nkinds of necessary physicians and health care providers. In fact, one \nof my favorite parts of this law is the significant new financial \nincentives it creates to encourage young adults to go into primary \ncare--dentistry, pediatrics, nursing, and mental health--to precisely \naddress those shortages. It is in the bill.\n  Doesn't it make sense, given the shortage of skilled health care \nprofessionals in this country, to make it easier for young people to \nget into those well-paying stable jobs?\n  Health care job growth continues to be a major stabilizing factor in \nour economy. Creating additional jobs in our local communities is \nsomething many in this body have fought for in all kinds of ways--tax \ncredits and plans and all kinds of things--but in the meantime, health \nreform tackles that problem too, just inexorably. Health care jobs \ncontinue to grow year after year, most of them private, obviously.\n  Just look at the numbers from the month of February of this year. The \nhealth care sector once again led the Nation's job growth last month, \nadding about 49,000 jobs, which was about the same as the month before. \nHealth care is the economic engine--in fact, it kind of undergirds our \neconomy. It is silent, it is relentless, and it will not stop because \nhealth care is something people cannot walk away from--the receiving of \nor the providing for.\n  Another important group helped by health care reform is our Nation's \nseniors, starting with lowering the cost of their Medicare prescription \ndrug coverage. That is very important in West Virginia, as the \nPresiding Officer knows. Thanks to the new health care law almost \n40,000 people with Medicare in West Virginia received a $250 rebate--\nthey have already got it--to help cover the cost of their prescription \ndrugs when they hit that famous doughnut hole in 2010. I will not \nbother to explain that.\n  In 2011, more than 36,000 West Virginians with Medicare received a \n50-percent discount on their covered brand-name prescription drugs when \nthey hit the doughnut hole. That is called very good news. Then we go \non to close the doughnut hole entirely.\n  This discount I am talking of resulted in an average savings of $653 \nper person and a total savings of over $23.5 million in our State of \nWest Virginia. By 2020, the law will close the doughnut hole \ncompletely, and I think that is rather sensational news for seniors.\n\n[[Page S2044]]\n\n  Closing the doughnut hole is not all this law does for seniors. Under \nthe new law, seniors can receive recommended preventive services. We \ntalk about that all the time, and we always think it is not in a \nbill. Preventive services such as flu shots, diabetes screening, as \nwell as new annual wellness visits--all things seniors should do but \noften decline to do because of lack of access or thinking they have to \npay for it and they don't have the money. So now they can get all of \nthese screenings for diabetes and flu shots and all kinds of other \nthings for free. So far, more than 32.5 million seniors nationwide have \nalready received one or more free preventive services, including the \nnew, as I indicated, annual wellness visit, which is a very good idea \nfor any person.\n\n  In 2011 more than 230,000 people with Medicare in West Virginia \nreceived free preventive services such as mammograms, colonoscopies, or \na free annual wellness visit with a doctor, and 54 million Americans \nwith private health insurance gained preventive service coverage with \nno cost sharing, including 300,000 people in the State of West \nVirginia.\n  The new law also provides new grants and incentives to improve health \ncare coordination and quality, as well as a new office, the Federal \nCoordinated Health Care Office. We have to have that. I kind of wish we \ndidn't have to, but we do because it is a new science. This is trying \nto get away from the health care system as usual, so we do have that \none little addition, sort of managing care for seniors and managing \ncare for individuals with disabilities and, importantly, eligible for \nboth Medicare and Medicaid. Those, obviously, are known as our dual-\neligibles: those who are poor enough to be on Medicaid and old enough \nto be on Medicare, so they can't afford life, so to speak. They need \nhelp and they need health care, and under this bill they get that. \nThere are about 8, 9, 10, 11 million of them in this country.\n  Many doctors, many hospitals, and many other providers are taking \nadvantage of the new options to help them work better as teams to \nprovide the highest quality care possible. That is called coordinated \ncare. It is new, it is important, and it is going to be really helpful. \nThat is good news because many chronic illnesses can be prevented or \nmanaged better through this coordinated care. It means doctors actually \ntalk to each other.\n  The way it is now, when a patient gets an x ray taken by a dentist or \nby somebody else, the patient has to carry the x ray with them--if they \ncan manage to get their hands on it--to go see another doctor, as \nopposed to a system, such as telemedicine, which has the technology to \nshoot the information over the Internet so the next doctor already has \nit, so he or some of his people are thinking about what they are going \nto do next. It is so important to talk to each other, but we don't. \nDoctors and hospitals often operate as if in a vacuum, sort of taking \nit on a case-by-case basis. That is bad for patients.\n  The health care law also helps stop fraud with tougher screening \nprocedures and stronger penalties and new technology. New technology \ncan catch all kinds of things. Thanks in part to these efforts, we \nrecovered $4.1 billion in taxpayer dollars in 2011. That was last year. \nThe second year's recovery hit this recordbreaking level also. West \nVirginia tax dollars should not go to pay for criminals who are \ndefrauding the system, and the administration is cracking down on this. \nBelieve it or not, it is.\n  And I am not done. In just over 18 months, a new competitive health \ninsurance marketplace called an exchange--which has everybody nervous \nfor no reason at all; it is great news--will be up and running in West \nVirginia and all across the country where individuals and small \nbusinesses can shop for coverage in the private health insurance \nmarket. This is not government; it is all private. An estimated 180,000 \nWest Virginians will be eligible for $687 million in premium tax \ncredits to help cover the cost of private health insurance in the year \n2014 when the exchanges start.\n  Families all over the country will finally have more power when it \ncomes to buying health insurance that works for them--having more power \nis a big deal if you are trying to shop for health insurance--thanks to \na clear, transparent summary of benefits. Yes, you actually get to see \nthe choices from which you can pick. You have a list of all the \nservices they are going to provide. It is required by law. They can't \ncheat. They can't just say: Oh, we will take care of you. Sign up with \nus. We are a big insurance company.\n  So they get the transparent summary of benefits and coverage that \nwill let them compare benefits on an apples-to-apples basis, which will \ncome standard with every single private insurance plan, which will be \nwhat makes up the exchanges. They will go through that, and they will \npick out what best suits them.\n  In fact, it is quite telling that this little-known provision I have \njust talked about is the single most popular one in the entire law. I \ndidn't know that. Eighty-four percent of Americans think that is really \ngood. They like the idea of being able to choose what they are going to \nget in health care coverage. The insurance companies, of course, hate \nit and have been fighting with everything they have, but we have been \nbeating it back, Mr. President, as you would expect me to do.\n  What that tells me is that people are frustrated and fed up with the \nconfusing information they have been getting from their health \ninsurance companies, and they are tired of guessing games about what is \nactually covered. They have a right to know, and now they can. So I \nlook forward to September of this year when every insurance company \nfinally has to come clean about what benefits are actually covered and \nthe products they are selling. It will be there in black and white. \nThey can read it, and families will obviously have much more purchasing \npower in their hands.\n\n  What is wrong with that?\n  While opponents have gotten used to talking about how the law costs \ntoo much, in fact, it has great provisions that will not only improve \nthe quality of care but also save hundreds of billions of dollars--yes, \nthat is true--for example, the average $2,500 discount thousands of \nWest Virginia small businesses received last December as a result of \nthe medical loss ratio rule. That was what followed the public option. \nEverybody so loved the public option. They thought it was wonderful. \nThe only problem is that it could not get votes from the Finance \nCommittee, so it could not come down here and we could not do anything \nabout it, so we invented the medical loss ratio. It is totally \nunderstandable, right? The question is, How does it work? Does it help \npeople? And it does because it says that health insurance companies are \nrequired to spend at least 80 percent of small businesses' and 85 \npercent of large businesses' health insurance premium dollars on actual \nmedical care--not on administration, not on marble pillars, not on CEO \nsalaries and all of that. They have 20 percent or 15 percent to do all \nof that. But if they fail to do that, they have to rebate to the \nconsumer, to the patient who has been paying the premiums, the fact \nthat they have not been abiding by this 80 percent or 85 percent law, \nand that is probably going to be several billions of dollars--at the \nvery least, hundreds and hundreds of millions, and that is kind of like \nbillions--and it starts this year. I am delighted.\n  Now, the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, is another \nexample. IPAB is not well understood and therefore not well received. \nWhat is not understood is generally not well received. That doesn't \nmean it is not good. IPAB will be made up of smart doctors, nurses, and \nother health care experts who will figure out ways to improve the \nquality of Medicare services and make sure the Medicare trust fund \nstays strong. And IPAB is legally forbidden in this law--which the \nfolks across the street are now considering--from recommending cuts to \nMedicare benefits or in any way increasing cost sharing on the part of \nMedicare recipients. That is in the law--cannot cut benefits, no cost \nsharing.\n  Yet the House just last week rallied behind an effort to repeal IPAB. \nThey didn't know what it was or they had really bad dreams about what \nit was, so they repealed it and felt better. The House vote is a good \nexample of what happens when special interest wins and seniors lose.\n  The Independent Payment Advisory Board was created to protect \nMedicare for seniors by improving the quality of\n\n[[Page S2045]]\n\nMedicare services and by extending the life of Medicare for years to \ncome. Instead of making Medicare better, House Republicans want to \ndecimate the program and force seniors to pay much more and give \nprivate health insurance companies and other special interests the \nauthority to raid the Medicare trust fund, which they will do in order \nto pad their bottom line, which they would love to do. This would take \nus exactly in the wrong direction. Every single senior in America \nshould be outraged.\n  You can even get simple things like better information about private \nhealth insurance by just going to the Web site healthcare.gov. The \ninformation is out there to help people shop for better coverage today.\n  There is so much more that has already happened and more to come, \nsuch as the nearly $70 million in grants West Virginia has already \nreceived for things like community health centers. We put aside $10 \nbillion in the bill for maybe up to 1,000 new rural health care clinics \nacross America. As the Presiding Officer knows, in places such as \nLincoln County in West Virginia, people don't want to go to hospitals, \nbut they will go to clinics happily because they are on the first \nfloor, tend to be in buildings that used to be stores or whatever, and \nthey get good medical care right there.\n  In closing, why would we want to throw this law out the window \nknowing just these facts? Think about it. The reforms here are the most \nsignificant reforms in health care in several generations. It is an \neffort that 50 years from now history will record the same way we do \nSocial Security or Medicare Programs--as an essential part of the \nimplicit promise to care for its citizens, to allow people to age with \ndignity, and to find ways to make our society a better place.\n  So as we mark the 2-year anniversary of the health care reform law \nbecoming the law of the land--and the folks across the street will \ndecide if that stands up or not, but I think they will--I, for one, am \nproud of my role in its passage and grateful that Congress came \ntogether on such a historic issue.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I will address the bill that will be before \nus later today.\n  The title of the bill is ``Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act.'' I \nthink that title begs the question: What is a tax subsidy? Most \nAmericans would define a tax subsidy as a payment of cash, such as \nthrough a tax credit, from the government to a particular industry. \nDoes this bill address subsidies? The answer is, absolutely. But \ninstead of repealing tax subsidies, it actually creates more of them.\n  Under this bill, the government would subsidize particular industries \nor activities through a host of tax credits. These subsidies range from \ntax credits for energy-efficient homes, alternative fuel vehicles, \nplug-in electric vehicles, cellulosic biofuels, wind energy production, \nbiodiesel and renewable diesel, and the list goes on and on. In other \nwords, the Tax Code would be providing special tax breaks for specific \nindustries, and the one thing that is common to all these is that they \nare the so-called green energies. They are the ones that would receive \nthe special tax treatment, to the tune of $12 billion. There are even \ndirect cash grants from the Treasury Department for industries that \ninvest in green energy so companies don't have to worry about whether \nthey have a tax liability to take advantage--direct cash grants. These \nare clearly subsidies aimed at particular industries, the very thing \nthe President himself has said we should avoid if we want a simpler Tax \nCode with lower rates that doesn't pick winners and losers.\n  So, yes, this bill deals with tax subsidies. It creates a bunch of \nthem, and they are in a very specific area--$12 billion worth.\n  What about oil and gas? It turns out there are no special tax \nprovisions for oil and gas. There is no special oil and gas loophole or \ngiveaway, as somebody called it. Oil and gas companies use the same IRS \nCode other kinds of companies use. They pay taxes under those \nprovisions. They get deductions or credits under some other of those \nprovisions but nothing that doesn't apply to other industries the same \nway. In fact, what this bill does is to take away the rights of oil and \ngas companies under some of these provisions and leave those provisions \nintact for others. In other words, it discriminates against specific \ncompanies within a specific industry.\n  There are four particular areas. The first is section 199 of the Tax \nCode. This is the basic code under which all producers--people who \nmanufacture things, who produce things--are allowed to take what is \ncalled a manufacturing deduction of 9 percent, except we have already \ndiscriminated against the oil companies. They can only take a deduction \nof 6 percent, but it is the same for the other industries; otherwise, \nit is 9 percent. But this bill would eliminate that deduction \naltogether for the larger oil and gas companies--the so-called \nintegrated companies--but not for other domestic producers. So it is \ndiscriminatory twice over. Remarkably, therefore, companies such as the \nVenezuelan company, CITGO--a large oil and gas producer--could continue \nto take the deduction, but U.S.-based companies could not.\n  How is that for double discrimination. First, all other companies in \nthe country get to deduct 9 percent, big oil companies only get to \ndeduct 6 percent, and this bill would eliminate that deduction for some \nof the American oil producers.\n  How about intangible drilling costs. This is part of the so-called \nR research and development--tax treatment. Research and \ndevelopment is something many businesses do, and when they do it, they \nget to deduct those costs as against their tax liability. For the oil \nand gas industry, the research and development is called intangible \ndrilling costs. Those are part of the R exploration for energy.\n  Again, the oil companies are actually already discriminated against; \nwhereas, other businesses can expense 100 percent of these R costs; \nlarge oil and gas companies, as I have said, can only expense 70 \npercent. So they are already being discriminated against, to some \nextent. This bill would further discriminate against them by \neliminating the expensing altogether. In other words, whereas most \ncompanies can expense 100 percent and smaller oil and gas companies \ncould still expense 100 percent, these larger companies could no longer \nexpense any of it. Their current-year deduction would be gone.\n  The third area is for businesses that have operations abroad that pay \nboth taxes and royalties. They are called dual capacity companies. \nThere are a lot of dual capacity kinds of businesses. Oil and gas is \none of them because they pay both taxes and royalties; casino operators \nare another, to give another example. In order to prevent double \ntaxation for American companies that pay both foreign taxes and \nAmerican taxes--and obviously they are competing against companies that \nonly pay taxes once--in order to mitigate that, every American company, \nwhether it is an oil company or any other kind of company, is allowed \nto take a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes paid. So whatever their \nAmerican tax liability is, they get to take a credit against that for \nwhat they have already paid to another country in tax liability there.\n  If they owe $100 in taxes and they have already paid Great Britain \n$70 in taxes, then they get to take a credit of that $70 against the \n$100 American liability. That is the way it works for all businesses \nabroad, including the dual capacity taxpayers.\n  This bill would eliminate part of the foreign tax credit for the \nlarge integrated oil and gas companies; therefore, putting our \ncompanies at a severe disadvantage with other oil and gas\n\n[[Page S2046]]\n\ncompanies doing business around the world. Of course, oil and gas \nbusiness is all around the world. They go where the oil or the gas is \nand extract it and then ship it to the user. Why would we deliberately \ngive foreign competitors an even greater advantage in foreign markets \nthan they already enjoy? As I said, this bill singles out oil and gas \ncompanies and would not extend the same discriminatory treatment to \nother dual capacity taxpayers such as, as I mentioned before, casinos. \nAgain, it is a double discrimination against oil and gas companies.\n  Finally, we have what is called percentage depletion. Every company, \nincluding oil and gas companies, that extracts minerals from the Earth \nor other substances from the Earth is allowed to use the percentage \ndepletion method for calculating their taxes. But, again, for the last \n30 years, the large integrated oil and gas companies can't do it. So \nthey are already prohibited from using this method. This bill repeals \nit again, so we are going to repeal something that has already been \nrepealed. I guess that is OK. It is not necessary. I guess it is a way \nto further kick somebody in the rear end if we don't like them.\n  The question is, therefore, why should we be doing this to oil and \ngas companies? The Wall Street Journal pointed out in a recent \neditorial--by the way, the title is ``Big Oil, Bigger Taxes''--that the \noil and gas industry is subsidizing the government, not the other way \naround. Because of the amount of taxes oil companies pay--far more than \nother companies--they are actually subsidizing the U.S. Government. Oil \nand gas companies paid almost $36 billion in taxes in 2009 alone. That \nis just one industry--the oil and gas companies--$36 billion. According \nto American Petroleum Institute figures, oil and gas companies had an \naverage effective tax rate of 41 percent in 2010 and paid more in total \ntaxes than any other industry.\n  For those folks who somehow suggest oil and gas is getting some big \nbreak, that they are not paying their fair share in taxes, this \nevidence clearly refutes that. We will remember the President's Buffet \nrule: Everybody should pay at least 30 percent in taxes. Oil and gas \ncompanies already pay at the rate of 41 percent, so it is not as if \nthey are getting off with some kind of special break.\n  Generally, our Tax Code allows companies to recover their expenses. \nIt allows businesses, including oil and gas businesses, to recover \ntheir costs of doing business. As I said before, the oil and gas \nindustry is already discriminated against. They can't recover all their \ncosts. Under section 199, for example, other companies get to deduct 9 \npercent; they can only deduct 6 percent. This bill would also remove \nprovisions that allow them to expense. So the code which already treats \nthem the same or worse than other industries would now treat them \nsubstantially worse.\n  Yes, of course, oil and gas companies have profits and, in some \ncases, they are large profits. But they are large in scale--their \nbusinesses are large in scale--because they have to be in order to \ncompete. It costs billions of dollars just to invest in one oil rig out \nin the Gulf of Mexico, for example. According to industry estimates, it \ncosts between $1.3 billion and $5.7 billion to produce oil in one \ndeepwater platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Think about it: If someone is \nmaking $200 a year, obviously, they can't do that. It takes companies \nthat make an enormous amount of money to spend $5 billion on one oil \nplatform to try to find oil and gas. Don't we want companies such as \nthat to find oil and gas so we can get more of it on the market so we \ndon't have to pay as much when we try to fill our car at the pump?\n  What would happen if we used the Tax Code to further penalize oil and \ngas companies with these massive tax increases? Does anybody think the \ncosts aren't going to be passed on?\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, tax increases such \nas the ones in the bill ``would make oil and natural gas more expensive \nfor U.S. consumers and likely increase foreign dependence.''\n  Everybody talks about reducing the price of gas at the pump and \nreducing U.S. dependence. What these tax increases would do is to \nfurther that dependence and increase the prices at the pump. This isn't \nlike shooting ourselves in the foot; it is like shooting ourselves in \nthe head. Why would we do this? We would have less domestic energy \nproduction. Obviously, taxing an activity more means we will get less \nof it.\n  How about jobs? The oil and gas industry supports more than 9 million \nAmerican jobs. The American Petroleum Institute estimates that 1 \nmillion new jobs could be created in the next 7 years if punitive new \ntax increases and unnecessary new regulations are avoided. We \ndesperately need to create jobs. These are good American jobs. Why \nwould we want to destroy jobs by imposing an unfair tax on an industry \nwhich is producing something we desperately need?\n  Foreign oil companies, such as those based in Russia and China and \nVenezuela, would have an even greater competitive advantage over \nAmerican companies in these overseas markets if we impose these taxes \non American companies.\n  Finally, we would hurt tens of millions of Americans who invest in \nthese companies through pension funds, retirement accounts, and mutual \nfunds. In other words, this bill would eliminate tax provisions that \nare not giveaways or subsidies to producers in the United States in \norder to pay for tax subsidies that would be given to specially chosen \nindustries--so-called green industries. In the process, we would get \nhigher fuel prices for consumers, less domestic oil and gas production, \nmore dependence on foreign oil, fewer jobs, less American \ncompetitiveness, and less retirement saving. This does not sound like a \ndeal worth making.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. HELLER. Mr. President, here we go again. Once again, Washington \nis doing its old familiar song and dance: pushing another measure that \nis big on talking points but very light on solutions.\n  The truth is, the measure we are debating will not help anyone \nstruggling with rising gas prices. It is past time for Congress to get \nto work on solving our Nation's most pressing issues.\n  Nevadans have already been hit hard by this economic downturn. Gas \nprices are only making a tough situation worse. Congress should do \neverything within its power to provide relief to Americans who are \nalready struggling to make ends meet.\n  In Las Vegas, the average price of gas is $3.93 a gallon. Up north in \nReno, gas prices are already more than $4 a gallon. In the rural town \nof Elko, the local newspaper recently reported that gas prices have \nincreased by 48 cents in the last month.\n  I received a text message recently from a prominent businessman in my \nState. He wrote:\n\n       Regular gas at $4.56 per gallon in southern California--\n     beginning to really affect our businesses.\n\n  This is an issue Congress has ignored for far too long. Instead of \naddressing gas prices, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nretreating to failed policy in hopes of distracting Americans from the \ndramatic price and rise of prices at the pump. They are merely \nfollowing the lead of this administration, whose own Secretary of \nEnergy statements before Congress indicated that their overall energy \ngoal is not to lower gas prices.\n  Unfortunately, my colleagues fail to understand what the American \npeople have understood all along; that is, to have a healthy economy, \nwe need affordable energy. Developing domestic energy resources and \nbuilding the infrastructure to get it to market will not only create \njobs, but it will bring more energy resources to market.\n  Nevada still has the unfortunate distinction of leading the Nation in \nboth unemployment and foreclosures. Whether you live in the vast \nexpanse of rural Nevada or in urban Las Vegas, high gasoline prices \ndisproportionately impact my home State.\n  The current state of our economy and the rising gas prices represent \nan extreme blow to many sectors of Nevada's economy, tourism in \nparticular. Tourism and the jobs dependent on that industry will be \nfurther devastated as gas prices increase at a time when Nevadans are \nhurting most.\n  Additionally, Nevada is roughly 110,000 square miles. High gas prices \nmean more vacant hotel rooms. It\n\n[[Page S2047]]\n\nmeans more empty restaurants. It means more closed small businesses. \nMany of my constituents must travel great distances to work or for \nbasic goods and services. At a time when middle-class families across \nNevada have already been forced to tighten their belts, the last thing \nthey need is to feel the squeeze of higher gas prices.\n  In Nevada we need jobs, not policies that make job creation more \ndifficult. I believe continuing to develop renewable and alternative \nsources is important to Nevada for the clean energy and job creation it \nbrings. The development of renewable energy is something I have long \nadvocated. However, our Nation must have a diverse energy strategy.\n  A truly comprehensive approach to our domestic energy security will \ncreate jobs and improve our economy. We must develop all of our \nresources, and I would argue that the positive impact increased \ndomestic production would have on our economy in terms of jobs and \nrevenue would actually facilitate the development of the technologies \nof the future.\n  There is no doubt alternative sources of energy are our future. While \nwe work to develop and perfect those technologies, we need to secure \nour economy now by having an energy policy that respects the cause of \nthe problem; that is, supply and demand.\n  What concerns me is we are not debating a bill that today provides \nsolutions. Today's debate is about a bill that is merely two failed \npolicies repackaged as a political stunt. Congress should not double \ndown on failed stimulus programs that have put Nevadans out of work and \nhave done little to salvage our economy. Americans do not want more \npolitical gimmicks. They want solutions. What Congress needs to focus \non are policies that will lower gas prices for Americans and fuel job \ncreation.\n  For this reason, I have authored an amendment to this legislation \nthat is truly a compromise containing solutions to the issues we are \nfacing today. My amendment, the Gas Price Relief Act, would relieve gas \nprices at the pump, increase domestic energy production, and close tax \nloopholes.\n  Under the Gas Price Relief Act, every American who drives a car will \nreap the benefit of tax relief. My legislation closes tax loopholes for \nthe major integrated oil companies and cuts the gas tax while ensuring \nrevenue is still being delivered to the highway trust fund.\n  My amendment also provides for domestic energy production and \ninfrastructure, which will create jobs and at the same time increase \nsupply. It is truly a commonsense ``all of the above'' strategy to \nprovide for the development of our domestic energy resources in order \nto meet our energy needs.\n  It is imperative Washington takes on our Nation's most pressing \nissues, not simply instigate partisan fights. Washington should not \ncontinue to play politics with America's paychecks. The longer Congress \ndelays making tough decisions the more people in Nevada and across our \nNation suffer.\n  In my home State of Nevada, gas prices have more than doubled since \n2009. Higher energy costs impact every aspect of life: from the cost of \nfood and clothing to virtually every good and service on which we rely.\n  Expanding domestic energy production, improving our energy \ninfrastructure, and passing savings along to the American people are \nthe right objectives to meet our Nation's immediate and future energy \nneeds.\n  Let's move beyond the partisan fights of today and start producing \nthe results Nevadans and all Americans are asking for.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss gas prices. Gas \nprices have doubled under this President, so today this body will \nconsider new legislation which the other side, I assume, thinks will \nmake the situation better. But their solution is to raise taxes on oil \ncompanies--raise taxes by $25 billion.\n  Any of you who have a business know when we raise taxes on a \nbusiness, it simply is a cost to doing business. When your costs \nincrease for making your product, what do you do? You charge your \nconsumer more.\n  So I am not sure what person is advising the other side, but I do not \nquite understand how raising $25 billion worth of cost on the oil \nindustry is going to help gas prices. In fact, I think it is going to \nsend gas prices even higher.\n  Some on the other side say: Oh, this is a matter of fairness; \neverybody needs to pay their fair share. Well, oil companies actually \npay $86 million a day in taxes. In the last 10 years the oil companies \nhave paid over $100 billion in taxes. And the people who say, well, we \nmust punish them; they are making too much money; let's punish them, \nwell, the oil companies employ 9.2 million people. They are 8 percent \nof our GDP. Do we want to punish the people who are creating jobs, the \npeople who are trying to make us energy independent in our country? It \nmakes absolutely no sense.\n  Some will argue, well, we need to make the Tax Code fair, and the oil \ncompanies have special exemptions. Well, guess what. These exemptions \nand business deductions apply to other businesses. But they just want \nto take them away from one of our successful industries. It seems to \nme, if an industry is successful and creates 9.2 million jobs, instead \nof punishing them we should want to encourage them. I would think we \nwould want to say to the oil companies: What obstacles are there to you \nmaking more money and hiring more people? Instead they say: No, we must \npunish them. We must tax them more to make things fair.\n  This whole debate about fairness is so misguided and it has gotten \nout of hand. The rich in our society do pay the vast majority of our \ntaxes. Do not let them tell you otherwise. Those who make over $200,000 \na year pay 70 percent of the income tax. Those who make more than \n$70,000 a year pay about 96 percent of the income tax. And 47 percent \nof our public do not pay an income tax. So those who are saying the \nrich are not paying their fair share are trying to use envy and class \nwarfare to get people stirred up. But it makes absolutely no sense.\n  We as a society need to glorify those who make a profit and those who \nemploy people. We need to encourage more business in this country. The \noil companies employ 9.2 million people. We do not need to heap \npunishment on them. We need to give them encouragement to employ more \npeople.\n  I will have two amendments to this bill that I think would actually \nmake it better. While the President talks about people not paying their \nfair share, he is actually giving more than their fair share to his \nfriends. I do not think the government should be used as a loan agency \nto give money to contributors. This is unseemly. I think the conflict \nof interest is undeniable.\n  We have companies such as Solyndra. This is a company that received \n$500 million of your money and went bankrupt. It just so happened that \nthe owner of the company is the 20th richest man in the United States \nand a big donor of the President. It just so happens that this company, \nSolyndra, the person who approved their loan was related, was the \nhusband, of a woman who worked for Solyndra.\n  Another company, a company called BrightSource out of Massachusetts, \nis owned by a member of the Kennedy family. They got $1.8 billion. \nGuess who approved their loan. A guy who used to work for the Kennedys \nwho is now in President Obama's administration. It does not pass the \nsmell test. What we have is crony capitalism or crony governmentalism \nwhere the government is picking out their friends and giving money to \ntheir friends.\n  So we come here today to raise taxes on Big Oil. Meanwhile, we are \ngiving money to millionaires and billionaires, and it does not seem \nright that your tax dollars should be sent to companies simply because \nthey were big contributors.\n  Another company, Fisker Karma, got $500 million supposedly to make an \nelectric car in the United States. Guess where they are making it. In \nFinland. We sent money to Solyndra through international banks, through \nthe Ex-\n\n[[Page S2048]]\n\nIm Bank. We sent money to First Solar through the Ex-Im Bank. Do you \nknow what their money was for? Their money was given to them so they \ncould buy their own products. The company bought a subsidiary in \nCanada. We gave money to the company in the United States and let them \nbuy their own products with your money. It makes absolutely no sense. \nSo I have two proposals.\n  One amendment to this bill would say. Look, if you think some \ncompanies are getting unfair deductions, let's get rid of all \ndeductions. Let's just have a flat tax. Let's make the corporate income \ntax 17 percent. Currently it is 35 percent.\n  So if we want to encourage business, if we want to encourage \nemployment, lower taxes; do not raise taxes. Canada has an income tax \nfor their corporations of 17 percent. Most of Europe is in the low 20s, \nand we are at 35 percent. We wonder why we cannot get business started \nin this country. We wonder why there is billions, even trillions of \ndollars, left overseas that will not come home because we want to \ncharge them a 35-percent tax when it comes home.\n  Our bill would also say: If you have already paid taxes overseas \nonce, you do not have to pay again when you come home. So a 17-percent \nflat tax. We would see a boom in this country like we have not seen in \na generation. We would see millions of jobs being created if we would \njust learn the basic facts of economics. If we punish a company, we \nwill have less jobs. If we encourage a company by giving them more tax \nbreaks, we will have more jobs. Taxes are a cost.\n  If this bill passes, not only will our gas prices continue to rise--\nthey have already doubled--but we will see our gas prices going through \nthe roof. But then again there are people in this administration who do \nnot even drive a car. They do not understand the price of gas because \nthey do not have to drive a car. Someone picks them up in a limousine. \nThe thing is, they need to go to the pump. They need to see how much we \nare spending on gas. They need to see what they are doing to this \ncountry and what they are doing to the job market.\n\n  I have a second amendment to this bill that would take all of this \nmoney, all of these loans they are giving to their buddies--the \nSolyndra loans, the Fisker Karma loans, the First Solar loan--all of \nthis money that is being dispensed to people who are large contributors \nof the President, we would take that loan program and eliminate it. \nWhen we eliminate that loan program, we would save nearly $30 billion. \nThe GAO has said as much as $6 billion is at risk for loss now. If we \nwere to eliminate that money, we could put half toward the debt and \nthen put half toward rebuilding our infrastructure.\n  The President says he wants to rebuild our bridges. He came to my \nState. I stood on a bridge with him and said I would help. But the way \nto help is by not passing out dollars to friends that are being lost by \nthe billions of dollars. We cannot simply create the money; let's find \nthe money.\n  So I propose to end the Department of Energy loans and take that \nmoney, put half of it against the debt, and put half of that into \nrepairing or replacing our bridges. This is how government should work. \nWe should pick priorities. There is not an unlimited amount of money. \nSo let's take it from an area where it is prone to corruption and where \nit is prone to a conflict of interest--these alternative energy loans \nthat seem to be going mostly to the President's friends and political \ncampaign contributors, let's take that money and use it to repair the \nbridges and to pay down the debt. This is what responsible government \nshould do. But what we are doing in this body, what will happen in the \nnext 24 hours as we discuss this bill is--and everybody in America \nneeds to be very clear about this--when they go to the gas pump and pay \nmore every day for gasoline, they need to realize where the \nresponsibility lies.\n  The responsibility lies with those who are running up the debt, and \nas we pay for the debt we print new money. So gas prices rising means \nthe value of the dollar is shrinking. That is why prices are rising. We \nneed to realize who is to blame for the gas prices. It is those who are \nrunning up the debt. But we also have to realize it is even worse than \nthat. It is not just the running up of the debt, we have to realize \nthese people today now want to add $25 billion to the gas prices. That \nis what happens.\n  When we raise the taxes on the oil companies we will add $25 billion \nin taxes, but we will increase their cost by $25 billion. Any business \nthat sells products simply passes that on to the consumer.\n  So what we are here about--and they should retitle their bill--since \nthey are willing to, by this legislation, increase gas prices, it \nshould be called ``the bill to raise your gas prices.''\n  So what I would ask this body to do is to consider two amendments \nthat would actually lower the debt and take money away from crony \ncapitalism and another one that would reform the Tax Code to eliminate \ndeductions and discrepancies within the Tax Code, but to do it by \nlowering the tax rate, flattening the tax rate, and allowing businesses \nto succeed in our country.\n  It gets down to whom do you want to represent you in Washington, DC? \nDo you want a party that basically wants to punish business, those who \nare creating jobs, or do you want a party that wants to encourage \nbusiness?\n  We are in the midst of a great recession. Until we understand this \nfundamental fact, we are not going to recover as a nation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, what we are seeing in the Senate this \nweek is exhibit A in what the American people just don't like about \nCongress. Gas prices have more than doubled under President Obama and \nthe Democratic control of the Senate. This is an issue that affects \nevery single American and drives up the cost of everything from \ncommuting to groceries.\n  What is the Democratic response? Well, it is legislation that even \nthey admit won't do a thing to lower the price of gas at the pump. We \nhave seven Democratic Senators on record saying this bill doesn't do a \nthing to lower gas prices. One of them has actually called it \nlaughable. Yet that is what they are proposing here this week\n\n[[Page S2049]]\n\nat a time when gas prices are at a national average of nearly $4 a \ngallon. This is what passes for a response to high gas prices for \nWashington Democrats--a bill that does nothing about it. I cannot think \nof a better way to illustrate how totally out of touch and \nirresponsible the Democratic majority has become.\n  Look, Democrats know they have to say something about this issue, so \nwhat they are doing is taking a page out of the President's playbook \nand blaming somebody else. That is what this entire exercise is about--\nblaming somebody else--and, frankly, the American people are tired of \nit.\n  If Democrats don't want to do anything to lower gas prices, just go \nahead and admit it. If Senate Democrats don't have any interest in \nlowering gas prices, then just say so, but don't waste the public's \ntime by using the Senate floor to talk up a piece of legislation the \nonly purpose of which is to convince people that you do. If the \nPresident doesn't want the Keystone Pipeline, why doesn't he just admit \nit? But don't insult the public by showing up for a ribbon cutting--for \none part of it that you had nothing to do with while lobbying against \nthe most important part at the same time.\n  Americans are tired of the political games and double-talk on this \nissue. They are tired of the constant campaign. They sent us here to \nactually fix problems, not to avoid them, and on this issue there is a \nlot we could be doing to make things a whole lot better. So Republicans \nare happy to use this opportunity to talk about some of those things. \nWho knows. Maybe more Democrats will decide it is long past time they \njoined us in actually supporting and approving some of these proposals. \nBut we are never going to solve the problems we face if Democrats \ninsist on using the Senate to make some political point instead of \nactually making a difference in the lives of working Americans at a \nmoment of urgency like this. And we are certainly not going to make a \ndifference if we keep sort of flitting from one issue to another.\n  We are now hearing that the Democrats want to move off this tax-hike \nlegislation--maybe it didn't make the intended political point as \nforcefully as they wanted--to move on to postal reform. Evidently, the \nSenate schedule is driven not by the needs of the public but by the \nDemocrats' perceived political needs, which seem to change from minute \nto minute around here.\n  I would suggest that the Democrats learn to prioritize. Let's stick \nwith one thing and actually do something. As I said, there is much we \ncould do to address gas prices. Why don't we stick with that? This is \nsomething that matters to every American. Postal reform is important, \nbut we all know nothing is going to get done on it until after we \nreturn from the Easter recess anyway. Let's make that the pending \nbusiness when we return and put first things first.\n  We were sent here to solve problems, not avoid them, and the refusal \nto come together on commonsense solutions such as the ones we are \nproposing on gas prices is precisely the kind of thing people detest \nabout Washington, and they are perfectly right to do so. So I would \nsuggest that our friends on the other side rethink this strategy of \ntheirs and join us. Why don't we just try doing the right thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for 2 minutes, Senator Boxer for 8 minutes, and then \nSenator Murkowski for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to stress the critical \ninfrastructure needs across our Nation and urge the House of \nRepresentatives to act quickly and pass the surface transportation \nreauthorization bill that we passed in the Senate with an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote. The fact is that we have neglected the roads, bridges, \nand mass transit that millions of Americans rely on for far too long. I \nknow that. A bridge collapsed just a few blocks from my house. It \nwasn't just a bridge, it was an 8-lane highway, and 13 people died and \ndozens of cars were submerged in the river. A bridge just doesn't fall \ndown in America--well, it did that day--and I am committed to passing \nthis highway bill. This bill is important for jobs, and it is important \nfor drivers who sit in congestion. Americans spend a collective 4.2 \nbillion hours a year stuck in traffic at a cost to the economy of $78.2 \nbillion.\n  So what is the solution? Pass this highway bill. It reduces the \nnumber of highway programs from over 100 down to around 30, defines \nclear national goals for our transportation policy, and it streamlines \nenvironmental permitting.\n  I spoke to 75 highway contractors today, and they are ready to go. \nThey want this bill to pass. Companies such as Caterpillar, which \nemploys 750 people at its road-paving equipment facility in Minnesota--\nI visited that company in August. Caterpillars' employees are the kinds \nof people who are out there on the front lines of American industry. \nThey want to build these roads and are the ones who are building the \nproducts when we talk about ``Made in America.''\n  With the short construction season for winter States such as \nMinnesota--my friend from California may not quite have the same \nsituation--we cannot delay, delay, delay on this highway bill. We \ncannot stop these construction projects in their tracks.\n  It is time to pass the Senate highway bill. It has bipartisan \nsupport, with 74 out of 100 Senators voting for this bill. I ask that \nthe House of Representatives quickly pass this bill and get this done \nwithout delay. It means jobs, it means safety, and it means a future \nfor America.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to thank my friend from \nMinnesota. Her leadership when she was on the Environment and Public \nWorks Commission was amazing. We miss her leadership there. She is \nworking so hard on other committees, but she still carries in her heart \nthe great understanding that if anything is bipartisan around here, it \nis the highway bill and the transportation programs. We proved it here. \nSo I thank the Senator.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about Big Oil and this crying about Big \nOil by my Republican friends here, and then I am going to segue to the \nbattle to pass a transportation bill and the 3 million jobs that hang \nin the balance.\n  First, I have to say that I listened very hard to the Republican \nleader, Senator McConnell, talk about what a useless thing it is to try \nto say to Big Oil, which has had these big subsidies for so long, \ndecade after decade, starting when they were young companies--what a \nterrible thing it would be to take away those subsidies, billions of \ndollars, when they are making multibillion dollars and they are robbing \nus at the pump, pocketing the profit. We would like to see that money \nbe used for alternative fuels, for energy-efficient cars so that we \ndon't have to worry so much if the price of gas goes up a penny. If we \nare getting 50 to 60 miles to a gallon--I drive a hybrid car, and I \ndon't visit the gas station that often because we get about 50 miles to \nthe gallon, so the shocks that come with the increase in gas are a \nlittle bit muted.\n  But here is the story. Americans have made sacrifices. They are \npaying more at the pump. They are told by Big Oil: We are so sorry that \nAmericans have to pay more at the pump because there is instability in \nthe world. Americans have to pay more at the pump because our \nrefineries are down, and we are really sorry.\n  What they don't say is that they are exporting the oil they find in \nAmerica to other countries. What they don't tell us is that they are \npocketing the profits we are paying for. They are pocketing the \nprofits. In 2010 the five biggest oil companies made $80 billion among \nthem. In 2011 they made $140 billion among them. So no one can stand \nhere--not even the esteemed Republican leader--and tell me that Big Oil \nis making sacrifices just like ordinary Americans. The people who are \nrunning away with our money that we are paying at the pump are Big Oil \nand the speculators on Wall Street who are playing around with the \ninstability in the Middle East on commodity futures trading.\n\n[[Page S2050]]\n\n  So if you want to do something, let's take away those subsidies from \nthese big oil companies that are making life miserable for the American \npeople. But, no, our friends on the other side put up a fight, and they \ncite a couple of folks on our side who agree with them because they \ncome from big oil States. I understand that. Let's stand up for the \nAmerican people.\n  Another way we can stand up for the American people is to speak with \none voice and ask the House to take up the Senate bipartisan \nTransportation bill that passed this Senate overwhelmingly. The clock \nis ticking toward a shutdown, and extensions are dangerous. So my story \non the Transportation bill is a beautiful story of compromise, working \ntogether here in the Senate, and a very ugly story about what the House \nis doing, which is dithering around, playing with fire. And I am \ntelling everyone that extensions are death by a thousand cuts. They \nthink they can just send over an extension and feel they have done \ntheir job.\n  Well, let me say that what we found out today from the American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials, AASHTO--\nthese are folks who are on the ground in our States. Today I spoke to \nthe departments of transportation from North Carolina, Nevada, \nMaryland, and Michigan. I think most people know I represent \nCalifornia, and I will be back with all of the details. Senator \nFeinstein is talking to the transportation officials today. But the \nreason I am talking about these four States is because they have \nalready calculated the job losses that have already begun because the \nHouse is dithering and will not pass our bipartisan Transportation \nbill.\n\n  North Carolina, which is not a blue State--I spoke to Gene Conti, the \nsecretary of the North Carolina Department of Transportation today, and \nwhat he said was that he has delayed the remaining 2012 project awards, \nwhich total $1.2 billion in projects and employ 41,000 people.\n  The House is right down the hall. I had the honor of serving there. I \nhope they are hearing this while they debate an extension. An extension \nof this program is not benign. An extension of this program is \ndamaging. An extension of this program means job losses--41,000 in \nNorth Carolina.\n  I spoke with Scott Rawlins today, who is the deputy director and \nchief engineer of the Nevada Department of Transportation. He said he \nis holding up advertising for federally funded projects until there is \na reauthorization bill committing Federal funds. He is required to slow \ndown the development of future projects. He will not execute consultant \nagreements without reauthorization. And right now, today, AASHTO, the \nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, \ntells me that 4,000 jobs are at risk in Nevada.\n  What the Nevada people tell me is that in the good old days when they \nwere in a boom, the State could come forward and take these extensions \nin stride. They had the funding to front-load their projects and not \nworry about the Federal reimbursement. They thought that reimbursement \nwould come. A, they are very worried about reimbursement, and B, \nbecause of the recession that has hit some of our States very hard \nbecause of the construction slowdown in housing, they do not have the \nfunds to fast-forward any of these projects.\n  So North Carolina has 41,000 jobs at risk, and Nevada has 4,000 jobs \nat risk.\n  I spoke to Caitlin Rayman in Maryland. She talked about the \nuncertainty, and she went into four or five different things she is \ntrying to do now that she cannot do. It is because the House is \ndithering and they won't take up the bipartisan Senate bill and pass \nit. So 4,000 jobs are at risk in Maryland because projects are being \ndelayed.\n\n  I spoke to the director in Michigan, Kirk Steudle. He said several \nlarge construction projects have to be delayed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 8 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds, and then I \nwill turn it over to my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So in Michigan it is the same story: 3,500 jobs.\n  So I am saying to the House today--and I encourage my colleagues to--\nand I know the Senator from New Hampshire is here and she is going to \nspeak a little bit later about this--come to the floor with stories \nabout their States.\n  These extensions are dangerous and they will lose jobs. Tell the \nHouse to pass the bipartisan Senate bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you, Mr. President. This is a good discussion on \nthe floor today. I join with my colleague from California in urging \nthat the House move to the Transportation bill. But that is not why I \nrise this afternoon.\n  I wish to speak on the legislation that is before us. This is the \nMenendez proposal to raise taxes--raise taxes on American energy \ncompanies and I think inevitably prices to American consumers. It has \nbeen described as something else, but I suggest to my colleagues any \neffort to increase taxes on the energy companies that are providing a \nresource to us is nothing more than a tax on our energy companies. As \nwe tax those energy companies, it is sure not going to make them \nproduce things that are more affordable, more abundant. In fact, it \nwill have the resultant effect: to impact prices to American consumers \nnegatively.\n  This legislation before us is not a new idea. This is something we \nhave seen before. I think the numerous times we have rejected it leads \nme to the conclusion that it still remains a bad idea. It is a \nmessaging bill that has failed over and over, and I think it deserves \nto see that same fate again.\n  This very Congress, just a little less than a year ago, rejected this \nsame tax hike. Anybody who is curious to see what it is we did back \nthen just needs to look up vote No. 72, which was back in May of last \nyear, just to see how all 100 Members of the Senate voted.\n  Some have accused Republicans of using this opportunity, when gas \nprices are high, to push our cause, if you will, for increased supply \nand that somehow we welcome the aspect of higher gasoline prices. It \nwas actually the President himself who said some see a political \nopportunity to call for greater domestic energy production.\n  With oil sitting at over $100 a barrel, I think we all recognize \nthere is impact out there. But I can tell my colleagues for a fact that \nmy constituents don't view this as a political opportunity.\n  I get a weekly summary of what is happening with gas prices around my \nState. Right now the average price of a gallon of unleaded in the \nUnited States is just a little shy of $4. Well, in my hometown of \nAnchorage, we are paying $4.14. In Juneau, which is our State capital, \nwe are paying $4.24. In Barrow, the top of the world, they are at \n$5.75. Bethel is paying $6.33. They long for the day they could be \npaying closer to $4. We are so far beyond the national average, they \ndon't view higher gasoline prices as any kind of a political \nopportunity. What they are asking for is that they do more. In fact, \nthere is an imperative that we in Congress do more to address prices.\n  I believe there is no question--there is no question--that we can \nbring additional resources on line, that we can bring several million \nadditional barrels of American resources to market. There is no \nquestion but what it would do. It is going to help to create jobs. We \nknow that for a fact. It will absolutely generate revenues. It will \nbetter insulate our Nation from the instability we have with the global \nprice markets. We know that is what is happening right now. Every time \nIran is mentioned, everything gets a little shaky out there.\n  We know so much of this is due, in effect, to the fact that there is \nlittle spare capacity in the global markets. So let's look closer to \nhome. What do we have closer to home?\n  The President has suggested time and time again we only have 2 \npercent of the world's reserves. Well, in fact, this myth about the \nU.S. oil scarcity is just exactly that. We talk about proven reserves. \nIn fact, it is a much smaller piece of the pie: 20.6 billion barrels of \nproved reserves. But what needs to be understood and, unfortunately, \ndoesn't make a good bumper sticker is that we have, as a nation, \ndemonstrated incredible national reserves: 5.6 billion barrels of \ntechnically recoverable resources. We don't even count the 800-\n\n[[Page S2051]]\n\nplus billion barrels of oil shale that are out there.\n  So one asks the question: Why are we not going after the rest of the \npyramid, the part in blue. So much of what we are facing is that so \nmuch of this is put off-limits. It is not accessible, and it is not \naccessible because of our government policies.\n  I recognize there is more to it when it comes to an energy policy \nthan just drilling, just increased domestic production. But it must be \npart of the solution, and it must be a significant part of the solution \nif we are going to talk about true North American energy independence. \nWe must do more when it comes to conservation and efficiency. We need \nto build out toward the renewable energy sources of the future. If we \nwant to have a bumper sticker, it is, ``Find More, Use Less.'' It is \npretty simple.\n  The chart lets us know we truly can find more here. But what we are \nfacing with the Menendez bill that is in front of us takes us in a \ncompletely different direction. What the President and the Democratic \nleadership are proposing cannot by its own definition reduce our gas \nprices. If anything, we are just going to see them pushed higher, and \nmy constituents back home just can't afford to see them pushed higher \nwhen they are paying above $5, above $6 per gallon at the pump.\n  We know pretty basic economic principles are at play. Taxing \nsomething does not make it cheaper and more abundant. We know from past \nexperience. Due to a failed experiment with the windfall profits tax \nthat harmed domestic fuel production and collected far fewer revenues \nthan what was expected, we know this is taking us in the wrong \ndirection.\n  Again, our problem is high fuel prices and their effect on average \nAmericans. I have yet to hear anyone explain to me how raising taxes is \ngoing to lower prices. Even when we look at the subsidies that are \nextended in the Menendez bill, not even half of these are related to \nthe transportation fuels.\n  The first section in his bill is extension of credit for energy-\nefficient existing homes. Well, I am all for that, but tell me how this \nties in somehow to our Transportation bills. In terms of costs, it is \neven more unbalanced. So I am left at a loss to understand how \npermanent tax increases for oil and gas producers, in exchange for \nanother year of subsidies for efficiency and renewable energy, is going \nto make any kind of a meaningful difference. It kind of says to the \nAmerican people: Well, that $4 you are paying at the pump, too bad \nabout that. But how about a government-subsidized dishwasher? That just \ndoesn't work.\n  Some will also come here to argue that increasing taxes will have no \neffect on production. In response to that, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record at this point two news stories from last \nweek.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Oilgram News, Mar. 22, 2012]\n\n               UK Offers New Tax Breaks for Remote Fields\n\n      (By Robert Perkins, Jillian Ambrose, and Nathan Richardson)\n\n       London.--The UK government March 21 pledged new tax breaks \n     to boost the development of some remote, deepwater fields and \n     remove doubts over offshore decommissioning costs as part of \n     a package of measures to support the country's declining oil \n     and gas industry.\n       Presenting his 2012 budget to Parliament, UK Finance \n     Minister George Osborne said the government would create new \n     tax breaks worth GBP3 billion ($4.75 billion) to cover large \n     and deepwater fields off the west of the remote Shetland \n     Islands in the Atlantic margin.\n       ``We are introducing new allowances . . . for large and \n     deep fields to open up West of Shetland, the last area of the \n     basin left to be developed. A huge boost for investment in \n     the North Sea,'' Osborne told Parliament.\n       The area to the west of the Shetland Islands is still \n     largely underdeveloped and could contain up to 20% of the \n     UK's remaining gas reserves, according to the government.\n       The government said it also plans to increase existing tax \n     breaks for developing small fields and promised support for \n     investment in existing fields and infrastructure.\n       As expected, Osborne also said the government plans to \n     enter into contracts with oil companies over future \n     decommissioning tax relief, helping to end the uncertainty \n     over the massive costs of decommissioning old oil and gas \n     production infrastructure in the North Sea.\n       UK oil producers applauded the decommissioning move, \n     estimating it could spur an extra GBP40 billion of new \n     investment in UK waters and result in the recovery of an \n     additional 1.7 billion barrels of oil and gas equivalent \n     ``over time.''\n       ``We see today's action by the Treasury as a turning point \n     for the UK's oil and gas industry--toward a more stable \n     future fostered by constructive collaboration between the \n     government and industry to ensure that the recovery of the \n     country's oil and gas resource is maximized,'' UK offshore \n     operators association Oil & Gas UK head Malcolm Webb said in \n     a statement.\n       The new tax moves could result in further investment of \n     over GBP10 billion and the production of ``hundreds of \n     millions of barrels'' of oil and gas, the association said.\n       The tax measures, which were widely anticipated, extend an \n     olive branch to an industry that has placed some of the blame \n     for last year's record 18% decline in UK oil and gas output \n     on a tax hike in the governments 2011 budget.\n       Last year, the UK government unveiled a surprise tax \n     increase on offshore producers in a bid to tap the higher \n     earnings of oil companies due to rising oil prices.\n       UK offshore operators said the move, which took an extra \n     $3.2 billion out of oil companies' pockets last year, would \n     damage confidence in the UK oil industry and hamper \n     investment plans.\n       Under the decommissioning initiative, the government said \n     it plans to introduce legislation in 2013 giving it the \n     authority to sign contracts with oil companies operating in \n     the UK to provide assurance on the relief they will receive \n     when decommissioning assets.\n       The government said it would consult further on the details \n     of the new contracts in the coming months.\n       ``Confirmation that the government intends to enter into \n     contractual agreements on tax relief for decommissioning \n     costs improves the fiscal stability of the UK Continental \n     Shelf, while the targeted incentives for particular types of \n     fields will go some way in increasing the attractiveness of \n     areas currently starved of investment,'' Derek Leith, the \n     head of oil and gas taxation at Ernst & Young, said in a \n     statement.\n       The UK oil industry has been lobbying the government over \n     the need for greater certainty around future decommissioning \n     costs for some years.\n       In 2010, UK industry body Decom North Sea estimated the \n     total cost of decommissioning the UK's oil and gas production \n     assets had risen to around $46 billion.\n       Under the contractual arrangement, every North Sea \n     participant would sign a contract with the government \n     guaranteeing that, if decommissioning tax relief falls below \n     50% in the future, the government would pay back the \n     difference.\n       Currently, new North Sea entrants might have to post \n     security of as much as 150% of its share of the expected \n     decommissioning costs.\n       If the industry were confident that the 50% tax relief on \n     costs now available would continue into the future, the new \n     entrant could post a lower security, effectively only 75% of \n     the expected costs.\n       However, the industry has not yet been prepared to accept \n     securities at the lower rate because there is uncertainty \n     over whether tax relief would continue in future governments.\n       In steps to mitigate the tax hike impact on North Sea \n     operators last year, the UK government said it would consider \n     introducing a new category of oil or gas field which would \n     qualify for field tax allowances.\n       It said, however, tax relief for decommissioning spending \n     will be restricted to the existing 20% rate to avoid \n     accelerated decommissioning.\n       In addition to decommissioning costs, UK oil and gas \n     players also have been talking to the government on \n     allowances to boost specific projects, or categories, where \n     investment is marginal.\n       In 2009, the UK introduced a new field allowance for small \n     fields and challenging HPHT--or high-pressure, high-\n     temperature--and heavy oil fields, providing them an \n     allowances to offset against tax, reducing the rate of tax \n     paid once in production.\n       In January 2010, the allowance was extended to remote, \n     deepwater gas fields to the west of Shetland.\n       Osborne said the government also plans to increase the \n     allowance for small fields to GBP150 million, introduce \n     legislation this year to support investment in existing \n     ``brown fields'' and continue to look at further allowances \n     for HPHT fields.\n       In documents supporting its 2012 budget, the finance \n     ministry said it expects its tax revenues from the oil and \n     gas industry to slip by 14% in the 2012 13 tax year as \n     declining production levels in the North Sea offset higher \n     expected oil prices.\n       Oil prices are expected to average $118/b in the coming tax \n     year, up from $111/b in the 2011 12 period, the ministry said \n     without saying if the estimate is based on Brent or WTI crude \n     futures.\n       Including a record 20% slump in gas production in 2011 due \n     to weak demand and a warmer than average winter, total oil \n     and gas output slumped 18% on the year. Over the previous \n     five years, the UK's mature North Sea fields had seen decline \n     rates average 6%.\n       UK oil production peaked at about 2.6 million b/d in 1999 \n     and gas output peaked in 2000. The UK became a net importer \n     of both commodities in 2006 and 2004 respectively.\n\n[[Page S2052]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 21, 2012]\n\n                    U.K. Plans Oil Sector Tax Relief\n\n                           (By Alexis Flynn)\n\n       London.--Oil and gas firms operating in the U.K. North Sea \n     will be guaranteed tax relief for the costs of retiring old \n     rigs and platform and be given fresh tax allowances totaling \n     K3.5 billion ($5.55 billion) for harder-to-access deep water \n     fields.\n       The move comes as the U.K. seeks to spur renewed investment \n     in its energy sector, Chancellor of the Exchequer George \n     Osborne said Wednesday in his annual budget speech to \n     lawmakers.\n       The measure ends months of uncertainty among the region's \n     oil producers and comes after intense talks between \n     government and industry over possible measures to aid \n     investment in the North Sea.\n       The move extends an olive branch to the industry, which was \n     incensed by a surprise hike in the windfall tax on oil and \n     gas profits last year. A record 18% decline in oil and gas \n     production in 2011 was blamed in part on the tax increase.\n       Mr. Osborne said Wednesday the government will sign \n     contracts with companies such as Premier Oil and Apache Corp. \n     guaranteeing tax relief for the lifetime of a project. The \n     ironclad government assurance on decommissioning could pave \n     the way for at least K17 billion of new investment over the \n     life of the North Sea basin, said Mr. Osborne.\n       In addition, it will provide tax allowances for companies \n     investing in fields located in the deeper waters west of the \n     Shetland Islands that are much harder to reach and require \n     greater amounts of capital investment.\n       Mr. Osborne said the fresh allowances for this harder-to-\n     reach exploration and production would total some K3.5 \n     billion.\n       Under current rules, the government covers between half and \n     three-quarters of the costs of dismantling old fields by \n     making them tax deductible, but there are fears among many \n     companies--and the banks that lend to them--that these rules \n     could change.\n       An entire production facility needs to be removed once a \n     reservoir has been exhausted, with its wells plugged and the \n     site returned to as natural a state as possible. The process \n     is expensive and complicated, and poses a number of \n     environmental and safety challenges.\n       Decom North Sea, a nonprofit organization jointly funded by \n     the industry and the government, expects the cost of \n     decommissioning efforts to reach about K30 billion by 2040.\n       The issue is particularly acute for the smaller independent \n     firms that are leading much of the next wave of investment in \n     the North Sea, wringing out the last drops of oil from many \n     of the older fields that were sold off by majors like Exxon \n     Mobil Corp. and BP PLC.\n       These companies have been hamstrung by the legal \n     requirement to provide security, usually letters of credit or \n     large cash deposits, against future decommissioning costs. A \n     tougher economic environment means these companies are \n     finding their access to capital restricted and lenders less \n     willing to issue letters of credit against a backdrop of \n     fiscal uncertainty and declining North Sea production.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, these are news stories, not editorials. \nOne is from Platts Energy; the other is from the Wall Street Journal. \nBoth detail an announcement from the British Government that it is \ngoing to reverse its own taxes on the oil companies.\n  Last year, England decided to do essentially what is being proposed \nwith the Menendez bill. They were responding to high oil prices, and so \nthey moved to increase taxes on the industry. Well, the result is not \ngoing to come as a surprise. When the government made it less \neconomical to produce oil by hiking their tax rates, companies stopped \nproducing and they were making their investments elsewhere.\n  In the years since Great Britain imposed its tax hikes, its \nproduction decline has tripled from 6 percent to 18 percent. Let me \nrepeat that. In the year since Great Britain imposed tax increases on \noil producers, production decline accelerated from 6 percent a year to \n18 percent a year. Now Britain is in the process of doing an absolute \nabout face. They are likely going to offer $5.5 billion in tax relief \nto the oil companies to try to bring the production back.\n  I am sure some here would refer to that tax cut as a subsidy and \nignore the inconvenient fact that higher tax levels lead to lower \nproduction. They don't lead to cheaper fuel; they lead to lower \nproduction. Yet even in the face of high fuel prices and compelling \nempirical evidence, the proposal in front of us is going to take us \ndown the exact same path that Great Britain went down last year. It \nwould make the clear mistake of driving production away when I think we \nneed it most. The outcome in England just helps prove this is a \nseriously defective idea and a dangerous one. So we just need to look \nat what has happened across the pond.\n  If the Senate were really serious about addressing gasoline prices, \nwe would be taking long-overdue steps.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 10 minutes.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I don't see anyone in the queue, if I \nmay have another minute to wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. If we are really serious in the Senate about what we \nare doing in terms of increasing our long-overdue requirement to up our \noil resources, our oil production and supply, we know how. We have \nopportunities from our neighbors to the north in Canada with the \nKeystone Pipeline. We clearly have opportunities in Alaska from the \nOuter Continental Shelf, from the Rocky Mountain West. We still import \nabout half of our oil supply and about half of that is from OPEC.\n  One last chart, if I may. Right now, about 47 percent is OPEC; non-\nOPEC is 53 percent. If we were to add to our mix in this country what \nwe could get from Keystone, which is the middle pie, but look where we \nwould be as a nation. If we were to plus up our activity with domestic \nproduction, bring on Keystone, and with our existing resources, our \nimports from OPEC are reduced to a minimal amount. We talk about North \nAmerican energy independence, and we truly could be in that position \nwhere we are not vulnerable--not vulnerable to the volatility of the \nmarkets, not vulnerable to the volatility that comes from OPEC setting \nthe prices as they do, not in a situation where we are spending \nmillions and billions of dollars to import a resource we need but that \nwe have as a nation.\n  I can't fathom why the Congress would want to drain our economy by \nraising taxes on the very businesses that help minimize our foreign \ndependence, help create good-paying jobs for our families, and truly \nhelp to make a difference to Americans around the country in the long \nrun.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to yield in just 2 minutes \nbecause I know Senator Sanders is here. I really feel I need to respond \nbecause it is very important to note that under the leadership of \nPresident Obama--for decades we did not drill as much as we have \ndrilled now. We have more wells pumping than at any time in recent \nmemory. I think it is an important point.\n\n  Of course, we are not going to drill off the coast of some of our \nprecious areas because we have to support the fishing industry, we have \nto support the recreation industry, the tourism industry. But all this \nargument about drill, baby, drill and we will solve everything does not \nwork because we threaten jobs when we go to certain areas that are \npristine and very important sources of economic income for our States. \nPlus, if you ask my colleagues on the other side, they will not support \nkeeping the oil in America--they will not--and we are exporting more \noil than we ever have before.\n  So this thing gets very interesting when we look at it. Still, in \nall, the big oil companies--as we all make our sacrifices at the pump--\nare bringing in record, record, record profits. They ask us to make \nsacrifices because there is instability in the world, but they are \npocketing those increases. Yet our Republican friends cry bitter tears \nbecause we want to suggest that subsidies they got decades ago--kept on \nundisturbed billions of dollars--we would like to see those funds go \ninto making it easier for America's families to be able to buy more \nfuel-efficient cars, to be able to find alternative fuels, et cetera, \net cetera.\n  When I come back to the floor after this discussion on the postal \nreform, I am going to talk more about the highway bill. The House is \nabout to vote on a 60-day extension. Let me tell you, that is \ndangerous. I hope colleagues over there will not do that because, I \nhave to tell you, every day we extend the highway trust fund for a \nshort period of time, we lose jobs, and we need certainty.\n  I am happy to yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S2053]]\n\n                         Postal Service Reform\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, later this afternoon--actually, in a \nfairly short while--we are going to be voting on whether to proceed \nwith the Postal Service reform bill, and I hope we vote yes. I hope we \nhave a strong bipartisan vote to go forward. I will tell you why.\n  About 9 or 10 months ago, the Postmaster General came up with a \nproposal for the Postal Service. In my view, that proposal from the \nPostmaster General is an unmitigated disaster for our country and \nespecially for rural America.\n  This is what his original proposal outlined: What he proposed was the \nshutting down of more than 3,600 mostly rural post offices. If one \nlives in a rural State such as mine, one knows how important rural post \noffices are, and their function is beyond being just a post office. In \nmany small communities throughout this country, post offices are the \ncenter of the town. It is where people come together. It is what \ndevelops a sense of community. In some cases, it is what that small \nrural town is all about. If we shut down that rural post office, in \nsome instances we are literally shutting down that town.\n  We should also understand, in the midst of the serious financial \nproblems facing the Postal Service, shutting down 3,600 mostly rural \npost offices would save the Postal Service one-quarter of 1 percent of \ntheir budget. So the original plan--which has since been modified--was \nto shut down 3,600 rural post offices, and I would suggest whether one \nis a conservative Republican or a progressive Independent, that is not \ngood for their State, not good for America.\n  In addition, the Postmaster General's original proposal talked about \nshutting down some 220 mail processing facilities all over this \ncountry. That is approximately one-half of the mail processing plants. \nIf he did that, that would end overnight delivery standards for first-\nclass mail.\n  At a time when the Postal Service is facing extreme competition from \ne-mail and the Internet, in my view, the last thing we would want to do \nis to slow down mail service. I think I speak for many Members of the \nSenate who say, if we move in that direction, making mail delivery \nslower, we are beginning the death spiral for the Postal Service. Many \nbusinesses, many consumers will be saying: Sorry, I am going to look \nelsewhere to get my packages, get my mail delivered.\n  Furthermore, the original proposal from the Postmaster General was to \nshut down Saturday mail delivery and, in the process, reduce the \nworkforce of the Postal Service--in the midst of the worst recession \nsince the Great Depression--by over 200,000 jobs.\n  Senators Lieberman and Carper, Senators Collins and Scott Brown, the \nranking members of the committees, came together and put together a \nbill which was significantly better than what the Postmaster General \nhad proposed, no question about it.\n  Some of us felt the Lieberman-Carper-Collins-Brown bill did not go \nfar enough, and we have been working with the chairmen of the \ncommittees to try to improve that bill, and I think we have made some \nsuccess. I think if we look at the managers' amendment, we will see \nstronger guarantees to make sure we are not shutting down rural post \noffices all over America; that if we shut down processing plants, it \nwill be a significantly smaller number than was originally proposed, \nand that also we would maintain strong mail delivery standards--if not \nas strong as I would like, at least stronger than what the Postmaster \nGeneral originally proposed.\n  Here is my fear: The Postmaster General is raring to go. If he \nperceives and the board of postal commissioners perceive the Congress \ncannot act, they are going to go forward and bring forth a proposal \nwhich will not be as strong in protecting post offices and workers and \nthe American people as we can do. So what we managed to do back in \nDecember was get a 5-month moratorium to prevent the shutting down of \nrural post offices and processing plants. That expires on May 15.\n\n  I think it is terribly important we begin the process, we vote to \nproceed within the next hour, we bring that bill to the floor, there is \nan open process by which people, including myself, will bring forth \namendments to make the bill even stronger than it is right now.\n  I would point out to my colleagues, in terms of the financial \nproblems facing the Postal Service, clearly, they have to deal with the \nserious problem, the very real problem that first-class mail has gone \ndown very significantly, being replaced by e-mail. There is no question \nthat is a real, legitimate problem.\n  But what is not a legitimate problem is that the Postal Service \nuniquely in America--not in local governments, State governments, \nFederal agencies or the private sector--the Postal Service alone is \nbeing asked to put $5.5 billion every single year into their future \nretiree health benefits program. According to the inspector general of \nthe U.S. Postal Service, given the fact there is some $44 billion in \nthat fund already, with interest rates accruing, we do not need to put \nmore money into that fund. There is widespread agreement the Postal \nService has overpaid into the Federal Employees Retirement System some \n$10 billion or $11 billion; into the Civil Service Retirement System, \nat least a couple billion dollars and perhaps a lot more.\n  The bottom line is this: If we are serious about protecting rural \nAmerica, if we are serious about protecting 3,600 rural post offices, \nif we believe the post office must continue being an important part of \nwhat America is about--so important to our economy and to small \nbusinesses--and we do not want to delay mail service, slow down mail \nservice, we do not want to shut down half of the mail processing plants \nin this country, I think it is important we begin that debate and vote \nfor cloture.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to urge our colleagues to vote \nfor cloture to proceed to the Postal Service bill. I will speak very \nbriefly.\n  This a great American institution, right there from the founding of \nour country. In fact, it is in the Constitution to provide post \noffices. It is an institution that is today in trouble. Last year, it \nlost almost $10 billion. Why? Part of it is the economic recession, but \nthe real explanation is that mail volume has dropped 21 percent in the \nlast 5 years, and mostly that is because people are using the Internet \nand e-mail instead of traditional mail. Yet the Postal Service not only \nitself provides a great service, but it facilitates various sectors of \nour economy that employ 7 million people--mailers, mail order catalogs, \nand the like.\n  Our committee, when confronted with this crisis--and the statement \nfrom Postmaster General Donahoe that if nothing was done, he would have \nto begin curtailing operations sometime this year because he would \nessentially run out of enough money to operate the Postal Service as it \nis--tried to get together and work on a balanced program. We reported \nout a bipartisan bill. Some people said it was too much; some people \nsaid it was too little. We think it was just about right.\n  There has been a lot of dialog with Senator Sanders and others, \npeople on both sides of the aisle. When we take this up--and I sure \nhope it is ``when'' and not ``if'' because I do not know how we could \njust turn away from this problem and essentially say to the Postmaster: \nWe are not going to provide you any help; you are going to have to \nhandle this. What he is going to do is close a lot of post offices, in \nmy opinion, close a lot of mail processing facilities, raise prices to \nthe extent he can under existing law.\n  This is a balanced program. It creates some protections for small and \nrural post offices before they can be closed. It creates new standards \nin the delivery of mail so the Postmaster will, in his wisdom, be able \nto thin out employment at some of the mail processing facilities, \nperhaps close some of them but nowhere near what he wanted to do \nearlier.\n  The Postmaster asked us for authority to go from 6 days of delivery \nof mail to 5 days of delivery of most mail, and we essentially said: \nYou may have to do that, Mr. Postmaster, but do not do it for 2 years. \nSee if the other things we are authorizing you to do enable you to get \nthe Postal Service back in fiscal balance. But if not, after the 2 \nyears, with the process we ordained, they will have to go to 5 days of \ndelivery.\n  Here is the bottom line: We are trying everything we can to save this \ngreat institution. It is not a relic. It is\n\n[[Page S2054]]\n\na fundamental part of the modern economy, and it has some great \nresources. First is its presence all over the country. One of the \nthings we are doing--we worked on this with Senator Sanders and \nothers--in the substitute, we will create an advisory commission, a new \ncommission which will be charged with the responsibility of not only \nreviewing the operations of the Postal Service to make sure it is being \nmanaged and run most efficiently but for looking for a new business \nmodel, for new ways to use the great assets of the Postal Service--one, \nthat it is all over the country in the post offices; and, two, that no \none else can cover the last mile of delivery to everybody's house or \nbusiness in the country regardless of where you live, including the \niconic burros that help deliver the mail in the Grand Canyon and the \nmailmen on snowshoes who deliver it in rural parts of Alaska. Right \nnow, FedEx, UPS, and others use that service of the last mile to \ncomplete their delivery to their customers.\n  We want to see if we can figure out how the Postal Service can make \nmore money so it can stay alive. This is a great American institution \nwhich I believe has a great future, but it is not going to have it \nunless we help.\n  So here we are challenged again. Are we going to fall into \nideological rigidity or partisan conflict and let this great \ninstitution slide and fall into a deep crisis or are we going to work \ntogether, as I believe our committee has, to present a bipartisan \nsolution which will guarantee, in a very different time in American \nhistory, that the post office--the U.S. Postal Service--can play as \nvital a role as it has throughout all the rest of our history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I share \nthe majority leader's view that we ought to turn to the postal reform \nbill. What I intend to do is to ask that we modify the consent that the \nmajority leader just offered--modify his request so that on Monday, \nApril 16, we proceed to the consideration of S. 1769, the postal reform \nbill.\n  That would give us an opportunity to further debate and discuss the \nMenendez proposal, which we just invoked cloture on yesterday, for the \nremainder of the week. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think most \npeople know I worked here as a police officer for most of the time I \nwas going to law school.

So I wish \nto get to the postal bill as much as anyone in this Chamber, having \nworked for the Postal Service, through the House Post Office.\n  I wish to move to the postal bill. But I am not going to be forced \ninto doing it at a time that may not work out just right for our \nschedule; that is, the Senate.

Mr. President, there is no question the Postal Service \nfaces serious challenges, and it needs to work with Congress and the \nAmerican people to address them.\n  There are some who say that the Postal Service can cut its way out of \nits financial hole.\n  The plan put forth by the Postmaster General would do just that. It \nwould have a heavy impact on my State, with at least 8 processing \nfacility closures and perhaps more than 250 post office closures. Under \nthat plan, mail from Springfield--the State capital--would be shipped \nall the way to St. Louis, just to come back to Springfield once again.\n  And these facilities are key hubs of commerce throughout the State.\n  Take Quincy, IL, for example. The Postal Service had already studied \nQuincy for consolidation in 2009. At that time, the Postal Service \nfound that the facility in Quincy was efficient and closing it would \nnot create new efficiencies. Despite that finding, the Postmaster \nGeneral decided to press ahead with the closure of the Quincy facility \nthis year. The facts are in Quincy's favor, but it seems that the \nPostal Service only wants to cut its way to death.\n  This bill is about jobs too. The Postal Service employs more than \n30,000 people in my State, from clerks, to drivers, to postmasters, to \nletter carriers, and so many more. These are not high-paying jobs, they \nare not glamorous. These are middle-class jobs that support the world's \nbest postal delivery network. Nationwide, the Postal Service employs \nmore than half a million people. Millions more in this country are \nemployed in businesses that depend on the Postal Service.\n  Given the wide-reaching impact of the Postal Service, it is clear to \nme that cutting to the bone is the wrong approach. It will lead to a \ndeath spiral and the eventual end of the Postal Service as we know it.\n  The Postal Service must grow and reform its way into 21st century \ncompetitiveness. This bill is a first step toward achieving that goal. \nBrought to the floor under the leadership of Senators Lieberman and \nCollins, this bill begins the process of addressing some of the serious \nchallenges facing the Postal Service. This will help USPS reduce long-\nterm costs, increase efficiency, and grow into a 21st century service \nprovider. I think these steps can be taken while maintaining a world-\nclass level of service.\n  There is no question there will be some short-term and long-term pain \nassociated with reforming the Postal Service. Without tough choices, I \ncan assure you there will be bankruptcy and the demise of the Postal \nService.\n  I believe that measured steps now, though painful, are worthwhile to \npreserve and improve the Postal Service for generations to come.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for cloture on the motion \nto proceed to this important legislation.\n\n[[Page S2055]]\n\nAnd I look forward to an open and honest debate and to working with my \ncolleagues to strengthen the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I rise today to address a simple but \nimportant issue about what our path forward is to building a stronger \nand safer America. I was deeply frustrated to hear earlier today that \nthe Transportation bill, which was passed by an overwhelming bipartisan \nconsensus in this Chamber, has gone over to the House and they cannot \nfind a way forward to respond to this bill from us or find any clarity \nor certainty about whether to simply take up, debate, amend, or \nconsider and enact, hopefully, our bill from the Senate or ask for \nshort-term extensions of 30, 60, or 90 days.\n  Madam President, as you know as a former Governor and as I know as a \nformer county executive, when investing in work as important as bridges \nand highways and roads that make infrastructure, transportation, and a \nreliable and predictable future for our economy possible, nothing is \nmore important than certainty. Financing major highway projects, buying \nmajor pieces of equipment, and hiring the crews to do the work are \nexactly the sorts of things where certainty is critical.\n  I have a simple question to our friends in the other Chamber, which \nis when will they take up this bill that passed this Chamber by such an \noverwhelming margin and when will they take seriously the broad \nbipartisan input from every imaginable group in support of this.\n  I was active in my previous elected role as county executive with the \nNational Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the AFL CIO. All have weighed in. In \nfact, if I remember correctly, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wrote every \nsingle office at the Senate in support of this legislation, calling for \nspecific action that both the Congress and administration could take \nright now to support job growth and economic productivity without \nadding to the deficit.\n  This bill came out of the committee after remarkable work by Senator \nBoxer of California and Senator Inhofe of Oklahoma, two Senators who \nare widely viewed as being at the opposite ends of our political \nspectrum here in this Chamber.\n  When I go home to Delaware, I hear folks say over and over again: Why \ncan't you work together? Why can't you iron out your differences and \nput America on a clearer, straighter track toward a stronger recovery?\n  Well, this is exactly the sort of bill that will accomplish that end. \nA 2-year reauthorization, a $109 billion bill that in my small State of \nDelaware would create 6,700 jobs now hangs in the balance. It will \nexpire at the end of this month. Rather than take up and consider and \nhopefully pass this bill, folks in the other Chamber--and frankly, \nsadly, largely folks on the other side of the partisan aisle here--are \nrefusing to do so and will instead take a short-term chip shot of an \nextension.\n  I simply wanted to say, if I might, that certainty is something I \nrespect from my years in the private sector. Certainty is something I \nhear from the other side of the aisle in the other Chamber all the \ntime. And this is a moment when certainty can be served by the House \ntaking up and passing the Senate-passed bill.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Will my friend from Delaware yield for a question?\n  Mr. COONS. Absolutely. I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. The Senator was a county executive; I was a mayor of a \ncommunity. We had to deal with the real-life aftermath of what happens \naround here, especially when it comes to these extensions. I know in my \ncity, when I saw these extensions from that end of the table, we always \nhad to stop projects, slow them down, didn't have the money to finish \nthem, winter shutdown. All it did was add costs, decrease the capacity \nof roads, and literally take projects off the list.\n  In his community, the Senator had to deal with this probably like I \nhad to. Did the Senator have the same kind of impact where you had to \ntell contractors: I am sorry, we don't have the money because the \nFederal Government has not done their job that they said they would do \n20-some times before and never completed it? Is that a similar \nsituation?\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, the Senator from Alaska is absolutely \nright. In my county, we didn't do roads, our State does the roads, but \nwe did sewers, and heavy capital investments in infrastructure would \ncost our little county tens of millions of dollars. We would be on a \nproject, off a project, on a project, off a project. We were fortunate \nthat our county in good times had enough money in reserve that we could \ngo ahead and authorize the bond issue and authorize the project. But as \nthe economy turned and as our balance sheet got tougher, we had to \nwait, we had to put things on hold, and we had to put off key projects.\n  I know the good Senator from Alaska, as a former mayor of Anchorage, \nalso saw that happen in transportation. Is that not the case, that \ncertainty was an enormous challenge when the Senator was relying on a \nFederal partner who was unreliable?\n  Mr. BEGICH. Absolutely, I say to the Senator from Delaware. In \nAlaska, I chaired the Metropolitan Planning Organization, the MPO, \nwhich had this money that would come from this legislation. It would \ncome to us, and if they delayed it here or they had these crazy \ncontinuations because for some reason they could not get their work \ndone--and now we are seeing that on the House side. They have had \nmonths to work on this. I think they actually banked that we would not \nwork together here, Democrats and Republicans, and get something done. \nWe actually did, and a pretty significant piece of legislation about \ntransportation infrastructure that is crumbling in this country got 74 \nvotes, bipartisan, from all spectra of political persuasions. I think \nthey banked that we would fail, but we didn't. There were five weeks of \nwork and a lot of compromise because we know what the impacts are on \nthe street if we don't do this.\n\n  Back home, if the House doesn't take action on a very reasonable \nbill, a bipartisan bill, what will happen in Alaska is that some of \nthese projects will de-obligate, or not obligate the funds, which means \nthey will delay them. That means the contractors who expected to do \nwork this summer will not. And in Alaska, because we are a winter \nclimate--a lot of Northern States have a similar situation--the plant \nthat provides the asphalt closes usually the first part of October. So \nyou have a window that shrinks very rapidly. If you are not careful, \nthe net result is that you have no projects and you pay more, which \nmeans that the delay the House side is doing is going to cost taxpayers \nmore money and there will be less jobs. In Alaska we have 18,000 jobs \nat risk. And at the end of the day, again, you get less product, fewer \nroads.\n  I can only assume the experience I have here matches the Senator's \nState government that worked with the county when he was county \nexecutive; it is the same thing they had to go through, as the Senator \nexplained on his water and sewer projects. But, as he said, times are \ndifferent. You can't supplement it with local money, the way it used to \nbe, because we don't have it.\n  The economy is struggling and starting to come back. But here we are \nat a moment when the economy is moving in the right direction, and what \nare we doing? The House over there is just waiting. I think that is not \nthe example we are looking for but what we are doing and what we are \nsuffering through.\n  Mr. COONS. What strikes me most about this, Madam President, and to \nthe good Senator from Alaska, is that of all the sectors in the entire \nAmerican economy--at least in my home State--that have suffered since \nthe financial collapse of 2008, construction was hit the hardest. We \nalready knew that we were far behind in investment. We have tens of \nthousands of bridges that are out of compliance with basic engineering \nstandards. Half of our roads are below the standards we would expect \nfrom a modern economy. This is money that can and should be invested in \nputting people to work in construction, which has suffered from the \nhighest unemployment. It has the support from the Chamber of Commerce \nto the AFL CIO, where we wrestled through\n\n[[Page S2057]]\n\nthe tough processes here over several weeks, and we have a strongly \nbipartisan bill sitting and ready to go.\n  There are other things we debate in this Chamber that will maybe \ncreate jobs, maybe won't. There is no question--even those who have the \nstrongest concerns about the Federal role in our economy cannot \ndisagree that Federal highway projects put people to work, strengthen \nour economy, and make us more competitive. This bill is ready to go. \nWhy you would not take it up and enact it today, I cannot imagine.\n  To the good Senator from Alaska, I might say Alaska may have a \nshorter summer season than we do, but if you have 18,000 jobs at risk, \nI can only imagine the kinds of calls the Senator is getting from his \nhome State, as I am getting from my State, urging that the House of \nRepresentatives take up this strong and bipartisan bill and pass it so \nwe can all move forward and create some real jobs.\n  Mr. BEGICH. The Senator and I have the same situation he has \ndescribed: Yes, we are getting those calls and they are not just--\npeople say this is a union thing. No, it is union, nonunion, chamber, \nenvironmentalists, neighborhoods, community councils. It is everybody \nyou can imagine because these are real jobs, about real people, about \nreal communities.\n  Over there I think they think it is some theory that if they delay \nit, nothing will happen. They are wrong because the Senator and I have \nlived on that other side and had to live with the consequences of \ninaction. This is one of those bills where there is bipartisan support, \nall the groups out there from all walks of life support it, and \neveryday people understand it.\n  When I was back in Anchorage getting some gas at the gas station, \nsomeone came up and they asked me, because why? We are about to start \nour season in the bidding process because you have to take 30, 60, 90 \ndays to get the bids out and then you actually have to construct. I \nthink sometimes in the House they think it is some fantasy land that \nwhatever they do has no effect. This does. I think the Senator said it \nvery clearly, and I appreciate being allowed to ask a few questions and \ncomment here. But it seems the most ridiculous thing to have Alaskans \ntelling me every day to work together, create bipartisan legislation, \nwhatever it might be. Here is one we have done successfully and now we \nare ready. But over there they are playing politics. They have now \ntried twice to do something this week and they still cannot get it \nmoving.\n  I would encourage those on the other side to move forward on the \nbipartisan bill that the Senate has passed when I know they were \nbanking we would not pass it. We did it; we did our work. The American \npeople are waiting for these jobs, the contractor community is ready, \nand the communities are ready. It is time to move forward.\n  I thank the Senator and the Presiding Officer for allowing me to ask \na few questions and give a little commentary.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank the Senator from Alaska. As we both know from our \nformer roles, when you have a short-term extension, there are costs. It \nmeans that folks getting mobilized, getting organized, getting ready--\nyou have to pull them back. When the State coffers, the county coffers, \nthe municipal coffers don't have the ability to float and put in place \nthe Federal funds they are waiting for, it means projects get canceled, \npeople lose their jobs, opportunity and optimism that were moving \nforward get pulled back.\n  We have folks in this Chamber and the other, former Governors, former \nmayors, former county executives, former business leaders, who know the \nimportance of a strong and reliable Federal partnership in \nstrengthening infrastructure in this country.\n  I congratulate Senator Boxer and Senator Inhofe for working together \nso well to craft a tough, strong, capable bipartisan bill, and it is my \nplea that the Members of the other Chamber will promptly take it up, \nconsider it, and pass it so we can get America back to work.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, before they leave the floor, I thank \nSenator Coons and Senator Begich and Senator Shaheen for the very \nimportant words they gave today on behalf of the House taking up and \npassing the bipartisan Senate Transportation bill. It is interesting to \nknow we also have the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, \nspeaking out in favor of the House picking up and passing the Senate \nbipartisan bill. I also served as a county supervisor a long time ago, \nbut I think we all understand that what we do here makes a difference.\n  This is one Nation under God, indivisible. There cannot be a \ncircumstance where one State puts their own funding from their State \ninto highways but the State next door does nothing. They cannot have \ncommerce. That is why I thought Dwight Eisenhower, when he was a \nRepublican President in the 1950s, said it well. He was a logistics \nexpert. He is the one who started the National Highway System. He knew \nfrom his experience in war that you have to move goods and people. He \nalso knew, in his role as President, that in order to have a strong \neconomy, we have to do the same thing here at home.\n  For me to see this House dither as they are doing--they are dithering \non a bill. All they have to do is take up the bipartisan bill. For \ngoodness sake, they have three-quarters of the Senate to support it, \nand all we need is 218 votes. When I served in the House for 10 years, \nwhat did I learn? You needed 218 votes. Tip O'Neill never cared where \nhe got his votes, he just got the votes for the American people. So I \nhave written letters to Speaker Boehner and Leader Cantor, and I have \nbegged them to please work with us on this bill, and all we get back \nare statements from their staff, saying: Well, we are going to do it \nour way. As Congresswoman Pelosi, the Democratic leader, said today: \nWhen you say my way or the highway about the highway bill, you don't \nget much done.\n  I also wanted to thank Senator Klobuchar. She also held office at the \nState level. She was a district attorney, and she understands what \nhappens when the Federal Government, State government, local \ngovernment, all work together for jobs, and that is what this bill is \nabout.\n  So I am going to call today on the House to immediately take up and \npass the bipartisan Boxer-Inhofe bill. I am going to ask them to \nabandon their goal of a series of extensions.\n  When someone goes to buy a house, they need a mortgage. Maybe it will \nbe a 10-year mortgage, 15-, 20-, or a 30-year mortgage. If the banker \nlooked at them and said, We can only give you a mortgage for 30 or 60 \ndays, it would be very difficult, to put it mildly. It is disruptive. \nYou don't know how to plan, you don't know what it is going to cost, \nyou don't know if you are ever going to get the money for the house. So \nthe House, by taking up these extensions, has to understand the impact.\n  Today I called a press conference to let the press know what the \nimpact is of these extensions. The extension means job losses. We \nstarted to put together a list that is coming to us from the States of \njob losses already happening in the field because of the lack of action \nby the House. I spoke to the Secretary of Transportation in North \nCarolina today. He has delayed the remaining 2012 projects totaling \n$1.2 billion that would employ 41,000 people. So 41,000 people do not \nhave work, as we speak today, because the House is dithering and not \npassing the bipartisan Senate Transportation bill.\n  I spoke to the officials in Nevada. As we speak, thousands of jobs \nhave been lost there because the House is considering an extension \ninstead of passing a bill such as our bill.\n  I spoke to the officials in Maryland. Same thing, thousands of jobs. \nI spoke to the officials in Michigan. Same thing. Right now we are \nputting together a list from all across the country of job losses in \nall of our States as a result of the House failing to take up and pass \nthe bipartisan Senate bill. What more bipartisanship do they need than \nto have 75 Senators support the bill? One of them was absent due to a \nfuneral. So we have 74 votes for it and 22 against it. What more do \nthey want?\n  Anyone watching the Senate today sees how paralyzed we are. We have \nnot been able to do a thing. There are filibusters on fixing the post \noffices. There are filibusters on making sure that Big\n\n[[Page S2058]]\n\nOil doesn't keep ripping off consumers at the pump. Filibuster, \nfilibuster, filibuster, filibuster. But we were able to get over all of \nthat and pass a transportation bill. Why wouldn't the House be thrilled \nabout that? Why wouldn't the House embrace what we did? Why would the \nHouse instead stand up again today and say, We are going to have a 60-\nday extension. Guess what. They pulled it. They are not having a vote \non that today because of the uproar it is creating in the States and on \nthe House floor. The House has not delivered on its promise for a bill. \nAll the leadership does is complain about our bill.\n\n  Today--I couldn't believe it--Chairman Mica said this bill is not \npaid for. Senator Baucus, Senator Thune, and others worked across party \nlines to pay for our bill. It is 100 percent paid for. And guess what \nit does. It protects 1.9 million jobs and creates another million. That \nis what our bill does. So they are pulling this vote. They are pulling \nthis vote today. Good. I am glad they are pulling this vote because \nthey ought to instead pass the bipartisan Senate Transportation bill.\n  I want to tell you a story about what is actually happening out there \nin the economy. If we do nothing, 1.9 million jobs are gone on March \n31. If we do an extension, then you have death by a thousand cuts, a \nproportion of these jobs is lost, and it keeps getting worse with every \nextension. So it is the end of these jobs, a slow torturous end of \nthese jobs.\n  I want to show how many unemployed construction workers there are--\n1.4 million. Why is that? When the unemployment rate is 8.3 percent, \nthe unemployment rate among construction workers is 17.1 percent. Why \nis that? Because we were having a very tough housing crisis, and we are \nnot out of it yet. So all of these workers who were building houses now \nwere hoping to be able to build highways, build freeways, and fix \nbridges. And our bill does that. Our bill will take these people and \nput them to work. We could get this unemployment rate down to 400,000 \nbecause we will take a million off this with the expansion of the TIFIA \nProgram, which stands for Transportation Infrastructure Finance and \nInnovation Act, which gives the money upfront for cities and States and \ngets projects built faster.\n  I want to show you what it would look like if you put every \nunemployed construction worker into a football stadium. This is a Super \nBowl stadium, and it is filled. Imagine each and every one of these \nseats is filled by an unemployed construction worker, and then close \nyour eyes and imagine 13 more stadiums for a total of 14 stadiums. \nFourteen stadiums full of unemployed construction workers, that is what \nwe are facing. Yet, the House will not take up and pass the bipartisan \nTransportation bill. They are flirting with extensions, which is the \nend of these jobs, but slower and more excruciating.\n  We talked about jobs, but we have to talk about businesses. These \njobs are private sector jobs, and these businesses--over 11,000 of \nthem--are construction companies that would be adversely impacted.\n  I met with business owners. One man was teary eyed. He said, Senator, \nI have had to lay off 1,000 people because of the indecision here, \nbecause of the constant extensions we have had on the highway bill. We \nneed your bill now. I said I understood. He said, I cannot look at \nanother worker. He said, Extensions are like living hand to mouth. It \ndoesn't work.\n  If you know, again, that all you are going to get is 90 days' worth \nof Federal funding, how can you let a contract for a year? No one is \ngoing to go out and let a contract for 90 days for a big program that \nlasts for a year or a year-and-a-half of construction. So we just have \nto remember we are not just talking about workers; we are talking about \nthe businesses that support those workers.\n\n  I am going to show my colleagues a series of editorials. They have \nrun in red States. They have run in blue States. They have run in \npurple States.\n  I am going to make a statement, and I am going to stand by it: \nEveryone in America gets this except the House of Representatives. \nEveryone in America gets this except the Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives, save a few of them who are courageous. Four of them \nhave broken off--one of them from the Presiding Officer's home State, \ntwo of them from Illinois, and one of them from North Carolina. They \nsaid: We stand with those who say take up and pass the Senate \nbipartisan bill. Good for them for showing that kind of courage.\n  I say to my colleagues now, it is a quarter to 5 in the evening. If \nany of them are tuning in to this discussion, listen to what these \nnewspapers are saying: ``House should pass transportation bill.''\n\n       The No. 1 priority for the House of Representatives should \n     be passing a bipartisan transportation bill--as the Senate \n     already has done on a 74 22 vote. . . .\n       The Senate has done its job. . . . House Speaker Boehner \n     should drop the notion of passing an extreme Republican-only \n     House bill and do as the Senate did--craft a bipartisan bill \n     that can pass both Houses.\n\n  This is in the Fresno Bee. It is in the reddest part of California. \nTrust me when I say that. I know. It is the reddest part of California, \nand they are asking the House to pass the Senate bill.\n  Then we have, in Michigan, the Detroit News: ``Congressional Waffling \nHurts State Roads.''\n\n       The U.S. Senate . . . has approved a bipartisan plan. While \n     imperfect, it's better than another reprise of an outmoded \n     transportation act that already has been extended eight \n     times. . . . The disarray hardly gives States the kind of \n     revenue certainty they need to get from a Federal plan, but \n     if Boehner and House Members can't agree on their own plan, \n     they would probably be wise to take what is politically \n     possible and pass it. Pass the Senate bill.\n\n  Newspapers all over the country--look at this one: ``Road to \nCompromise.'' One would think the House would embrace this. What are \nthe American people telling us? We are viewed--we in the Congress--as \nfighting constantly. Our approval rating is 10 percent. I don't know \nwho represents that 10 percent, but it is probably the Presiding \nOfficer's family, my family, and the family of my colleague from \nMissouri.\n  Why is that? We can't work together. We proved today on two bills \nthat we can't get together. But we proved a couple of weeks ago, after \n5 weeks of debate, we could do it on the Transportation bill.\n  When Senator Inhofe and I agree, my goodness, that is a day. We don't \nagree on so many things, believe me. We are struggling over anything \nthat has the word ``environment'' in it. He is fighting to overturn the \nEPA clean air rules, and I am fighting him to keep them. He doesn't \nwant that much oversight on nuclear accidents; I want more oversight. \nHe says I don't do enough oversight on things he wants oversight on. \nListen, we argue. We respect each other. We like each other. We \ndisagree with each other. But on this we came together. What more does \nBoehner want? What more does Cantor want?\n  Speaker Boehner is putting at risk 55,000 jobs in Ohio, and Leader \nCantor is putting at risk 40,000 jobs in Virginia. Don't they care \nabout the businesses and the workers there?\n  This headline says the ``Road to Compromise.'' This is the Ohio Akron \nBeacon, from the heartland:\n\n       On Wednesday, 74 Senators, Republicans and Democrats, \n     joined together in a real accomplishment. They approved a \n     two-year bill. . . . The timing couldn't be better. . . . \n     What will the House do? It should take the cue of the Senate \n     and quickly approve the legislation that won bipartisan \n     support.\n\n  It couldn't be more clear. That is Ohio.\n  I will tell my colleagues I have never seen such an array of \nnewspapers from all over the country.\n  This one is the Chicago Sun-Times: ``For a Better Commute, Pass \nTransportation Bill.''\n\n       The Senate just delivered a gift to the House: A bipartisan \n     transportation bill at a time when America really could use a \n     lift. Here's hoping the House Republicans don't mess it up. . \n     . .\n\n  Well, hope against hope. So far, I feel very worried--very, very \nworried. The whole program expires on Friday and all they can come up \nwith is extensions, and then they don't even have the votes for that. \nHow bad would it be for them to give me a call, give Senator Inhofe a \ncall, and say: We are going to come over and sit down and bring the \nbipartisan leadership of the committee--there are four of them--bring \nthe bipartisan leadership of the Senate, and let's hammer out \nsomething.\n\n[[Page S2059]]\n\n  What is happening over there? Speaker Boehner is the Speaker of the \nHouse not Speaker of the Republicans. He needs to work with the \nDemocrats. I don't expect they will love each other, my goodness. We \ndon't expect miracles, but we should expect them to work together.\n  I remember fondly my days in the House with Tip O'Neill and Bob \nMichel. Couldn't have better friends. Did they agree on everything? No. \nDid they work on everything? Yes. I remember those days. I was a whip \nat a certain point in the House, and they used to call us together and \nwe would come back and say: There are 25 Democrats who can't vote for \nthis Democratic bill. You know what Tip O'Neill would do? He would say: \nFine, I will call Bob Michel and see if he has 25 votes for me. They \nsaw that they might have had 20 and they didn't have 25 and they had to \ncompromise the bill. And they did it. That is why I decided I loved \nlegislating.\n  I loved working on this bill with my friend Senator Inhofe. I loved \nworking with my staff and his staff. Our staffs became almost like \nfamily. I would encourage Speaker Boehner to take a page out of this \nbook.\n  I see the Senator from Louisiana on the Senate floor. He and I go at \nit on a number of issues. We work together. We even put on this bill \nthe Restore Act--a bipartisan piece of legislation that is going to \nmake sure the gulf can rebuild and get paid back for the suffering that \nwent on there. Did California get a lot out of that? No. But the \ncountry will get a lot out of that because the gulf is a region we care \nabout. It is where we get a lot of our energy. It is where we get a lot \nof our seafood. We need to work together.\n  So Senator Vitter and I don't agree on a lot of subjects, and we go \nat it pretty hard in the committee. But on this we agreed.\n  So let's look at a few others, and then I will yield the floor after \nwe go through the rest of these.\n  ``Highway Bill Would Boost Stability.'' This is Mississippi. This is \none of the reddest States in the Union. I beg Speaker Boehner to open \nhis ears and hear me:\n\n       A two-year, $109 billion highway bill that passed the U.S. \n     Senate this week buoys the hope of interest groups like \n     roadbuilders and the travel industry that the House can be \n     prodded by the Senators' action to pass its own bill before a \n     March 31 expiration date. . . .\n       This bill has no earmarks. . . .\n       Mississippi could derive major benefits.\n       I am just saying, when we have editorials from Mississippi \n     for a bill, we know it is a bipartisan bill.\n\n  Let's take a look at some others: ``A Solid Transportation Bill.'' \nThis comes from Oregon, the Register Guard, an editorial:\n\n       By an impressive bipartisan vote of 74 to 22, the Senate on \n     Wednesday passed a two-year blueprint for transportation. The \n     House should move quickly to approve the Senate measure. If a \n     transportation bill is not approved and signed into law by \n     April 1, the government will lose its ability to pay for \n     Federal transportation projects.\n\n  So now we have Mississippi, Oregon, Illinois, and Ohio. I don't \nremember all that I read.\n  ``Bipartisanship in Senate Moves Transportation Bill.'' This is \nOklahoma, another deeply red State:\n\n       With rare bipartisanship, the U.S. Senate on Wednesday \n     passed a much-needed and much-delayed national transportation \n     bill that could create jobs and fund road projects. . . .\n       The country's infrastructure has been ignored for too long \n     and is in dire straits. This is an important and necessary \n     extension of the transportation bill. It will make needed \n     improvements to our infrastructure, and it is a real job-\n     creator. . . .\n\n  I am telling my colleagues that I am buoyed by these editorials \nbecause these editorials from Republican papers and Democratic papers \nare nonpartisan. They are all urging us to act.\n  ``Transportation Funding Held Hostage in the House.'' Fort Worth \nStar-Telegram, Texas--another red State:\n\n       What an exciting thing to see the Senate pass a surface \n     transportation bill last week on a 74 to 22 vote. Such \n     bipartisan support for maintaining and improving this crucial \n     part of the national infrastructure makes it almost seem like \n     the good old days in Washington. . . .\n       At one point, [House Speaker Boehner] said he would put the \n     Senate bill before the House. Earlier, he said House \n     Republicans might go for an 18-month extension. . . . It's \n     beginning to look like Boehner doesn't have a clue what the \n     House will do. . . .\n       Does this sound familiar? Does it remind you of the \n     congressional follies of last summer, the reality-TV drama \n     and brinksmanship of the debate over raising the federal debt \n     limit.\n\n  I can't reach Speaker Boehner. He doesn't answer my letters. Cantor \ndoesn't answer my letters. They just have spokespeople who put \nsomething out there. What is wrong with talking to each other? What \nhappened to those days?\n  Now, it goes on, and I am going to go through these: ``Pass This \nTransit Bill.'' This one is the Miami Herald:\n\n       In an all too rare display of bipartisanship, the Senate, \n     by a vote of 74 to 22 last week, passed a transportation bill \n     of vital interest to South Florida and the rest of the \n     country. . . .\n       This uncompromising approach is why public approval of \n     Congress stands at 10 percent or below in recent polls. Mr. \n     Boehner should urge the members of his caucus to set aside \n     their job-killing intransigence and accept the bipartisan \n     Senate version before funding runs out.\n\n  So here is the thing--I will wrap up--there is a clear path to \nsuccess, and it is not painful. It is not painful. Speaker Boehner and \nLeader Cantor should abandon their idea of these endless extensions. We \nhave proven today through the State organizations and by talking to \nState officials in all of our States that jobs are already being lost \nbecause of the uncertainty, the dithering--that is my word--and the \nfact that they are talking about extensions. Extensions are no good. \nExtensions mean job losses--41,000 jobs already lost today as of now in \nNorth Carolina and thousands in other States because States do not have \nthe ability to up-front the Federal share. They are counting on us.\n  Our bill is fully paid for in a bipartisan way. Our bill has not one \nearmark. Our bill takes 90 programs down to 30. It is streamlined. It \nis made efficient.\n  We have, in a bipartisan way, added the Restore Act. We added ways to \nfund rural districts for their schools by the timber receipts. This is \na good bill, and this is a bill that is truly a work product of \neveryone in this Chamber. Even those who ended up voting no had \nsomething to do with it and helped us get it through.\n  So there is a clear path. They pulled their 60-day extension off the \nfloor of the House, and that is a good thing. Now they should put the \nSenate bill on the floor and both sides should embrace it and pass it.\n  Let me tell my colleagues a signal it will send to our people at \nhome: It will send a signal of job growth in the future, a signal that \nwe are working together, a signal that we are going to get out of this \nrecession, a signal that we put aside politics for the good of these \nhard-hat workers and the companies that employ them. They deserve it. \nThey got hurt by Wall Street. Everybody in the country did. But for \nthese construction workers, because of all this messing around with \nthese mortgage-backed securities, it killed the construction industry \nand housing.\n  We have a chance to help some of the hardest working people in our \nNation. I call on the House leadership to take a page out of our \nbipartisan book here and pass the Senate bill.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                               Gas Prices\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, this week the majority brought a bill to \nthe floor to talk about gas prices and energy-producing companies. That \nwas yesterday. Today the majority brought another bill and tried to \nmove away from that bill. We ought to be talking about gas prices. We \nshould be talking about what impacts so many families and so many \nbusinesses and so many individuals.\n  I talked to somebody on the phone just yesterday, a friend of mine \nfrom St. Charles, MO, where gasoline is about $3.50 a gallon. That is a \nlittle lower than it is maybe in other places where it is $3.90, the \nnational average, though I am sure we can find a place in St. Charles \nwhere the gas is $3.90. But my friend talked about gas prices, how it \naffects his business, the restaurant business.\n\n  I have said on this floor before, when American families stand before \nthat gas pump and the cost goes from $40 to $50 to $60 to $70, almost \nevery family in America watches those numbers and\n\n[[Page S2060]]\n\nthinks of something they were going to do that week or that weekend \nthat they are not going to do. Certainly, if you are in the restaurant \nbusiness, as my friend is, you know that.\n  But he said: I was at the gas station just yesterday, and there was a \nwoman there in a car with a child. She said: Could you just give me $5? \nI don't think I can get home with the gas I have. I don't have any \nmoney. I need to put a little more than a gallon of gas in the car just \nto know I can get home. Could you put $5 of gas in the car for me?\n  He said: I put $20 of gas in the car. And $20, at $3.90 a gallon--the \nnational average--does not last very long.\n  People who are putting $5 or $10 in their gas tanks are not doing it \nbecause they love to go to the gas station. They are doing it because \nthey cannot afford to put the gas they need in the car to do the things \nthey need to do.\n  The national average hit $3.90 just a day or two ago, and it is on \nthe way up now. It is more than double what it was in January 2009 when \ngasoline was about $1.90 or $1.91 a gallon.\n  People feel this. I cannot think of a meeting I have had in the last \n2 weeks with any group who did not have some story about how energy and \ngas costs were impacting them.\n  Now, why we would have a bill on the Senate floor that would raise \ngasoline prices I have no idea. But that is the bill that is on the \nfloor. I think the idea is that the majority is wanting to blame \nsomebody else rather than the President's energy policies. The American \npeople do not accept that.\n  I asked people in Missouri to talk to me about some of the challenges \nthey are having with these skyrocketing fuel prices. Remember, the \nPresident, in the fall of 2008, said at the San Francisco Chronicle, \nunder his energy policies, energy costs would ``necessarily \nskyrocket.'' So I guess he has to believe his policies are doing \nexactly what he thought they would do. But here is what they are doing \nto people all over America.\n  Trent Drake, a farmer in southwest Missouri, who raises soybeans, \ncorn, wheat, and cattle, told me--of course, like every farm--he is \nheavily dependent on fuel, in his case diesel fuel. His fuel bill went \nup 125 percent over last year. That is more than twice the fuel bill he \nhad last year.\n  Roger Lang, who owns a company, Byron L. Lang Inc., in Jackson, MO, \ntold me a majority of all the profits they are making are now going \nback into paying the fuel costs, which, of course, means they cannot \nlook at profits they made and think: What can we do for better benefits \nor better wages or to hire more employees? They have to think: How much \nhigher is this gasoline bill going to go? How much higher is my energy \nbill going to go under the energy policies we are working under now?\n  According to Roger Lang, if something is not done, he believes this \none issue will end his business. A business his family has been \noperating since 1947 would be ended because we have energy policies \nthat do not make sense.\n  Linda Yaeger, who is the executive director of the Older Adults \nTransportation Service--I do not know what it is called everywhere \nelse; it is called the OATS system in Missouri--provides transportation \nfor seniors and people with disabilities in 87 of our 115 counties.\n  For every penny gas goes up, Linda said it costs her program $15,250. \nFor every penny that gas goes up in 87 counties all over Missouri--\nessentially, for vans and buses that take seniors and handicapped \npeople where they need to go--for every penny gas goes up, it costs \n$15,250. And for every penny that is a loss of the equivalent of 10,000 \none-way trips for the people they serve. Multiply that $15,250 by the \n200 pennies gasoline has gone up in the last 3 years and suddenly we \nhave a budget that does not do what we would hope it could do for the \npeople they serve.\n  The Ozarks Food Harvest in Springfield, MO, where I live is a \nregional food bank that serves one-third of the State of Missouri, \ndelivering about 1 million pounds of food a month. Bart Brown, who runs \nthe Ozarks Food Harvest, cannot, obviously, predict--as none of us \ncan--these gas prices. But they did just have to raise their delivery \ncosts from 4 cents a pound to 6 cents a pound. So there is a 50-percent \nincrease in the delivery costs to the Food Harvest in getting food to \npeople's homes.\n  The charities of America are incredible in their ability to make \nmoney last, to stretch a dollar, to do everything they can to make \ntheir contributions have real impact. The Food Harvest--I have been to \na lot of these food banks, and they benefit from getting food from \npeople who are food producers, the processors who have an overrun or \nthey have a damaged box or they have whatever is still perfectly good, \nbut they are willing to make it available to somebody else because it \ndoes not quite fit the way they do business.\n  But when they have to increase their delivery costs by 50 percent \njust because gas has gone up--gas has gone up 100 percent. So if they \nincrease their delivery costs by 50 percent, I guess they are still \ntrying to make the most of the situation in which they find themselves. \nIt is not the only part of the cost, but it is a big part of the cost. \nThat is going to have a big impact on all the people in one-third of \nthe counties in Missouri that get food from the Ozarks Food Harvest.\n\n  Meanwhile, a lot of my colleagues on the other side have already \nadmitted this tax hike on American energy producers would do nothing to \nlower gas prices. This clearly is a messaging bill. But why, if they \nwere trying to divert attention away from the President's energy \npolicies, they bring this bill to the floor is a surprise to me.\n  In May 2011--a year ago--the bill's sponsor, Senator Menendez, \nacknowledged:\n\n       Nobody has made the claim that this bill is about reducing \n     gas prices.\n\n  Well, why would they be talking about it if they could be spending \nthe same time doing things that would reduce gas prices. The American \npeople believe the government could have an impact on gas prices. I \nbelieve the government could have an impact on gas prices. This bill we \nare talking about is not even designed, according to the sponsor, to \nreduce gas prices.\n  Senator Begich said the proposed tax hikes ``won't decrease prices at \nthe pump for our families and small businesses.'' He may or may not be \nfor the bill, but he certainly has figured out what the bill would do.\n  Senator Baucus noted ``this is not going to change the price at the \ngasoline pump. That's not the issue.''\n  Well, what is the issue? Maybe we ought to figure out what the issue \nis. Families think it is the issue. Families think, when they see that \nsign go up three different times maybe in a week--that the price goes \nup--that there is some issue we ought to be dealing with. Senator \nSchumer admitted this bill ``was never intended to talk about lowering \nprices.''\n  Probably this bill was never even intended to be on the Senate floor. \nI assume the majority brought this bill to the floor thinking \nRepublicans would not want to talk about this topic of whatever tax \npolicies are designed to encourage more American production. But why \nwouldn't we want to talk about that? Why wouldn't we want to have more \nAmerican energy of all kinds?\n  Senator Landrieu told Americans this bill ``will not reduce gasoline \nprices by one penny.'' She is absolutely right.\n  Even the majority leader, who brought the bill to the floor, said \nthis bill ``is not a question of gas prices.''\n  So, really, this bill maybe is not a question of anything we ought to \nbe talking about, so let's talk about what we should be talking about. \nWe ought to be talking about what increases American energy. The \nshortest path to more American jobs is more American energy--the jobs \nthat produce energy and the jobs that benefit from competitive energy \nprices.\n  We are not some little European country. I know in the fall of 2008, \nbefore the President chose him, the Secretary of Energy said our \nproblem was that our gasoline prices were not as high as the gasoline \nprices in Europe, where at that moment they were $8 or $10 a gallon.\n  I do not think that is our problem at all. In fact, we are not a \nEuropean country. We are the United States of America. We are a big \ncountry. Our transportation needs are different. Our energy needs are \ndifferent. We generally do not walk to work or we generally do not only \nbenefit from food\n\n[[Page S2061]]\n\nproducts and other products that come from 5 or 10 miles away. That is \nnot who we are. That is not who we are going to be. We need to have \nenergy policies that work for us.\n  Congressional Republicans in the House and the Senate have long \nsupported a plan that uses all American energy. In fact, at the State \nof the Union Message, one of the few smiles on the Republican side of \nthe aisle that night was when the President said he was for an ``all-\nof-the-above'' energy strategy because that is what we have been for \nfor a long time, and mean it. That can include wind and solar, \nrenewable, biomass, shale gas, shale oil, coal, nuclear--all of the \nabove.\n  It seems to me the message has not gotten through to the regulators \nand the legislators that we need to be doing all we can to find more \nAmerican energy--all of these things, every one I mentioned: Nuclear, \nbig and small; natural gas. We now think we have more natural gas than \nanybody in the world. Let's go after it. Let's use that resource to the \nadvantage of our economy.\n  They all have bipartisan support, and I think there is bipartisan \nsupport for investing in the future. Let's figure out what comes next \nin the energy world, but it will not come quickly, and our economy \ncould not afford for it to come quickly. If we decide: OK, tomorrow we \nare not going to drive cars powered by gasoline, that would be a huge \nmistake. It would be an equally huge mistake if we decided 10 years \nfrom tomorrow none of us will be driving cars powered by gasoline. We \ndo not even know what the next power source will be. We are going to \nuse these fossil fuels for a while, and we should use them to our \nbenefit.\n  Instead, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to talk \nabout raising taxes on domestic energy and domestic energy \nmanufacturers--tax hikes that absolutely will be passed along to \nconsumers. Some of these things in the Tax Code are to encourage \nAmerican energy production. There is energy all over the world. Why \nwouldn't we want to encourage the energy production jobs to be here \nrather than somewhere else?\n\n  I know the President said we are going to give money to Brazil, and \nwe want them to drill in the deep water, and we will be glad to buy \nsome of their oil and gas when they produce it. But why would that be \nour alternative when we could, in fact, do things that encourage \nAmerican energy production or, if it is not from the United States of \nAmerica, what about our neighbors? The Keystone Pipeline--80,000 \nbarrels of oil a day is going to go somewhere because they are going to \nuse that resource to their benefit, and it is either that the pipeline \nis going to come south to our refineries or it is going to go west and \nbe sold to Asia.\n  Why we would not want the 20,000 jobs to build that pipeline--not \ntaxpayer-paid jobs but jobs for people who pay taxes, working for \ncompanies that pay taxes--why we would not want those jobs to be right \nhere in the United States rather than in Canada, sending that pipeline \nwest to eventually have that same oil sold to Asia, is a mystery to me.\n  If the President wants to support an ``all-of-the-above'' energy \nstrategy, he should stop blocking all this energy. The President should \nwork to enable all sources of energy we have in the United States. The \nbest place for us to meet our own energy needs is right here. The next \nbest place is our best trading partner, our biggest trading partner, \nour closest neighbor, Canada. Then even the Mexican energy appears to \nbe on a rebound in a positive way that could benefit us.\n  Let's be as independent as we can be on energy and the energy that \nrelates most directly to American jobs.\n  The responsible development of more domestic energy will help create \njobs, bring down prices at the pump, and position our country to have \ngreater energy security. The shortest path to more American jobs is \nmore American energy. Let's get on that path instead of this path that \nis discouraging the very thing that can help us the most.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I too come to the floor to talk about the \nmost pressing issue facing so many millions of Louisiana and American \nfamilies; that is, the price at the pump. Sometimes we seem to get \nourselves in a cocoon in Washington, DC, divorced from the real world.\n  We need to reconnect to the real world. Back in Louisiana, \nPennsylvania, and every State across the country, middle-class, lower \nmiddle-class families are struggling with this ever-increasing price at \nthe pump. When President Obama was sworn into office a little over 3 \nyears ago, that price was about $1.84 a gallon. Today, it is over \ndouble that, $3.80 and beyond.\n  That is a big hit to American families. That hits folks where it \ncounts and where it hurts--in the wallet, in the pocketbook, in the \nfamily budget. All around Louisiana families are huddled around the \nkitchen table trying to figure out how to make it work because \ngasoline, transportation, driving is not a luxury. Sure, they can cut \nback a little bit, but for the most part it is a real necessity; it is \ngoing to work; it is getting the kids to school; it is doing absolute \nnecessities.\n  This is a big hit to middle-class, lower middle-class families' \nbudgets and wallets and pocketbooks. So let me suggest the obvious; \nthat we focus on what truly matters to American families, that we focus \non that in the Senate, here in Washington, and we do something about \nthat.\n  That is why I favored moving to the Menendez bill on the Senate \nfloor. That is why I voted against moving off the bill today, not \nbecause I agree with that solution--it is not a solution--but at least \nwe can talk about the topic, at least we can offer amendments on what \nis to millions of Louisiana and American families the biggest day-to-\nday challenge they face; that is, that ever-increasing price at the \npump.\n  The Menendez ``solution,'' the Democratic plan, will not help bring \ndown the price at the pump. In fact, it will do the opposite. I think \nthe American people with good old-fashioned American common sense get \nit. Look, we can love the oil companies, we can hate the oil companies, \nbut the Menendez bill increases taxes on U.S. energy companies and on \nU.S. energy production.\n  It increases taxes on those folks and on that activity. What do we \nthink is going to be the result of that in terms of the price at the \npump. The American people know. The American people get it. It is \nobvious. It is going to increase the price at the pump. It is certainly \nnot going to leave it alone or decrease it. Why? It is economics 101. \nWhen we give business a new additional cost, almost all the time that \nis going to be passed on to the consumer.\n  The American people get that. They see that. They feel it. They deal \nwith it every day. Also, when we increase taxes on something, we \nproduce less of it in the market. In this case, the Menendez bill is \nincreasing taxes on energy production, in particular, ironically, U.S. \nenergy production, which I thought we wanted to increase and maximize.\n  So when we tax something more, we get less of it. Supply goes down. \nGuess what happens when supply goes down and demand is the same. Price \ngoes up. So I not only agree with, but I go further than some of the \nDemocrats who were quoted by the previous speaker saying this bill is \nnot about reducing the price at the pump. It is not only about not \nreducing the price at the pump, it will have the impact of increasing \nthe price at the pump.\n  Conservatives have a different suggestion that will decrease the \nprice at the pump; that is, to use the resources we have in this \ncountry, to open our ability to use those energy resources, to produce \nmore good U.S. American energy for ourselves, to increase supply, and \nto thereby lower the price at the pump. We can do that and we should do \nthat.\n  A lot of Americans do not realize the United States is actually the \nmost energy-rich country in the world, bar none. When we look at total \nenergy resources, when we compare countries in terms of their total \nenergy resources, the United States is the richest in energy, bar none. \nThis chart shows that. The United States is top. Russia comes second. \nSaudi Arabia is third. But look at Saudi Arabia and all Middle Eastern \ncountries--way below our total U.S. energy resources. We are very rich \nin terms of energy.\n  This map shows just how rich we are in terms of U.S. resources. We \nhave\n\n[[Page S2062]]\n\nenormous recoverable natural gas, particularly with new technology and \nhorizontal drilling that has been developed. That is these green \ncircles. That represents, conservative estimate, 88 years of natural \ngas using just that for U.S. use.\n  We have enormous recoverable oil--again, very conservative estimates. \nBut in the gulf, where we do produce, also on the east and west coast \nand Alaska, there is lots of oil, and we have enormous recoverable oil \nfrom shale, particularly out West. That is being blocked now. It is \noff-limits. But we have these resources.\n  The problem is--and I said we are the single most energy-rich country \nin the world, bar none. We are. The problem is we are the only country \nin the world that puts well over 90 percent of our resources off-\nlimits. We are the only country that does that. East coast production, \nno, absolutely not; west coast production, no--big red no; ANWR, Alaska \nNational Wildlife Refuge, where we could access millions of acres of \nlands from a very select footprint, smaller than an area the size of \nDulles Airport in suburban Virginia, no; western shale production, \nwhere we saw so much of the resource potential on the previous map, no; \neven production in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, no. Under Federal law, \nbecause of this administration, because of this Senate, we keep saying \nno, no, no to our U.S. resources.\n\n  A good example of that is President Obama's 5-year lease plan for \noffshore production. Under Federal law, every President has to develop \nand issue a 5-year plan about leasing the Outer Continental Shelf \noffshore. President Obama's 5-year plan is half of the previous plan. \nWe have very little we are able to touch as it is, and President Obama \nhas backed us up from this, has turned us around, moved us in the wrong \ndirection from there. His plan is literally half the previous plan. So \nwe are moving there in absolutely the wrong direction.\n  This map shows that. This map is what was available for potential \ndrilling under the previous plan. We were finally moving forward on the \neast coast, on the west coast, offshore Alaska. We have been in the \ngulf. But under President Obama's very different lease plan, we are \nback to saying no, no, no, no, no, no--backing up, moving in the wrong \ndirection.\n  We are moving in the wrong direction in other areas too under this \nadministration. In the Gulf of Mexico near where I live, traditionally, \nthe area where we produce the most U.S. energy, even in the Gulf of \nMexico we are moving in the wrong direction. Production is down 17 \npercent in 2011. It is projected to go down more in 2012. Permitting is \ndown over 40 percent compared to the pre-BP levels of permitting. I \nknow with the BP disaster there had to be a quick pause. We had to \nchange some rules. But it is still down over 40 percent. Production is \ndown 17 percent in one of the few areas we allow activity. We cannot \nafford that. We need to produce more good U.S. energy.\n  Oil production on Federal property, again, is down on all Federal \nproperty, down 14 percent. Federal offshore is down 17 percent in the \nlast couple years. We need to do better.\n  Of course, perhaps the clearest example of this approach to energy by \nPresident Obama is his recent veto of the Keystone Pipeline, a true \nshovel-ready project, truly ready to go. It is not U.S. energy, but it \nis the next best thing, from our biggest trading partner, a very good \nfriend and reliable trading partner, Canada. The President has vetoed \nit and with it the 20,000 jobs it would have created--no; 700,000 \nbarrels a day of oil from Canada, no; $7 billion of economic investment \nwhen we are trying to come out of this horribly weak economy, no; help \nto lower prices at the pump, no--again, No, no, no, no, no, no.\n  We can do better. We can do better as a country. We certainly can do \nbetter in Washington and say yes. We can do better by accessing more \ndomestic energy resources. Again, we are the most energy-rich country \nin the world, bar none. But we are the only country that puts over 90 \npercent of that off-limits. We need to change that. We can create more \ngreat U.S. jobs. Let us say yes to that. By the way, those are jobs \nwhich by definition cannot be outsourced to China or India or anywhere \nelse.\n  If we are creating energy in the United States, that job has to stay \nin the United States. We can build greater energy independence. Let us \nsay yes to that. We can dramatically increase revenue to the Federal \nGovernment and thereby reduce deficits and debt. After the Federal \nincome tax, the second biggest source of revenue the Federal Government \nhas is revenue on domestic energy production, those royalties, second \nonly to the Federal income tax.\n  Let's say yes to that new revenue, deficit and debt reduction, and we \ncan help lower the price at the pump because supply does matter. \nIncreasing supply does matter. It will lower prices.\n  Again, I disagree with the Menendez approach. The Menendez approach \nwill increase the price at the pump and increase taxes on an industry \nand that is going to be passed on to the consumer. Taxing something \nmore produces less of it. Less oil means the price goes up. But we can \nhave an American solution. We can open access to our own resources and \nthereby gain control of our own future. We do not have to beg Saudi \nArabian princes. We can regain control of our own destiny and our own \nfuture. Let's do it. The American people want us to do it. Common sense \ndictates that we do it. Let's move forward together and do it for the \ngood of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to join \nmy colleagues who were here earlier to talk about the bipartisan \nSenate-passed Transportation bill. I give credit to Senator Barbara \nBoxer, Chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and Senator \nInhofe from Oklahoma, the ranking member, for all of their good work on \nthis legislation. They joined three other committees that also passed \ntheir portions of the bill with strong bipartisan support.\n  I think we could all agree that transportation is one of the Federal \nGovernment's core responsibilities. It has been far too long since \nCongress updated and reformed Federal transportation programs. Every \ncommittee that worked on the Senate's long-term Transportation bill \npassed it with a strong bipartisan vote. When the bill came to the \nfloor, 74 Senators from both parties voted in favor of the \nTransportation bill.\n  Now I urge the House of Representatives to follow our lead in the \nSenate and act on a long-term bipartisan transportation bill. I think \nthey ought to take up the Senate bill. The Senate's Transportation bill \nis about strong bridges, good jobs, and dependable roads that \nbusinesses count on to move goods and reach customers.\n  The Senate bill reauthorizes transportation programs for 2 years, it \nmaintains current funding levels, and it does not increase gas taxes. \nRepeating that, it doesn't increase gas taxes, and it is fully funded. \nCutting funding for transportation right now would be a very dangerous \nchoice.\n  We are seeing emerging economies, such as China and India, spending \nroughly 9 percent of their gross domestic product per year on roads, \nbridges, public transportation, and infrastructure. At the same time, \nin the United States, we are spending about 2 percent. That is half of \nwhat we were spending in the sixties. At this rate, we will not be able \nto stay competitive with the rest of the world. That is a macro reason \nwhy we need to pass the Transportation bill. The bill is fully paid \nfor, it doesn't increase the deficit, and most of the funding comes, as \nusual, from the gas tax.\n  To make up the gap in funding, we came up with bipartisan ways, \nincluding stiffer penalties on tax delinquents and by shifting unused \nfunds designated to clean up underground storage tanks.\n  The Senate's Transportation bill is about making our investments more \nefficient so that we spend less on overhead and more on roads and \nbridges. I think several people have talked about the fact that this is \na good time for States to be able to borrow. There are low interest \nrates. We can get a lot for our money. That is what I heard in New \nHampshire when I talked to our transportation officials, that interest \nrates are very low right now.\n\n[[Page S2063]]\n\n  This bipartisan bill streamlines the number of Federal transportation \nprograms from over 90 to 30. For the first time it requires States to \ncollect data so we can measure what kind of bang we are getting for our \nbuck. Not only is it a reform bill that is more efficient, but it is \nmore accountable. I think that is why groups from the AFL CIO to the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce support this bill. They have come together to \nsupport a bill that is truly bipartisan and that would support nearly 2 \nmillion jobs nationwide and, in my State of New Hampshire, about 6,600.\n  There have been a lot of reports about the difficulties facing the \nHouse in finding an agreement on a transportation bill. I think the \nSenate has provided a very good model that maintains current funding \nlevels and avoids an increase in both the deficit and gas taxes.\n  What we need now is for the House to join the Senate and produce a \nreasonable, bipartisan, long-term transportation bill that can give \nlocal governments and businesses some certainty before the height of \nthe construction season. State and local transportation projects budget \nand plan based on the idea that the Federal Government will provide a \nconsistent level of long-term funding. When you are planning a \nmultimillion dollar project that employs hundreds of people, it is \ncritical to know what your budget is going to be more than just a \ncouple months in advance. We would not run a business that way, and we \nshould not expect the government to run that way.\n  If the House doesn't pass a bipartisan, long-term, transportation \nbill, States and towns won't have the certainty they need from us in \nWashington to plan their projects and improve their systems.\n  According to numerous studies, deteriorating infrastructure costs \nbusinesses more than $100 billion a year in lost productivity. This is \nno time to stall programs that encourage economic growth and create the \nclimate that our businesses need to succeed.\n  In New Hampshire, we have seen firsthand the real-world consequences \nof uncertainty in Federal transportation funding. Our Interstate 93 \ncorridor runs from the capital in Concord down to the Massachusetts \nborder. It runs pretty much the length of the State. Right now we have \na project underway that would spur economic development in the southern \nhalf of that highway. It has been underway for several years, but the \npace of the project has lagged because there has been no certainty \naround our highway bill.\n  It has been impossible for businesses and developers around the I 93 \ncorridor to predict the future of the project. At a time when the \nnumber of people working in the construction industry in New Hampshire \nis the lowest in a decade, it is unacceptable that we cannot provide \ncertainty for this project. We know highway projects like Interstate 93 \nproduce good jobs. New Hampshire's Department of Transportation has \nsaid that just one section of Interstate 93, between exits 2 and 3 \nclose to the Massachusetts border, created 369 construction jobs.\n  All around the country, there are projects just like Interstate 93 \nthat are stalled while we wait for the House to pass a bipartisan long-\nterm transportation bill. We need to come together and make the Federal \ninvestments that are necessary to get these projects moving and get \npeople back to work. Investing in transportation creates jobs and the \nconditions that our companies need to succeed. It is, as the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce says, a core function of government. It should not \nbe an issue for politics or partisanship.\n  I urge the House to take up the Senate bill. Congress needs to work \ntogether to pass a transportation reauthorization bill before the March \n31 deadline.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the new Federal \nregulation that many may or may not be aware of. According to the \nDepartment of Justice, every swimming pool of ``public accommodation,'' \nmeaning any pool at a hotel, motel, lodging establishment, recreation \ncenter, YMCA, apartment complex, condominium complex, school, or \ncommunity pool, is to install a large, expensive permanent pool lift \nfor the disabled, or else face steep fines from the Department of \nJustice and the threat of lawsuits.\n\n  We must make sure that we have accommodations for the disabled in \nevery public place. This is happening around the country. But to do \nthis with very little thought of the implications and the cost and the \nactual service to the disabled is a huge problem.\n  As we have seen time and time again, one-size-fits-all mandates from \nWashington don't work. We want public pools to have the flexibility to \nwork with people with disabilities to ensure success.\n  On January 31 of this year, 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice \nCivil Rights Division published revised requirements for swimming pools \nand their means of entry and exit. This was 2 months ago.\n  The DOJ has now put forth new requirements for all facilities ``of \npublic accommodation'' that go beyond those contained in the final rule \nissued in 2010 giving hotels and other residential communities \ninsufficient time to comply with this burdensome new rule.\n  We need to think about it for a minute, because their lack of \nplanning here is pretty evident by the fact that they are suggesting \nthat this already be in place in less than 2 months, when the equipment \nis not even available in the country to do it. So it is clear that they \nhave not thought through how to best serve the disabled, how to make \nsure that these services are available, and to do it in a way that does \nnot put an undue burden on businesses that want to provide this \nservice.\n  Senator Graham and I have a bill that nullifies the requirement and \nstops the Attorney General from enforcing this requirement or any \n``guidance'' associated with it. It also prevents against any third \nparty using this rule or guidance in any manner.\n  To be clear, our bill will allow public pools to work directly with \npeople with disabilities to meet their specific needs. Hotels, motels, \nand other public pools already have financial incentives to meet the \nneeds of people with disabilities that use their facilities. They have \nbeen working diligently to do that. Our bill simply says the DOJ should \nnot impose a national mandate for a one-size-fits-all solution that may \nnot be appropriate for every facility.\n  This new burdensome rule seriously changes the obligations of public \nfacilities around the country. There are an estimated 309,000 public \nspas and pools in the United States. The number of businesses--and not \njust the large hotels and resorts--that will have to comply is \nstaggering.\n  The rule requires a permanent pool lift be installed for every pool \nor spa. So if a hotel, resort, or community association has more than \none pool, they will have to get multiple lifts, instead of what is \nbeing done now, which is using a portable lift that can be moved around \nthe facilities as needed.\n  A pool lift can run from $4,000 to $10,000, and the installation \ncould run $5,000 to $10,000, depending on how much work needs to be \ndone. So we are talking about billions of dollars being spent on \nsomething that could perhaps help the disabled but also become an \nobstacle and danger to others using the pool if this is not thought out \nand done in a careful manner.\n  The last thing we need to do right now is to add burdensome rules and \nrequirements on businesses across the country. Hotel owners want to \nwork in good faith to make sure pools are accessible to everybody, but \nwe have to make sure that here at the Federal level we are not killing \noff more businesses by imposing mandates.\n  Mandates such as these are burdensome on businesses, and we all know \nthese costs will be passed on to consumers--including the disabled--in \nthe form of higher hotel costs for rooms and services.\n  The Department of Justice has left many questions from the hotel \nindustry and others unanswered on issues such as compliance ability, \ntimeframe, and economic cost, as well as rising insurance premiums.\n  It is clear that the deadline for compliance should be extended to \nallow hotels and other places of public accommodation flexibility in \nproviding access to guests with disabilities. We should start over. \nThey have given a 60-day relief period, but that is not enough time for \nthis to be planned or for the equipment to be manufactured. The \ncompanies cannot comply in this period of time.\n\n[[Page S2064]]\n\n  We need to guarantee that services are available to the disabled, but \nthe quickest way to do the wrong thing is the way the Justice \nDepartment is doing it now. So instead of us letting this go into \neffect and letting large fines be put on businesses all around the \ncountry, even community pools and YMCAs, let's set this judgment aside \nby unanimous consent today, and if we want to debate and work with the \nDepartment of Justice to come up with a rule that works for the \ndisabled and works for America, we can do that. But I have a unanimous \nconsent request here that I wish to read.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 336, S. 2191, that the bill be read a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill appear at this point in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as one of the Senators who wrote the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act and whose name appears as the lead \nsponsor of that bill that was passed 22 years ago, I oppose Senator \nDeMint's effort to bypass the regular order and to amend the ADA to \nremove the ability of the Justice Department to regulate the \naccessibility of swimming pools. Twenty-two years have passed and \nperiodically things such as this come up, but I believe the ADA has \nwithstood the test of time.\n  We look around at an America that has been transformed, not just for \nthe disabled but for everyone. Everyone utilizes universal design now \nin the fact that things are easily accessible for everyone. When we \ninitially started putting in ramps, we thought only people using \nwheelchairs would use those ramps. I ask anyone here, go out and watch \nwho uses those ramps. It is not just people in wheelchairs. The elderly \nuse it, mothers with baby carriages use those ramps. You would be \namazed how many people find those ramps a lot easier than climbing up \nand down stairs. That is one example. But I want to be clear about what \nis at stake here.\n  The Americans With Disabilities Act is a civil rights law that \nguarantees equal rights and equal opportunities for individuals with \ndisabilities. Senator DeMint's legislation attempts to interfere with \nthe Justice Department's ability to enforce the statute, a civil rights \nstatute. Again, it would be a dangerous precedent for the Senate to \nset, and that is why I object to his bill. Let me get to the point here \non the swimming pools.\n  In September of 2010, the Justice Department published final \nregulations implementing title II and title III of the ADA. These new \nregulations addressed a number of issues that have arisen over the past \n22 years, one of those being access to swimming pools and other \nrecreational facilities. The requirement that has prompted Senator \nDeMint's bill has to do with swimming pool accessibility.\n  Under the new regulations, newly constructed or altered pools covered \nby the ADA are required to provide at least one accessible means of \nentry into the water for people with disabilities, which must either be \na sloped entry into the water or a pool lift that is capable of being \nindependently operated by a person with a disability. Larger pools--\npools larger than 300 feet in length, which is a big pool, Olympic \nsize--are required to provide a second accessible means of entry. \nAgain, these were promulgated in September of 2010, so it has been \nalmost 1\\1/2\\ years. These requirements apply in the case of a newly \nconstructed pool or one that has been significantly altered as a part \nof a renovation. Again, new pools or pools undergoing significant \nrenovation.\n  In addition, since the ADA requires that public accommodations remove \narchitectural barriers where it is readily achievable to do so, some \nexisting public accommodations may be required to also increase access \nto pools for people with disabilities under title III's readily \nachievable standard. Let me repeat: readily achievable standard. The \nreadily achievable standard is not one-size-fits-all. I heard my friend \nfrom South Carolina saying this is a one-size-fits-all. That is not so. \nIt is a very flexible standard.\n  For example, if the equipment is not available--I heard Senator \nDeMint say the equipment may not even be available. If it is not \navailable, by definition it is not readily achievable and, therefore, \nnot required by the ADA. If it is not available, by definition it is \nnot readily achievable. So it is not a one-size-fits-all. It is very \nflexible. It means ``without much difficulty or expense.'' That is the \nlaw.\n  So what constitutes readily achievable in a particular case is an \nindividualized analysis based on a number of factors, such as what the \ncost would be, the resources of the entity involved. In short, it is \nwhat a business can afford to do. So readily achievable for a Fairmont \nHotel would be a lot different than readily achievable for a mom-and-\npop motel that has a small swimming pool--much different. It is what \nthe business can afford to do.\n  I know the American Hotel and Lodging Association has been upset \nabout the application of this readily achievable standard and what \ntheir members may be required to do. But again, keep in mind, the pool \nrequirements from September of 2010 were required to go into effect by \nMarch 15 of this year, 1\\1/2\\ years later. But there were some \nmisunderstandings, and so the Department of Justice has extended the \ndeadline to May 21. Again, I understand that the Justice Department has \nissued a notice of proposed rulemaking asking for comments about \nextending the deadline an additional 4 months, until September 17 of \nthis year. The deadline for those written comments is April 4. Again, \nthe process is working just as it has worked for the last 22 years.\n  When we were working on the ADA back in the 1980s, we heard from a \nnumber of industries that requiring accessibility for entities such as \nrestaurants, retail stores, theaters was going to create serious \nproblems for small businesses. I remember having numerous hearings in \nmy subcommittee about that. So in an effort to address this concern and \nto help small businesses comply with the ADA, we created a disabled \naccess tax credit. We heard Senator DeMint talk about the costs, but we \ninstituted a tax credit in the IRS Code.\n\n  The two sides: For businesses with 30 or fewer full-time employees or \nwith total revenues of $1 million or less per year, they get a tax \ncredit. It can be used for adaptations to existing facilities. The \namount of credit is 50 percent of eligible access expenditures. It is \nup to $5,000 a year. I don't know what a lift might cost. I think the \nfigures my friend used were a little high, but let's say it costs \n$10,000. You get a tax credit of up to 5,000 for that, so it really \nonly costs you up to $5,000. You get a 50-percent tax credit for that.\n  In addition, section 190 of the IRS Code provides a tax deduction. \nFor businesses of all sizes for costs incurred in removing barriers to \nmeet the requirements of the ADA, the maximum deduction is $15,000 per \nyear that they can deduct. So these two tax incentives certainly help \nthe hotel industry offset any expenses associated with installing \naccess to swimming pools.\n  Again, I want to say the rule does not require a permanent pool lift, \nas my friend from South Carolina said. That is not so. It is a flexible \nstandard under readily achievable. If it is not readily achievable for \nexisting pools, it is not required. So if you had a mom-and-pop motel \nwith a very small swimming pool, if a permanent lift is not readily \nachievable under the outlines I have just stated, then it is not \nrequired.\n  Again, we have had 22 years, a lot of court cases. Some went to the \nSupreme Court. Then in 2008, this body unanimously--without one \ndissenting vote, this body and the House passed the ADA Act amendments \nto overcome three rulings by the Supreme Court. We passed it \nunanimously. The second President Bush signed it into law. And, again, \nwe moved the ball forward in making this country more accessible for \neveryone, including people with disabilities. So as I say, it has stood \nthe test of time. There is no reason to curtail the Department of \nJustice enforcement authority. There is no reason to bypass the regular \nprocess and to do what Senator DeMint is trying to address.\n  Let's remember how popular the accessible improvements that the ADA \nrequired turned out to be for all Americans. I mentioned earlier the \ncurb cuts, elevators, captioning on television\n\n[[Page S2065]]\n\nscreens, all of the things that seem to be commonplace today that we \ntake for granted.\n  I am confident that the improvements in swimming pool access that \nthese new regulations will require will turn out to be popular. \nActually, they may turn out to be very popular with hotel guests who \ndon't have disabilities. But think about it in terms of families who \nare traveling--it may be an adult, may even be a child with a \ndisability, and they want to use the hotel pool, yet there is not a \nlift or there is not a ramp. So one person from that family is barred \nfrom using those facilities.\n  As I said, keep in mind, it is readily achievable. If it is not \nreadily achievable, they don't have to do it. That is why I objected to \nSenator DeMint's request to bypass the regular process. I hope the \nJustice Department will continue. I don't have a view one way or the \nother on the extension to September. If the Justice Department feels \nthat is okay and most of the comments that have come in ask for that \nextension, I see nothing wrong with extending it another 5 or 6 months. \nBut at some point the law must take hold, and we have to meet our \nobligations to remove the barriers to accessibility in our country. We \nhave come a long way since the ADA. Let's continue the wonderful \nprogress we have made in the last 22 years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n Increasing American Jobs Through Greater Exports To Africa Act Of 2012\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my colleagues Senator Boozman and Senator \nCoons and I are on the floor to speak to an issue relative to Africa. \nIt is my understanding the majority leader is coming to the floor to \nmake a unanimous consent request. With the understanding of my \ncolleagues that we will interrupt our presentation for his request, I \nthink we can proceed, if it meets with the approval of my colleagues. \nSince I was the last to arrive, I want to defer to Senator Coons and \nSenator Boozman to start the conversation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with Senator Durbin and Senator Boozman for up to 30 minutes. \nAnd, as Senator Durbin indicated, we will suspend when Leader Reid \narrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. I want to briefly lay the groundwork for the conversation \nwe are going to have in this colloquy about the Increasing American \nJobs Through Greater Exports to Africa Act of 2012, of which Senator \nDurbin is the lead sponsor and Senator Boozman and I have joined him as \noriginal sponsors.\n  The core question is, what is it about the rapid growth in Africa and \nthe economic opportunity in Africa that should concern Americans, that \nshould concern our constituents at home, and that should occupy our \ntime and attention.\n  Back on November 1 of last year, the African Affairs Subcommittee of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee delved into this. Senator Durbin, \nSenator Isakson, and I looked hard at the ongoing developments in \nAfrica. As this first chart suggests, there has been a dramatic change \nin the amount of exports from China to Africa relative to the exports \nfrom the United States to Africa. In fact, since 2000, Chinese exports \nto Africa have outgrown U.S. exports to Africa by a more than 3-to-1 \nratio.\n  Why does that matter? Why does it matter if American workers and \nAmerican companies are losing out on a continent that I think many \nAmericans view as having relatively modest opportunity? Frankly, Africa \nis a continent of enormous opportunity. In fact, out of the 10 fastest \ngrowing economies in the last decade, 6 of them were in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica. That is not a widely known fact. So part of why I lay this \ngroundwork to start this colloquy is to help folks who are watching at \nhome and to help our colleagues understand why Senator Durbin has taken \nthe lead in making sure that we focus America's efforts on \nstrengthening our exports to Africa, a continent of enormous \nopportunity.\n  Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to my colleague from Delaware that the Commerce \nDepartment estimates we can create jobs here in America capitalizing on \nthe opportunities in Africa, and that is a good starting point in the \nmidst of a recession, to know that in Delaware, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, \nand Illinois there are jobs to be created, good-paying jobs right here \nat home, taking advantage of these export markets.\n  The chart Senator Coons has brought to the floor at this point \nindicates the dramatic growth that is occurring right now in Africa, \nand I think it would surprise a lot of people, as he said, who believe \nthis is still a continent which is struggling with age-old problems.\n  In the past 10 years, 6 of the world's 10 fastest growing economies \nwere located in Sub-Saharan Africa, and in the next 5 years it is \nexpected that 7 of the world's 10 fastest growing economies will be in \nSub-Saharan Africa.\n  The bill which we are bringing here is an effort to focus America's \nexport market on this great continent and this great opportunity, \ncreating jobs at home and a better working relationship with the \ncountries and leaders of Africa.\n  I went to Ethiopia last year and met with the Prime Minister of \nEthiopia. As I have done in the times when I have traveled to other \ncountries, I asked: What has been the impact of China on your country? \nWe stayed and spoke for another 30 minutes as he explained to me the \ndramatic changes taking place in Ethiopia because of China.\n  The numbers tell the story. When we look at what China offers to \nEthiopia and the continent of Africa, they are offering concessional \nloans. What it means is, if it is a $100 million project that you need \nto start in Africa, the Chinese will give you $100 million and say \n``but you only have to pay back $70 million.'' What a great deal that \nis, a 30-percent discount--with a few conditions: that you use Chinese \nengineers and Chinese construction companies and half the workers will \nbe coming over to your country from China.\n  They are building a base of economic support within Africa. Between \n2008 and 2010, China provided more to the developing world than the \nWorld Bank, loans totaling more than $110 billion. What we are \nsuggesting is that as this is a growing opportunity for exports, we \nneed to grow with it.\n  I would like to yield to my colleague from Arkansas who has been kind \nenough to join us in this effort.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. I thank the Senator from Illinois for doing that. It is \na pleasure being with him and the Senator from Delaware. I think this \nis a good example of working together. The name of the game now is \njobs, jobs, jobs, and exports mean jobs. The other people being so very \nhelpful to our colleagues--in the House, Congressman Chris Smith, and \nalso Bobby Rush from Illinois. These guys have been very helpful. Then, \nDon Payne, who is my former ranking member and chairman who recently \npassed away, I know he would be very pleased with this effort.\n  I have had the opportunity to travel to Africa on many occasions, \nbeing on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and now being in the \nSenate. It is interesting. You go to these places--the Senator \nmentioned this--you go to these places and all they want to do is talk \nabout trade. They like American products. They want American products. \nI was part of the first delegation to visit South Sudan. Here they are, \nthis small, struggling country and again all they want to do is talk \nabout trade.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to suspend our \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope I am not interrupting anything that \ncannot be restarted in a short time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2065-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2065-S2068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1905\n\n  Mr. REID.

Reserving the right to object, I am amazed the majority \nparty objects to an amendment that simply restates the Constitution. \nOur Founding Fathers feared granting power to declare war to the \nExecutive. They were quite concerned that the Executive can become like \na King. Many in this body could not get boots on the ground fast enough \nin a variety of places, from Syria to Libya to Iran. We don't just send \nboots to war; we send our young Americans to war. Our young men and \nwomen, our soldiers, deserve thoughtful debate. Before sending our \nyoung men and women into combat, we should have a mature and thoughtful \ndebate over the ramifications of war, over the advisability of war, and \nover the objectives of the war. James Madison wrote:\n\n       . . . that the Constitution supposes what history \n     demonstrates, that the Executive is a branch most interested \n     in war, and most prone to it. Therefore, the Constitution, \n     with studied care, vested that power in the legislature.\n\n  My amendment is one sentence long. It states that nothing in this act \nis to be construed as a declaration of war or as an authorization of \nthe use of military force in Iran or Syria.\n  I urge that we not begin a new war without a full debate, without a \nvote, without careful consideration of the ramifications of a third or \neven a fourth war in this past decade. I, therefore, respectfully, \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am terribly disappointed. There is nothing \nin the resolution that talks about war; in fact, it is quite to the \ncontrary. It is unfortunate. I know, I read the Constitution a few \ntimes. My friend says he wants to restate the Constitution. That is a \nstrange version he just stated. I don't see that anyplace in the \nConstitution. So I am deeply disappointed the Senate was not able to \nenact additional critical sanctions against the Republic of Iran.\n  The sanctions that came out of the Banking Committee unanimously are \na key to our work to stop Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and \nthreatening Israel and jeopardizing the U.S. national security. It is a \nbipartisan bill which passed unanimously out of the Senate Banking \nCommittee. It would have had much needed new sanctions put in place \nright now, as we speak. We could pass this legislation this minute if \nthe minority would drop their opposition. We can't afford to delay \nthese sanctions or slow down this process in any way. I am willing to \nmove this bill without amendment also at any time.\n  I say to my friend, whom I respect, I say to my friend, if there are \nadditional things that should be done--I was told this morning that \nRepublicans want to offer amendments to this unanimous consent request. \nI said, no, because Democrats want to also. But we are satisfied with \nwhere we are. This is a wonderful piece of legislation, done on a \nbipartisan basis in the Banking Committee. If people, such as my \nfriend, the junior Senator from Kentucky, want to do more, as do my \nfriends from this side and the Republican side, let's come up with \nsomething else. But I think not to do this is unfortunate.\n  We are slowing down these sanctions. This is not a declaration of war \nor even anywhere within the neighborhood of that. We are slowing down \nthese sanctions. That I believe is the way to avoid war. I am willing \nto move this bill without amendments, at any time, I repeat. I am \nhopeful my Republican colleagues will see the light and realize how \nimportant it is to advance this measure and prevent Iran from obtaining \nnuclear weapons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we can resume the \ncolloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. At this point, I yield to the Senator from Arkansas, if \nhe would like to conclude his remarks.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. I thank the Senator from Illinois. Again, I was making \nthe point that as we go to these African countries that want American \nproducts, whether it is the newest country in Africa, South Sudan, or \nthe older countries, and we need to have the ability to supply them. \nBoth Senators have mentioned China. China is certainly lurking out \nthere. Again, it is not only China; it is India and a number of other \ncountries. The Senator might want to comment on that. Senator Coons.\n  Mr. COONS. Senator Boozman is right. There is a real challenge to the \nUnited States in Africa, and it is not just a economic challenge. We \nface competition from China, from Russia, from Brazil, from India, from \nother rapidly growing countries.\n  But there is also a values change because, frankly, in countries I \nvisited--and I know both Senators, in their service to the public in \nthe House and Senate, have visited more countries on the continent than \nI have--but I am concerned that China's agenda in Africa is sometimes \ndifferent from ours. It is not a values agenda. They are not there to \npromote democracy, tolerance, transparency, protection of intellectual \nproperty from piracy, from counterfeiting. There are lots of different \nthings we advance in partnership with trade opportunities that are not \npart of their issues and are not part of what they try to advance. I am \nimpressed Senator Durbin has pulled together an all-of-government \nstrategy for dealing with this opportunity, and I would be interested \nin hearing more about how the mechanics of this bill would actually \nwork to deploy all the great resources of the American Government.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This bill develops a comprehensive strategy to coordinate \nthe agencies of our Government in helping U.S. businesses export to \nAfrica. Currently, the U.S. export promotion and financing regime is a \npatchwork of overlapping, loosely coordinated, and maybe in some cases \nwasteful efforts that are difficult for U.S. businesses to navigate and \ntoo often unresponsive to the real needs of real businesses.\n  This bill creates a special Africa export strategy coordinator to \nensure this is no longer the case. He will work with the existing \nexport agencies and make sure they are on the same page. The bill \nestablishes a minimum number of commercial Foreign Service officers to \nbe stationed at U.S. embassies in Africa and the multilateral \ninvestment banks. These are the men and women who are contacted by \nAmerican businesses, wanting to do business. They can navigate them \nthrough local government requirements as well as some of the other \ncultural challenges they might face. The bill formalizes and \nstandardizes the training received by economic and commercial officers. \nIt also incrementally increases the amount of money Ex-Im can loan over \nthe next 10 years and creates a standard of accountability for those \nloans. Remember, this is only an increase in the lending limit, and \nthese loans actually make money for the U.S. Treasury.\n  Lastly, the legislation gives the Export-Import Bank greater \nincentive to aggressively counter concessional loans, below-market \nloans such as the one I mentioned earlier in the case of Ethiopia and \nChina, that countries such as China often use to undercut our bidding \nin the process.\n  After the Prime Minister of Ethiopia explained to me how the Chinese \nwere offering these concessional loans, he then said: But, of course, \nthen we turned around with the telecommunications contract and the \nChinese won that too. He said they are winning everything. That is not \ngood news for us. We have the capacity to produce goods and provide \nservices competitive with any nation in the world. But once they have \nbasically become a part of the local economy and once they are part of \nthe local culture, it is difficult for our companies to compete. That, \nI think, is the real challenge we face.\n  That is what this bill basically does. I think it not only creates an \nopportunity to create jobs here, but as has been mentioned by Senator \nBoozman and Senator Coons, these are developing nations which are \nreaching a\n\n[[Page S2067]]\n\nlevel of economic maturity. We want to be not only good trading \npartners but partners with them in the future, developing not only good \nmarkets but good values that are consistent with our view of democracy \nand the participation of people who live in each of these countries.\n  I would like to yield at this point to Senator Boozman.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. I agree with the Senator from Illinois. We trade not \nonly goods and services, but we trade ideas. That is so important as we \ngo on. Certainly, Africa is developing a very healthy middle class. \nThis is certainly something new that they have not seen before. Again, \nthey are hungry for American products.\n  I appreciate the way the legislation was crafted in the sense it is \nrevenue neutral so there is no cost to the taxpayer. What we are trying \nto do is get a plan together to make it such, particularly our small \nbusinesses, so they can compete in this huge continent that has so much \ngoing for it. Again, it could be such a great help to a State such as \nmine. In Arkansas, we are talking about we already export $5.6 billion \nin merchandise. I think one of the ways we are going to climb out of \nthe economic doldrums we are in and create jobs is going to be through \nexports, and certainly this gives us an opportunity.\n  We are almost--we could almost say, using the statistics from the \nSenator from Illinois; he talked about 7 of the 10 top emerging \neconomies coming out of Africa--we are almost doing a disservice to our \nsmall businesses by not going forward with this legislation.\n  Mr. COONS. That is right. I am grateful Senator Boozman has been an \nactive participant in helping pull together on this bill what has been \na bipartisan consensus in this body and in the House on the importance \nof improving the access to the export opportunities of Africa for \nbusinesses large and small in the United States.\n  Both of our States are well known for poultry exports. All three of \nour States also have manufacturing exports, across all the different \nsectors of our economy. We can't help but do better if we increase our \nexports to Africa.\n  Fifty years ago, 70 percent of all U.S. funds that flowed toward \nAfrica were development or relief assistance from U.S. Government \nsources. Today that is inverted. Today more than 80 percent of all \nresources that go to Africa are direct investment by the private \nsector. So Senator Durbin has led the effort to create a wise and smart \nbill that uses that leverage, that makes, as Senator Boozman said, the \nrapidly growing markets of Africa accessible to our home State \nbusinesses, large and small, but also makes a more efficient, more \nfocused use of the dramatic resources of our Federal Government and \nmakes it more accessible.\n\n  What is next and where do we go from here?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I can tell the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from \nArkansas if you ask the average American to give you their image of \nAfrica, it will be an old image. The image of new Africa is a continent \nthat is changing dramatically as those numbers show. Listen to these \nnumbers: In the year 2000, 7 percent of the population of Africa had \naccess to the Internet. In 2009, the number was up to 27 percent. That \nis almost a fourfold increase in access to the Internet.\n  There was also a revolution when it comes to mobile telephones. In \n1998, there were fewer than 4 million phones on the entire continent. \nToday there are 500 million. From 4 million to 500 million phones. Most \npeople have this image of a dusty little village in Africa where people \nlive under pretty primitive circumstances, and that is true in many \nparts of Africa. But 78 percent of Africa's rural population has access \nto clean water. Seventy-eight percent has access to clean water. Access \nto information and the global market are the pillars of building a \nmiddle class. In Africa this means a middle class hungry for goods and \nservices, and the United States can use that to our advantage.\n  I am openminded about this. I want us to be able to import from \nAfrica as well because that is the nature of a good trade relationship. \nIt cannot be all one-sided. Of course, our first priority is American \njobs in Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, and Colorado. But let's \nunderstand as the middle class grows, their productivity will grow too \nand what they can provide us can make a big difference.\n  The world banks said recently in a report that Africa could be on the \nbrink of an economic takeoff much like China was 30 years ago and India \n20 years ago. So this bill, promoting our trade into Africa, could not \ncome at a better moment.\n  I wish to yield to Senator Boozman at this point.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Well, I agree with the Senator from Illinois and the \nSenator from Delaware. The bottom line is there is a tremendous \nopportunity for our country. I think that our country, as we do start \nthe trade process, trading ideas along with goods, that, again, we are \ngivers. We can be very proud of the work we have done in Africa. Nobody \nhas done more when we are talking about food. I was one of the cochairs \nof the malaria caucus. We can be very proud of the work the Congress \nhas done in the last several years. These are things that the Western \nworld can get together and eliminate.\n  As the continent settles down and develops a middle class, 60 percent \nof the businesses that do exports are small businesses and certainly we \nneed to get in there. This bill challenges us to increase that by 200 \npercent and gives us the incentive and a template for how we do that so \nwe can stop this erosion by the Chinese where they are outdoing us by \nabout 3 to 1.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Senator Boozman is absolutely right. The significant \ninvestments that have been made by the last administration and the \ncurrent administration, by Congresses controlled by both parties, in \nrelief of the very broad health challenges throughout sub-Saharan \nAfrica have produced dramatic results. It has been both positive \nresults in terms of relieving human misery but also positive results in \nterms of the view that most Africans have of the United States. This is \nthe continent on the Earth where we are most positively viewed. We need \nto take that platform and use the tools Senator Durbin is trying to \ncraft through this legislation we support to make sure that businesses \nlarge and small all across the United States see this continent clearly \nas a continent of opportunity, as a continent where we have strong \npotential partners, and get us back in the race.\n  Frankly, right now we have a wakeup call. When those of us who have \nbeen to Africa repeatedly see it as a continent of great opportunity \nperceive that we are allowing other countries to rapidly move past us, \nwith Senator Durbin's leadership with this bill, we can take that \nopportunity, refocus our resources and make this the decade where the \nUnited States and Africa, working in partnership, build and sustain \ntremendous growth in imports, exports, and trade.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hope we can change a few things in Washington as we \nlook at Africa. I hope the U.S. Commerce Secretary will travel to \nAfrica. That has not happened in years. I would encourage our Secretary \nto discover the opportunities on this continent for the good of our \neconomy here in the United States.\n  It is hard to imagine, as well, the Commerce Department is actually \ncutting its staff in Africa at this point, and the Export-Import Bank \ndoesn't have an African staff at this point. This can change. The \ntremendous growth of the African economy and its middle class makes \nlack of engagement inexcusable. We can reverse it, and this bill is a \nstep in the direction to reverse it.\n  As Senator Boozman said, it is modest, commonsense, and doesn't add \nto the deficit. It thinks of ways to use current resources more \neffectively. It moves us in that direction with low-cost steps that \nwill actually earn U.S. money while creating U.S. jobs.\n  I will yield on this issue and allow my colleagues to close if they \nhave closing remarks.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. I thank the Senator. We appreciate his leadership. \nPerhaps the three of us, and maybe others, can write a note to the \nSecretary of Commerce and ask him to make a much-needed trip to Africa, \nto look at this bill and not only do this, but use other ways as a \nstrategy to implement so we can get our small businesses trading more \nwith the continent, again, keeping up with the likes of China, India, \nand all of the places we mentioned.\n  I think once it is all over, we will be very proud of our efforts, \njust as I am\n\n[[Page S2068]]\n\nvery proud, as was mentioned, of the efforts we have made in feeding \nthe hungry, helping those with HIV, those with malaria, and diseases \nsuch as that. It is interesting that it is the place in the world where \nwe have the highest acceptability. The people are very pleased with \nwhat the Americans have done there. Our State Department is doing a \ngreat job. We are teaching people how to fish rather than feeding them, \nand that has been very successful.\n  I appreciate everybody's efforts and hopefully we can get our \ncolleagues together and get this thing passed.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank Senator Boozman and Senator Durbin for the \nopportunity to join together in this colloquy.\n  As Senator Boozman referenced, this is another example of how when \nAmerica leads with its values, America will find success for our \nworkers, our families, our communities at home in terms of increased \nexport opportunities, but also in terms of higher regard for our \nvalues, for our priorities throughout the world. When we are willing to \ntake on the challenge of combating terrible diseases such as HIV-AIDS, \ntuberculosis, and malaria in partnership with research universities, in \npartnership with African universities, and doctors and health care \nprofessionals, we can achieve remarkable results.\n  When we pull together with Senator Durbin's leadership on this bill \nand we pull together all of our government, OPEC, Ex-Im, the Trade \nDevelopment Administration, the Department of Commerce, the Department \nof State, and we deploy the strength and the capabilities of America's \nentrepreneurs and small businesses, the sky is the limit in terms of \nthe difference we can make for the people of Africa and the people of \nthe United States.\n  I wish to thank Senator Durbin for his leadership on this important \nbill. I am grateful for the chance to join him and Senator Boozman in \nthe colloquy today.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleagues Senator Boozman and Senator Coons.\n  Mr. President, I ask that this colloquy be brought to an end, and I \nbe recognized individually in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2068-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2068-S2070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STUDENT LOAN DEBT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I held a hearing last week in the \nJudiciary Committee on an issue that most Americans are aware of, but \nnot aware of the severity of the challenge we face. The issue relates \nto student loan debt.\n  Last month the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys \nissued an eye-opening report entitled ``The Student Loan Debt Bomb.'' \nThe report pointed out that American student borrowing exceeded $100 \nbillion in 2010, and the total outstanding student loans exceeded $1 \ntrillion last year. There is now more student loan debt in this country \nthan credit card debt.\n  Of course, when used prudently, student loans can be valuable. I am \nliving proof of that. I borrowed money to go to college and law school. \nI paid it back and felt it was money well invested. I stand here today \nbecause of it. A lot of students have gone through the same experience. \nUnfortunately, too many students today are being steered into loans \nthat they will never be able to repay.\n  According to an analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 37 \nmillion Americans hold outstanding student loan debt with an average \nbalance of $23,300. However, only 39 percent of those student loan \nborrowers were actually paying down the balance. More than half of the \nstudent loan borrowers in the United States are not paying down their \nloan.\n  The New York Fed's study found that 14 percent of student loan \nborrowers--that is 5.4 million Americans--were delinquent while the \nremaining 47 percent of borrowers were either in forbearance, which \nmeans a delay in payment as the actual cost of the loan increases, or \nstill in school and adding to their debt.\n  Last month Standard & Poor's issued a report saying that ``student \nloan debt has ballooned and may turn into a bubble.'' Moody's Analytics \nrecently said that ``the long-run outlook for student lending and \nborrowers remains worrisome.''\n  The overall growth in student indebtedness is troubling. The most \npressing and worrisome parts of it are private student loans. What are \nthese loans? These are loans given to individual students, not by the \nFederal Government or through a Federal agency, but rather through a \nprivate entity.\n  According to the Project on Student Debt, the most recent national \ndata shows that 33 percent of bachelors degree recipients graduated \nwith private loans--one out of three--at an average loan amount of \n$12,550. The difference between private and federal student loans is \nsignificant. Private loans to students in school are far riskier to \npay. Federal student loans, through the government, have fixed, \naffordable interest rates at 3.4 percent. They also have a variety of \nconsumer protections, such as forbearance in times of economic \nhardship, and they offer manageable repayment options such as income-\nbased repayment plans.\n  On the other hand, private student loans often have high variable \ninterest rates. While interest is at 3.4 percent for a government loan, \nit can be as high as 18 percent for the student loans from a private \nsource. We found that in our committee. That dramatic interest rate \nincrease means that many students, unless they land a great job and can \npay it back quickly, will find the principal not being reduced and the \ninterest building up over the years.\n  Once a student takes out a private loan, that student is at the mercy \nof the lender. I have invited students from across the United States to \nshare their stories about private loans and what has happened to them. \nI want to tell you one of those stories this evening. A young lady came \nto testify before my committee. Her name is Danielle Jokela. Danielle \nis a constituent of mine who lives in Illinois and appeared at our \nhearing on the looming student debt crisis.\n  The odds were against Danielle. Both of her parents were high school \ndropouts, but because of the personal value education has for her, \nDanielle was determined to go to college. Not unlike a lot of young \npeople these days, her family couldn't help her. She had to do it on \nher own. In the year 2004, she moved from Minnesota to Chicago to \nattend the Harrington College of Design, a for-profit institution owned \nby Career Education Corporation.\n  Before I go any further, let me tell you the story of the Career \nEducation Corporation. November 1 of last year the CEO of Career \nEducation Corporation resigned after it was disclosed that this for-\nprofit school had reported incorrect information to its accreditor \nabout the number of students who were getting jobs after they \ngraduated. It was such an embarrassment to the corporation that he was \nforced to resign. The parting gift for this embarrassing situation was \na $4 million parachute to the CEO as he left the Career Education \nCorporation. He failed in his job and got rewarded for it.\n  Now let's go back to Danielle's story. She didn't fail. She kept \ngoing to school. She fully trusted the staff at Harrington to help her \nwith financial aid. They helped her fill out all the financial aid \npaperwork for her loans and made phone calls on her behalf. There was \nno discussion about interest rates and what the actual debt load would \nbe by the time she finished. School employees never talked about \nmonthly payments once she graduated nor did they tell her about the \nkind of salary she could expect to earn upon graduation or the \npercentage of graduates coming out of the Harrington School of Design \nwho actually found a design job.\n  In 2007 Danielle graduated with a bachelor of fine arts in interior \ndesign. You can imagine how proud she was coming from a family where \nher parents had not finished high school. After graduation, she started \nto pay back the following amounts that she had to borrow to graduate: \n$37,625 in Federal loans and $40,925 in private loans. Danielle owed \n$79,000 when she got her bachelor's degree in interior design. Today, 5 \nyears after graduation, she still hasn't found a job in that field and \nshe now doesn't owe $79,000, she owes more than $98,000. Those loans \njust continue to grow. She makes one combined payment each month of \napproximately $830. Nearly 28 percent of her current income goes to \nstudent loan debt. Twenty-five years from now--25 years in the future--\nif the interest\n\n[[Page S2069]]\n\nrates hold where they are, she will have paid nearly $56,000 for her \nFederal loan, which started off at $37,000, and nearly $155,000 for the \n$41,000 private loan. That is approximately $211,000 she will have paid \n25 years from now on her $79,000 debt. That is a staggering 264 \npercent.\n\n  Do we believe any college student could even understand when they are \nsigning these loan forms what they are getting into? They assume that \nif the Federal Government loans money to the school, it must be a good \nschool. Not true.\n  Many of these schools, such as Career Education Corporation, have \nwhat they call national accreditation. I met with a national \naccrediting agency. It accredits a lot of schools, some of which the \nPresiding Officer is very familiar with in his State. It turns out that \nthe for-profit schools have a peer-reviewed accrediting operation. They \nlook to one another to decide whether they are competent to hold \nthemselves out as schools offering higher education, and the Department \nof Education accepts it. So what is the student to think? I am going to \nan accredited school, a nationally accredited school. The Federal \nGovernment is offering loans, maybe even Pell grants. The student would \nassume that this must be a good school.\n  Secondly, of course, the situation with the cost of these for-profit \nschools is dramatically higher, the amount of indebtedness of the \nstudents is dramatically higher than public education and even private \nnot-for-profit schools. The amount of the indebtedness of the students \nis dramatically higher, and more and more of these for-profit private \nschools are dragging the kids, the young students, into debt with \nprivate loans with absolutely explosive terms to them.\n  There is one thing I haven't mentioned that bears saying. Under the \ncurrent law, no student loan is dischargeable in bankruptcy except \nunder the most severe and extreme circumstances. It hardly ever \nhappens. It means that the loan papers you sign at the age of 21 are \ngoing to be with you for a lifetime. And if you aren't one of the lucky \nones--landing a good job, making enough money--you will watch what \nhappens as that student debt increases. Danielle's debt went from \n$79,000 in 5 years to over $98,000, and it continues to grow.\n  I asked her about her lifestyle--32 years old, married. She is trying \nto do the best she can. She can't go back to school--impossible. She \ncan't borrow more money to do that. She is looking for a job and trying \nher best. She said: It looks like I am going to lose my home over this. \nIt is just a little house my husband and I were working on paying for. \nWe just can't do it anymore.\n  Age 32, virtually in debtors' prison for these private loans and \nFederal loans--for what? For making the mistake of going to college? I \ndon't happen to think that is a mistake. For most of us, it was a \nticket to a future. She thought it was a ticket to a future for her. It \nturned out to be a ticket to a life of debt.\n  What are we going to do about this? Are we just going to shrug our \nshoulders and say that these students ought to think twice about \nsigning up or their parents who cosigned should have asked harder \nquestions or are we going to be more honest about this? The current \nsituation has to be examined in honest terms.\n  How many private loans are now not dischargeable in bankruptcy? What \nother private loans would not be dischargeable in bankruptcy? The \nanswer is none. The only things nondischargeable in bankruptcy are \nthings like Federal student loans, taxes you owe the government, child \nsupport, and alimony. These private loans from schools were added a few \nyears ago. We gave them the sweetest deal of any creditor in America. \nNo other private unsecured creditor gets that protection in bankruptcy, \nother than those issuing private student loans, like for-profit \nschools.\n  So you say to yourself, Congress, why did you do that? Why did you \noffer that kind of a benefit to one tiny sector of the economy? And the \nanswer is, there wasn't a lot of debate about it and there wasn't a lot \nof talk about it. It was in the bankruptcy reform bill, which I voted \nagainst, and the provision was stuck in there that gave them this \nsweetheart arrangement, this sweetheart deal.\n  Well, it may have been a sweet deal for the schools and the private \nlenders; it sure isn't for Danielle. I don't know what to tell this \nyoung woman. There is no place for her to turn. At age 32, that is her \nplight in life now. It is happening more and more.\n  What I read earlier about this looming student debt crisis and the \nfact that we could be dealing with a bubble is something we ought to \ntake seriously. It is a serious problem. While the volume of private \nstudent loans is down from its peak in 2007 when it accounted for 26 \npercent of all student loans, we know that private lending is still \nbeing aggressively promoted by the for-profit college industry.\n  I always put these numbers on the record so people can put it into \nperspective. Ten percent of the postsecondary students in America \nattend for-profit colleges--10 percent. The for-profit colleges receive \n25 percent of all Federal aid to education--10 percent of the students \nbut 25 percent of the Federal aid to education.\n  We had to put a statutory limit on the Federal subsidy of these \nschools at 90 percent. They can receive no more than 90 percent of \ntheir money--a for-profit school--in money directly from the Federal \nGovernment--loans, Pell grants. The GI bill is excluded, so it can go \nup even higher. These are the closest things to government agencies \nwith multimillion-dollar parachutes for their CEOs that I have ever \nseen. Yet we turn our backs and say that is the way it works.\n  The Project on Student Debt reports that 42 percent of for-profit \ncollege students had private loans in 2008, up from 12 percent. For-\nprofit college students also graduate with more debt than their peers. \nAnd the last statistic: 10 percent of the students, 25 percent of the \nFederal aid to education, 44 percent of the student loan defaults \nthrough for-profit schools.\n  The answer is obvious: They string these kids out, bury them in debt, \nthey end up graduating, and they can't find a job to pay off their \ndebt. And we sit here and say: Gosh, I wish there was something we \ncould do about it.\n  There are a lot of things we can do about it. We need to take action. \nI have introduced legislation--the Fairness For Struggling Students \nAct--that restores the pre-2005 bankruptcy treatment for private \nstudent loans. If those for-profit schools and those creditors making \nprivate student loans knew they were dischargeable in bankruptcy, would \nthey ask harder questions about the payback? Would they be more \nconcerned about whether the students actually could end up with a job? \nYou bet they would. There is no reason private student loans should get \ntreated differently than any other private debt in bankruptcy, and it \nis especially egregious that these private loans are nondischargeable \nwhere a student was steered into a loan while the student still had \neligibility for the much lower costing Federal student loan. Think \nabout that. Here is a student who is eligible for a 3.4-percent Federal \nstudent loan being lured into a private loan at 18 percent. As long as \nthey have eligibility for the Federal student loan, the private loan \ncertainly should not be nondischargeable in bankruptcy.\n\n  I am encouraging my colleagues to take a hard look at this issue. I \nbet a nickel that if my colleagues went to a town meeting in any town \nin America--in Illinois or any other State--and asked folks there, does \nanybody have any concerns about student loans, watch the hands go up. \nPeople are worried about it.\n  The last example I will use is one of the people who work in my \nFederal office who is a wonderful lady who cleans the building and we \nhave gotten to know her. She is an immigrant to this country with a \nlimited command of English, but she is a hard-working person. Her \ndaughter graduated from high school with a GED, and she was so elated \nwhen her daughter finally made it through high school. She came in one \nday and said: I have great news. My daughter was accepted to college.\n  It turned out she was accepted at Westwood College. Westwood College \naccepted her and offered her a degree in law enforcement. We asked her \nmother what it is going to cost. Well, it is the $5,500 Pell grant plus \n$17,000 more for 1 year. This college, unfortunately, has become \nnotorious. It is under investigation by the Illinois attorney general \nfor its loans. Students\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\nwho watch all these crime programs on TV can't wait to become part of \nlaw enforcement. Here is the bad news: Westwood College's law \nenforcement degree is not accepted by any law enforcement agency in \nIllinois. It is not a legitimate college degree.\n  Well, we called Westwood because we have been through this with them \nbefore many times and said: If you don't tear up those papers right now \nand allow her mom and her to walk away from this, there will be a press \nconference out in front of your building tomorrow morning. They tore up \nthe papers. But, sadly, many college students who went to Westwood \ndidn't have that good result. The worst one I know of is a young lady \nliving in the basement of her parents' home now, a graduate of Westwood \nwith a law enforcement degree and $90,000 of debt and nowhere to turn. \nShe is in her late twenties and has nowhere to turn. That is the \nreality of what is happening out there in the real world.\n  We have a responsibility here, a responsibility to these students, \nthese leaders of tomorrow, a responsibility when it comes to the \nreputation of education in our country to step in and police the for-\nprofit schools that are not doing a good job, that are taking advantage \nof students and leaving them deeply in debt with worthless diplomas. It \nis not an issue where people jump up and say: Let's get down to the \nfloor and join Durbin on this one. It is just not that interesting to a \nlot of folks yet. I am afraid it will be. If this looming student debt \ncrisis grows, there will be more and more tragic stories like the one I \nput in the Record today about Danielle Jokela.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2070-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2070-S2071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the issue that is \nbefore us today on the floor of the Senate; that is, the issue of high \ngas prices.\n  I was at home in Wyoming and filled up again this weekend, as I do \nmost weekends, and today the average price of gasoline, regular \nunleaded gasoline nationwide, is $3.91 a gallon. That is about 20 cents \nmore than it was a month ago.\n  People at home in Wyoming see the prices continue to go up week after \nweek. High gasoline prices are causing hardships--hardships for \nAmerican families and American businesses. When families pay more at \nthe pump, they can't spend money on other goods and services. For \nfamilies dealing with kids and a mortgage and bills, they know the \nspecific impact as they fill their car or truck and see that price rise \nto the point where it is most, if not more, than $100 to fill the tank. \nAlso, when companies pay more for gasoline, they have less money to \nexpand their businesses. That hurts job creation in this country.\n  Wyoming families and Wyoming businesses know this all too well \nbecause in Wyoming we drive longer distances than most Americans. The \nPresident also knows this, and that is why he continues to give \nspeeches on energy. It is clear that the President is defensive on this \nissue. I have heard the speeches, and I say: Pay less attention to what \nhe says and pay more attention to what he does.\n  The average price of a gallon of gasoline, regular unleaded gasoline, \nis over 100 percent higher than it was when President Obama took \noffice. I will say that again. The price of gasoline is over 100 \npercent higher than it was when President Obama took office. It is \nclear that the President's policies are contributing to higher gas \nprices, but instead of changing course President Obama and Democrats in \nCongress are doubling down on bad policies and desperate schemes.\n  Here is an example. One Senate Democrat--someone across the aisle \nfrom me--said: Let's ask Saudi Arabia to produce more oil. That is \nexactly what he said. He said his solution is to ask the Secretary of \nState to ask Saudi Arabia to produce more oil. Now President Obama and \nSenate Democrats want to raise taxes on American oil production. So we \nare going to ask Saudi Arabia to produce more and yet raise taxes on \nthose who are producing American oil. So the President and the \nDemocrats want more oil from Saudi Arabia, and they also want to make \nit more expensive to produce American energy.\n  The legislation on the floor doesn't make sense, and the American \npeople recognize that it doesn't make sense. Americans know that if you \nwant less of something, you tax it more. They also know that if you \nwant to increase the cost of something, you tax it more. Raising taxes \nincreases the cost for consumers, and that is, in effect, what \nPresident Obama and Senate Democrats are doing with this legislation. \nThey are proposing increasing gas prices by increasing taxes. Even the \nauthor of this legislation has said that ``nobody has made the claim \nthat this bill is about reducing gas prices.''\n  So, then, why would President Obama want to increase gas prices 7 \nmonths before a Presidential election? Well, it appears to me it is \nbecause his political base fiercely opposes fossil fuels. Now that \nshould not surprise anyone. We have seen this before. Of course, I am \nreferring to the President's rejection recently of the Keystone XL \nPipeline, bringing energy from Canada into the United States. The \nKeystone XL Pipeline would have created thousands of good-paying jobs \nfor Americans. The President said no. The Keystone XL Pipeline would \nhave facilitated oil production in Montana and in North Dakota. The \nPresident said no. The Keystone XL Pipeline would have increased \nsupplies of oil from Canada. The President said no--to the point that \nthe Prime Minister of Canada actually went to China to ask if they \nwould buy the energy from Canada if the United States is not \ninterested.\n  So why would the President reject it? Well, because his political \nbase has fiercely opposed the pipeline. Now the President wants to have \nit both ways. He would like to please his political base as well as the \nAmerican public. That is why the administration wants to go hat in hand \nand ask Saudi Arabia to produce more oil. It is also why the President \nis considering plans to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  This will be the second time President Obama tapped the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. Last June, if you will recall, the President \nreleased 30 million barrels of oil from the Reserve. Prior to that, it \nhad only been tapped twice for emergencies since 1975. So between 1975 \nand June of 2011, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve had only been tapped \ntwice for emergencies. It was tapped in 1991 upon the outbreak of the \nPersian Gulf war, and it was tapped following Hurricane Katrina. In \nboth instances those were real disruptions of the supply of oil to the \nUnited States.\n  But when President Obama tapped the Strategic Reserve last year, \nthere was no substantial prospect of a supply disruption. His decision \nat the time was based on politics, as would be his decision to tap it \nnow. That is why Jay Leno recently called the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve President Obama's ``Strategic Re-Election Reserve.''\n  Well, my Republican colleagues and I think there are other ways to \naddress high gas prices. The other thing is, when they tapped the \nStrategic Reserve last year and took out the 30 million barrels, they \ndid not actually refill it, so that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is \nnot filled up right now. It is lower. Just to fill it back to where it \nshould be, its baseline level, would cost actually almost $1 billion \nmore than they got when they sold the oil last year.\n  I believe there are things we should be doing and can do that will \nenhance, not jeopardize, our Nation's security and specifically our \nNation's energy security. We understand the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \nis for emergencies, not political disasters; and we understand if we \nwant more of something or if we want to lower the cost of something, we \ndo not raise taxes on it. What we do is make it easier to produce the \nproduct. That is why my Republican colleagues and I support making it \neasier to produce American energy, and it is why we are asking the \nPresident to make it easier to produce American energy--not harder, not \nmore expensive but easier.\n  A few weeks ago, we learned oil and gas production on Federal lands \nand waters is down. Specifically, we learned there was a 14-percent \ndecrease in oil production on Federal public lands and waters from 2010 \nto 2011 and an 11-percent decrease in gas production from 2010 to 2011.\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\n  Again, the President has not made it easier, but he must make it \neasier to produce American energy. The President can begin by \nincreasing the number of permits issued for exploration in the Gulf of \nMexico. It is my understanding there are only 25 deepwater rigs active \nin the gulf right now. I understand 34 deepwater rigs were active in \nthe gulf at this time in 2010. The administration needs to approve more \npermits and to do it immediately.\n  The President should also increase access to other offshore areas. He \nshould provide access to offshore areas in the Atlantic and the Pacific \nOceans. In November, the President proposed an offshore oil and gas \nleasing plan that amazingly excluded the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific \nOcean. He excluded areas off the coast of Virginia, even though both of \nthe Senators from Virginia who are Democrats, as well as the Governor \nof Virginia who is a Republican, all support such exploration.\n  The President should also increase access to onshore areas. The \nPresident should open areas of Alaska, and we should support proposals \nto open ANWR. Both Senators--a Democrat and a Republican--and the \nGovernor of Alaska strongly support opening ANWR for energy \nexploration. The President should too.\n  The President should also take steps to facilitate onshore production \nin the West. Specifically, the President should scrap new regulations \nrequiring ``Master Leasing and Development Plans.'' These regulations \nwere put into place over 2 years ago by the Secretary of the Interior. \nIt is unclear to me why the Secretary issued these regulations. They \nadd more redtape, they cause more bureaucratic delay, and they slow \ndown American energy production.\n  Of course, there are other regulations that are driving up the cost \nof American energy--specifically, the EPA's forthcoming tier 3 \nregulations that will affect America's refineries. A recent study shows \nthis rule could increase the cost of manufacturing gasoline by 6 to 9 \ncents a gallon. This rule could also raise annual compliance costs for \nrefineries by billions of dollars. And it will almost certainly \nincrease the pain at the pump that is being felt by American families. \nTo me this is unacceptable. The President should at the very least \ndelay the issuance of this rule.\n  In addition to providing more access to Federal lands and waters and \neliminating burdensome regulations, the President should address \ndelivery bottlenecks. Specifically, he should address all the \nbottlenecks the Keystone XL Pipeline would relieve. Here, of course, I \nam referring to the 100,000 barrels of oil each day that Keystone would \nship from Montana and North Dakota. That is right--homegrown American \nenergy from Montana and North Dakota.\n  Right now there is not sufficient pipeline capacity out of North \nDakota and Montana. Do you know how they are getting the oil out of \nthere? Well, they are shipping it on trucks and in trains, and that is \na lot more expensive than shipping it by pipeline.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline would reduce the cost of shipping American \noil. In addition, the pipeline would ship about 700,000 barrels of oil \na day from Canada. The Canadian oil would replace oil imports from OPEC \nand thus increase our Nation's energy security. Approving the Keystone \nXL Pipeline is an easy decision, and the President should make that \ndecision immediately.\n  Again, the President must abandon his support for policies such as \nthis legislation that is ahead of us today, which will only increase \nthe pain at the pump. He must also abandon plans which will put our \nNation's security further at risk. Instead, the President must make it \neasier to produce American energy. He should increase access to Federal \npublic lands and waters, eliminate costly regulations, and approve the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n  It is my hope the President will take all of these steps and do so \nimmediately so the American public does not continue to suffer the \nsignificant pain at the pump that continues to affect our country \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2071-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2071-S2076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with \nmy colleague from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n                            Energy Planning\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, just as I expected, we have been in this \nback-and-forth show-and-tell on oil and gas issues instead of spending \nthe time and working on a real energy plan, one that is important for \nnot only my State, my colleague's State, but for the whole Nation. So \nwe go back and forth, and it is politics as usual in this Chamber. We \njust heard a nice presentation by my colleague from Wyoming about how \nit is all the President's fault the prices are going up and all these \nother issues.\n  Let me just say this--and I know my friend from Louisiana knows \nthis--in Alaska, there is a clear indication what we believe when it \ncomes to energy prices. We have communities that pay $9, $10 a gallon \nfor heating fuel. We understand when costs go up what happens to our \neconomies in our rural communities.\n  We also are a producer of oil and gas, and we understand the \npotential and job opportunities. But this last week, when we started on \nthis bill, I know my colleague and I were just two of four people who \nsaid, no; we are not moving on this bill because we expected exactly \nwhat is going on now. We are just doing a little show-and-tell, having \na little argument back and forth, and in another 24 hours or maybe 30 \nhours we will be off this bill and we will not have an energy plan.\n  When I go back home for our break, when I am talking to Alaskans--and \nI know the Senator will be talking to folks in Louisiana--they will \ncomplain about gas prices and heating costs and how much it costs to \nfill their cars or their RVs if they are trying to go somewhere on the \nweekends, and we have not done anything to make a dramatic change.\n  Of course, this idea of eliminating these incentives for the oil and \ngas industry I have opposed from day one, for a variety of reasons. \nOne, if we are going to do real tax reform, then we should do a broader \nsweep, and no industry should be left off the table. Everyone should be \npart of the equation.\n  I have heard this from the industry--I know my colleague has heard \nthis from the industry--that they are willing to be part of the bigger \npicture, but do not single them out because poll numbers say they are a \ndemon of some sort or people do not like them. Let's talk about real \ntax reform. That is one debate.\n  The other debate is, if we really want an energy plan, then let's \nreally do one. Let's focus on opportunities, and let's quit putting out \npieces that one side puts down because it sounds good for their \nbrochure, and then the other side puts one down. Let's really focus on \nsomething that will make a huge difference to this economy.\n  As I mentioned, in Alaska fuel is expensive in our rural communities \nfor heating, and communities in Fairbanks, which is a very urban area, \ncan pay upwards in the winter of $1,000 or maybe more per month in \nheating costs, making their ability to survive very difficult.\n  As we work on these energy projects and what is important, let me put \nanother thing in perspective from Alaska. People think in Alaska all we \ncare about is oil and gas. Well, we do. It adds a lot of jobs. But we \nalso care about renewable energy. I know I have been on the floor of \nthe Senate talking about that. My colleague has been on the floor \ntalking about renewable, alternative energy. It is all part of the \nequation, how to ensure we develop a plan. We diversify our energy \nresources, and then we deliver it for the betterment of this country \nand economically in order for us to survive.\n  In Alaska, for example, as we work on our oil and gas development, we \nare also moving forward on renewable energy. In our State, just about \n25 percent of our energy production for use in the State is renewable \nenergy, with the goal to be at 50 percent by 2025. We have a plan \nbecause we understand the value of it.\n  I want to show a chart I have in the Chamber, and then I know my \ncolleague has comments, and we will probably go back and forth a little \nbit. But I want to show you this one chart.\n  When I came into office--and my colleague over here talked about \nANWR. I\n\n[[Page S2072]]\n\nsupport ANWR. I am aggressive about it beyond belief. My colleague has \nbeen. Before I got here, she was pounding away on this issue also. It \nis important.\n  We have four regions in Alaska that are of high value. When we talk \nabout oil and gas in Alaska, at least from our office, we talk about \neverything that is possible. We talk about ANWR. We talk about the \nNational Petroleum Reserve which--let me make that point--is designed \nfor petroleum production. We have the Chukchi Sea over here, and the \nBeaufort Sea over there. These four regions have huge value to the oil \nproduction of this country.\n  When we talk about this, where are we today? What can it do? What can \nit replace? It can replace countries such as Libya and Nigeria and \nSaudi Arabia, where we get oil from. We could actually produce it here, \nand the good news is we are on the path to do that.\n\n  Now, has it been long and tedious? Yes, it has. But are we moving in \nthe right direction? Yes. We have seen for the first time in 30 years \nthe opportunity to develop in the Arctic that we have not seen before. \nWe are seeing for the first time--this summer, Shell is moving their \nships up to the Chukchi Sea because the potential between the Chukchi \nSea and the Beaufort Sea alone is 24 billion barrels of oil.\n  Let me repeat that. I know we deal with these numbers in our two \nStates: billions, billions. When we look at the Chukchi Sea, 15.4 \nbillion barrels of oil; plus a little side product, gas, and we love \ngas because it is clean burning, 77 trillion cubic feet; the Beaufort \nSea, 8.2 billion barrels of oil--this is what we know best today in our \nestimates--where they are doing exploration now, so we are going to \nfind out more opportunities--gas, 28 trillion cubic feet.\n  NPR-A, the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, 1 billion barrels of \noil is what we know of, and they are in production this year.\n  ConocoPhillips will be developing in what they call CD5.\n  ANWR is still a struggle, but 10.4 billion barrels of oil. It is \nstill an important piece, where a small, little component of this would \nbe developed, 2,000 acres out of 19 million acres. That would be the \nfootprint we would utilize.\n  But the point I am trying to make is, if we want to get on to a real \nenergy plan, then let's do that. I know the folks on our side did their \nvote. It was amazing. It shocked me, actually, that they voted to move \nforward. They had not done that ever since I had been here on that \nbill. It is because they wanted to do show-and-tell for a week, get \nsome press, and beat up the President because of Presidential politics.\n  I have my differences with the President. We fought him a lot on \nthese issues. But what I am interested in, what I came here for--and I \nknow the Senator came years ago for--is to do a real energy plan that \ninvolves our country being more self-sufficient on our own energy \nresources, and let's do it the right way.\n  Let's have the real debate that will make the difference for \nconsumers. So when I go home, and my colleague goes home, and someone \nsays thank you because we have set in motion a trend that will lower or \nstabilize gas prices for our homes, for our cars, for our businesses, \nfor transportation in general, that is what we should be doing. But \ninstead we are going to burn up a few days here and make a lot of \nspeeches, and then we will move on.\n  Well, I will tell you, and I think my colleague will agree with me on \nthis, that the two of us are not going to stop. We are going to talk \nabout an energy plan because that is what we need in this country if we \nwant to grow this economy and make ourselves more self-sufficient and \nmore secure nationally.\n  What is happening in the Middle East? The price is going up. It is \nnot anything we are doing. But we have some good news. Even though it \nis predominately private land that has been the growth factor of oil \nand gas, we are seeing more domestic production for the first time in \n10 years. I do not know, but to the Senator from Louisiana, I think \nthat is a good thing; right?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. It is a good thing. The Senator from Alaska is right on \nas usual on this subject and in the main stream of what most Americans, \nI believe, are thinking about.\n  I wanted to ask the Senator from Alaska, following his comments--I \nmean, why does my colleague think our friends on the Republican side \nwant to spend this week beating up on the President as opposed to doing \nsomething that might help energy policy advance in the country? I do \nnot know if they do not realize that people are very frightened and \nanxious and upset about these prices or what does the Senator think is \ndriving this sort of theater on the Senate floor?\n  Mr. BEGICH. Well, I think the Senator said it in the question in a \nway. It is a lot of Presidential politics. I think what I hear when I \ngo home is--and the Senator probably hears it too--that people are \nfrustrated with that activity.\n  Think about this: Just a couple of weeks ago, we passed a bipartisan \ntransportation bill. Unbelievable. People say we cannot do things \ntogether. Seventy-four votes moved a bill, with very diverse views, as \nwe all know. But we worked it out. We spent 5 weeks doing it after all \nthe committees' months and months of work. And what did we end up with? \nA great product that went over to the House, that now sits there \nlanguishing and not having anything happen to it.\n  What is interesting, if we do not do a good energy plan, here is what \nhappens: asphalt, which is a petroleum-based product which builds those \nroads, only goes up. When that goes up, that means now the roads we \nwant to build become less. It is not complicated.\n  Why are they not doing this--I think even some of their own Members \nwere surprised that they had to be told by their leadership to change \ntheir votes and do a certain type of vote. Now we are in this no-end \nproduct. In other words, we are not going to end up with anything. I do \nnot get it. I know they will go home just like the Senator and I, and \nthey will hear the same thing: jobs, gas prices, and construction and \nthe housing market, what is happening? These are things we hear about. \nI am surprised.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am surprised myself. I hope when we do go home \nconstituents in all of our States will say: Stop the bumper sticker \npolitics on the floor of the Senate and get down to passing an energy \nbill. I think we most certainly, if we stop electioneering and start \nlegislating, could actually do that.\n  Now the Senator from Alaska and I--and I have been here a few years \nlonger than the Senator, but he has been a most welcome addition to \nthis issue because he is knowledgeable. He comes from a State that is \nlarger than almost half of the lower 48. His State is rich in \nresources. I have had the great pleasure to go to Alaska. I am looking \nforward to traveling there again this summer and actually going to the \nNorth Slope because in Louisiana we build many of the ships that \nactually operate in Alaska for their exploration activities.\n  Mr. BEGICH. If I can make a comment that the Senator just christened \none of our new ships coming up. It has Icebreaker capacity to work for \nShell to do what? Go right here.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That ship was just christened this weekend in \nLouisiana. So the relationship between Louisiana and Alaska goes back a \nlong way. I am very happy to have the Senator here advocating for a \nsmart and effective energy policy.\n  This debate some people are having--I do not believe I am included in \nthat because we are having our own colloquy about serious issues. But \nthis so-called debate that everybody else is having is going to result \nin nothing, just a lot of sound bites. There will be no energy policy \nthat comes out of this because the fact is--and everyone knows this \nthat follows this--both parties are guilty for not having the right \nkind of energy policy, Democrats and Republicans alike.\n  Democrats, from my perspective, do not appreciate the way they should \nthe need for more domestic drilling. So they resist sometimes the need \nfor more domestic drilling. I think Senator Begich and I have pointed \nout there are some places where there are people--Governors and \nSenators, Democratic Senators--who are open to drilling. We could go to \nthose places and do a better job of developing onshore and offshore.\n  But Republicans are not good at all when it comes to conservation. \nThey resist helping the auto industry, for instance, to retool itself, \nwhich we know\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\nhas had an absolute direct bottom line on less petroleum products being \nused for gasoline.\n  Many of the new automobiles coming out of domestic manufacturers, \nbecause of what Democrats and President Obama, who led this effort--\nwhich he never gets enough credit for on the other side--have done to \nretool Detroit so that just this week in the newspaper, I believe it \nwas the Washington Post--I wanted to ask the Senator from Alaska if he \nsaw this article. The most amazing thing that has happened over the \nlast 10 years is that our imports of foreign oil have decreased for 2 \nreasons: One, we are producing more oil and gas at home, although there \nhave been some setbacks with this administration which we are not happy \nabout, the two of us, but also because of the conservation we have done \nin this country.\n  Mass transit is a part of that, which many Republicans reject. \nConservation initiatives are a major part of that, which Republicans \nreject. Helping the domestic auto industry, which they--even Mitt \nRomney, their leader on the Republican side, said that was a mistake to \nhelp Detroit, Ohio, et cetera, Michigan and places in Ohio.\n\n  So I am coming to the floor to say this blame game is not going to \nwork because both parties are almost equally at fault. Senator Begich \nand I would like to believe that we represent a little bit of the \nDemocratic side, a little bit of the Republican side, coming from \nStates--both of us being Democrats but from States that know something \nabout drilling.\n  I want to put up my map of Louisiana so people believe when I say \nthat we know something about drilling.\n  This is what my State looks like. Some people might not like this \npicture. This is the oil and gas infrastructure in Louisiana. To \nsomeone who is a purist and does not like pipelines and does not like \noil wells and does not like leases, they may recoil at this. But people \nin Louisiana like this because this is about money, and it is about \ndomestic energy self-sufficiency and independence.\n  These are pipelines. There are 9,000 miles of pipelines under south \nLouisiana. We have been drilling onshore and offshore for the last 50 \nyears. Until the Macondo Well blew up in spectacular fashion and killed \n11 people, which is very unfortunate and the fault of BP and some of \nthe contractors who were not doing their jobs correctly, it has been \nmostly successful. We have drilled 40,000 wells--40,000.\n  So when the Senator from Alaska says we know something about oil and \ngas drilling, trust me; it would be like asking the Senators from \nMichigan: Do you know something about building cars? We know about \nthat. We have been fracking. We have been using horizontal drilling. We \nknow there is a lot of oil and gas still to be found, and the Senator \ntalked about some of his reserves.\n  I know the Senator is aware that Louisiana--just off the coast of \nLouisiana--produces just about as much oil as we import from Saudi \nArabia every year. I do not know if the Senator knows that.\n  How are the reserves looking in Alaska?\n  Mr. BEGICH. Well, absolutely. As a matter of fact, as we know, this \nline--this is the pipeline that brings resources from here down to \nValdez and ships it throughout the country and the world. It is about \n10 percent of the oil for our country that comes from Prudhoe Bay up \nhere.\n  What is amazing about this development is, as it moves forward, it \nwill obviously provide even more. Also, as the Senator said, with the \nmap there, it is about jobs. I mean, when we think about this \ndevelopment, this could be upwards of 54,000-plus jobs estimated by an \nindependent research arm. Plus these jobs pay very well: on an average, \n$117,000 a year. I do not know about you; I think that is a good-paying \njob.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. It is a very good paying job. This is a very good point \nbecause I have tried to remind everyone here that this oil and gas \nindustry that exists in Louisiana and Alaska does not just support the \npeople of our States. Think about it. There are only 500,000 people in \nAlaska. If that is going to create 50,000 jobs, that would be 1 for \nevery 10 people. But people fly in and fly out. They will work for 2 \nweeks or a month and fly back. We have people working on our rigs that \nare from Maine or from Colorado or from New Mexico or from New York.\n  Most of the people who work offshore are from the Gulf Coast States, \nI might say. You can tell this when you drive through the parking lots \nand see the license plates which are easy to spot. But I can tell you \nthere are people from all over the country who work in this industry.\n  If I showed you a supplier line, you would see supplies coming from \nall over the United States to fund the operations like, for instance, \nthe boat that is going to be operating in Alaska was built by people \nfrom Louisiana. Some of those boats are built in Mississippi, and some \nof that may even come from the east coast. I do not know if the Senator \nis familiar with that.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Some of those ships will be refurbished and some of the \nwork that is being done is out of the Port of Seattle and Tacoma and \nthat region. It is a nationwide aspect. Think about this. In 2011, the \noil and gas industry produced 9 percent of the new jobs in this \ncountry.\n  Let me repeat that: Nine percent of all of the new jobs in this \ncountry came from the oil and gas industry. It is the fastest growing \nindustry at producing jobs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. It is also producing great wealth. I do not think \npeople understand because a lot of the land in the West is public land. \nSo we hear this debate about public land, et cetera. But most of the \nland in my State is private land. In fact, the Federal Government owns \nless than 2.5 percent.\n  Now, we are at polar ends of this debate. We are at opposite ends \nbecause in Alaska the Federal Government owns 90 percent of that State. \nIt only owns 2.5 percent of my State, and the farther east you go it is \nless and less and less.\n  So when there is more drilling, like in Louisiana, it is private land \nowners who are getting wealthy. In many of these instances, such as in \nthe Haynesville shale, which is up along this area in Louisiana, \nnorthwest Louisiana, farmers whose land was virtually worthless or who \nwere growing crops but not really making it very well, now the gas has \nbeen discovered on their land, so they are getting royalty checks for \n$10,000 a month, $20,000 a month. That is more money that people have \nmade or ever dreamed about making. I have heard of royalty checks of \n$50,000 a month that people are getting. So they take that $50,000, \nthey are not even drilling for oil and gas; they have just leased their \nproperty. They go out and start a business in their hometown or they go \nout and buy two new automobiles for their family or a new pickup truck \nfor their operations.\n  I know the Senator understands the indirect impact. It is not just \nthe direct jobs for the industry, but the wealth that is created \npersonally, and the U.S. Government collects quite a bit of taxes from \nthis industry as well.\n  Mr. BEGICH. If I could add, in this Chukchi/Beaufort, for example, it \nis estimated that the cumulative state, local, Federal value over the \nnext 50 years in terms of revenue stream is upwards of $100 billion. If \nwe then talk about the payroll over the next 50 years for the same two \nareas, it is $150 billion.\n  What happens to that $150 billion that people get paid? Exactly. They \nbuy a house. They maybe put their kids through college or they are \nvacationing or they are improving their lifestyle. They are moving up, \nand that kind of money is significant.\n  It has a multiplier effect that is hard to measure, but it is real. \nAnybody seeing somebody making $117,000, they are spending that money \nin the economy. That is why we see the job growth we see here. Again, \nto the principal debate we are having tonight--and we are the minority \nof the minority in a way--we need to get back to the basic issue of \nwhat do we want in this country in a diversified, well-delivered energy \nplan. We can get there. For example, we had a bill, and the other side \nthrew down the same old talking points a few weeks ago--to drill \neverywhere one could imagine. It is about drilling but doing it \nresponsibly, in the right areas, with the right design. They had \nBristol Bay, the fish basket of the country, where 40 percent of the \nfish are caught. They want to drill there. I cannot vote for that. It \nis a balanced approach that we need.\n\n[[Page S2074]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. We don't have to drill everywhere. The resources are so \nspectacularly promising. I have to get back to this blaming President \nObama. I don't know if my friends on the other side remember who the \nPresident was when the Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, a Republican, \nopposed drilling off the eastern gulf. The President at the time, his \nbrother, George Bush, honored that no drilling pledge. I remind my \nfriends on the other side that their party is not blameless in this \ndebate. They could do a lot better for the country if they would stop \ntrying to throw President Obama under the bus every minute--although I \ndon't agree with all his energy policies; I didn't agree with the \nmoratorium in the gulf and other things. I think they made some strong \npoints. But this should not be about hurting anybody; it should be \nabout helping our country. We do that by using a balanced approach, \nsuch as the Senator from Alaska said. It is how we came together on the \nTransportation bill. It was balanced, a compromise, and it was a little \nof this and a little of that. We put a jobs bill together that will \nhelp our Nation.\n  We could put an energy bill together if we have both parties stop \nbeating up on people. One beats up on the companies and the other beats \nup on the President and the poor people are the ones who suffer.\n  I wish to show you something about oil and gas taxes. People say: \nThere goes Landrieu again; she is defending the oil and gas industry. \nFrankly, some of them, and the industry itself, should be defended \nbecause it is an honorable, good industry. It has provided jobs. It \nprovided the oil we needed to win World War II. How do you think the \nallied troops got across Europe? They didn't do it on a wish and a \nprayer. That oil came out of the Permian Basin in Texas. We have a long \npatriotic history in that industry. We get our dander up when people \nbeat up on the industry.\n  People say the oil industry gets these subsidies. I wish to put two \nthings into the Record. It says that according to the Energy \nInformation Administration--which is our administration, not a third-\nparty spinmeister group. It says in the study published in 2008 that \noil and natural gas received only 13 percent of the subsidy but \nproduced 60 percent of the energy needed to power our country. I will \nrepeat that. The oil and gas industry receives only 13 percent of all \nthe subsidies, but we produce 60 percent of the energy that keeps the \nlights on in this building and powers everything in the country. We \nspend about $16.6 billion on U.S. energy subsidies over the course of 1 \nyear on everything, and renewables, refined coal, nuclear, and others \naccounted for more than 85 percent of the subsidies.\n  So the oil and gas industry got less than 13 percent of the \nsubsidies, but they continue to be the bogeyman in all this. In \naddition to receiving only 13 percent of the subsidies--and my friend \nfrom Alaska will know this as well--look what tax rate they pay. \nConocoPhillips paid 46 percent. This was the effective tax rate from \n2006 to 2010. Chevron paid 43 percent. They made a lot of money. They \nare absolutely making a lot of money. These are public companies, and \ntheir executives are paid well. I think they are probably paid a little \nmore than I would pay, but that is what they are paid. These are public \ncompanies, and the shareholders are making money as well. But they are \npaying this very high rate in taxes.\n  Look down here on the chart. Walmart only paid 33 percent. Philip \nMorris only paid 27 percent. PepsiCo--a very good company--only paid 24 \npercent. These are effective tax rates. My favorite--although I like \nthem very much, but GE only paid a 9-percent effective tax rate.\n  When the Senator says we need tax reform, we most certainly do. If \nyou came to me and said in a major bill we are going to have an energy \nbill and have some tax reforms to balance this out, I would be for \nthat. But in good conscience, I cannot take away the subsidy from oil \nand gas when they only represent 13 percent of the overall subsidies \nbut produce 60 percent of the energy. I certainly don't want to raise \ntaxes on an industry now with prices at the pump being so high. If we \ndo, we are just going to drive them up, which is the last thing we want \nto do, particularly when this is the truth about the tax rates. The \nSenator from Alaska is again absolutely correct. This debate we are not \nhaving but everyone else is having is not getting us very far.\n  Mr. BEGICH. If I can, I will add one more point before we finish. If \nthese incentives are so bad, then why are we at a 10-year high in \nproduction? Why do we see in Alaska more independence than ever before? \nProbably in the Senator's State I venture to guess--I remember \nAnadarko, a very small company, which is now a very big one. We can \nlook at these different companies and part of the incentives are \nutilized to take hard-to-get areas and make them more profitable so \nthey can produce them. The result is that we now have more gas, for \nexample, than we have ever had, and the price dropped so far that \npeople are excited about it, which happens--if we talk to the \npetrochemical industry, they love these low prices because they are \nproducing more opportunities in this country to produce products we \nused to produce overseas. So there is a ripple effect. People say these \nare bad incentives. Actually, we are producing more. They are paying \none of the highest tax rates, as the Senator said. So we are getting \nmoney back on our investment. They are high prices because we don't \nhave a comprehensive energy plan to have diversified energy portfolio \nand make sure we deliver it everywhere we can. It is not complicated.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator is right. I am glad he mentioned this as \nwell because I happen to also represent a State that has a tremendous \npetrochemical industry. Of course, that is because the Mississippi \nRiver is there, as well as the great finds in the 1950s and 1960s for \ngas. So when big companies--particularly petrochemicals but big \nmanufacturers--look around in the world to where they go, one thing \nthey look at is the tax rate. But that is not the most important thing. \nThe other thing is to make sure they can find the skilled labor they \nneed. They need cheap energy costs because they cannot produce steel \ncompetitively, for instance, if we don't have cheap energy.\n  So a lot of these companies came to Louisiana in the 1960s because we \nhad cheap energy. That changed, and a lot of them left. Maybe we did \nother things to drive them offshore. You know what is happening today. \nBecause of this $2 gas, they are all coming home. You should see the \nbuilding we have going on. That is why the Texas unemployment rate is \nthe lowest in the Nation. I know the Governor would like to take all \nthe credit for this. My Governor likes to take all the credit for this \ntoo. They are two outstanding Republican Governors, and they may be \npretty good, but it is the low price of energy that is driving this. \nThat could happen in Colorado, it can happen in Illinois, if we just \nsupport the oil and gas industry in a balanced way, instead of choking \nit off.\n  Not only does that money go to them, it helps undergird this entire \nindustry which employs millions more people, and it helps us to compete \nbetter with China, with India, and I know the Senator understands that. \nHe doesn't have as much heavy construction or refining in Alaska \nbecause of a little bit of the isolation. But I think he can appreciate \nwhat happens in New Jersey and Louisiana and Illinois, as an example.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Absolutely. I will tell the Senator we have been \nexporting for 40 years. We have been doing that because of our ability \nto do so and being able to get to the Pacific Asian market. Overall, \nthe State here--through all its natural resources, we are a net \npositive in our export trade. We help lower the trade deficit for a \nvariety of reasons--our fish, minerals, gas, and natural resources. So \nwe are a huge contributor to this economy in a lot of ways.\n  I have been here only 3 years, and I still wake every day being \nhopeful. I am hopeful that at some point we will debate and have a real \nenergy plan discussion. When we do that, the net result is that \nAmericans will win, consumers will win, and national security will win. \nEverything wins if we have a good dependable energy policy that looks \nnot only at today but down the road.\n  I think my friend from Louisiana made a very good point about \nconservation, about those issues. Thinking about the automobile \nindustry, we came to their rescue and we got a lot of\n\n[[Page S2075]]\n\ncriticism--all of us, the President included--but what is the result? \nThose folks paid back their loans, and they are more innovative than \never before. But they are also producing more fuel-efficient cars, \nwhich saves fuel, and it saves on the long-term dependency on foreign \nproducts.\n  Some people say that is not conservation; that was a bailout. It is a \ncombo. It is multifaceted. For whatever reason, the other side sees \nthat as just another government thing. I cannot remember, but it was a \npretty good interest rate we got on that money and they paid it back \nand now they are being more innovative. Most recently, our automobile \nindustry is building more natural gas fuel vehicles. They want to move \nforward in that area. I don't know if that will be successful, but they \nare moving forward because the price is lower. We have a lot of it, and \nthat is an industry that is stronger than ever before.\n  As we sit talking about the importance of energy and how we have to \ndevelop our plan and have a diversified plan of action from all \nsources, as the Senator went through the list of the subsidies, we do \nit in every arena. We are trying to create a diversified energy \nportfolio for economic security, and it also creates innovation. We \ncannot depend on one type of fuel source. It is all part of it. People \nwho say it can just be oil and gas are in another world. We have to \nhave a multifaceted approach and then we have to do it and deliver it \nfor the benefit of the American people. There is a way to do that.\n  Again, I struggled tonight because of the vote I took yesterday--one \nof four--that said we are not moving forward because I saw what was \ngoing to happen. By this weekend, I will be home talking to Alaskans \nand sharing their concerns about high energy costs in small villages \nand urban areas, and they will be asking the question: What are we \ndoing? I wish I could say here is the answer and the price will go \ndown. For the 3 years I have been here--and the Senator from Louisiana \nhas been here longer--we have had a debate with no real substantive \nbeef. People have put something out on the table, and the other side \nvotes against it, instead of having a meaningful, real comprehensive \nenergy bill. We have tax incentives here and there but not something \nthat says this is what are going to do, so 20 years from now, all of \nus, including my colleague from Louisiana and my colleague from \nColorado, can look at our kids and grandkids and say we did the right \nthing because we are stronger because we diversified our energy \nresources.\n  That is the fundamental issue we will not get to. We are in our own \ndebate because we are a group of four. Two of them are out tonight. The \nrest are in a different debate.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes. I wish to reemphasize too the importance of \ngetting back to the basics on energy policy. I have been privileged to \nbe here long enough where I have helped to pass comprehensive energy \nbills. I remain hopeful when I wake too. I am a person with the glass \nhalf full and not half empty, and I try to remain optimistic in the \nface of evidence to the contrary. I remain hopeful we can continue on \nthe path of more energy independence for our country. That is why that \narticle, written this week, which I will put in the Record, was very \ntelling to me, because I have been saying, similar to the Senator from \nAlaska, are we making any progress? I believe if we cannot manage, we \ncannot measure. What is the measurement? One of the measurements is, \nare we importing more or less oil from dangerous places in the \nworld. And when I saw that had dropped by 15 percent, I was very \nencouraged.\n\n  And the article pointed out two reasons, not one--not drill, baby, \ndrill or conserve and conserve only but both, because America has been \ndoing a better job. Despite the setback of the moratorium, despite the \nsetback with the Deepwater Horizon, despite some of the President's \nslow policies on drilling, and despite the Republican resistance to \nconservation, we have been doing something right, because we have \nreduced our dependence on foreign oil, which is good.\n  We don't want to be dependent on Venezuela, and we don't want to be \ndependent on the Mideast, particularly Saudi Arabia. They have been \nsomewhat of an ally, but they do not share all our values, let's be \nhonest. Women just got the right to drive this year--no, actually, to \nvote this year. I don't think they have the right to drive yet \nofficially. So do we share those values? No.\n  So why don't we kind of get back to the basics here of drilling more \nat home, promoting and expanding our nuclear industry safely. And I \nmean drilling where it is safe and not everywhere, as some Republicans \nsuggest--let's drill everywhere. We don't have to drill everywhere; we \njust have to be smart and strategic about where we drill, compromise \nsome about the places that are really opposed to it. We can drill more, \nhave revenue sharing, which makes sense with the coastal States of \nAlaska, Louisiana, Virginia, Mississippi, and Alabama because that \nbuilds a strong partnership and stakeholders between the local, State, \nand Federal governments.\n  I think we could do more on building efficiency. We can do more on \nnatural gas vehicles. Wouldn't it be wonderful to have the kinds of \nvehicles that run on electricity or on--and I don't know if this is \npossible yet, but we could experiment on electricity, on natural gas or \non petroleum fuels or on diesel or bio so that if the price of natural \ngas was low, you would just sort of power yourself on natural gas. If \nyour electric bill is low because you are on nuclear and the nuclear \nprice is low and you are getting your electricity from your nuclear \npowerplant, you just plug in your automobile and you pay very little.\n  Why can't we break this dependency by producing more of everything at \nhome and transforming our auto industry, which is the big pull on fuel. \nYou know, our industries run on coal or natural gas or some oil, but \nthe real pull on this oil is our automobiles.\n  So that is why Republicans are wrong. They do not want to fund this \ntransformation, but we have to fund the transformation to help America \nmove from an old-fashioned petrochemical, where we just fill up at the \npump because we only have one thing to get--and that is petroleum--to \nwhere we can fill up with several other things. This isn't pie in the \nsky, this is happening right now. But with a little more government \ninvestment, it could happen more, and wouldn't that be a relief?\n  The Senator from Alaska will know this, and I don't want to misquote \nhere because I could get in trouble, so I will be careful, but if we \nhad a system like that and the price of gasoline was $10, no one would \ncare. Do you know why? Because they wouldn't have to use it. Think \nabout that. You wouldn't have to buy it. You wouldn't need it for your \nairplanes, you wouldn't need it for your trucks or your cars because we \nwould have created a system of choice. And choice is power for the \nconsumer--really good choice. They could fill up their car with natural \ngas or they could fill it up with another source. That is where we need \nto go. Then we will break it. We will break the dependency because it \ncould be $10 or $100 a gallon and who would care, because no one would \nhave to buy it.\n  So that is where we need to go. We can get there. We are sort of \ncreeping there. That is what this article also said--inch by inch we \nare getting there, but we could accelerate it--no pun intended--if we \nget off this ridiculous ``blame the person in the White House so you \ncan win the next election and then get back to doing nothing.''\n  So I will turn the conclusion over to the Senator from Alaska by \nsaying that the debate with sound bites for elections coming up and \nbumper stickers to put on cars will not help, but I am ready for a real \ndebate.\n  We have introduced several pieces of legislation. I have been a \ncosponsor of every piece of legislation since I have been here on any \nkind of major Energy bill, but it has to have a conservation component, \nit has to have an environmental safety component, it has to have more \ndrilling, revenue sharing, and then I think an expansion of nuclear \npower would be very important and the right subsidy mix for the kinds \nof energy we would like to produce in this Nation. That would make our \nNation much stronger when it comes to energy, but it would make us so \neconomically powerful and it would make us militarily more powerful \nbecause we would negotiate treaties differently if we didn't have to \nget on our hands and knees and ask countries that don't even share our \nvalues to pump a little\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\nmore gas for us when we could pump it ourselves.\n  I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I thank my friend from Louisiana, and I will conclude by \nsaying again that her point about being smart and strategic is what we \nare saying. No one is saying either/or, that it has to be this or that. \nIt is a combination of things. Some will be more expensive today but \nmaybe less later.\n  Think about the technology around the cell phone the first time it \ncame out, which used to be a box about this big, and you plugged it in \nyour car and the big receiver would be in your trunk. It cost several \nthousand dollars to buy that technology, if you remember, and people \nwere saying: No one is ever going to do that. Now you can go to the 7-\nEleven--or in my State it would be the Holiday store--and buy throwaway \nphones. It is amazing what can happen when you allow some expansion of \nthis knowledge and technology.\n  Oil and gas bring new technology. The Senator mentioned directional \ndrilling, for example, which is new technology being developed in our \nState and her State to bring opportunities that Shell gas is now \ndoing--all kinds of opportunities.\n  When you think of the security level, I know the Senator from \nColorado, our Presiding Officer here, has been in the Armed Services \nCommittee, where we talk about this all the time. How do we get the \nbiggest consumer--the military--to find new alternatives? And they are \nexperimenting.\n  But what is amazing--and we heard it last week and the week before--\nis that our friends on the other side are wondering why the military is \nlooking at alternative fuels. They actually asked, what gives you the \nauthority to do that? Well, actually, when it costs you almost $400 a \ngallon for diesel fuel on the front lines of Afghanistan, I think that \nis a good reason. They should be looking at what kinds of alternatives \nthey can use.\n  I have seen what they are doing. They are doing some amazing things \nwith solar panels and small devices. And what is important about that \nfor the military is they can move more rapidly through areas so they \nwon't have to worry about where is the diesel truck for energy. But for \nrural Alaska, it is important in our rural villages where it is $10 or \n$11 a gallon for heating fuel, and now there is technology that, \ninstead of taking up a whole room, is portable, and they can move it, \nthey can use it, and it saves consumers.\n  So there are all kinds of things we should be doing.\n  I know the other side will say: Those things cost too much; these \nthings cost too much. When you are at the R stage, things always cost \ntoo much because you have to move slowly to develop and create the \nmarkets. But the military is a huge driver of a market, so I am excited \nthat they are in these areas. And I oppose the idea of some Republican \nSenators and House Members who are saying they shouldn't be doing \nanything experimental. Absolutely, they should. They are a consumer of \nthe product. Let's have them give us some innovation.\n  People may forget that the same people who were doing the energy \ndevelopment in the early 1960s are the ones who started the Internet, \nfrom which we all now benefit. Imagine in the 1960s if we had said to \nthe military: Oh, we don't want you testing whatever they were calling \nthat Internet system. That is bad. You get out of that business. Where \nwould we be today? Now, as the parent of a 9-year-old, I might have a \ndifferent view on this. I may not want my son on the Internet. But it \nmade a difference in our economy and everything else that is going on.\n  To conclude, I would say we have a chance to develop, to diversify, \nand to deliver a real energy plan if we focus on it. That is what we \nshould be doing. So I thank my colleague from Louisiana, and I thank \nthe Senator from Colorado, who is our Presiding Officer tonight, for \nallowing us to have a little rant time here in our own world. But I \nthink the world we talk about is the same world almost everyone in \nAmerica is living in, with high gas prices and wanting real solutions.\n  Anyone who says there is a magic bullet and the price will go down--\nthat isn't happening. I support the Keystone Pipeline, and I know my \ncolleague from Louisiana supports that, but that won't lower prices \ntomorrow. I support, for a variety of reasons, a long-term plan--jobs \nand other things--but it won't lower prices tomorrow. Drilling in \nChukchi and Beaufort is important to me. I think in the long term it \nwill create jobs and it will lower gas prices but not tomorrow. But \nthese are the kinds of things we should be doing.\n  Will our investing in conservation to ensure that our commercial \nbuildings and houses are more efficient turn a dollar right away? A \nlittle bit. But over the long haul--I am doing an energy retrofit to my \nhouse in Anchorage. I am going to save some money. It will go in and go \nout because I have to put some money aside for my son's education. But \nI will have more money. So it pays over time. Nothing happens \novernight. It drives me crazy when I hear the other side say that this \nis like magic and tomorrow things will change. I wish that were the \ncase. We all do. But we have to have a plan to get there.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for joining me tonight. I thank \nher for standing tall when we took our vote yesterday. I think we made \nour point, and now we need to move forward, and hopefully we can get \nother people to follow our lead and do a comprehensive plan.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2076-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2076-S2077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SURFACE TRANSPORTATION ACT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, while I am on the floor, I would like to \nspeak for a few more minutes, if I might, on another subject but one \nthat is equally important. The Senator from Alaska and I just spent \nsome time talking about a balanced approach to energy production and \nthe fact that if we could get there, we could create jobs. The Senator \nwas saying that no matter what we do, it won't create jobs overnight, \nand he is right again. It will take a long time, it won't lower the \nprice overnight, and it will create jobs.\n  But there is a bill that actually will create millions of jobs \novernight that is pending, hanging around this Capitol, that if we \ncould get passed would mean a great deal immediately--tomorrow, \nliterally the day after the bill is signed by the President--and that, \nMr. President, is the Federal highway transportation bill which last \nweek was passed and compromised by one of the most liberal and \nprogressive Members of this body and one of the most conservative \nMembers of this body, Senator Boxer of California and Senator Inhofe of \nOklahoma, who worked for over a year and a half to put a transportation \nbill together, a 2-year transportation bill. Many of us would have \nliked it to be 5 years or 6 years, but 2 years is what they could \nnegotiate. And you know what, it is a lot better than the short-term 3-\nmonth, 6-month, 2-month, or 3-month temporary measures we have been \nunder for the last several years. That gives no consistency--none--for \nour States and our counties and our cities.\n  If you talk about uncertainty, the business community, real estate \ndevelopers, planners, community planners, transit planners--these \nentities do not know what it is going to look like 6 months from now or \neven next year. This bill would give at least 2 years of certainty, and \nthen we could come back, hopefully, and pass a long-term extension of 5 \nyears or 6 years. But 2 years is much better than 30 days or 60 days or \n90 days, which is what the House is contemplating.\n  I am proud the Democrats and some Republicans are standing up in the \nHouse and saying no short-term extension. We have a bill. We have the \nSenate bill that got over 74 votes of Republicans and Democrats, \ncompromised again between a more progressive and a more conservative \nMember for the benefit of our country.\n  There are 1.9 million jobs at stake. For the gulf coast Senators, \nthere is an extra bonus. Besides funding our rail, our highways, and \nour transit, the gulf coast Senators and House Members from the States \nof Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida got a very \nsignificant amendment to fund coastal restoration and flood control \nprotection and economic development in the gulf coast, directing the \nfine money that is going to be levied against BP sometime in the next \nfew weeks or months. Instead of that\n\n[[Page S2077]]\n\nmoney coming to the Federal Treasury to be spent on a variety of \ndifferent things, it will stay where the injury occurred, along the \ngulf coast, and 80 percent of that money will stay in those coastal \nareas and those coastal States, helping our economies to revive \nourselves and to save our coastlines.\n  So gulf coast House Members, I am speaking and hoping some of them \nwill hear this message. Gulf coast House Members of either party, \nDemocrats or Republicans, should stand tall and say: Yes, let's pass \nthe Senate Transportation bill for the benefits that will come to our \nState and our Nation, creating or securing literally almost overnight \n1.9 million jobs for the country, helping our recovery. But tucked into \nthe Transportation bill is a bill that could bring billions of dollars \nto the gulf coast to help with coastal restoration and beach erosion.\n  I have seen the clips every day since we passed RESTORE, from Tampa, \nFL, to Mobile, AL, to Jackson, MS, to Gulfport, MS, to the Times \nPicayune in New Orleans, to the Houston Chronicle, and as faraway \nnewspapers as the New York Times which have editorialized on: Pass the \nRESTORE Act now; bring jobs and economic relief to the gulf coast, an \narea and environment that has been hard hit by the 5 million barrels of \noil that were spilled in the gulf. Next month, it will be the 2-year \nanniversary.\n  I don't know what the House of Representatives is thinking. They have \na real jobs bill over there right now, voted on by Republicans and \nDemocrats here, not just a few Republicans. I think more than half the \nRepublicans in the Senate joined with us to pass this bill. In \naddition, it has the RESTORE Act in it. As the Presiding Officer knows, \nhe had a great hand in supporting the part of that effort to fund the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund which will provide money to all the \nStates for park restoration and maintenance and for land purchase with \nwilling sellers.\n  So I am on the floor to support Barbara Boxer, to support Jim Inhofe, \nto say to the House: Take the Senate Transportation bill. Take it now. \nIt is good for all your States and for the gulf coast House Members \nparticularly. The RESTORE Act is very bipartisan and bicameral. Theirs \nis a RESTORE Act very similar to ours. Please, let's join together, \nstop procrastinating, and pass this bill.\n  We have had many supporters of this bill. The chamber of commerce has \nput out messages to everyone today:\n\n       The Chamber strongly supports this important legislation . \n     . . Passing surface transportation reauthorization \n     legislation is a specific action Congress and the \n     Administration can take right now to support job growth and \n     economic productivity without adding to the deficit.\n\n  I wish to say one word about this extension. Extensions are not \nbenign. As Senator Boxer told us today, extensions in some States \naren't worth the paper this extension will be written on because we \nknow that most of these projects are funded by approximately 75 percent \nFederal money, 25 percent local. In the old days when States were flush \nwith cash and people were running surpluses, when we messed up in \nCongress as we are messing up now and not giving them the \nTransportation bill on time, some of our States could just dip into \ntheir local money, keep their projects going, waiting for us to do our \njob.\n  Those days are over. Do you know any State in the Union running a \nmassive surplus right now? Do you know any State anywhere? I don't. \nBecause States have drawn down their reserves. They are running on very \ntight budgets because they are all coming out of this recession. Even \nour State that has a very low unemployment rate relative to everybody \nelse, that never experienced the recession as everyone else did, is \nstill running pretty sizeable deficits at the State level. I can tell \nyou, my State doesn't have any extra cash to front the Federal \nGovernment.\n  When these projects run out and don't get reauthorized, a lot of \nthese transportation projects will come to a halt. States will stop \nbuying right-of-way. They will cancel or put on hold what is under \ncontract until the money comes forward. So I am going to be in touch \nspecifically with the State of Louisiana on how this is going to work \nin our State, but we were told today that there are a handful of States \nthat have already started to put out notices to their contractors: \nThere will be no more paychecks associated with this road project or \nthis bridge project or this mass transit project.\n  Let me show everyone what I do know about our State. These are the \ngrades we get from the Civil Engineering Association. I am not proud of \nthese grades. But the reason I am not too embarrassed is because just \nabout every State has these same grades because, overall, America's \ninfrastructure generally is graded at a D. We are the most advanced \ncountry in the world but get a D rating when it comes to our \ninfrastructure, surface transportation, water infrastructure, dams, \nlevees, et cetera.\n\n  Our airports in Louisiana are C. Our levees, despite the huge \ninvestment the Federal Government has made recently, but because of the \nlongstanding overall long-term disinvestment or lower investment over \ntime, we still have a C. We have more bridge surface than almost any \nState in America--I think we are third--and we have a D-minus. We have \nmore ports; in fact, Mississippi's southern port from Plaquemine to \nBaton Rouge is one of the largest in the world, definitely the largest \nin the country, a C-minus, and our roads are D.\n  Senator Boxer has been on the floor now all week, and I am joining \nher and helping her tell the House of Representatives they are playing \nwith fire. They are playing with dynamite. We have to get this \nTransportation bill out. I am sure other States can benefit from this \nbill. If we don't, this will be the ninth short-term extension since \n2009.\n  People at home must think we have lost our minds. The clearest thing \nto people at home--they may not understand, and sometimes it is hard \nfor us to understand, all the intricacies of every issue. But everyone \nin America, even our children understand that to build roads we need a \nroad crew, to build bridges we need a bridge crew, to build mass \ntransit we have to have people actually constructing. We need jobs in \nAmerica right now, yesterday, today, immediately.\n  Why is the House of Representatives sitting on a bill that is paid \nfor--contrary to some comments from House Members, paid for--that will \ngo for 2 years? It is as long as I would like. It is not 4 years, it is \nnot 5 years, but it is 2 years. It is longer than the 60-day, 90-day \nextensions we have been living under since 2009. It is 2012. Let's get \na transportation bill.\n  My final point: For the gulf coast this is critical. We have a major \npiece of legislation tucked inside this bill. With the Transportation \nbill that the Senate passes, the RESTORE Act passes with it. We create \nan oceans trust fund, land and water conservation with willing seller \nprovisions, and we invest billions of dollars in the gulf coast. It is \na real jobs bill, not a pretend jobs bill. It is a real jobs bill. It \nmeans everything to our States. Whether one has a Republican or a \nDemocratic Governor, they are waiting on us to pass this bill so they \ncan get their people to work. I know mayors I have spoken to, police in \nour State, county commissioners are waiting for this money as well so \nthey can get plans and put people to work.\n  So I most certainly hope that in the next 24 hours, before we leave \non Friday, the House of Representatives will pass the Senate \nTransportation bill, send it over to us, and let's put our people to \nwork. It is only going to last 2 years. We can argue about the \ndifferences, about how the money should go directly to the States. We \ncould argue about mass transit. We can debate that for the next 2 \nyears. Let's pass the bill. Let's get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2077-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2077-S2078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SENATOR BARBARA MIKULSKI\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, with all of the very well \ndeserved statements that have been made about our colleague Senator \nBarbara Mikulski, I wanted to raise my voice in support of the \nmilestone she recently achieved as the longest-serving woman in \ncongressional history.\n  A personal word I want to add about Senator Mikulski is that she has \nbeen so supportive and such a leader of our Nation's space program. As \nthe Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, \nJustice, and\n\n[[Page S2078]]\n\nScience, she has to be intimately familiar with the details and the \nappropriate way to allocate funds that are vital for our civilian \nprogram to go forward in the visionary and frontier breaking manner \nthat it always has and I am grateful for her leadership. I wanted to \nadd this to the accolades that she so well deserves and has already \nheard from so many of our colleagues.\n  Senator Mikulski began her tenure in Congress in 1977 as a member of \nthe House of Representatives. She represented Maryland's Third District \nfor ten years before moving to the Senate in 1986.\n  During her time in the Senate, Senator Mikulski has been a champion \nfor many of the issues that are particularly important to my fellow \nFloridians and me. She is a strong supporter of veterans' and seniors' \nissues.\n  Senator Mikulski has also worked to protect our oceans by supporting \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, especially during \none of the worst environmental disasters we've seen. In 2010 she \nconducted a subcommittee hearing to explore the use of dispersants in \nresponse to the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf, helping us to \nbetter understand the long-term consequences of that environmental \ntragedy.\n  Senator Mikulski also serves as Chairman for the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Subcommittee on Children and Families. In December, \nshe chaired a hearing on child abuse, casting light on this issue and \nurging her colleagues to take greater steps to combat it.\n  I am honored to have served with Senator Mikulski for the past \ndecade, and I look forward to continuing to work with her on matters of \ngreat importance to Maryland, Florida, and the rest of the country.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in honoring the \nservice of the Senator from Maryland, Barbara Mikulski, on becoming the \nlongest-serving woman in the history of Congress. She is an \ninspiration, a mentor, and a friend, and I congratulate her on \nachieving this historic milestone.\n  The story of Barbara Mikulski is the story of the American Dream. The \ndaughter of a grocer in Baltimore, she learned what it meant to do a \nhard day's work. She got good grades, went to college, and eventually \ngot her Master's Degree in Social Work.\n  When she was in her 20's, she got involved in a fight to stop a \nhighway proposal that would have cut through a working-class \nneighborhood. She stopped that highway and saved the homes of the \nfamilies who lived there.\n  Those families saw something that day that all of us would recognize \ntoday: a woman of passion, hard work, and determination.\n  Throughout her years of service, she has reflected these values day \nin and day out as she has fought for America's working families. She \nunderstands that our country needs to make things and grow things if we \nare going to have a middle class and an American Dream. She understands \nthe dignity of work, and how important that is to families who want to \ncreate a better future for their children, just as Barbara's family did \nfor her.\n  And in her many years of leadership and service, she has been \nfighting every day to create a better future for every little girl and \nboy in Maryland. She did not come here for the power; she came here to \nserve. And I think that is why the people of Maryland have chosen her, \ntime and time again, to be their champion in the U.S. Senate.\n  In the whole history of the United States, 1,931 people have served \nin the U.S. Senate. Of those, 39 were women. And of those, 17 are \nserving right now. And of those, only one--Senator Barbara Mikulski--is \nour Dean and our mentor.\n  I want to thank my friend, Senator Mikulski, for all she has done for \nme and for all the women who will follow in her footsteps in the years \nto come.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, the Senate is in the midst of recognizing a \nvery important milestone in our history. I would like to join my Senate \ncolleagues in congratulating Senator Barbara Mikulski as the longest \nserving female Member of Congress.\n  As we all know, Senator Mikulski has dedicated her life to public \nservice. Before running for public office, Senator Mikulski worked as a \nsocial worker helping at-risk children and educating seniors on \nMedicare. In 1971, she successfully ran for her first public office and \nwas elected to serve in the Baltimore City Council, where she served \nfor 5 years.\n  Senator Mikulski first ran for Congress in 1976, seeking to represent \nMaryland's Third District. She won that race and went on to hold the \nseat for a decade. In 1986 she decided to run for the U.S. Senate, and \nshe has been serving here ever since. The Senate was a very different \nplace when she first arrived as one of two women Senators. She not only \nhad to learn how the Senate functioned but had a quick lesson in \nbipartisanship--as the other woman, Nancy Kassebaum-Baker, was a \nRepublican from Kansas. Today, we have 17 women in the Senate and 76 \nwomen serving in the House of Representatives.\n  Senator Mikulski has been an outspoken advocate for working people \neverywhere. Due in large part to her leadership and strong advocacy on \nbehalf of women, our daughters and granddaughters will have \nopportunities that were not available to many women in the past. She is \na wonderful role model through her dedication to public service, as she \nfights passionately every day for the people of Maryland that she is \nhere to represent.\n  And so I want to add my voice to those praising Senator Mikulski as \nshe reaches this important milestone. She is a true pioneer, a strong \nexample of a smart legislator, and an outspoken voice for working \npeople. I have great respect for the journey she has taken, and I am \nproud to serve alongside her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2078-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                JOBS ACT\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on H.R. 3606, \nthe JOBS Act, which we passed in the Senate last Thursday, March 22, \n2012 by a vote of 73 26. I am very pleased that this legislation passed \nwith such strong bipartisan support, particularly because it includes a \nmeasure which I authored to update the shareholder threshold before \nwhich banks must register their securities with the Securities and \nExchange Commission.\n  Title VI of the JOBS Act is based off of S. 1941, which I introduced \non December 5, 2011 with Senator Mark Pryor. Section 601 of this title \nincreases the registration threshold for banks and bank holding \ncompanies to 2,000 persons and the deregistration threshold to 1,200 \nperson.\n  As the author of Title VI of the JOBS Act, I welcome today's \nconsideration of H.R. 3606 in the House of Representatives and the \nendorsement that President Obama has given this job-creating \nlegislation in a Statement of Administration Policy. The new thresholds \nfor registration and deregistration are effective upon the President's \nsignature since no rulemaking is necessary. It is the intent of \nCongress that this new law should apply immediately to banks and bank \nholding companies so that they can raise additional capital to increase \nlending in their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2078-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2078-S2079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to \nrecognize the dedication of women service members and women veterans in \ncelebration of Women's History Month.\n  Women have played an important role in our Nation's military from the \ntime of our Founding Fathers. Today, women make up 15 percent of the \nActive-Duty military and 18 percent of Guard and Reserve forces. Our \nwomen soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen have \nserved courageously in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have played a variety \nof roles ranging from convoy leaders to fighter pilots to field medics. \nI am inspired by their bravery and their dedication to our country.\n  Already women make up nearly 10 percent of the veteran population, a \nproportion that Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, expects to grow \nover the next decade. VA has already come a long way in addressing the \nunique health needs and challenges that women face. A generation ago, \nVA would have been the last place that we would associate with women's \nhealth, but just this past January, VA marked an important milestone in \ncaring for\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\nwomen veterans. In Salt Lake City, UT, a woman veteran not only \nreceived all of her prenatal care from VA but also delivered a \nbeautiful baby girl under the care of her VA obstetrician. Yet, for all \nof its recent progress, VA still must do more to ensure that women \nveterans are receiving the care that they need and deserve. As they \nreturn from the battlefield, the VA system must be equipped to help \nwomen veterans step back into their lives as mothers, wives, and \ncitizens.\n  I am incredibly proud of the women who have served or are serving our \nNation in uniform, and I strongly believe we must do all we can to \nhonor them. That is why I led the effort to pass into law the Women \nVeterans Health Care Improvement Act. This bill, which was included as \npart of the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of \n2010, helped to transform the way that VA addresses the needs of women \nveterans. This act authorized the VA to provide neonatal care, train \nmental health professionals to provide mental health services for \nsexual trauma, develop a childcare pilot program, and staff each VA \nmedical center with a full-time women veterans program manager. VA has \nan obligation to provide women veterans with quality care, and we have \nan obligation to make sure VA does so.\n  Our commitment to women veterans does not end with passing \nlegislation like the Women Veterans Health Care Improvement Act. We \nmust actively monitor the implementation and effect of these bills to \nmake sure that no woman falls through the cracks. In December of 2010, \na VA Office of Inspector General report found that the Veterans Benefit \nAssociation had not fully assessed available military sexual trauma-\nrelated claims data and had no clear understanding of how consistently \nthese claims were being adjudicated. While both men and women service \nmembers carry the devastating wounds of military sexual trauma, the GAO \nfound in 2002 that 22 percent of screened women service members \nreported military sexual trauma compared to 1 percent of screened men. \nWith this shocking statistic in mind, Senator Tester and I pressed VBA \nto improve the accuracy and consistency of their military sexual \ntrauma-related disability claims process. I am happy to say that VA \nagreed with our assessment and has since worked to overhaul the way it \nprocesses military sexual trauma disability claims.\n  Mr. President, the committee's experience with military sexual trauma \ndisability claims is symbolic of the kind of work that remains to be \ndone for women veterans. I recognize the challenges that women veterans \nface over the coming years and remain determined to work on their \nbehalf. The promise that we make to our veterans is sacred and knows no \ngender. To honor our veterans, we must honor this promise for each and \nevery one of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2079-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EYE DONOR AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, March 2012 marks the 29th annual \nNational Eye Donor Month--a month devoted to honoring eye donors and \ncorneal recipients, and increasing awareness of the need for eye \ndonations.\n  Since President Ronald Reagan declared the first National Eye Donor \nMonth in 1983, the Eye Bank Association of America, EBAA, and its 97-\nmember eyebanks have used National Eye Donor Month to educate the \ngeneral public about the donors and their families who provide life-\nchanging corneal transplants for over 50,000 people annually.\n  Of the EBAA's 97-member eyebanks, four are located in Ohio, and they \npossess a deep-rooted commitment to restoring sight by providing \ncorneas for sight-saving transplant procedures. In 2010, charitable eye \ndonations made by Ohio residents allowed our State eyebanks to provide \nmore than 1,000 corneas to help their friends and neighbors regain \nsight, and an additional 1,000 eyes and corneas for additional surgical \nprocedures, as well as for research and educational purposes.\n  These selfless efforts have not gone unnoticed, changing the lives of \nthousands of Ohioans through the selfless gifts of donors and their \nfamilies.\n  The Central Ohio Lions Eye Bank in Columbus, serving 45 counties, has \nmade possible over 12,000 corneal transplants since 1973.\n  In the past 10 years, the Cincinnati Eye Bank for Sight Restoration, \nlocated in the southern part of our State, gave the gift of sight to \nnearly 6,300 individuals through transplantation.\n  In northern Ohio, the Cleveland Eye Bank has provided corneas for \nover 20,000 cornea transplants since its founding in 1958.\n  Lions Eye Bank of West Central Ohio, LEBWCO, in Dayton has provided \nhigh-quality ocular tissue to surgeons and patients since 1982 and \nserves more than 1 million people in nine counties. LEBWCO is dedicated \nto making the gift of sight a reality for the Dayton community and all \nOhioans.\n  Since the EBAA's inception in 1961, corneal transplants have changed \nthe lives of over 1,000,000 people. However, much remains to be done to \noffer more people the opportunity to receive life-changing corneal \ntransplants.\n  I encourage all Americans to register to become eye donors. Inform \nyour family of your wishes; designate yourself as a donor on your \ndriver's license; and register as an eye donor through your State donor \nregistry.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with their local eyebanks and the EBAA \nto promote the importance of eye donation and its life-enhancing \neffects on corneal recipients.\n  During March 2012, let us commemorate the lives of the donors who \nmake corneal transplants possible, celebrate the sight restored by \nthese transplants, and work to widen the path for additional \nadvancements in corneal transplantation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2079-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              TRIBUTE TO \n                          RAYMOND J.

For more than 30 years, Ray Price has \nrepresented his fellow workers in Ohio and across the country with \ndistinction and dignity.\n  In September 1978, he started as an apprentice painter at IUPAT \nPainters Local 867 in Cleveland. He honed his craft to become a journey \nworker just 3 years later. As he rose through the ranks he earned the \ntrust and admiration of his fellow brothers and sisters progressing as \na business representative, business manager, and, by 1995, as manager \nand secretary-treasurer of IUPAT District Council 6, which covers all \nof Ohio and central Kentucky.\n  He would become heavily involved with the Cleveland Building Trades \nCouncil and served as vice president of the Cleveland AFL CIO \nFederation of Labor. What IUPAT members in Ohio understood about his \nloyalty and toughness, soon members from across the country would also \nrecognize. In 1999 he joined the International Union staff as a \nrepresentative of the general president and, later, as general vice-\npresident at large.

Nick Bollettieri, \nlegendary coach and entrepreneur, and Eiichi Kawatei, a strong promoter \nof tennis in Asia, will join Mr. Davies in the Contributor Category.\n  I was not surprised when I read that Mr. Davies taught himself how to \nplay tennis and has used the same self-invented grip to swing his \nracket for the past 65 years. This anecdote is a perfect metaphor for \nhow he, as an innovator, has transformed a game that so many Americans \ncherish.\n  Although we remember him as a great player battling to the top as No. \n1 in Britain today, I recognize his perhaps lesser known contributions \nto tennis. He dedicated many years to leading our world's major tennis \norganizations, including the World Championship Tennis, WCT, serving as \nits executive director for 13 years, the Association of Tennis \nProfessionals, and the International Tennis Federation, where he made \nthe Davis Cup a tournament worth watching. In these capacities, he \nchanged parts of the game that we take for granted and made playing and \nwatching tennis more enjoyable, competitive, and exciting. Mr. Davies \ndeveloped and implemented tie-breakers, allowed players to wear color, \nchanged the ball from green to yellow for the benefit of television \nviewers, added time between points and games, and suggested the use of \nchairs during breaks in play.\n  Remarkably, Mr. Davies is responsible for the first public \nbroadcasting of a tennis match, facilitating the airing of the 1972 WCT \nfinal match between Rod Laver and Ken Rosewall on NBC. In addition, \nwhile at WCT, Mr. Davies implemented the first, multimillion world \ntour. These two big ideas made the sport more accessible to all \nAmericans. As showcased by these accomplishments and many others, Mr. \nDavies has been a tireless advocate for diversifying tennis and \nsupporting all players, regardless of class or race, who had the \npotential to rise through the ranks.\n  Most recently, Mr. Davies has dedicated his talents to the incredibly \nsuccessful New Haven Open tournament at Yale University. He has brought \nbig-time tournament tennis competition to the city of New Haven and \nhelped to create an arena where athletes of all ages can be inspired to \nbe strong, fight hard, and work to their full potential. In their own \nbackyards, they can experience the incredible energy of skilled players \nwho are only a few games away from the U.S. Open.\n  I congratulate Mr. Davies for this remarkable honor and would like to \nrecognize the International Tennis Hall of Fame and Museum for its \noutstanding work in preserving the legacies of these cultural icons and \nmotivating new generations of young athletes and entrepreneurs to \nstrive for greatness every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2080-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE NEW HAVEN LIONS CLUB\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the New \nHaven Lions Club as they celebrate their 90th anniversary and nearly a \ncentury of community service, civic involvement, and charitable \ncontributions to the city of New Haven, the State of Connecticut, and \nthe increasingly interconnected international community.\n  Lions Club members are connected to the heart and soul of their local \ncities and towns, following the proactive philosophy: ``community is \nwhat we make it.'' Through their extraordinary service and generosity \nincluding weekly meetings, annual volunteer events, and fundraising the \n46,000 Lions Clubs and their 1.35 million members change the world \naround them. Following their historic practice of activism and \nparticipation, they touch countless lives.\n  Founded in 1922, the New Haven Lions Club is the second oldest Lions \nClub in Connecticut. The members--or Lions, as they aptly call \nthemselves--come together four times a month at the New Haven Long \nWharf to plan the community outings that have become well known and \nanticipated events. Their impact is felt when they hand out free hot \ncider at the New Haven tree lighting or deliver food donations to the \nConnecticut Food Bank. Since its start, the club has raised more than \n$717,000 in charitable contributions.\n  Responding to a call to action by Helen Keller in 1925, one of the \nhallmark services offered by Lions Clubs around the world is assisting \nthe often-marginalized blind and visually impaired communities. In \n1975, the One to One Program was created in New Haven, where \npartnerships are formed between a blind and a seeing person. Together, \nthese pairs attend events together throughout the year. In addition, \nfree eye screenings have been offered on the New Haven Green since \n1998, serving as a practical resource as well as symbolic gesture that \nthe Lions Club of New Haven is dedicated to inspiring the vision of New \nHaven residents, helping them to see better lives for themselves.\n  The Lions of New Haven also offer valuable opportunities for children \nand young adults in New Haven, understanding their specific needs and \nthen aiming to fill the void, whether providing recreational fun, \nmentorship, or the teaching of life skills. They have partnered with \nlocal schools in New Haven throughout the years, most recently with \nNathan Hale School, to sponsor Leo Clubs, which lead students to spend \ntime volunteering and giving back to their communities. Last July, the \nLions Club of New Haven offered $2,500 in scholarship funds for \ngraduating Leos.\n  The New Haven Lions Club is also known for Camp Cedarcrest, 42 acres \nof grounds in Orange, CT, enjoyed each summer by thousands of \nConnecticut residents. Together, the New Haven Lions, along with four \nother service organizations and the New Haven Department of Parks, \nRecreation and Trees, provide this spot for the community to enjoy.\n  Even though the New Haven Lions Club has held and participated in \nmany newsworthy events such as hosting a Benny Goodman concert in 1958 \nand volunteering over 150 hours during the 1995 Special Olympics World \nGames held in New Haven--what makes this service club special is its \nmembers' dedication to each other, their community, and their legacy. \nSince its birth, then only the second of its kind in New England, the \nLions Club of New Haven has evolved and adapted while always keeping \nthe tradition of service, companionship, and civic duty as the \nfoundation of every step together.\n  I wish the Lions of New Haven all the best as they continue to listen \nto the pulse of the city of New Haven and represent Connecticut in the \nmany Lions Club happenings around the world. I have the greatest \nconfidence that steadfast progress, tender human connections, and far-\nreaching impact will be made by this invaluable organization over the \nnext 90 years and more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2080-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2080-S2081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMERICAN STUDIO GLASS MOVEMENT\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the American \nStudio Glass Movement. The movement is celebrating its 50th anniversary \nthis year. The American Studio Glass Movement began in Toledo, OH, as a \nsmall group of passionate artists and has grown into an international \nmovement of artists creating one-of-a-kind art glass. I would like to \ncongratulate the American Studio Glass Movement on 50 years of \nencouraging and supporting sculpture glass.\n  In 1962, the American Studio Glass Movement began with two \nglassblowing workshops at the Toledo Art Museum. These workshops were \nhighlighted by the inaugural implementation of the personal glass \nfurnace. This invention made it possible for individual artists in \npersonal studios to engage in creative glass design.\n  The American Studio Glass Movement has introduced the beauty and \ncreativity of studio glass to millions of people. From June 13 16, the \nGlass Art Society will hold its annual conference in Toledo, OH, \nallowing artists, collectors, and enthusiasts from across the world to \ngather at the birthplace of glass art to celebrate 50 years of studio \nglass. Further, over 160 art museums, including nine Ohio art museums \nwill hold exhibitions honoring the 50th anniversary of the American \nStudio Glass Movement.\n  I would like to join with the movement's thousands of supporters and \nassociated museums in congratulating the American Studio Glass Movement \non 50 years of success.\n\n[[Page S2081]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2081-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             BEALE AIR FORCE BASE CHILD DEVELOPMENT CENTER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncelebrating the April 2, 2012, opening of the new Child Development \nCenter, CDC, at Beale Air Force Base in Yuba County, CA.\n  I am so pleased that this facility has at long last become a reality \nfor the families stationed at Beale, and I was proud to have fought to \nsecure the funding required to build it.\n  When I visited Beale in 2004, I saw firsthand the critical need for a \nnew CDC on base. The old CDC built in 1967 was in dire need of \nreplacement. The aging facility was too small to accommodate eligible \nchildren and was found to contain safety hazards including asbestos and \nlead. The men and women serving our Nation at Beale deserve to know \nthat their children are being cared for in a safe and nurturing \nenvironment. The new CDC will provide this peace of mind.\n  The Silver-LEED-Certified 37,566-square-foot facility will increase \nthe number of children served from 175 to 280, relieving the burden on \nmany military families who currently rely on childcare located 20 miles \noff base. It will have a total of 21 classrooms for children ranging \nfrom infants to preschool age and employ 70 staff members. The new CDC \nis also centrally located and easily accessible from anywhere on the \ninstallation. This new CDC will go a long way to ensure we are meeting \nthe needs of the families stationed at Beale.\n  As cochair of the Senate Military Family Caucus, I know that when a \nservicemember wears a uniform, the entire family serves. That is why we \nmust do everything we can to lessen their burden and provide for their \nneeds. The new CDC at Beale symbolizes America's commitment to our \nincredible military families and is one more way we can show our \ngratitude for their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2081-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LEE ANDERSON\n\n Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor an \nexceptional Tennessean and fellow Chattanoogan for his outstanding \ncareer as a newsman and his many contributions to our city and country.\n  Lee Stratton Anderson was born in Trenton, KY in 1925 to Mr. and Mrs. \nHerbert L. Anderson. At the age of 5, he moved to Chattanooga, TN, \nwhere he still resides today. In 1942, as a high school junior, Lee was \nhired as a reporter at the Chattanooga News-Free Press, and on April \n18th of this year, he will retire from that same newspaper 70 years to \nthe day his storied career began.\n  It was clear from an early age that Lee Anderson was an exceptional \nperson dedicated to serving others and his country. In addition to \nbecoming a journalist at 16 years old, Lee earned the distinction of \nEagle Scout and was the winner of two Sons of the American Revolution \nGood Citizenship Awards. After high school, he enrolled in the \nUniversity of Chattanooga and volunteered for the Air Force aviation \ncadet program, serving 21 months on Active Duty in World War II before \nreturning to school and to the paper. He maintained a busy schedule as \na college student, arriving at 6:00 a.m. to the paper each day before \nheading to class until 9:30 p.m. Remarkably, he graduated in 3 years \nwhile still finding time to be a leader on campus. He was president of \nSigma Chi fraternity, the Blue Key Honor Society, and the \nInterfraternity Council, and chairman of the Honor Council \nIndoctrination Committee, all while holding a full-time job.\n  At the Chattanooga News-Free Press, Lee covered politics and the \nState legislature before being named associate editor in 1948 and then \neditor in 1958. It was as an associate editor that Lee began to write \nthe editorials that would become his signature. Over 40 years later, \nwhen Walter Hussman bought and merged the News-Free Press with then-\nrival the Chattanooga Times, Lee was named associate publisher and \neditor of the combined paper. The Chattanooga Times Free Press remains \nthe only U.S. newspaper to offer two editorial perspectives, and, at \nage 87, Lee continues to plan three or four editorials for the Free \nPress section of the editorial page each day. His editorials have been \nreprinted in publications throughout the country, garnering him \nnumerous awards, including the Freedoms Foundation's national award for \neditorials in 1979.\n  In addition to his 70-year career in the newsroom, Lee Anderson's \ncontributions to his community, State and country have been just as \nimpressive and valuable. He is a retired major in the U.S. Army Reserve \nand has served on a number of committees focused on educating the \npublic about the Civil War. In 1957, he cofounded Confederama, now \nknown as the Battles for Chattanooga Museum, an educational tourist \nattraction re-creating local battles and highlighting Chattanooga's \nrole during the Civil War. He has delivered more than 2,000 speeches on \na variety of topics, including religion, history, and politics, and \nauthored two books: ``Valley of the Shadow: the Battles of Chickamauga \nand Chattanooga, 1863'' and ``Israel: I looked over Jordan.''\n  Lee has held leadership positions in numerous civic causes and \norganizations, including the Chattanooga Downtown Rotary, the \nChattanooga Convention and Visitors Bureau, and the local chapter of \nthe American Red Cross, to name a few. This past year, Lee was named \nthe public face of United Way's annual campaign after almost 80 years \nof continuous participation with the charity, making his first \ncontribution as a first grader. He also served Tennesseans for 4 years \nunder my good friend, then-Governor Lamar Alexander, on the Tennessee \nIndustrial and Agricultural Development Commission.\n  Lee Anderson's many achievements in life are too numerous to list \nhere, but if you were to ask him, he would tell you after his wife, \nBetsy, of 62 years, two children and two grandchildren, one of his \ngreatest accomplishments has been teaching Sunday school for over 40 \nyears at First Presbyterian Church in Chattanooga.\n  Mr. President, I have known Lee Anderson for my entire adult life and \nhave seen firsthand his love for our community and witnessed his \ncontributions to making it a great place for our citizens to live and \ndo business. Over his long career, Lee's views have always reflected \nhis strongly held beliefs and deep devotion to the city and country he \nloves. It is an honor and a privilege to serve in the Senate on behalf \nof Tennesseans like Lee Anderson. I congratulate him for his remarkable \ndedication to the newspapers of record in Chattanooga and join with so \nmany others in thanking him for the lasting impact he has made, which \nwill extend for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2081-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2081-S2082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FROZEN FOOD MONTH\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge Frozen \nFood Month and to recognize the frozen food industry's significant \nefforts to ensure that families and schoolchildren across the United \nStates have access to healthy, affordable foods such as fruits and \nvegetables.\n  In our all too often hectic lives, frozen foods give Americans the \nflexibility to quickly prepare meals that are both nourishing and \naffordable.\n  School lunch planners also rely on frozen foods as they seek to serve \nhealthy, child-friendly meals while stretching limited budgets. For \ninstance, frozen fruits and vegetables are readily available and offer \noutstanding nutritional value to schoolchildren year-round.\n  Even during these tough economic times, the frozen food industry \ncontinues to provide much needed American jobs, with almost 100,000 \nemployees working in nearly 700 facilities nationwide.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to honor one of my home State's \nown frozen food companies, National Frozen Food Corporation. \nHeadquartered in Seattle, WA, National is currently celebrating its \n100th year as a leader in the frozen foods industry.\n  National began its impressive history when a man named William \nMcCaffray, Sr., started selling frozen strawberries in 1912. With a \n$5,000 loan from a friend, Mr. McCaffray built his small business from \nthe ground up, and in the 1930s expanded to selling frozen vegetables \nas well as fruit. From Mr. McCaffray's humble beginnings, National has \ngrown\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\nto be one of our country's premiere private-label frozen vegetable \nproducers and employs 670 people throughout the year. Today, National \nFrozen Foods is committed to continued improvement through innovation \nwithin its own walls and at the industry level.\n  I am proud to acknowledge the part that National Frozen Foods \nCorporation has played in our economy in Washington State, as well as \nthe positive impact that the frozen foods industry as a whole continues \nto have on the United States. In celebration of Frozen Foods Month, I \napplaud the employees and management of National Frozen Foods \nCorporation, and of the entire frozen food industry, for their hard \nwork and contributions to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2082-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DR. ANN COYNE\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I wish to honor \nDr. Ann Coyne of Lincoln, NE, who has recently been awarded the \nNational Association of Social Workers' Lifetime Achievement Award.\n  Dr. Coyne's accomplishments are many, and she is most deserving of \nthis prestigious award. First and foremost, she is a loving wife and \nmother. Dr. Coyne was married to her husband, Dermot, for nearly 45 \nyears before his death in 2002; and they were blessed with six \nchildren: P.J., Brian, Tom, James, Cathy and Gerry. She has been a \n``mom'' to many more by providing a safe and loving home to many \nNebraska foster children and by assisting many special needs children \nwith international adoptions.\n  In addition to being a mother, Dr. Coyne has maintained a strong \ncommitment to children throughout her professional career. She is a \nconsultant for the Nebraska Foster Care Review Board and was a board \nmember for Adoption Links Worldwide. She developed the dual degree \nbetween social work and public administration at the University of \nNebraska-Omaha, UNO; was instrumental in renaming UNO's School of \nSocial work in honor of another prestigious social worker from \nNebraska, Grace Abbott; and continues to teach both undergraduate and \ngraduate coursework to countless students in our State.\n  Perhaps the greatest of Dr. Coyne's achievements is her work in \nNicaragua. She fosters an ongoing relationship between UNO's Grace \nAbbott School of Social Work and the University of Nicaragua at Leon, \nUNAN, which has assisted 75 Nicaraguans in earning degrees in social \nwork. She worked with the Omaha Suburban Rotary Club to found Las \nChavalitos Maternal and Child Health Clinic in Managua. Additionally, \nDr. Coyne partnered with a former student to develop the Association de \nMaestras y Padres de Ninos Sordos, which now operates La Escuela de \nNinos Sordos, a primary day school for deaf children.\n  I, and all Nebraskans, have benefitted from Dr. Ann Coyne's \naccomplishments as a teacher, educator, and advocate for children. We \nare proud that the National Association of Social Workers has bestowed \nupon her its Lifetime Achievement Award. And we are also proud that the \nenormous impacts of Dr. Coyne's life and work have benefitted, and are \ncontinuing to benefit, the children of Nebraska, the United States of \nAmerica, and the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2082-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CESAR ESTRADA CHAVEZ\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize Cesar Estrada Chavez, a man whose leadership and nonviolent \ncrusade for justice changed millions of lives throughout America. Cesar \nChavez helped give all of us a chance at a better future.\n  On March 31, 2012, we will celebrate Cesar Chavez Day to commemorate \nhis life and his legacy. We will also pause to remember that the \nactions of one person can empower an entire community to fight for \nequal treatment and civil rights.\n  Cesar Estrada Chavez was born on March 31, 1927, near Yuma, AZ, to a \nfamily of farm workers. When his father was unable to work, Chavez \njoined the millions of people who worked in the fields to provide for \ntheir families and was inspired to do something to help his community. \nDaily, he saw and felt the farm workers' suffering. Working conditions \non the farms were extremely dangerous and compensation was poor. Chavez \ntaught migrant farm workers across the West that the life they deserved \nwas very different from the one they had been living. He knew the farm \nworkers' struggles intimately and used that knowledge as motivation to \nhelp the entire community find the tools it needed to overcome those \nstruggles. Change initially took root in California, swiftly spreading \nto the rest of the Western United States. Colorado's heritage is richer \nbecause of his influence and his legacy.\n  Chavez's message reached Colorado's Hispanic community during the \ndays of the civil rights movement. Chavez led advocacy efforts to \nempower people across Colorado, bringing about improved living and \nworking conditions for Colorado's farm workers. Additionally, his \nteachings inspired many Coloradans to join him in teaching farm \nworkers, students, and veterans the importance of equality, justice, \nand empowerment. A Coloradan who became one of these leaders was \nRodolfo ``Corky'' Gonzales, who would become a voice for the voiceless \nand a masterful poet and teacher in Colorado's Hispanic community.\n  Cesar Chavez's and Rodolfo Gonzalez's selflessness, patience, and \ncommitment mobilized Latinos and non-Latinos in Colorado and across \nAmerica to fight for equality, justice, and civil rights. Chavez is \nespecially remarkable because he truly embodied his own teachings. \nThroughout his life, he turned down many prestigious job offers and \nopportunities, choosing to work long hours in the fields side by side \nwith migrant workers. Chavez gave a human face to agriculture. He \ntaught many across the country that the grapes, onions, tomatoes, or \nother foods they purchased at the grocery store were part of a much \nlarger story. Moreover, he believed that the world's real wealth lies \nin the act of helping others. It is this belief that sustained him in \nthe face of long odds.\n  In a speech inspired by the nonviolent messages of Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., and Mahatma Gandhi, Cesar Chavez said, ``You cannot \nuneducate the person who has learned to read. You cannot humiliate the \nperson who feels pride. And you cannot oppress the people who are not \nafraid anymore.'' Chavez's life and legacy has taught millions of \npeople far more than just pride and bravery. He inspires all of us to \nfight for a better future for the world, for ourselves and for our \nneighbors. Cesar Chavez is a role model for Coloradans and for all \nAmericans.\n  On March 31, Coloradans across the State will come together to give \nback to their communities. I am proud to speak on behalf of them and on \nbehalf of all Americans fighting to give their children and the people \nin their communities a better life, regardless of their background or \ncolor of skin. Together, we honor those who are continuing Cesar \nChavez's fight for justice and celebrate the remarkable influence of \nhis vision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2082-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2082-4", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2082]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/27/senate-section/article/S2082-5", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2082-S2083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:14 p.m., a message from the House, delivered by Mr. Novotny, \none of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the \nfollowing bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 2682.

A bill to ensure that veterans have the information and \nprotections they require to make informed decisions regarding use of \nPost-9/11 Educational Assistance, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today, as Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am proud to introduce the GI Bill \nConsumer Awareness Act of 2012.\n  My colleagues, including my fellow Veterans' Affairs Committee \nMembers Senators Akaka, Begich, Brown of Ohio and Rockefeller, and my \nSenate colleagues Senators Coons, Harkin, Inouye, Leahy, and \nWhitehouse, join me in introducing this important legislation. I \nappreciate their continued support of our Nation's veterans.\n  With the end of the war in Iraq and the drawdown in Afghanistan, more \nservicemembers are separating from the military to start their civilian \ncareers. When my father came home from war, the GI Bill helped him go \nto college. He used that education to get a job, one that gave him \npride. That's the opportunity we must provide those returning from \ntoday's wars.\n  America's investment in its newest generation of veterans is \ntremendous.\n  In 2012, over 590,000 servicemembers, veterans, and other \nbeneficiaries are expected to enroll in educational institutions using \nthe Post-9/11 GI Bill. VA is expected to spend over $9 billion dollars \nin 2012 on Post-9/11 GI Bill payments and over $2 billion for the \nnearly 400,000 beneficiaries of the VA's other education programs. \nDespite this level of support, those returning from today's wars are \nunable to use VA educational benefits to their full potential. Today, \nthat ends.\n  At its heart, the GI Bill Consumer Awareness Act would take \nsignificant steps to make certain that GI Bill beneficiaries have \naccess to information to help them make informed decisions about the \neducational institutions they attend, so they get the most out of this \ntremendous benefit. This bill would also require VA and DoD to develop \na joint policy to curb aggressive recruiting and misleading marketing \naimed at servicemembers and veterans so they can make a decision on a \nschool without bad actors exerting unfair influence on them.\n  Many servicemembers and veterans attend educational institutions that \ndo not suit their intended goals. This shouldn't be the case. \nServicemembers and veterans should enroll in educational institutions \nwhich put them on the path to a successful career, or allow them to \naccess more post-secondary education opportunities. For many years we \nhave provided VA educational beneficiaries with billions of dollars in \neducational assistance, but have given them little to no assistance in \ndeciding where to use these benefits. This bill would put an end to \nthat.\n  The GI Bill Consumer Awareness Act calls for disclosure of, among \nother data, statistics related to student loan debt, transferability of \ncredits earned, veteran enrollment, program preparation for licensing \nand certification, and job placement rates. heard from many veterans \nthat this type of information would be very useful to them as they make \ndecisions about where to enroll.\n\n  My bill would also require VA to provide educational beneficiaries \nwith easy-to-understand information about schools that are approved for \nGI Bill benefit use. Collecting data for data's sake is not the goal \nhere. I want VA to use this information to develop a report card of \nsorts that allows veterans to see how one school compares against \nanother to help them decide which school is right for them.\n  We must acknowledge the differences between student veterans and \ntheir civilian classmates. Unlike their classmates, servicemembers and \nveterans need to know what services institutions provide to ease their \ndifficult transition to civilian life. Some educational institutions \nprovide more support than others.\n  The University of Washington, one of the oldest public universities \nin my\n\n[[Page S2088]]\n\nhome state, serves as an example of what all universities should be \ndoing. Through its Veterans Center, the University of Washington offers \nits student veterans a place to connect with other veterans, access \nuniversity resources, and receive referrals to campus and community \nresources that help to balance academic and personal demands. The \nUniversity of Washington is helping to ease the transition from the \nbattlefield to the classroom, and these types of services should be \nreplicated across the country.\n  Despite this bright spot, I have heard from servicemembers and \nveterans who don't think their schools are in touch with the assistance \nthat VA and other Agencies can provide to them. The GI Bill Consumer \nAwareness Act would require educational institutions to have at least \none employee who is knowledgeable about benefits available to \nservicemembers and veterans.\n  My bill would further require that academic advising, tutoring, \ncareer and placement counseling services, and referrals to Vet Centers \nare available and that faculty members are trained on matters that are \nrelevant to servicemembers and veterans. I want to make sure that each \neducational institution that is approved for GI Bill education benefits \nhas the support services that student veterans need in order to make \nthe most of their educational experience. No veteran should step on a \ncollege campus in this country and feel unsupported.\n  I am concerned about what I am seeing and hearing about groups who \nmislead our servicemembers and veterans--just to boost enrollment of \nstudents with a very lucrative benefit. The GI Bill Consumer Awareness \nAct would require VA and DoD to develop a joint policy on aggressive \nrecruiting and misleading marketing aimed at servicemembers, veterans, \nand other beneficiaries.\n  When servicemembers and veterans make a decision about a school--it \nshould be done with their own best interests at heart, and in \nconsultation with their families and those Agencies with a mandate to \nhelp them. The GI Bill Consumer Awareness Act would make educational \ncounseling available to more beneficiaries. As long as a beneficiary \nhas educational entitlement--counseling from VA would be available. I \nreally want VA to be proactive in its efforts to get these \nservicemembers and veterans in for counseling. This is an important \nstep in choosing a school and career path and one that I hope that more \nstudent veterans take advantage of.\n  This is not a full summary of all the provisions within this \nlegislation. However, I hope that I have provided an appropriate \noverview of the major benefits this legislation would provide for \nAmerica's servicemembers after they leave military service. I also ask \nour colleagues for their continued support for the Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2241\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
