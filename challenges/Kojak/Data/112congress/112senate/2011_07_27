Madam President, today our Republican colleagues in the \nHouse planned to vote on a bill to lift the debt ceiling for a few \nmonths before plunging this Nation and its economy back into a state of \nuncertainty.\n  What I mean by that is under their legislation, which would extend \nthe debt ceiling for just a few months, and the latest report, because \nthe numbers they have come up with are all wrong, we would come back in \nSeptember if, in fact, we ever left here, and we would be debating the \ndebt ceiling all over again. What a way to proceed. It is unbelievable \nthey would come up with such a program.\n  Last night, Speaker Boehner pushed back that vote because his \nlegislation did not even have the support of Republicans in his own \nChamber. Group after group, from the Republican Study Committee, the \nClub for Growth, and many organizations have said they simply do not \nlike his legislation.\n  But pushing back the vote by a day or rewriting parts of the bill \nwill not solve the underlying problem: A short-term solution is not an \nadequate solution for our economy. Our country, our economy, and the \nworld demand more.\n  Why do I say the world? Because our economy is the most robust, \nstrongest economy in the world--the history of the world--and for us to \nfail to pay our debt would throw the world economy into a tailspin.\n  Even if the Speaker could get his legislation through the House of \nRepresentatives, I can assure everyone it would not pass the Senate. \nAnd certainly if by some strange phenomenon it passed, the President \nwould not sign it. We do not have to worry about that. There will be no \nveto. This legislation is so weak that it will not get out of this \nChamber.\n  Rather than lifting what economists call the fog of default, this \nRepublican plan would usher in an era of bad economic weather that \ncould last for years. A few weeks ago, Speaker Boehner said it was a \nterrible idea to merely postpone a default on the national\n\n[[Page S4918]]\n\ndebt or to push the problem down the road for a few weeks or a few \nmonths. That is what he said. Back then he was not interested in a \nshort-term solution. Back then he was right.\n  This is why: Economists, market analysts, and rating agencies have \nsaid the world economy simply cannot bear this kind of uncertainty any \nlonger. They have said a short-term solution to the impending default \nwould still result in the loss of our AAA rating that has kept interest \nrates low in this country and saved consumers money for more than 70 \nyears. So I trust Speaker Boehner and other reasonable Republicans \nunderstand the seriousness of a default crisis. Here is what the \nSpeaker said very recently:\n\n       That would be a financial disaster not only for our country \n     but for the worldwide economy. You cannot create jobs if you \n     default on the Federal debt.\n\n  But a short-term fix does not get the job done. It would cause many \nof the same calamitous results as a technical default, including rising \ninterest rates that would essentially raise every person's taxes. \nAmerican families will pay more for their mortgages, car loans, student \nloans, credit card bills, and everything else. Higher interest rates \nwould not just be costly for consumers, it would also cost the Federal \nGovernment more, and would actually increase our deficits and debt--and \nvery quickly.\n  A less than 1-percent increase in interest rates, which economists \nhave predicted if the United States debt is downgraded, would cost our \ngovernment more than $100 billion every year. I repeat: It would cost \nour government $100 billion extra every single year. In a decade, that \nwould cost this country as much taxpayer money as Speaker Boehner's \nproposal would cut from the deficit. In effect, his short-term plan \nwould yield not a single dime of savings. Nothing.\n\n  Republicans would like the American public to believe Democrats in \nCongress and the White House are insisting on a long-term deal for \npolitical reasons. They say Democrats want to push this off until after \nthe Presidential election. That is not true. It is not Democrats who \nhave asked for a long-term solution. It is the economy. The economy has \ndemanded it.\n  If Republicans in Congress are willing to risk our economy by playing \npolitics in July, why would they not do the same in September, October, \nNovember, when his proposal--Speaker Boehner's proposal--would run out \nof money? That is why every economist, every market analyst, every \nrating agency, has insisted any legislation to avert a default on the \nNation's debt must take us through the end of 2012.\n  The Senate is considering a measure that would avert default and cut \n$2.7 trillion from the deficit. It is a reasonable measure. Republicans \nhave supported every one of its cuts in the past, and it should be able \nto pass both Houses of Congress with bipartisan support. I have heard a \nnumber of my friends on the other side of the aisle come here and say: \nBut they are talking about the overseas contingency fund. The \nCongressional Budget Office--the nonpartisan watchdog of Congress--has \ndecided that is worth $1 trillion, just what we put in our bill. The \nOffice of Management and Budget said it is worth $1 trillion. The \nlegislation we are projecting gives each side something it wants. It \nprotects Social Security and Medicare without raising a single penny of \nrevenue. And, most importantly, it is a long-term strategy to safeguard \nthe economy and give the markets the stability they need.\n  Unlike Speaker Boehner's legislation, which economists have rejected, \nit would not put us through all of this again in a few months--probably \nonly a few weeks--and with even less certainty of achieving a \ncompromise than now.\n  British Prime Minister David Lloyd George said: ``There is nothing \nmore dangerous than to leap a chasm in two jumps.'' That is true. \nCongress has a duty to do what it takes to avert a national default in \none swift leap.\n  It will take political courage. I urge all of my friends, Democrats \nand Republicans, to join hands. We can take courage from one another \nand make that leap together. Because if we do not clear this chasm, our \nNation's economy will go over the edge with us.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/27/senate-section/article/S4918-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, yesterday afternoon the White House \nissued a Statement of Administration Policy which said that when the \nlegislation Speaker Boehner is now revising reaches the President's \ndesk, unnamed senior advisers will recommend that the President veto \nit.\n  I have a question for these senior advisers: what about this \nlegislation is so offensive that you would rather see the Nation \ndefault on its obligations than have the President sign it into law?\n  From what I can tell, the only thing in this bill the President has \nnot already expressed his support for either publicly or privately is \nthat it does not get him through his election without having to engage \nin another national discussion about the debt crisis that has brought \nus to this point.\n  So I would ask these senior advisers whether that is a position they \nwant to put the President in. Do they really intend to suggest that he \nveto the Nation into default for political reasons?\n  That is how I read the threat. And I think that is how the rest of \nthe country would read it too.\n  So this morning I would like to reiterate my strong support for \nSpeaker Boehner, the House Republican leadership and this plan to \nprevent default and reduce Washington spending.\n  I also want to commend the Speaker for his efforts and his \ndetermination.\n  This has not been an easy process, but I hope through it all the \nNation sees how hard the Speaker has worked to ensure our Nation avoids \ncalamity while safeguarding the American dream.\n  The Nation has had a chance to see the Speaker at his best over the \npast few days.\n  Unlike the President, he not only put forward actual legislation to \nprevent this crisis, he is keeping his promise to cut spending more \nthan any increase in the debt limit--with no tax hikes.\n  What about the President's plan? When asked about the President's \nplan, his aides point to a speech and a veto threat.\n  With all due respect, Congress cannot vote on a speech, and a veto \nthreat would not prevent default. The fact is Republicans have offered \nthe only proposal at this point that attempts to get at the root of the \nproblem and which actually has a chance of getting to the President's \ndesk.\n  That is why we will continue to press for the legislation Speaker \nBoehner has proposed, and that is why we will fight against anything \nthat pretends to solve the problem but doesn't--including the bill from \nSenate Democrats that proposes the largest debt limit increase in \nhistory, while falling $\\1/2\\ trillion short on the cuts it claims to \nprovide.\n  This crisis our Nation faces at this moment has a very simple cause \nand is easily understood: Washington spends a lot more money every year \nthan it takes in. Do that every year and the debt piles up. Now we have \nreached the point where our deficits and debt are so large they are \nsuffocating job growth, threatening the wider economy, and imperiling \nentitlements.\n  It took more than two centuries for Washington to amass a debt of \n$10.6 trillion. But just 2\\1/2\\ years after President Obama swore the \noath of office, it is higher by more than one-third. Based on the \nPresident's actual policies, the situation is expected to get much \nworse.\n  In just 5 years' time, under President Obama's budget plan, the \nFederal Government will spend almost as much money just to cover the \ninterest on its debt as it will on national defense. Over the next 10 \nyears, the President's policies will add more than $9 trillion to the \ndebt.\n  This is why S revised its long-term credit outlook for the United \nStates, not because we haven't authorized the President to spend more\n\n[[Page S4919]]\n\nmoney but because he is asking for so much of it.\n  Yet, incredibly, the President's budgets would do nothing to reverse \nthis trend. So he can claim to be interested in a solution, but what he \nput on paper makes the problem worse.\n  Right now, the President is asking Congress to raise the debt ceiling \nby more than it has ever been raised before in our history--even as the \nNation is teetering on the edge of a crisis caused by that very debt.\n  Let me repeat, our Nation is facing a crisis because of the size of \nour debt, and the President of the United States, the man Americans \nelect to be the steward of our economy, is threatening to veto any bill \nthat doesn't add more than $2 trillion to the debt ceiling, the largest \nincrease in history.\n  The President is not taking a stand on cuts. He is not taking a stand \non reform to entitlements. He is not insisting on reforms. Forget all \nthat. What he wants more than anything else is more room under the debt \nceiling to get him through the election. He has said that is his bottom \nline.\n  I remain as committed as ever to resolving this crisis in a way that \nwill allow us to avoid default without raising taxes and to cut \nspending without budget gimmicks.\n  There is only one option that does that and that is the one Speaker \nBoehner has proposed, and that is being improved as we speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/27/senate-section/article/S4919-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, yesterday, I came to the floor to talk \nabout where we have been, where we are and where we are going and to \ndiscuss how we are going to get out of this mess. I pointed out the \nPresident's disappointing record when it comes to the debt issue.\n  The President originally requested a clean debt ceiling increase that \ndidn't have any spending reductions attached to it. He then submitted a \nbudget that failed to ever balance, and this budget didn't include the \nrecommendations from the Simpson-Bowles commission he had appointed to \ncome up with some suggestions about how to put our country on a more \nsustainable fiscal path.\n  According to the CBO, his budget didn't even meet his metric of \nprimary balance, which is balancing the budget not including interest \ncosts. After realizing House Republicans were the only ones with a plan \nto balance our budget and pay down the debt, President Obama decided to \ngive a speech. Of course, it was just a speech. It did not include \nnumbers. He didn't resubmit his budget, despite requests to do so. He \njust gave a speech.\n  As they say, talk is cheap. We need action. The only action he \npromised, though, is that he will veto plans that would do something to \naddress our debt and deficit problems.\n  Earlier this month, the administration issued a veto threat for the \ncut, cap, and balance bill. This was a reasonable proposal that \nimmediately cut spending, put a cap on spending, and would have raised \nthe debt limit after a balanced budget amendment was approved by the \nCongress.\n  In fact, this was so reasonable that, according to a CNN poll, 66 \npercent of the people in this country supported this plan. This bill \ngarnered the support of 234 Members of the House of Representatives, \nincluding 5 Democrats. But Senate Democrats voted to table the bill \nafter this veto threat was issued by the President.\n  So Speaker Boehner in the House of Representatives unveiled yet \nanother plan. It certainly isn't perfect, but it begins to deal with \nour spending problem while also increasing the debt limit to provide a \nperiod of time for Congress to pass more substantial budget savings.\n  Unfortunately, the administration issued a veto threat for this bill. \nTheir reasoning? It doesn't extend the debt limit past the election.\n  It doesn't take a genius to figure out why. It is not because the \nmarkets require a longer term increase; they don't. It is not because \nCongress generally approves long-term increases in the debt limit; we \ndon't. It is not because a long-term increase would force us to cut \nmore spending; it would not. It is because the President has to face \nreelection next year. That is it--nothing more, nothing less. It is a \npolitical consideration, not an economic one.\n\n  So after months of fearmongering about the risk of not raising our \ndebt limit, the President will actually veto a bill because it casts \nhim in a bad political light. This is unacceptable.\n  Tomorrow, I am hopeful the House of Representatives will pass the \nBoehner bill. I am hopeful that as soon as we receive it in the Senate, \nwe will take it up, pass it, and send it to the President for his \nsignature.\n  We need to do it not just for the debt limit increase, which we do, \nbut we also need to do it to start cutting spending and creating a \nprocess to reform entitlement programs.\n  Already, our economy is feeling the impact of these debts and \ndeficits. We know from the Reinhart and Rogoff study that our economy \nis growing at 1 percentage point less than it should be because of our \ndebt. This is costing us about 1 million jobs every single year.\n  If we don't take action to cut spending, we know what our future \nholds: downgrades, interest rate increases, austerity programs filled \nwith tax hikes and Draconian spending cuts, and anemic economic growth.\n  Looking at Europe right now, Ireland pays 12.9 percent interest on 3-\nyear bonds. Portugal pays 19.4 percent. Greece pays an astounding 28.9 \npercent. These rates would truly bankrupt our country in short order.\n  Unfortunately, as former Bush economic adviser and Federal Reserve \nBoard of Governors member, Larry Lindsey, pointed out in a Wall Street \nJournal op-ed recently and reiterated it yesterday at a Finance \nCommittee hearing, even a normalization of interest rates in the United \nStates to their historical average for the past 20 years would add $4.9 \ntrillion to our projected debt over the next 10 years.\n  We can't afford the spending we have now, let alone this additional \ninterest. We need to start cutting spending now. Both the cut, cap, and \nbalance plan and the Boehner plan would do this.\n  We also need to create a process to reform entitlements. The cut, \ncap, and balance plan does this by capping spending, and the Boehner \nplan does this through the new joint committee that has a firm deadline \nfor congressional action yet this year.\n  I wish I could say there was a plan by the President that does this. \nThere isn't. That is why we in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives are going to have to take the leadership in this \ndebate. The President has obviously decided this is more about politics \nand, unfortunately, has not stepped up with the leadership that is \nnecessary to get our country back on a sustainable fiscal path. We are \nwhere we are as a consequence of that, and we are facing a deadline in \na few days where we will have to increase the borrowing authority of \nthis country.\n  What I submit to colleagues is, the issue and the challenge and the \nproblem in front of us is not the debt limit, it is the debt. If we \ndon't do something about this debt, we are going to bankrupt this \ncountry, we are going to see the kind of interest rates they are seeing \nin Europe and we are going to see anemic economic growth in this \ncountry and it is going to be difficult to get people back to work. So \ncutting spending, getting our fiscal house in order, making government \nsmaller, not larger, making the government economy smaller and the \nprivate economy larger is the way we need to get this country back on \ntrack. But it starts by having a plan that puts our fiscal house in \norder. So we, in the next few days, are going to have a chance to vote \nyet again on a plan put forward by the\n\n[[Page S4920]]\n\nHouse of Representatives because the President has failed to put \nforward a plan. I hope our colleagues in the Senate will do the right \nthing for this country and start to get us on that pathway that will \nenable us to get past the short-term challenges we face, get us to an \nopportunity to vote on a balanced budget amendment, which I think is \ndesperately needed in this country, which would put the kind of fiscal \ndiscipline we need in place for the long term, so we aren't having \nyear-over-year $1.5 trillion deficits that continue to accumulate more \nand more debt and put this country at a greater risk in future \ngenerations and greater jeopardy.\n  I hope my colleagues will support a responsible plan that actually \ndoes cut spending, does address the issue of entitlement reform, does \nit without raising taxes, and make sure that come next Tuesday we have \ntaken the necessary action to protect our economy, shield it from any \nadverse impacts that could occur as a result of us not raising our debt \nlimit but do it in a way that addresses the fundamental issue, which is \nthe debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nthe Senator from South Dakota. Before coming to the floor this morning, \nI returned 2 phone calls I received yesterday out of 2,000 that came \ninto the office. I picked those two because they were people I have \nknown for a long time but haven't talked to in a long time, and they \nhave never called me in my capacity as a Senator. Both of them are \nbusinesspeople, both are neighbors, and both had the same message: the \nuncertainty that Congress and this administration is now causing in \nterms of our inability to meet the day of reckoning next Tuesday, when \nwe must do so, is beginning to impact their business, their philosophy, \ntheir investments, and their country.\n  What we are doing as we almost dilly-dally around, putting off a \nfinal decision, agreeing to not agree on anything is we are making the \nsituation worse. I think the reports in a couple months will show \neconomic activity in July will show America is slowing down, economic \nactivity is slowing down. That is because Congress and this President \ncannot get their act together.\n  History and facts are stubborn. I wish to go over a 2-year history of \nthis debt ceiling crisis because, for years, we have known it was \ncoming. For 2 years, we have talked about it. In fact, a little over 18 \nmonths ago on the floor of the Senate, Republicans and Democrats passed \na deficit commission amendment, which made it successfully through \nCongress, was signed by the President, and that deficit commission was \ncreated. It was charged with coming up with a solution for our rising \nspending problems, reduction of the deficit and debt over time, better \nmanagement of our fiscal policy, and getting Congress's act together, \nwhere it could vote up or down on a proposal. That became known as the \nSimpson-Bowles proposal. It would cut $4 trillion in spending over one \ndecade, reform our tax policy, and weed out a lot of bad things that \nhave been in there for a long time.\n  What happened is, when it came out in December, the President \nrejected it out of hand. I am not being partisan, because a bipartisan \ngroup of people offered that proposal. I was one of the five \nRepublicans who voted for it on the floor. I thought it was a \nconscientious way to address the debt and deficit and the problem we \nfaced. For some reason, unbeknownst to me, the President rejected it \nout of hand. All he had to do was send it to the Senate for an up-or-\ndown vote, and we would at least have begun the process of dealing with \nthe debt and deficit. Instead, he rejected it out of hand.\n  In the months preceding this debate today and this coming Tuesday \nwhen we run up against the debt ceiling, we have had other legislation \ncome to the floor or from the House that has been rejected out of hand. \nThe cut, cap, and balance legislation, which I voted not to table last \nweek, the majority leader decided to not even discuss but to make a \nmotion to table it. But that was a conscientious way to deal with our \ndeficit and debt over time. It was a disciplined process that said we \nneed to make cuts now and begin the process--$51 billion--and watch our \nspending in the future based on historical spending averages, and we \nought to give the American people a chance to say: Does America need a \nbalanced budget?\n  Instead, the Senate tabled it, when we had a chance to say just say \nyes to solving our problems, and we just said no.\n  Last night, Speaker Boehner's bill, which was to be voted on today, \nwas pulled off because of a revenue estimate produced by CBO. I hope \nthat will get worked out and will pass the House and will come back to \nthe Senate. It is about time for us to say just say yes to something \ninstead of just saying no.\n  I wish to talk about the consequences of just saying no for a \nsecond. The longer we say no, the longer we send uncertainty into the \nworld markets and our own markets, the worse our problem will be.\n\n  Our tax system is based on Americans being prosperous. As America \nprospers, as we have better economic activity, our revenues go up--not \nbecause we raise taxes but because we raise expectations. We are now \nlowering expectations in America.\n  The two businesspeople I talked to this morning said they do not know \nwhat to do. Quite frankly, I didn't know what to advise them. I ran a \ncompany for 22 years, and I know the worst thing about running a \nbusiness is to have uncertainty in terms of which way to go.\n  So it is my sincere hope everybody will come together and realize no \nis not an option. We need to say yes. If the President has a plan, \nbring it. If the House passes their plan, let's vote for it on the \nSenate floor. But let's move forward because the price and the cost of \nuncertainty is destroying what little economic vibrance the United \nStates of America has today.\n  Let's raise the expectations of our people. Let's raise the \nproductivity of the Senate and the Congress and this President. Let's \nsit down at the bigger table of common sense and find a solution, and \nlet's find it now.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I come to the floor today having \nlistened to my colleagues and looking at the most recent job data, \nwhich shows the effects of our struggling economy. Unemployment is \ngoing up, wages are going down, and there are concerns all around the \ncountry with jobs, the economy, the debt, and spending.\n  I have to say, I certainly believe, as somebody who has practiced \nmedicine for 25 years in Wyoming and taken care of families all around \nthe Cowboy State and been very involved in the debate over the health \ncare law, that the President's health care law makes matters worse, \nabsolutely makes matters worse.\n  The President's health care law makes matters worse by forcing \nemployers to either offer government-approved health insurance or pay \nhigher expenses. Each day it becomes obvious to me the new health care \nlaw is designed to ultimately end employer-provided coverage altogether \nand to encourage Americans to join government-run exchanges. That is \nwhy, as a doctor, I come to the floor week after week with a doctor's \nsecond opinion about the health care law. Under this law businesses are \npermitted to drop out of paying for employer-provided coverage as long \nas they pay a fine. The fine is about $2,000 per employee. This number \nis far smaller than what it would actually cost the business to provide \nfamily health benefits to each of their employees.\n  So what happens with small businesses in this country? Well, they are\n\n[[Page S4921]]\n\ngoing to face an ever-clearer incentive to drop coverage for the people \nthey employ. They are not required to pay this fine for the first 50 \nworkers who lose coverage. So the question is, Where are these people \nsupposed to go? Where do they go for their insurance? How does it work?\n  The President promised them if they like what they have, they can \nkeep it. Yet the incentives built into the health care law seem to be \nencouraging employers to drop their employees. So where do they go?\n  Well, the new health care law sets up what are called health care \nexchanges for these people to enter. Whether they want to or not they \nwill be forced to go that way. These exchanges are shorthand for \ninsurance markets where as much as 80 percent of the cost of the \nfamily's insurance could be actually borne by taxpayers. Under these \ncircumstances, the natural response is for businesses to drop coverage \nfor their employees altogether and then simply offer them some less \nexpensive cash benefits.\n  Meanwhile, what happens to the employees who are going to lose the \ncoverage they may like and then try to replace it because that is what \nis going to happen? They will have to replace it with a plan Washington \nmandates. That is of concern to a lot of Americans, and this may be \nvery bad news for the patient and is really bad news for taxpayers.\n  Experts predict the annual cost to provide government insurance \nsubsidies could cost up to nine times more than what the White House \noriginally claimed. If that isn't proof enough the health care law is \nthe wrong prescription to help America's job creators continue offering \ncoverage to their workers, let's take a look at some of the things that \nhave just come out in the last week.\n  This week, on Monday, July 25, the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness--a group that represents small businesses all around the \ncountry--released an astonishing new report. The NFIB surveyed 750 \nsmall businesses. These are small businesses of less than 50 employees. \nThe survey asked these small businesses if they planned to drop health \ninsurance coverage should their employees become eligible for this \ngovernment subsidy to buy health insurance in the so-called exchange. \nMore than one-quarter of the small businesses who offer coverage \ntoday--over one-quarter of the small businesses that offer coverage \ntoday--said they were very likely to drop coverage. I repeat: Very \nlikely to drop coverage. Another 31 percent said they are somewhat \nlikely to drop coverage; that they needed to look into it to find the \nspecifics.\n  When we take a look and add the ones who are very likely and somewhat \nlikely to drop coverage, we are looking at over half the small \nbusinesses in this country dropping insurance coverage and effectively \ndumping their employees into the government-run exchange.\n  The small business group in the survey and the response from these \nsmall businesses prompted the Wall Street Journal to print an editorial \nhighlighting this data. It is entitled ``The Flight to the Exchanges.'' \nWhen I read this, I said: Gee, I couldn't have said it better myself.\n  The President's health care law wraps businesses in reams of \nbureaucratic redtape and uncertainty. Adding insult to injury, on \nMonday, July 11, of this year, the Department of Health and Human \nServices released yet another proposed regulation mandated by the \nhealth care law. The Obama administration issued its proposed insurance \nexchange regulation. What the rules do is give the States the specific \nframework they must use to set up a program or an exchange with this \nWashington-approved and mandated insurance. Here we go again, another \nexample of where this administration takes roughly 30 pages from the \nhealth care law and turns it into 340 pages of bureaucratic Washington \nrules and regulations.\n  Of course, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is trying to \nsell this new rule as offering competition and uses the word \n``flexibility.'' But nothing could be further from the truth. How \nflexible can a 347-page Washington rule be when it is a rule that \ncontains the word ``must'' 580 times and includes the word ``require'' \n811 times? How flexible can that Washington rule actually be?\n  Well, after examining all the rule's ``musts'' and ``requires,'' one \nthing is very clear: This administration is paying lipservice to State \nflexibility while their policy is promoting a Washington-mandated, \nWashington-dictated, Washington-enforced approach. This regulation \ndetails a very complex and confusing process that States are going to \nhave to follow. The States have to follow these confusing rules in an \neffort to prove to the Department of Health and Human Services they \nmeet its Washington mandates to set up and run the insurance exchanges, \nand they have very little time to do it. So this administration creates \nonerous new mandates and then fails to give States ample time to meet \ntheir overwhelming set of requirements.\n  Let's put this into context for the States. Comments of the \nadministration's proposed rules are due this September 28. Typically, \nit can take the Department of Health and Human Services 6 months to \nreview those comments about the rules and issue a final rule. That \nmeans we would likely see a final rule in March of 2012. Remember, \nthere are significant details missing from these exchange regulations. \nThis regulation is only part of the details States need to review \nbefore they can decide whether to run a health insurance exchange on \ntheir own or let the Federal Government do it.\n\n  The administration has yet to release rules explaining the health \ncare law's essential health benefits package, the individual \neligibility to participate in the exchanges, quality standards for the \nexchanges, and quality standards for the participating insurance plans. \nThose details may not come out until October or November of this year. \nThis means States still do not know what the minimum set--the minimum \nset--of health services individuals, small businesses, and insurers \nwill have to offer in the exchange. Pending missing details and further \nrules expected to come from the administration this fall, final rules--\nfinal rules--may be in place finally in May or June of 2012. States \nwould then have to be prepared to submit their plan in June of 2012 to \nHealth and Human Services to be certified.\n  But what happens if the rules aren't out by then? Many State \nlegislatures end their sessions by June, making complying with this \ntight time line extremely difficult, if not impossible. It seems to me \nthis administration will have had 2 years to post their final \nregulations while the States may have only 2 months to comply.\n  What happens if a State isn't ready? They say have no fear; \nWashington is here to help. That is what they say. If the Department of \nHealth and Human Services says a State's insurance exchange is not in \ncompliance, then Washington will swoop in and set up its own program. \nThis is often called the Federal fallback or the federally facilitated \nexchange, big fancy words for Washington bureaucrats telling States \nwhat they have to do.\n  The irony of all this is the administration's rules offer very few \ndetails explaining what this Federal fallback exchange will look like, \nso the States don't even know what happens if the Federal fallback \ncomes into play.\n  Is the Department of Health and Human Services creating a stealth, \nback-door Federal exchange? If a State doesn't have adequate time to \nmeet all the operational program requirements and the burdensome review \nprocess, it sounds to me like the Obama administration will then take \ncontrol of the States.\n  Why should a State such as Utah, for example, that has created an \nespecially designed insurance marketplace be forced to comply with \nonerous and costly requirements of this rule? If they are not willing \nto comply, will they face the consequences that Washington will make \nthe final decision? States should be encouraged to create innovative \nsolutions that meet the unique needs of their constituents, not forced \nto follow a one-size-fits-all laundry list of Washington mandates.\n  This is why I returned to the floor today, as a physician who has \npracticed medicine for a long time, with a doctor's second opinion, to \ntell you I believe this health care law is one that is bad for \npatients, it is bad for providers--the nurses and the doctors who take \ncare of those patients--and it is bad for taxpayers. It is why I \nbelieve it\n\n[[Page S4922]]\n\nis important we repeal and replace this health care law.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I come to the floor today with a great \nsense of urgency. We are less than 1 week away from reaching our debt \nlimit. If we fail and we falter, the United States of America will be \nirrevocably fractured. We aren't at an impasse; we are at the edge of a \ncliff. Unless Congress acts, we are going to go over it.\n  What will be the consequences of it? If we do not meet our \nobligations to pay our debts, it will result in a default, and default \nwill result in enormous increases in interest rates. For Americans who \nare so worried about tax increases, I've got to send a real red alert. \nWhen interest rates go sky high because of our failure to act, it will \nbe the biggest tax on America that we could have, and it will be a tax \nat the kitchen table. It means if anyone has a variable-rate mortgage, \nit will skyrocket.\n  If you have a student loan, that interest is going to increase. If \nyou have a car loan, forget it. The payments are going to be enormous. \nSo we need to face what this means: raising the debt limit. We need to \nprevent the default so our bond rating is not lowered.\n  I have never been big on talking about bond ratings, but this is a \ncrucial one. We now have a AAA bond rating. So what does that mean? It \nmeans when they buy our Treasury bills or other government-secured \ninvestments, but particularly our T-bills, it is as good as gold. If we \nare downgraded, we could just be a tinhorn, tin-cup nation. This is not \nthe United States of America. This is not what people fought and died \nfor.\n  When people say they represent a party that wants to defend the \nConstitution, we all have to defend the Constitution. Right now, \ndefending the Constitution and defending America is to lift our debt \nceiling and get to the hard work of, No. 1, dealing with our debt but \nalso dealing with job growth.\n  We have to get to work. Instead, we are busy at work playing the \nblame game. Squabbling is not a solution. But I believe we Democrats do \nhave a solution, and I think the solution does lie in the Reid \nproposal. The Reid proposal the majority leader has offered is \nsubstantive, it is real, and it is achievable.\n  I was on TV yesterday, and they said: Oh, you are a liberal Democrat. \nWell, I don't know if I am a liberal, I don't know if I am a \nconservative, but I will tell you what I am. I am a diner Democrat. I \nthink about the people. I think about the ordinary people, and I think \nabout their day-to-day needs. When people talk about what kind of \nsolutions they mean, they want everything on the table. What I want on \nthe table are the things that affect the kitchen table. That is why I \nsupport the Reid proposal. It is an achievable framework for avoiding \ndefault and downgrade of our bond rating now.\n  What does it do? It has three important elements.\n  One, timing, to take us through 2012. It is not about the next \nelection. It is showing we are serious and we are substantive.\n  Second, it has important content where we do cut Federal spending. \nIt's observable, it's quantifiable, and it's verifiable.\n  No. 3, it gives us a path forward to deal with the important issues \nof entitlement and revenue reform. Wow.\n  So why can't they take it? I am puzzled about why they can't take it. \nIs it 2012? OK. Who knows who is going to be in control of either the \nWhite House or the Congress then? But it can't be about us. It is not \nabout me. It is about we--we, the people.\n  Let's go to the content. There are substantial cuts there in \ndiscretionary spending. And there are substantial cuts to defense \nspending that do not affect readiness or military health care. These \nare actually cuts that the House voted for in the Ryan budget. So a few \nweeks ago, they said yes to the cuts. But when we say yes to the cuts, \nthey say no to the proposal. I don't get it. But it's not whether I get \nit. It is that we have to make sure we get a solution.\n  What I think is important about the Reid proposal is it is $2.7 \ntrillion in cuts. I understand CBO has scored it and they say it is \n$2.2 trillion. Well, $2.2 trillion, $2.7 trillion, that is real money. \nThat is real money, and it shows we are serious.\n  It also provides this important path forward called a Joint \nCommittee. It is not a commission where it is going to be outsiders who \nare experts from think-tank environments and hoo-ha, hoo-ha. It's \nMembers of Congress, both sides of the aisle, both sides of the Dome. \nLet's get it together with them, and then let's have this committee \nwhere we then move forward on the reform of revenue as well as looking \nat entitlement reform.\n  I want to be clear that if, the horror of all horrors comes where we \nfracture the standing of the United States of America, not only in the \nfinancial markets but in the standing of the world, it will have very \nserious consequences.\n  The President is going to have to pay the bills based on whatever \nmoney is coming in. He would not be able to borrow. America would not \nbe able to borrow. So our T-bill will not have the same value it once \ndid. He is going to have to pay our bills.\n  What are the consequences on federal benefits? One is paychecks. The \nfirst paycheck he is going to meet is the paycheck for our troops. He \nhas to make sure that if they are fighting to defend America while we \nare squabbling around and screwing around, we are going to pay our \ntroops. My God, did it ever occur to anyone that our troops wouldn't \nget paid? Yes, it is going to be tight.\n  So we pay the troops. We are going to certainly pay our veterans' \nbenefits. They might not be the same amount the first month, but we \nwill kind of squeak through. Then, it will be Social Security. Well, \nmaybe the checks will go out, but maybe it will only be at half the \namount. But the Social Security offices will be closed. So benefits \nwill have a direct impact.\n  Where is he going to slow down the trickle of money? To State and \nlocal governments. So what does that mean? Community development block \ngrant money, education, and so on. That is going to cause enormous \nlayoffs of public employees and contractors at the State and local \nlevel. The asphalt contractor, the person who handles the office \nmachinery, minority contractors, and so on--all that small business \nthey love to romanticize over are going to have a big impact.\n  Then the Federal Government will definitely have to slow down or not \npay at all contractors, whether it is the big defense guys that employ \nthousands and thousands of people or it is the small- to medium-sized \nbusinesses, like the ones in my own State that do information \ntechnology?\n  We are about to destroy the reputation and solvency of the United \nStates of America. We are about to destroy the reputation and solvency \nof the United States of America not only for one day but for a decade \nand maybe the rest of the century. This is not being done by an outside \npower. We are spending $700 billion on defense, and we are destroying \nourselves by a self-inflicted wound because of political dysfunction, \npolitical rigidity, and political ideology. What the heck is this? I \ncould even use more intense language. What we are about to do, we \ncannot allow this to happen.\n  One of my colleagues said to me yesterday, Senator Mikulski, what \nwould it take to get you to the table? I said: Get me a plan and 30 \nRepublican names behind it; I will see if I can support the plan and \nget 30 others.\n  I know my time is up, but I don't want the time to be up on America. \nLet's come together. Let's stop being Democrats, let's stop being \nRepublicans, let's call us what we should be called: Americans.\n  What do Americans do? When the times are tough, the tough get going. \nLet's get going. Let's make the tough decisions. Let's put politics \naside, put America No. 1, and get us back on track.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, I wish to thank my good friend and colleague\n\n[[Page S4923]]\n\nfrom Maryland for her great words. She comes from the heart of Maryland \nand the heart of America. Very few people I have met in politics in my \nmany years in this endeavor have an understanding of how average people \nfeel and think and tick than the great Senator from the State of \nMaryland, and I wish to thank her for her outstanding remarks. If this \nbody on both sides of the aisle would listen to her and her commonsense \nintelligence, we would be in a lot better shape than we are now. So I \nthank my colleague from the great State of Maryland, the senior \nSenator.\n  I rise to discuss the deadlock we have reached in the debate over \nraising the Nation's debt ceiling. Two nights ago, the President spoke \nand put the current stalemate in the context it belongs: The result of \na small block within the House Republicans that refuses to compromise \neven one inch, it is on their shoulders.\n  We have perhaps 100 Republicans at the extreme right who seem to be \nleading the Congress and the Nation over a cliff. They don't even care \nabout the idea that we might default. It is appalling. Yet they seem to \nbe calling the shots.\n  For the last few weeks, the President has met over and over with \nHouse Republicans trying to meet them halfway and in some instances \nmore than halfway. He has offered to cut record amounts from our debt \nand make cuts in programs that would be extremely painful to our side \nof the aisle. This minority in the House has come to think of \n``compromise'' as a dirty word, and it appears as if they can't take \nyes for an answer. If you don't care about debt reduction, if you don't \ncare about debt ceiling, rather, you can't get something done.\n  Speaker Boehner, who is a good and reasonable man, wants to do the \nright thing and compromise, but he is struggling to rein in his caucus. \nInstead of leading the House, Speaker Boehner is being led by a fringe \nin his caucus that thinks default is OK. This week, Speaker Boehner \noffered a two-step plan that simply kicks the can down the road. It \nresolves the debt ceiling only for the next few months. With the new \nCBO numbers, it will inevitably resolve it for even a shorter period of \ntime, and that puts us, within a few months, right back at square one, \nall over again, with the same anxiety, the same gridlock, the same \nproblems we face today. What sense, in the good Lord's name, does that \nmake to just repeat this over and over until we drive off the cliff? It \nmakes no sense.\n  All we have to do is look at how difficult this crisis has been to \nresolve after a year of negotiations. Does anyone think it would be a \ngood idea to do this all over again in less than 6 months? The \nSpeaker's approach is not only wrong, it is dangerous. It would leave a \ncloud of default hanging over our heads for the next several months, \nundermining confidence in U.S. bonds.\n  Market analysts have rejected the Speaker's approach, saying it could \nactually bring some of the same bad consequences as a default itself. \nIt could even cause a credit rating downgrade.\n  Just yesterday, the CEO of Nasdaq testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee and said:\n\n       The longer the deal, the better it is for the markets.\n\n  Christian Cooper, a currency trader, was quoted by Bloomberg News \nthis morning saying:\n\n       From the markets' point of view, a two-stage plan is a \n     nonstarter because we now know it is amateur hour on Capitol \n     Hill and we don't want to be painted in this corner again. \n     There is significant risk of a downgrade with a deal that \n     ties further cuts to another vote only a few months down the \n     road.\n\n  He said it better than any of us could say it, and he is a currency \ntrader.\n  Mohamed El-Erian, the CEO of PIMCO, one of the most respected \ninvestors in the markets--and he invests, as I understand it, hundreds \nof billions of dollars. Mr. El-Erian expressed concern the other night \nthat ``the political ground is being prepared for a short-term stop-gap \ncompromise.'' He warned this could push stocks down and leave the U.S. \ndebt rating ``extremely exposed to a damaging downgrade.'' Let me again \nquote Mr. El-Erian, one of the great experts on our credit markets. \nWhat he said is, the kind of plan that came over from the House that is \nattempting to be debated in the House--I don't think it will even make \nit over, but the kind of plan being debated in the House would ``create \nan extremely exposed damaging downgrade to our credit, to our Nation's \ndebt rating.''\n  Even Republicans rejected a short-term increase in the debt ceiling \nas recently as last month. Dave Camp, Republican chairman of Ways and \nMeans, said:\n\n       It doesn't give you certainty. Ideally, you'd like to get \n     that settled and not have to continually have it a \n     continually hanging-over issue.\n\n  That is the Republican head of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  House majority leader Eric Cantor said:\n\n       If we can't make the tough decisions now, why would [we] be \n     making those tough decisions later. I don't see how multiple \n     votes on a debt ceiling increase can help get us to where we \n     want to go. It is my preference we do this thing one time. . \n     . . Putting off tough decisions is not what people want in \n     this town.\n\n  That is from House Majority Leader Cantor. Yet he is leading the \ncharge to send over the very type of plan he has criticized only a few \nweeks ago.\n  Republicans have apparently flip-flopped on this point. They are now \nsaying they want the same kind of short-term debt ceiling increase they \nopposed on substantive grounds previously. Republicans have flipped-\nflopped on this point. Make no mistake about it, a short-term deal is \nstill a nonstarter in the Senate and nothing more than a glidepath to a \ncredit downgrade, and we will not allow it.\n  While Republicans continue pushing for an unproductive plan, Senator \nReid's plan, the Senate plan, offers real potential to finally break \nthis impasse. It makes difficult choices. It includes almost $1 \ntrillion in domestic discretionary program cuts, including defense. \nThis is serious belt tightening that will have consequences, good \nconsequences, for years to come.\n  The plan received a major boost this morning when Congress's official \nscorekeeper confirmed that the first draft cuts more--a lot more--than \nthe Boehner plan. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the \nSenate draft bill achieves almost $1.3 trillion more in deficit \nreduction than the Boehner plan.\n  The report also affirms that the $1 trillion in savings the Senate \nplanned from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is real. That is CBO saying \nit, not some Democrat who is hoping and praying for an easy fix. This \ncompletely undercuts the arguments by Republicans who have tried to \ncall these savings a gimmick, even though they included them in their \nown budget and voted for them a few months ago. If it was OK in their \nbudget, it has to be OK in our budget. You cannot just change your mind \nbased on whose budget it is. Substance should matter to some extent.\n  Plus, since the CBO only measured the plan's first draft before \nadditional planned savings were incorporated into the bill, the final \nversion of the Senate plan will achieve even deeper savings when it is \nfiled on the Senate floor. As Politico reports this morning:\n\n       In the battle of budget scores, the Senate Democratic \n     deficit reduction bill is the clear winner thus far over an \n     alternative by Speaker John Boehner.\n\n  Lastly, Senator Reid's proposal allows for a joint committee that has \nthe potential to achieve even deeper savings down the road to get our \ncountry back on the path to economic growth. All in all, this is an \noffer that Republicans cannot refuse. All of the cuts in Senator Reid's \nproposal have been supported at one point or another by the Republican \nside. It meets the two main requirements laid out by the House \nRepublicans: First, Speaker Boehner said the amount of the debt ceiling \nincrease must be matched by the amount of spending cuts. Our proposal \nwill do just that.\n  Second, Speaker Boehner said the tax increases must be off the table. \nEven though most of us would prefer tax increases, our proposal \nincludes no revenue raisers whatsoever. We don't want tax increases on \nthe middle class; we want tax increases on the wealthy and elimination \nof corporate loopholes. To not have them is a hard decision to many on \nour side who know we are going to need to do that for serious debt \nreduction.\n  The bottom line: In conclusion, we are getting dangerously close to \nAugust 2. Over and over Democrats have shown a willingness to move in \nthe direction of Republicans. It is time for\n\n[[Page S4924]]\n\nSpeaker Boehner to cut off his extreme Republicans who refuse to \nsupport even the plan that he crafted to meet their reckless demands. \nThe Reid plan is our best route to a compromise. It is a compromise we \nneed soon before the markets render a truly ominous judgment that will \nset our economy back for years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from New York, \nSenator Schumer, as well as Senator Mikulski from Maryland for coming \nto the floor this morning and speaking about the crisis we face. The \ndebt ceiling default, which will occur in 6 days if we do not act, will \nhave a profound, negative impact on America's standing in the world and \nour economy at home. It threatens to stifle job creation and to slow \ndown the business growth we need to get out of this recession. It is \nthe most serious impact one could imagine at a time when we are facing \nthis kind of recession.\n  This debt ceiling is being extended, or should be extended, under a \nlaw that was passed in 1939. We have extended the debt ceiling 89 \ndifferent times: 55 times under Republican Presidents, 34 times under \nDemocratic Presidents, and virtually every President has done it.\n  The President who holds the record for the most debt ceiling \nextensions in history is Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan extended the debt \nceiling 18 times in his 8 years, during that period of time tripling \nthe national debt. The President who holds the record next is President \nGeorge W. Bush, who doubled the national debt in his 8 years and raised \nthe debt ceiling 9 times.\n  This should have been done, and done routinely. Many of the Members \nof Congress, House and Senate, who come to the floor and say we will \nnever vote to extend the debt ceiling are not being honest with the \nAmerican people. The debt ceiling is paying for what Congressmen and \nSenators voted for. They came to the floor and said: Let's go to war, \nlet's stay at war, let's spend $10 billion a month. And the President \nsaid: That was Congress's decision. Now I have to borrow the money to \nkeep that promise. And these Members of Congress are saying: Oh, no, we \ndon't want to have any fingerprints on the debt ceiling extension.\n  We cannot have it both ways. Members of Congress cannot ask for \nspending and then fault the President when he has to borrow money to \nmake it happen. That is exactly what they are doing.\n  The President has tried to work out a bipartisan agreement to deal \nwith this debt ceiling crisis. He invited in Republicans and Democratic \nleaders with Vice President Biden to sit down and work out an \nagreement, a bipartisan agreement. About 4 weeks ago, the House \nRepublican majority leader, Eric Cantor of Virginia, stood up and \nwalked out. He said: I am walking away from these bipartisan \nnegotiations. I am not going to be party to them. Leave it up to \nSpeaker Boehner.\n  Speaker Boehner then went into negotiations with President Obama, \ntalking behind the scenes about ways to resolve this issue. That was a \npositive thing. But then he announced he was walking away from \nnegotiations not once but twice, most recently last Friday.\n  Monday night, television sets around America were tuned in as the \nPresident of the United States explained this crisis and then Speaker \nBoehner explained his point of view. Speaker Boehner said Monday night \nhe had a plan, a plan that would solve this crisis in a responsible \nway. That was Monday night. But then came Tuesday, and as the dawn came \non Tuesday morning and people took a close look at the Boehner plan, \nhere is what they found.\n  They found that business leaders across America were saying it was a \nterrible idea, the idea of a 6-month extension to the debt ceiling; \ngoing through this mess again and again would harm our economy.\n  Then the Congressional Budget Office took a look at the Boehner plan. \nThey talked about it Monday night and said it does not add up. It does \nnot cut the spending Speaker Boehner said it would. Then, finally, 100 \nmembers of Speaker Boehner's Republican caucus walked out on him \nyesterday, saying it was a bad plan.\n  So here we are, 6 days away from a deadline, 6 days away from a \nmanufactured political crisis. It is time to do what is right. Senate \nmajority leader Harry Reid has a proposal which addresses this \nresponsibly. It cuts spending--and it has already been scored, has it \nnot, by the Congressional Budget Office? It turns out that unlike \nSpeaker Boehner's plan, Senate majority leader Harry Reid's plan does \ncut spending to move us toward a balanced situation.\n  Second, it extends this debate beyond the next election, beyond the \nnext year, so we do not put our fragile and weak economy through this \nagain and again. That is sensible. It also calls for the creation of a \njoint committee to deal with the long-term deficit. I have been \ninvolved in this conversation with the deficit commission, again, with \nthe Gang of 6. We can do this on a bipartisan basis if we are honest \nand open with one another, and Majority Leader Reid leads us in that \ndirection.\n  We face a deadline 6 days from today. The Boehner plan of Monday \nnight has disintegrated before our eyes. It has been rejected by \nbusiness leaders. It has been rejected by the Congressional Budget \nOffice. It has been rejected by the House Republican caucus. It is time \nfor a little humility on both sides of the aisle from both parties.\n  Let's put all this squabbling aside. Let's focus on America's \neconomy, putting people to work, saving businesses, and handling our \ndebt in a responsible way. We can do it. We can do it if we stop \nlistening to the political extremists and start dealing with the center \nof America which calls for leadership and wants us to put an end to \nthis squabbling.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/27/senate-section/article/S4924-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, as the Senator from Illinois just \npointed out, today we are 6 days away from a possible default which \ncould plunge this country into a serious crisis. In fact, there are \nsome who view maybe it is not exactly 6 days; it could be a few days \nmore. There are those who argue that somehow--in a bizarre fashion--\nthat somehow we could prioritize our payments to the most urgent \nrequirements, such as our veterans, such at Social Security and others.\n  I wonder, what if the Greek Government came up with that same \nproposal as they went into bankruptcy, that they would prioritize \nspending that is remaining?\n  The point is, today we are 6 days away. The point is, markets are \njittery. Investors are concerned. Most importantly, our constituents \nare frustrated. They are confused and they are\n\n[[Page S4925]]\n\nangry. Today, on the front page of USA Today, there is a headline that \nsays:\n\n       The Debt: What Americans Think About The Political Debate.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Just get it done, work it out.\n\n  Another person:\n\n       ``I'm sick of it,'' says Davis, 73, a retired economist. . \n     . . ``They're playing games. Here we are, trying to pull \n     ourselves out of recession, and they can't come to an \n     agreement.''\n\n  If anyone thinks that the reputation and the approval rating of \nCongress and the Presidency has improved during this situation we find \nourselves in, obviously they are out of touch with their constituents \nand the American people. Not only are the American people concerned, \nnot only are the American people upset, but I will quote from and ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from this \nmorning's Washington Post.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 26, 2011]\n\n  Frustrated Executives Say Political Impasse Slows Hiring, Investing\n\n                            (By Neil Irwin)\n\n       Chicago.--Business leaders are growing exasperated with \n     Washington. And they say the dysfunction in the political \n     system is holding them back from hiring and investing.\n       A new sort of risk to growth is emerging, not from the kind \n     of economic forces that led to the recent recession but from \n     elected officials' inability to agree on how to deal with \n     them. This angst in the executive suite is reflected in this \n     month's uptick in lobbying by business groups eager to see a \n     deal on the federal debt ceiling, in surveys showing falling \n     confidence among business leaders--and, in the American \n     heartland, by the deepening frustrations of corporate chiefs.\n       In interviews in this great industrial capital, senior \n     executives in the area said they lack confidence that \n     political leaders can execute the basic nuts and bolts of \n     governing, as exemplified by the brinksmanship over raising \n     the debt ceiling. Indeed, the frustration over the political \n     climate and Washington's seeming inability to solve problems \n     appears to weigh more heavily in their minds than any \n     specific government policy.\n       The executives are hostile to President Obama and his \n     agenda and say higher taxes would damage their business \n     prospects and make them less inclined to invest and hire. But \n     in contrast to congressional Republicans' claims that any tax \n     increases would stop job creation in its tracks, many \n     executives say they could tolerate somewhat higher taxes if \n     they were part of a broader plan that offered clarity on the \n     nation's future policies, particularly one heavy on spending \n     cuts.\n       ``What are the rules of the game going to be in the long \n     term?'' said Lyle Heidemann, chief executive of the 5,000-\n     store hardware chain True Value. ``What our retailers would \n     like to have is consistency and predictability. We can handle \n     decisions we don't agree with, but that's easier than not \n     knowing what the decision is going to be.''\n       For example, he said, several True Value franchisees have \n     sold their stores in the past year--even though they would \n     have preferred to hold on to them for a few more years--\n     because they feared that the 15 percent capital gains tax \n     will rise at the end of the year, when it is scheduled to \n     expire.\n       The loss of confidence in Washington seems to be a driver \n     of a more fundamental lowering of expectations in America's \n     executive suites. The Conference Board, a business research \n     group, found in its most recent survey of chief executives \n     that 43 percent expected economic improvement in the next six \n     months, down from 66 percent at the beginning of the year.\n       The groups that represent businesses in Washington, \n     including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business \n     Roundtable, have been urging Congress to raise the debt \n     ceiling to avoid the risk of a default or downgrade of the \n     U.S. credit rating, even as many newly elected Republican \n     members of the House--who received support from business \n     interests when running--are reluctant to vote for such a \n     measure. A group of major business groups sent a letter to \n     the president and every member of Congress two weeks ago, \n     imploring them to raise the debt ceiling.\n       The tenor of the debates in Washington has damaged the \n     executives' sense, long taken for granted, that the taxes and \n     regulatory policies they face will be predictable and \n     reasonably constant. The executives are horrified that the \n     nation might be on the verge of losing its AAA credit rating, \n     and they have a deep hunger for a grand bargain: a master \n     plan to determine the nation's fiscal future over the coming \n     decade.\n       There is no telling what the tax code will look like next \n     year or who will ultimately bear the burden of reducing the \n     nation's budget deficits. That makes it an ominous time to \n     consider even buying a new piece of equipment or hiring \n     another worker, businesspeople said.\n       ``Clarity is everything, even if it's negative clarity,'' \n     said Rick Bastian, chief executive of Blackhawk Bank, which \n     has eight branches in northern Illinois and southern \n     Wisconsin. The mid-size manufacturers to whom the bank lends \n     money have made it through the worst of the recession, \n     Bastian said. But now they are resistant to upgrading \n     equipment or expanding production capacity because they don't \n     know what the tax burden will be on their revenue.\n       ``Let's say you make an investment that will return \n     $100,000,'' Bastian said. ``I don't know if I'll be paying \n     $10,000 more in taxes or $15,000 more. That could be the \n     difference between whether you can afford to service a loan \n     to pay for it or not. I'm not going to make a long-term \n     investment that requires me to commit cash flow for years if \n     I don't know what taxes are going to be.''\n       There has been plenty of political bickering in the \n     nation's history, and the current situation bears some \n     resemblance to the standoffs between President Bill Clinton \n     and the Republican Congress that shut down the government \n     twice in 1995 and 1996.\n       But executives describe a very different environment this \n     time around. The economy was in generally strong shape in the \n     mid-1990s, and business confidence--then high--was little \n     phased by the showdown in Washington. Now, with 9 percent \n     unemployment and an exceptionally weak two-year-old recovery, \n     confidence is far more fragile.\n       ``We're still coming out of a deep crisis and recession,'' \n     said Kevin Kelly, chief executive of Heidrick & Struggles, a \n     leading executive-search firm, who said his conversations \n     with executives in recent weeks have frequently featured \n     fretting over the debt-ceiling talks. ``There have been fits \n     and starts toward stronger growth, and now the outlook hinges \n     on what happens in Washington.''\n       At Quality Float Works, a Schaumburg, Ill., company that \n     makes metal float balls for industrial use, the debt impasse \n     has General Manager Jason Speer nervous that it could cause \n     interest rates to spike and make the line of credit the firm \n     uses to finance its inventory more expensive to manage.\n       As a result, even with business up 30 percent this year and \n     more long-term orders coming in, ``we're kind of holding back \n     on hiring and major purchases,'' Speer said. ``We're waiting \n     and seeing what effect all this will have on our credit and \n     on our ability to do business overseas.''\n       Many executives describe the uncertainty around taxes and \n     spending as only one in a series of confidence-sapping \n     challenges coming from Washington.\n       For example, BrightStar Care provides staffing services for \n     home health-care workers through 225 franchisees worldwide \n     with a combined 6,000 employees. Shelly Sun, the company's \n     founder and chief executive, said that as she works with \n     potential franchisees, many are held back by uncertainty over \n     whether they will have to pay for their workers' health-care \n     costs once last year's health-reform legislation is fully \n     enacted, and if so, what it will cost.\n       ``This is a very price-competitive business,'' Sun said. \n     ``Consumers are already having difficulty scraping together \n     funds to pay for services, and if the franchisees have to \n     bear an extra dollar, $1.25, or $1.50 per hour for health-\n     care costs, what could be a viable business may not be.''\n       And at Discover Financial Services, the large credit card \n     and transaction processing firm with 11,000 employees, \n     President Roger Hochschild has had to grapple with great \n     uncertainty about how the financial system will evolve under \n     changing regulations.\n       ``It's really challenging to enter the mortgage business \n     with no clear understanding of what Fannie Mae and Freddie \n     Mac will look like down the road,'' Hochschild said.\n       But for many executives, the uncertainty about how the \n     United States will lower its budget deficit over time and who \n     will pay for it looms most heavily over their decisions.\n       ``Among the other presidents and CEOs I interact with, the \n     only consensus of opinion is none of us has any idea where \n     things are going,'' said Scott Morey, chief executive of \n     Morey Corp., a 700-employee company in Woodridge, Ill., that \n     makes electronic equipment. ``And in my observation, the \n     uncertainty we are experiencing is caused almost entirely out \n     of Washington and other governments around the world.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. That article says:\n\n       Frustrated executives say political impasse slows hiring \n     and investing.\n       Business leaders are growing exasperated with Washington. \n     And they say the dysfunction in the political system is \n     holding them back from hiring and investing.\n\n  So where we are is, average American citizens are worried, Social \nSecurity recipients who are entitled are calling our offices, and the \nmarkets are already jittery. Most economists believe, if we allow this \ndeadline to pass, that we will see a cratering of the financial \nmarkets, which, obviously, has a significant impact on savings, on \npeople's holdings in the stock market, 401(k)s, et cetera. Meanwhile, \nhere we are with a situation, and over on the other side of the \nCapitol, our Republican friends are trying to come up with a proposal \nthat will receive the support of their majority. Over here, we have \nindividuals who believe somehow there is still a chance, at least in \nthis Congress, to pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n\n[[Page S4926]]\n\n  I will take a backseat to none in my support of the balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution. I have voted for it 13 times. I will \nvote for it tomorrow. What is amazing about this is, some Members are \nbelieving we can pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \nin this body with its present representation, and that is foolish. That \nis worse than foolish. That is deceiving many of our constituents by \ntelling them that just because the majority leader tabled the balanced \nbudget amendment legislation that, through amending and debate, we \ncould somehow convince the majority on the other side of the aisle to \ngo along with a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. That is \nnot fair. That is not fair to the American people to hold out and say \nwe will not agree to raising the debt limit until we pass a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution. It is unfair. It is bizarro. \nMaybe some people who have only been in this body for 6 or 7 months or \nso believe that. Others know better. Others know better.\n  I am confident, one, someday we will pass a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution. Two, I am confident the overwhelming majority of \nthe American people support it. Three, I am convinced that is the only \nway that at the end of the day, we will get spending under control \nbecause I have seen in the past Congress enacting very strong \nrestrictions on spending, such as the Gramm-Rudman legislation, which \nrequired spending cuts with increases in spending and all of them \nfailed because Congresses cannot bind future Congresses.\n  That is why I remain committed to a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. To somehow think or tell our citizens that if we have \nenough debate on amendments in the Senate, in the short term, in the \nnext 6 days, we will pass a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution is unfair to our constituents. It is unfair to our \nconstituents, frankly, to come up with a plan--the so-called Reid \nplan--that is full of smoke and mirrors, and, frankly, does not entail \nany increase--real spending cuts. It is unfair of the President of the \nUnited States to lead from behind. It is unfair of the President of the \nUnited States not to come forward with a specific plan that perhaps \ncould be considered by both bodies but only to go out and give lectures \nand act in as partisan a fashion as I have seen in his addresses to the \nAmerican people. It is no wonder the approval ratings of the American \npeople of the President and of Congress are literally at alltime lows.\n  I wish to talk for just a minute about an editorial in The Wall \nStreet Journal this morning. The Wall Street Journal is not known to \nbe--especially on its editorial page--a liberal periodical. It is \nentitled ``The GOP's Reality Test.'' It talks about:\n\n       The debt-limit debate is heading toward a culmination, with \n     President Obama reduced to pleading for the public to support \n     a tax increase and Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority \n     Leader Harry Reid releasing competing plans that are next-to-\n     last realistic options. The question is whether House \n     Republicans are going to help Mr. Boehner achieve significant \n     progress, or, in the name of the unachievable, hand Mr. Obama \n     a victory.\n       Mr. Obama recognizes these stakes, threatening yesterday to \n     veto the Boehner plan in a tactical move to block any \n     Democratic support.\n\n  It goes on and talks about the two-phase Boehner plan.\n\n       Congress would authorize $1 trillion in new debt in return \n     for $1.2 trillion.\n\n  It has since been scored by CBO, and now I believe that on the House \nside--they are struggling but I hope will succeed in coming up with a \nproposal that will authorize the cuts we have advertised.\n  But I go on to read:\n\n       Unless the plan passed, Mr. Obama couldn't request the \n     additional $1.6 trillion debt ceiling increase that he would \n     soon need. The political incentive is for a reasonable \n     package, and many Senate Democrats also don't want to vote \n     for tax increases before 2012.\n\n  It talks about the critics, about people putting out statements, \ntelling Republicans, telling the Speaker to come up with a better \nsolution.\n\n       The usually sensible Club for Growth and Heritage Action, \n     the political arm of the Heritage Foundation, are scoring a \n     vote for the Boehner plan as negative on similar grounds.\n       But what none of these critics have is an alternative \n     strategy for achieving anything nearly as fiscally or \n     politically beneficial as Mr. Boehner's plan. The idea seems \n     to be if the House GOP refuses to raise the debt ceiling, a \n     default crisis or gradual government shutdown will ensue, and \n     the public will turn en masse against Barack Obama. The \n     Republican House that failed to raise the debt ceiling would \n     somehow escape all the blame. Then Democrats would have no \n     choice but to pass a balanced budget amendment and reform \n     entitlements, and the tea party Hobbits could return to \n     Middle Earth having defeated Mordor.\n       This is the kind of crack political thinking that turned \n     Sharon Angle and Christine O'Donnell into GOP Senate \n     nominees. The reality is that the debt limit will be raised \n     one way or another, and the only issue now is with how much \n     fiscal reform and what political fallout.\n       If the Boehner plan fails in the House, the advantage \n     shifts to Mr. Reid's Senate plan, which would raise the debt \n     ceiling by $2.4 trillion in one swoop through 2012. That \n     would come without a tax increase but also $2.7 trillion in \n     mostly fake spending cuts like less government ``waste, \n     fraud, and abuse.''\n\n  How many times have we heard we are going to cut waste, fraud, and \nabuse?\n\n       And a $1 trillion savings from troop drawdowns in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan that are already built into the baseline. As \n     fiscal reform, this is worse than Mr. Boehner's plan.\n       The Speaker has made mistakes in his debt negotiations, not \n     least in trusting that Mr. Obama wants serious fiscal \n     reforms. But thanks to the President's overreaching on taxes, \n     Mr. Boehner now has the GOP positioned in sight of a \n     political and policy victory. If this plan or something close \n     to it becomes law, Democrats will have conceded more spending \n     cuts than they thought possible, and without getting the GOP \n     to raise taxes and without being able to blame Republicans \n     for a debt-limit crackup or economic damage.\n       If conservatives defeat the Boehner plan, they'll not only \n     undermine our House majority. They'll go far to re-electing \n     Mr. Obama and making the entitlement state that much harder \n     to reform.\n\n  Let me say, again, I believe the plan crafted by Senator McConnell \nthat would call for significant cuts in spending, which would not have \nraises in taxes, would, in the short term, be a most reasonable \nsolution. I hope that on both sides of the aisle we could work together \nand negotiate a way through that. I also think the much derided by some \nidea of a committee composed of Members of Congress--of Members of \nCongress only--from both sides of the aisle, from both sides of the \nCapitol, to sit down and work out a long-term solution to our fiscal \ncalamities we are facing and those results and those recommendations by \nthat committee be subject to an up-or-down vote only is the only way we \ncan go.\n  How many times have we had a budget resolution that tasks the various \ncommittees to come up with savings and always those savings are phony \nor they are dismantled on the floor of the Senate? The only way we are \ngoing to have the courage to make these cuts is with a committee \ncomposed of an equal number of Republicans and Democrats on both sides \nof the Capitol who come up with tough measures that need to be taken. I \nbelieve the American people will support it. If it is not an up-or-down \nvote, we know what happens around here. Let's be honest. Let's have \nsome straight talk. The special interests prevail, and they would \ndismantle the tough provisions this committee would come up with. I say \nto my friends on this side of the aisle, this is a balance, Republican \nand Democrat. We only control one-third of the government, and that is \nthe House of Representatives. It seems to me a balanced, equal \nrepresentation is to our advantage.\n\n  I just wish to say a word, again, about the Reid plan. First of all, \nI congratulate the majority leader for coming up with a plan because \ncertainly the President has not. Spectrum auctions is part of it. That \nis going to provide auction of billions of dollars. I have been in this \nbody for a considerable period of time. I can't tell you the number of \ntimes we have called for auction of spectrum. It is an annual basis. It \nis a copout that prevents us from making tough decisions. Most \negregiously, the majority leader's plan provides $1 billion to pay \ntelevision broadcasters who return unused television broadcast \nspectrum. The television broadcasters got the spectrum for free, and \nnow we are supposed to ask the taxpayers to give them $1 billion to \ngive back the spectrum they own?\n  Then, very interestingly, savings in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. \nThere\n\n[[Page S4927]]\n\nare $30 billion in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reforms. There is nowhere \nin this proposal that mentions that, but I would point out we have \nalready spent $150 billion on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that we have \nnever seen the end of. Then, of course, the large claim that there is \n$1 trillion in savings from winding down the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and, of course, that is phony. Everybody knows we are \nwinding down the war in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  So here we are 6 days away, and we still have members of Congress who \nare saying we have to pass the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. We have Members on the other side who are saying we have \nto raise taxes. We have a President of the United States who so far has \nrefused to come forward with a detailed plan of his own. That is called \nleading from behind. It is time we listened to the markets. It is time \nwe listened to our constituents. Most of all, it is time we listened to \nthe American people and sit down and seriously negotiate something \nbefore we face a situation where we are depriving the American people \nof the fundamental right of having a government that doesn't deprive \nthem of the essential services, goods, and entitlements which they have \nearned.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I wish to speak for 10 minutes or so. \nWhen I have 2 minutes remaining, if the Chair could tell me, I would \nappreciate it.\n  Madam President, I am here today with a sense of optimism. I know all \nof us are very concerned about what is happening in our country with \nthe debt ceiling. I know we are getting lots of calls from \nconstituents.\n  I think we have made remarkable progress over the last couple of \nweeks. If we think back to just a couple of weeks ago, people were \ncrafting legislation for sort of a political vote, if you will, and I \nunderstand that. But here we are today, and we actually have the leader \nof the U.S. Senate--a Democrat--who has proposed a bill that has to do \nwith spending. The Republican leader of the House has introduced a bill \nthat has to do with spending. Candidly, I am kind of uplifted. We are \nfinally on the right topic now. Candidly, to use a colloquial term from \nTennessee, we are beginning to cook with gas. What I mean by that is \npeople are actually now focused on the right issue.\n  We have all talked about this August 2 date. We have talked about the \nfact that our debt ceiling has to be raised by then. Certainly, there \nare a lot of ambiguities in the financial markets right now. A lot of \nthem have been watching the Treasury Department and think the Treasury \nDepartment has actually made some ways of causing that to last a little \nbit longer. But I think one thing we can all agree to in this body at \npresent is that we have until August 2. I think everybody would agree \nwith that. Some people think we have longer. I think the one thing \nalmost everyone would agree with in this body is that we have until \nAugust 2 to solve this problem, and I hope we will do so.\n  The other thing that I think is becoming part of sort of the mantra \nand the understanding throughout our country is that many of the \nfinancial markets, the people who actually buy our Treasurys, are now \nnot as concerned about the debt ceiling. They want it raised, don't get \nme wrong, and as I just mentioned, we all understand August 2 is the \ndate we have until to do that. But now they are more concerned about \nthe fact that we may raise the debt ceiling and not actually do what we \nneed to do to actually get our deficits in order.\n  First of all, we have the ratings agencies saying that if we don't \nget at least $4 trillion in savings in some form or fashion, then some \nof them are going to downgrade us. But our office over in the Banking \nCommittee--our folks are constantly talking with folks who buy \nTreasurys, and the actual purchasers of these Treasurys are now telling \nus in our office that if we don't do something that at least shows $4 \ntrillion in savings, then they believe we don't have the political will \nto cause our country to be as worthy of a borrower and that we are \ngoing to be paying more in the way of rates.\n  The other point I wish to make is that we have a proposal on the \nfloor. Personally--and I may catch some grief back home for saying \nthis--I think Senator Reid has actually tried to put something forward \nto help solve this problem. I believe that. I think he has been working \nclosely with Senator McConnell. I think Speaker Boehner also--I know he \nhas a different set of circumstances--is trying to solve this problem.\n  Here is the point: We are at a place where we are now actually \ntalking about the right topic, and we now know that if we don't put \nforth a solution that is at least $4 trillion or in that order of \nmagnitude, we are going to be downgraded.\n  It seems to me that people on the other side of the aisle--my \nDemocratic friends--would not want to support a proposal that extends \nthe debt ceiling that is less than $4 trillion because their President \nwould be presiding over a country that was downgraded while he was \nPresident.\n  It seems to me that the Republicans who have worked hard to press \nthis issue--and everybody has gone through tremendous acrimony, and \ncertainly people who are watching this are incredibly frustrated and \nangry--it seems to me that Republicans who are on the verge of \npotentially being able to craft something that actually solves this \nproblem would not want to support something that is less than $4 \ntrillion either.\n  In fact, I would make this statement which I think is true: Anybody \nwho votes for a package in this body to address the debt ceiling and \nour deficits simultaneously that isn't of the order of magnitude that \nis real and scorable--those are two different definitions, real and \nscorable--of $4 trillion is actually voting for a package that likely \nwill cause our country to be downgraded.\n  So here is what I think. Senator Reid, has offered a proposal, and I \nthink they scored it at $800 billion. I know it says $3 trillion; his \nscores at about $800 billion. Speaker Boehner has offered a package, \nand he, too, has some scoring issues with his package.\n  It seems to me that all of us in this body should be pressing the \nleaders on both sides of the aisle to at least present a package that \nis scorable and real in the area of $4 trillion, depending on what we \ndecide to do with that package. But if a Senator voted for a package \nthat was less than that, they would be casting a vote to raise the debt \nceiling and at the same time probably cast our country into a situation \nwhere we are downgraded, and that doesn't make any sense to me.\n  So we have 6 days left. I know people back home are nervous. I did a \ntele-townhall last night. We had thousands of people on the phone. \nPeople are angry that we have waited this long to actually get serious \nabout this issue. They are concerned about Social Security checks, \ndisability checks, veterans' checks. I understand that. I empathize \nwith them. But we haven't quite finished our work. We actually are on \nthe right topic, finally.\n  Again, Senator Reid has offered a proposal. The House has offered a \nproposal. Neither one of them is strong enough.\n  For what it is worth--I know the Presiding Officer knows this, but I \nam talking to people on both sides of the aisle--I think people are \nreading what the markets are doing and becoming increasingly concerned \nabout considering voting for a package. I know the Presiding Officer \ncomes from the center of the universe as it relates to those kinds of \nissues. People are rising up. There are a lot of private phone calls \ntaking place, and people are saying: Wait a minute, let's think about \nthis. The markets--which matter, by the way, because they are the ones \nthat buy our bonds--are now saying to us that they know we are going to \ndeal with the debt ceiling--and I think we are--they know we are going \nto deal with the debt ceiling by the time we have to--and I think we \nare--but now they are beginning to think we are not\n\n[[Page S4928]]\n\ngoing to do something that is actually the real solution.\n  So I am here today to talk to my friends on both sides of the aisle \nto say let's communicate with our leadership and say that we have 6 \ndays left. We have an opportunity to do something--we have all been \nsaying this--that really does rise to the seminal moment to actually \nsolve this problem. This is not a Republican issue. It is not a \nDemocratic issue. It is something that is going to affect everybody in \nour country. And we are finally, after all of this time, focused on the \nright subject matter. I mean we really are.\n  I just met with a group of Senators. I am going to meet with another \ngroup of Senators here in a little while. Let's make sure our \nleadership on both sides of this Capitol understands that we believe \nvoting for a package less than $4 trillion in savings over this next \ndecade that is not real and scorable really isn't getting the job done.\n  I know Senator Reid's approach has been to do it all at once, and \nmaybe there is a way to craft a package between now and next Tuesday \nthat people can vote on that has $4 trillion in real savings. I think \nthat might be difficult, but maybe something is happening behind closed \ndoors that we are not aware of. I know that on the other side of the \nbuilding, people are concerned about--well, actually, on the other side \nof the building they are looking at a short-term extension.\n  I know the President has been concerned, candidly, about a short-term \nextension. In fairness, I think the business community around our \ncountry would be concerned about a long short-term extension--in other \nwords, one that carries out months and months and we still don't have a \nsolution to this problem. I understand that creates the kind of \nuncertainty that many of the people on my side of the aisle and, \ncandidly, people on the other side of the aisle, to some degree, have \ntalked about as it relates to the business environment.\n  So, sure, I would love to vote for something that solves this problem \nand does it all on the front end. But I assume our leadership, knowing \nthe acrimony that is taking place--but, again, at least we are on the \nright subject matter, finally--the acrimony that is taking place, I \nassume they have some really short-term extension in their back pocket \nthat, to the extent we don't come to a conclusion by next Tuesday, they \nare ready to pull out and they know it is something that can actually \npass both bodies.\n  Again, I think we are so close now because we are finally focused on \nthe right thing. I think we are close to getting to something that \nsolves our country's problems for a while, causes people around the \nworld and the country to know we actually have the will and the courage \nto deal with these issues and at the same time addresses the debt \nceiling.\n  Should we not quite get there by this Tuesday--and I know there are a \nlot of complications, and we have bodies that are made up of two very \ndifferent groups of people--I would assume our leadership, who \nunderstand what is at stake here, have in their hands, in their back \npockets, a very short-term extension that could be used as a bridge for \nthe kind of solution that maybe takes us to a place that we can all \nagree helps solve our country's problems.\n  Again, I have heard people have been coming down to the floor back \nand forth and criticizing each side of the aisle. I am actually more \noptimistic today--I am not over the top, but I am more hopeful than I \nwas 2 weeks ago when we were not even focused on the right issues, at \nthat time focused on casting blame. Now what we have is both bodies \nlooking at packages to actually address the deficit we have before us.\n  I hope people on both sides of the aisle will talk to leadership, \nwill let them know they have no desire to support something that does \nnot solve the problem with all we have gone through as a country and as \na body over the course of the last couple of months. I am hopeful we \nwill figure out a solution that actually meets that test--in other \nwords, avoids the crisis on Tuesday and, at the same time, avoids the \ncrisis that will occur if people look at our country as a downgraded \nentity because we have not shown we are willing to at least deal with \n$4 trillion.\n  I think most people know I wish to do a lot more than that, and I \noffered a bill that was bipartisan that did a lot more than that. But I \nthink we all now know that baked into the expectations about where our \ncountry is today is the fact that it has to be a minimum of $4 \ntrillion. I think a lot of people have worked toward that goal. To even \nset up a process that is short of that does not make any sense to me. \nIt is kind of as though you have to be kidding me: We are going to go \nthrough the aggravation of the next 6 months working toward an \naspirational goal that we all know does not solve the credit rating \nissue?\n  Madam President, I thank you for the time. I hope we come to a \nsuccessful conclusion soon. I stand ready and am talking with people on \nboth sides of the aisle to try to come up with a solution so we either \nsolve this on the front end or put in place a process, a very quick \nprocess, that takes us to a place where we know we have actually dealt \nwith the problem.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the urgent need \nto raise the debt limit. I wish to take this opportunity to remind my \ncolleagues of our obligation to represent our constituents' best \ninterests and those of our great Nation, for at this late hour, with \nthe deadline for an agreement fast approaching, the consequences of \ninaction are clear. They have been made clear by economists, they have \nbeen made clear by credit rating agencies, they have been made clear by \nthe Federal Reserve and by our Treasury Secretary, and they have been \nmade clear by respected leaders of each side of the aisle. And soon, if \nwe do not act, they will be made clear by the market itself.\n  I keep hearing from some Members talking about the August 2 deadline \nas if it is no big deal. They say they have their own theories about \nwhen the real deadline is. That leaves me dumbfounded. I, for one, am \ngoing to take the Treasury Secretary and virtually every economist at \ntheir word. We need a solution before August 2 or we risk economic \ncatastrophe.\n  There are some Members who are essentially saying the Treasury can \nprioritize payments to avoid default, but getting Social Security \nchecks out should not be a problem. I heard a Republican Member of the \nHouse Budget Committee on Public Radio this past weekend say the money \nfor Social Security checks is in the trust fund.\n  Well, yes, we have $2.6 trillion in assets in the trust fund, but \nthey are all in Treasury securities, not cash. I find it stunning that \na Member of Congress, let alone a member of the Budget Committee, would \nnot understand the most basic functioning of our government. If there \nis no debt limit increase, Treasury may be able to juggle payments to \nget Social Security checks out on August 3, and I am sure they will do \neverything they can to do so, but August 3 would be just day one of \nTreasury's improvised prioritization strategy. August 3 is a date that \nabout half of the Social Security checks go out. But we have another \nround scheduled to out on August 10, and another on August 17, and \nanother on August 24. In fact, the Treasury sends out over 70 million \nchecks a month. August 3 is not the end of the problem, it is the \nbeginning.\n  About 1 month ago, the Bipartisan Policy Center briefed members of \nthe House Republican caucus on the actual implications of the August 2 \ndeadline, what we can pay and what we could not pay. Jay Powell, the \nformer Under Secretary of Treasury under President George H.W. Bush, \npresented at the briefing. He outlined his research on what is likely \nto happen on August 3. He suggested that in the month of August we \ncould pay our debt interest, Social Security checks, Medicare and \nMedicaid, vendors for Defense projects, and unemployment insurance \nbenefits. That is what we could pay, but no pay for active-duty \nmilitary, no benefits for veterans, no Federal loans for low-income \nstudents about to head off to college in the fall, no Pell grants, no\n\n[[Page S4929]]\n\nFederal Government employees, including counterterrorism agents in the \nFBI, for example, no border agents.\n  Before we default, we could have time to make this sign for all \npoints of entry. This is the tip of the iceberg. That is a symbol of \nthings we definitely could not afford to do.\n  That does not even address the global economic impacts of playing it \nso close to the edge. The dollar would be devalued, our credit rating \nwould be downgraded. It would cost us much more--much more--to borrow \nand to pay the interest on our debt, and thus our debt would actually \nincrease.\n  More importantly, all adjustable interest rates would rise, including \ncredit cards and mortgages and student loans. New loans, of course, \nwould be more expensive. These impacts could have a legacy that dogs us \nfor decades, if not centuries.\n  This is serious business and we should not be testing this deadline. \nYet that is exactly what some of my colleagues are doing. I worry that \nRepublicans in the House are blind to research, deaf to reason, and are \nsimply ignoring facts that are contrary to what they want to hear.\n  Throughout this debate, conservative House Republicans have stood in \nthe way of a deal. We have offered them some pretty sweet deals, and \nthey have walked away. They treated the August 2 deadline as advisory, \nas optional. They suggest that the Treasury can figure out something to \nprevent a default.\n  Now they are opposing Senator Reid's sensible deficit reduction plan \nbecause of how it calculates some of its savings. Specifically at issue \nis the Reid plan's $1 trillion in savings from winding down the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan, which Republicans are calling a budgetary \ngimmick, not real savings.\n  Yet the Ryan budget, which almost every House and Senate Republican \nvoted for, counted the same cuts almost identically. So to say it is \nreal savings in the Ryan plan but fake savings in the Reid proposal--I \nam sorry, but you cannot have it both ways.\n  Further, Senator Reid's plan is actually all cuts. I do not \nnecessarily like that. It contains dollar for dollar spending cuts to \nmatch the debt ceiling increase. And as much as I do not like this \naspect of it, it does not include any revenues, even though a \nWashington Post-ABC News poll says that 72 percent of the American \npublic believe we should have those making over $250,000 pay more--72 \npercent.\n  But a cuts-only plan is what Republicans have been saying they wanted \nall along. Now we have given it to them, we have it out there, it is \nthere, and all of the cuts in the Reid plan have been supported by \nRepublicans in the past. So we are presenting a plan that is all cuts, \nno revenue. The pretense they are using to reject it does not pass the \nsmell test. According to CBO, it saves $1.3 trillion more in savings \nthan the Boehner plan, such as it is. You know, I often hear \nRepublicans say corporations are sitting on trillions of dollars of \ncash instead of investing, expanding, and creating jobs, because \nbusinesses are facing so much uncertainty. Well, Senator Reid's plan \noffers certainty.\n  But suddenly Republicans want a short-term deal, one that would very \nwell put us in this same crisis again in 6 months. What kind of \ncertainty is that? No, a short-term deal will not offer our businesses \nand markets the certainty they need. A short-term deal may very well \ninduce a credit downgrade, according to Standard & Poor's. Yet \nRepublicans say they prefer a short-term deal over Senator Reid's plan, \nwhich would take us through the end of next year.\n  I do not get it. It sounds to me as though they care more about \npolitics and winning than they do about their constituents' well-being \nand the prosperity and economic security of the Nation. Their hard line \nand cavalier attitude is frankly dangerous--very dangerous.\n  Playing fast and loose with the facts is reckless. The American \npeople deserve better. We need to raise the debt ceiling now, and \nLeader Reid has shown us the way forward. I do not like all of the cuts \nin his package. I wish there were increases in revenue from those who \ncan afford it. But I know we have to pass it because it will keep us \nfrom defaulting, and it will do so responsibly and sensibly.\n  We owe it to the American people to pull back from the brink and pass \nthe Reid plan so we can avert disaster. We owe it to our constituents, \nand we owe it to our children.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/27/senate-section/article/S4929-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4929-S4930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FAA REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the FAA bill. On \nFriday, authorization for the Federal Aviation Administration was \nallowed to expire. Four thousand workers were placed on furlough. The \nairport and airways trust fund now lacks the authority to collect user \nfees that fund air traffic services, airport maintenance, and other \nthings that Americans rely on.\n  Let's be clear. This should not have happened. It happened because a \nfew Members of the other body made a conscious choice to negotiate in \nbad faith. Clear and simple.\n  Let me recap it. Under the able leadership of Senator Rockefeller, \nthe Senate again passed our long-term FAA authorization in February, \nwith a bipartisan vote of 87 to 8. Later, the House passed its bill, \nbut largely along party lines.\n  In April, the Senate named conferees to negotiate a final bill. \nHowever, our friends in the House have yet to appoint conferees to join \nus at the negotiating table.\n  Meanwhile, since 2007, we have passed 20 extensions to allow this \nprogram to continue operating while we work to negotiate a long-term \nsolution. Not a single one of those extensions has been met with \ncontroversy--not one.\n  However, as we undertook what should have been the latest clean \nextension, the House unexpectedly eliminated 13 rural airports that \nrely on Essential Air Service just days before the authorization \nexpired. The House refused to reconsider and chose instead to shut down \nthe Federal Aviation Administration.\n\n  The House seeks to save approximately one-tenth of 1 percent of \noverall aviation spending by attacking essential air services. I agree \nwith anyone who wants to control Federal spending and invest in real \npriorities--we all do--but it simply doesn't make sense to focus on \nsaving fractions of pennies on the dollar instead of coming to the \nnegotiating table to hammer out long-term solutions.\n  At the same time, the House rejected an opportunity to protect our \ntroops from exorbitant baggage fees. Congressman Nick Rahall introduced \nan amendment to the House extension that would have prohibited air \ncarriers from charging a baggage fee for members of the Armed Forces \nwhile traveling on official military duty, especially those checking \nfour or fewer bags. In one instance, an airline reportedly socked a \npoor servicemember with a baggage fee of $3,000. Regrettably, the House \nrejected this offer to protect our troops, and the rejection was on a \nparty-line vote. Those of us negotiating in good faith here in the \nSenate were left scratching our heads. The House would reject a clean \nextension to save a mere one-tenth of 1 percent by attacking rural jobs \nand commerce, but it would reject an opportunity to protect our troops \nfrom getting gouged by baggage fees on the same bill. It doesn't make \nsense.\n  Later, we learned through the press that the House's erratic strategy \nhad apparently nothing to do with potential cost savings at all, but, \ninstead, these antics were about rulemaking by the National Mediation \nBoard. This is a labor issue that has nothing to do with essential air \nservice and nothing to do with the daily operations of the Federal \nAviation Administration, both of which could be operating right now \nunder a clean extension. This labor issue should be worked out in a \nconference--the conference committee we can't have because the House \nhas yet to name conferees.\n  One of the rural communities the House Members chose to cut down as a\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\npolitical pawn is Glendive, MT. Glendive is growing in the energy \nsector. It is in the Bakken formation, with lots of oil and gas wells \ndrilled, and it is a huge potential new energy source. Energy companies \nfrom Texas and Louisiana are rapidly sending personnel up to Glendive, \nand hotels in the area are running at near-full occupancy year-round. \nWe are working hard to quickly build housing and infrastructure in \norder to capitalize on this great opportunity to create much needed \njobs. Today, unemployment in Glendive is half the national average. But \nGlendive is located 230 miles from any larger airport. Glendive needs \nessential air service to maintain its lifeline to national commerce and \ncontinue to grow and create jobs.\n  We can discuss at length the merits of essential air service, the \npromise made to rural America, and the lifeline it provides to towns \nsuch as Glendive. In fact, this is a conversation we should have. Any \nchanges should be made as part of thoughtful and transparent \ndiscussion, with input from the folks on the ground who are most \naffected. Again, that is precisely what conference negotiations are \nfor--yet, again, negotiations we can't hold. Why? Because the House has \nyet to name its conferees.\n  The House antics have halted as much as $2.5 billion in airport \nfunding--funding that employs as many as 87,000 workers on construction \nprojects around the country. At Glacier International Airport in \nKalispell, MT, much needed upgrades to the taxiway are now on hold \nindefinitely, and so are the much needed construction jobs this project \nwould support.\n  Even more troubling, 4,000 mothers and fathers and breadwinners are \nnow out of work. These are folks such as Kristina Richardson, an \nadministrative support specialist at Billings Logan International \nAirport's air traffic control tower. Over the weekend, Kristina wasn't \nable to go grocery shopping. She didn't know if she could count on her \nnext paycheck to buy food and pay her bills. Kristina described the pit \nin her stomach when she went in to clean off her desk and shut down her \ncomputer. Kristina told my office she worried about who would help the \npeople she had been working with. She described the pride and \nfulfillment that comes from working and the blow that comes when that \nis taken away.\n  Luckily, Kristina was told on Tuesday she would be able to return to \nwork. But 4,000 other folks across the country haven't been so lucky. \nLike most Montanans, Kristina is one tough lady, and she understands \nthe vital importance of essential air service to rural communities. \nEven when she thought she had been furloughed, she hung in there. She \ncontacted my office to voice her support for a clean FAA extension that \nrejects arbitrary cuts to rural communities.\n  I am increasingly concerned about the nature of our political \ndiscourse. Lately, it seems some folks are more focused on making 30-\nsecond sound bites than making laws. What happened with the FAA bill is \nan example of this misguided focus. Whatever the House's true reason \nfor suspending 4,000-plus jobs and halting construction to improve \nairport safety, it just wasn't right.\n  Still, I know we can do good things around here when we work \ntogether, and I hold out the hope that we will return our focus to what \nis important and start getting work done, and it is not just here but \non debt extension and a lot of major matters around here. But in the \nmeantime, we need to fix this mess. This is easier to fix--much easier.\n  Along with Senator Rockefeller, I introduced a clean FAA extension \nthat would put 4,000 employees back to work, let us start construction \nprojects around the country to create jobs and improve the safety of \nour airports, and continue to fund the trust fund. Then together we can \ncontinue working on a longer term solution. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport a clean extension.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have three separate issues facing the \nCongress. First, the authority of the Treasury Department to borrow to \nmeet the Nation's obligations will be reached on Tuesday. In order for \nborrowing to continue after Tuesday, Congress needs to raise the debt \nceiling. That is the first of the three issues.\n  The second issue we face is the need to help our economy to become \nprosperous again. Unfortunately, the debate in Congress has totally \nlost sight of this issue, the issue of how we can grow the economy and \nhow we can create jobs.\n  The third of the three issues is the need to put in place a long-term \nplan to reduce the deficit and the debt. The issue of raising the debt \nceiling and reducing the long-term deficit and debt have, \nunfortunately, come to be seen by many in Congress as a single issue. \nSo I want to urge all colleagues to take a step back and to recognize, \nfirst, that these issues are separate and, second, that failure to \nresponsibly deal with the first of these issues; that is, failure to \nraise the debt limit, will greatly hamper our ability to deal with the \nother two issues that I mentioned.\n  The failure to raise the debt limit will not return our economy to \nprosperity; instead, it will postpone the day when that prosperity \nreturns. Failure to raise the debt limit will not help reduce our debt \nand deficit. It will add to the debt and deficit by raising interest \nrates for the government and for all Americans.\n  So let's review how we got here.\n  Since the beginning of this Congress nearly 7 months ago, the \nRepublican majority in the House has had a laser focus on one issue; \nthat is, cutting spending. To achieve that objective, the first \nstrategy adopted by the Republican leadership in the House was to \nthreaten a shutdown of the government unless sufficient spending cuts \nwere agreed to. Spending cuts were agreed to, and at the final hour \nRepublicans agreed to pass the bill that was needed to fund the \ngovernment for the balance of the fiscal year. By that I mean through \nSeptember 30 of this year.\n  So as soon as that crisis was averted and the threat to close down \nthe government was behind us, at least for a few months, the effort \nshifted to a new strategy. This strategy was to threaten a first-in-\nhistory default by the government on its financial obligations if \nenough additional spending cuts were not agreed to; that is, spending \ncuts in addition to what were agreed to, in order to avert a shutdown \nof the government. The device for bringing about that default was \nrefusal to extend the debt ceiling when the government's borrowing \nauthority was scheduled to be reached August 2, next Tuesday.\n  We should remind ourselves of what an artificial device is being used \nfor leverage in this negotiation. Congress passes the laws that \ndetermine how much revenue the Federal Government collects, and \nCongress passes the laws that determine how much we obligate the \ngovernment to spend. When the revenue we collect is less than the \namount we are committed to spend, the Secretary of the Treasury has no \nalternative but to borrow money to meet the obligations that Congress \nhas taken on.\n  So in a period like today, when the government is receiving in \nrevenues much less than is required to meet its obligations, there are \ntwo logical actions for Congress to take. First, it can raise more \nrevenue; second, it can reduce the obligations of the government. But \nin refusing to allow the Secretary of the Treasury to borrow, we are \ntaking neither of these logical steps. Instead, we are telling the \nSecretary of the Treasury to default on the obligations which this and \nprevious Congresses have already taken on on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  We are told by the Secretary of the Treasury that unless Congress \nacts he will be forced to default or renege on our obligations \nbeginning next week, August 2. The refusal to raise the debt ceiling \nand the threatening of default on our obligations has achieved much of \nwhat Republicans set out to achieve in this Congress. It has \nprecipitated a crisis and in order to avoid that crisis,\n\n[[Page S4931]]\n\nDemocrats have agreed to or acceded to the primary demands the \nRepublican majority in the House have made.\n  What are those demands? There are two primary demands. The first of \nthose demands was that all of the deficit reduction be accomplished \nwith cuts in spending. No revenue could be raised from the wealthiest \nin our society to help close this gap between revenues and spending; no \nloopholes could be closed; no subsidies could be eliminated from the \nTax Code.\n  Democrats have agreed that the deficit reduction would not be \naccomplished with a balanced package of spending cuts and revenue \nincreases as the previous deficit reduction packages have been under \nPresident Reagan, under President George H.W. Bush, and of course under \nPresident Clinton. This deficit reduction that we are now considering \nwould be done with spending cuts only. So that was the first demand and \nit was one that Democrats have acceded to.\n  The second demand of the Republican leadership was the totally \narbitrary demand that the size of the increase in the debt ceiling not \nexceed the amount of spending cuts projected in the Federal budget over \nthe next 10 years. This is a demand totally lacking in any logical \njustification, but, again, Democrats have agreed in order to achieve a \nsolution to the immediate impasse.\n  In order to avoid the threatened default on our obligations, Senator \nReid has put forward a proposal that would lock in, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, about $2.2 trillion of deficit reduction \nover 10 years with cuts in both discretionary spending and mandatory \nspending. The Treasury Secretary would be given authority to borrow to \nmeet the obligations that Congress has undertaken for approximately \nanother 18 months. The proposal also puts in place a bipartisan and a \nbicameral committee with responsibility to present Congress with \nlegislation to further reduce the deficit.\n  Unfortunately, it appears this proposal that Senator Reid has made \nwill be opposed by many on the Republican side. Some say the cuts are \nnot sufficiently deep and that they would rather push the country into \ndefault rather than agree to a mere $2.2 trillion in spending cuts.\n  Some others say they want to extend the debt ceiling for a shorter \nperiod so we can have another showdown with another threatened \ngovernment default 6 or 7 months from now. Some say that causing the \nFederal Government to default will not have the adverse consequences \nthe Secretary of the Treasury has predicted and that in fact it will \nhave a salutary effect on both our economy and our politics.\n  I strongly disagree with all of these views. I believe a refusal to \nhonor our obligations will have a major adverse consequence for our \neconomy. I believe Congress should act now to raise the debt limit in \norder to avoid these adverse consequences and that, although the \nproposal Senator Reid has brought forward fails the test of balance \nbetween spending cuts and revenue increases which I would prefer, it is \na plan I am willing to support in order to head off a default on our \nNation's obligations. I understand additional deficit reduction will be \nrequired in the months and years ahead, but clearly the responsible \ncourse is to do what can be done today and that is adopt the Reid plan. \nOnly by doing so can we once again focus on the steps we can take to \nreturn our economy to prosperity. That is the first priority for most \nAmericans today. It should be our first priority as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, this week we have a unique \nopportunity to reduce the deficit to the tune of $2.2 trillion. That is \n$2.2 trillion to protect Medicare, to protect Social Security, to \nprotect Medicaid, and to make sure the United States of America doesn't \ndo something we have never done; that is, go into default.\n  We can debate how we got here. We can debate why we have this huge \nbudget deficit. We can debate whether it is Barack Obama's fault or \nGeorge Bush's fault. We can debate whether it was the Recovery Act or \nwhether it was the two wars President Bush didn't pay for. We can \ndebate whether it is the health care bill of President Obama or the \ngiveaway to the drug and insurance companies that President Bush did in \nthe name of Medicare privatization. We could talk about President \nBush's tax cuts. We could do any of that, but the urgency of this \nsituation is not a question for debate. Never before has the full faith \nand credit of the United States of America been held hostage to a major \nbudget agreement.\n  In the past three decades before President Obama--so let's take him \nout of this picture for a minute--we have avoided default by raising \nthe debt limit 38 times in the last 30 years before President Obama. \nOut of those 38 times, 34 of those times--almost 90 percent--were under \nRepublican Presidents. Again, 34 of 38 times were under Republican \nPresidents. We didn't do a hostage-taking. We didn't try to scare \npeople. Even if we didn't like doing it, we simply raised the debt \nceiling.\n  As I and many Democratic colleagues have said, we can balance the \nbudget as we did under President Clinton. I came to office in 1992 in \nthe House. I voted for a controversial budget. No Republicans joined \nus. We had almost 8 years of economic growth, with 21 million net \nprivate sector jobs created, and we got to a balanced budget. We know \nhow to do that. We do it with a balance between spending cuts and \nrevenues, especially closing tax loopholes, giveaways to the oil \ncompanies, tax breaks for companies that outsource jobs, and tax breaks \nfor hedge fund operators on Wall Street. We can close those tax \nloopholes. We can do spending cuts, and we can do what we need to do to \nmove toward a balanced budget.\n  During those 38 times, there were freestanding votes. Each time it \nwas raised, there was a freestanding vote. Neither party played these \ngames. Neither party held our Nation hostage to these political games.\n  Rather than a freestanding vote on the debt limit, we are in a last-\nminute scramble. Democrats have said: OK, we will reach an agreement. \nNever has one party insisted that the amount of the increase in the \ndebt limit be offset by an equal amount of spending cuts. We have even \nagreed to that approach. Never before has one party insisted that a \nmajor budget agreement exclude provisions that address revenue. We have \neven said yes to that. Now having had their demands met, the people in \nthe party who insisted on all these conditions are saying no. They are \nsaying no again.\n  The debate on the debt and the deficit has been complicated, it has \nbeen contentious, it has been angry, but a default should be \nunimaginable. A default should be unimaginable. A default would risk \nwhat would amount to a permanent tax hike.\n  I hear many of the radicals in the House of Representatives who say \nthey will never vote for a debt increase, as if it is something we \nshould never, ever do in a country. They all talk about tax cuts, but a \ndefault on the part of the United States of America would amount to a \npermanent tax hike on all Americans. Interest rates would rise for \nanyone owning a home, paying a home mortgage, applying for a home \nmortgage, anyone with a car loan, anyone with a college loan. Credit \ncosts for all borrowers would climb for governments at every level, \nbusinesses, nonprofits, small businesses, large businesses, credit card \nholders. There would be repercussions for pension funds and money \nmarket funds that guard the retirement savings of middle-class \nfamilies.\n  Basically, everybody in the Presiding Officer's home State of \nMinnesota, in my home State of Ohio--everybody would be afflicted with \nthis tax increase, if you will, from higher interest rates. Several \nStates have already been placed on a credit watch. Every State would be \nhurt by a Federal default, which is why Governors of both parties are \nsaying: Make a deal; get to this. This is not alarmist thinking.\n  There is a reason Ronald Reagan went to Congress 18 times to raise \nthe debt ceiling. Here is what President Reagan said:\n\n       The full consequences of a default--or even the serious \n     prospect of a default--\n\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\n\n  That is where we are right now, in a serious prospect of default--\n\n     by the United States are impossible to predict and awesome to \n     contemplate. Denigration of the full faith and credit of the \n     United States would have substantial effects on the domestic \n     financial markets and the value of the dollar.\n\n  None of us is being alarmist because we really don't know, but we \nknow people whom most Americans respect--President Reagan, President \nClinton, others who have asked for a debt ceiling increase, economists, \nbusinesspeople--nobody knows for sure what would happen, but nobody has \never wanted to take that risk. We have always paid our bills. Default \ncould affect Ohioans receiving Medicare and Social Security. It could \naffect veterans in hospitals and universities. President Obama has said \nhe can't guarantee payments to senior citizens, to bondholders, or \nother obligations of the United States of America. You cannot fake \ncashflow. These are real consequences.\n  When it comes to jobs, to seniors living on fixed income, in the \nmidst of an economic growth that is as fragile as ours is, lawmakers \nought to suspend their politics. Today, the harm of inaction would be \nimmense.\n  President Obama put several proposals forward to reduce the deficit \nin a big way, modeled after these bipartisan commissions where there \nhas been pretty good bipartisan agreement. But efforts to forge a grand \ncompromise bringing the deficit down by $4 trillion have been abandoned \nby Republican leaders over and over.\n  I have not supported every detail on these grand compromise efforts. \nI don't want to do anything to undermine Medicare or Social Security or \nMedicaid, programs that have worked for generations now and programs \nthat millions of Ohioans depend on, from Middletown to Ashtabula, from \nToledo to Athens and Gallipolis. I wanted a more balanced approach. I \nknow the Presiding Officer did too. But as days and weeks and months go \nby, we are now only days away from default. We are simply running out \nof time. That is what the Senate bill is about--protecting us from \ndefault.\n  In the spirit of continued compromise, again, the majority leader has \ncome forth with a plan to reduce the deficit by $2.2 trillion. It is \ntruly a compromise because it meets the Republicans' main criteria. It \ncontains spending cuts to roughly match the debt ceiling increase \nthrough 2012. The spending cuts in the Reid plan are ones to which \nRepublicans have previously agreed. It contains no revenue increases. \nAll three of those have been what Republicans asked for. But now it is \nnot good enough. What do they want to do when we basically met their \ndemands?\n  Beyond all that, this compromise we have offered--mostly what they \nhave asked for--contains an important priority of mine--not one of the \nRepublicans, to be sure--and that is that we protect Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid.\n  I know that major Republican budgets--the so-called Ryan budget, the \nRepublican House budget--undercut our major important programs, \nMedicare and Medicaid especially. We know the so-called cut, cap, and \nbalance proposal the Republicans have passed that is being voted on \nhere didn't protect Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. So we know \nRepublicans want to go after those programs. Under this compromise, we \nhave been able to protect that, but we need to make sure we put country \nahead of party, national interest above partisanship. That is why we \nhave been willing to compromise.\n  Speaker Boehner's plan is being revised, but so far it provides \nsignificantly less than the savings in the Reid proposal. By design, \nthe Boehner plan would put us back in this situation in a few months. \nWhat rational economist, what responsible elected official, what \nbusinessperson in St. Paul or Columbus, in Rochester or Mansfield--what \nbusinessperson would say: Let's put the U.S. in this situation again in \n6 months?\n  We know what has happened in this country in the last month or so. As \nwe approach default, as businesses particularly watch the way this is \nbeing debated and how this is being handled, people are way less \ncertain, people are way more concerned about our ability to raise the \ndebt ceiling and keep us out of default. Businesses are holding on to \ntheir cash reserves because they are not willing to invest now because \nthey don't want this to happen.\n  So why would we want to go through this again in 6 months? Why would \nwe possibly think this is good for the United States--for people in \nChillicothe and Dayton, in Youngstown and Akron, in Canton and Kenton, \nWauseon and Bowling Green? Why would we want businesses in our country \nto go through this again in 6 months?\n  We need to get this done quickly. We have to raise the debt ceiling \nto keep us out of default. We need to make sure we focus on deficit \nreduction, and we need to put our efforts into job creation. People all \nover my State--when I am in Dayton, Springfield, Cuyahoga County or \nMahoney County, as I was this past weekend--people are mostly saying \nthey want us to focus on job growth. We need to do budget cuts and \nraise the debt ceiling to keep us out of default. We mostly need to \nmake sure we move forward on job creation.\n  We prevent a default and reduce the deficit with the Reid plan--a \ncritical imperative for our children and our grandchildren. It protects \nMedicare and Social Security and Medicaid.\n  My office is being swamped with calls and e-mails from Ohioans who \nsimply can't believe we are this close to default. Within the week, \nCongress must pass and the President must sign an increase in the debt \nceiling. It is essential if we want to prevent an absolutely \nunnecessary, an absolutely uncalled for, yet catastrophic default. It \nis necessary to move on to address the issue of jobs. Too many recent \ncollege graduates, too many people who have been in the workforce for \ntoo many years, too many people who are unemployed are looking for \njobs. That is where our focus should be.\n  We need to pass the Reid plan, work on deficit reduction, and work on \njob growth.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as I \nthink many of my colleagues have, to speak to the topic at hand, which \nis the debt ceiling debate we are having in the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  I have to say, I think Americans across the country are looking at us \nwith disbelief, anxiety, and--I think rightly--anger. They awoke this \nmorning hoping to find that cooler heads had prevailed and that all of \nus were working together on a plan that keeps our country from default \nand our economy from looming collapse. Instead, the headlines read that \nthe Speaker of the House was again refusing to negotiate and that he \nis, in fact, delaying action in the House because of Republican \nupheaval against his own plan.\n  I have to say, even if the House of Representatives passed a bill \npreventing default this evening, within hours, we would still be \npushing our country right up to the edge of an economic catastrophe. In \nother words, what I am saying is, even though economists, market \nanalysts, business leaders, credit rating agencies, world leaders, and \nthe American people are begging us to find an agreement to avoid \ndefault on our debt obligations, we are no further along today than we \nhave been in the many weeks we have been debating this issue.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, as a former Member of the House, I \ntake no pleasure in criticizing the people's House. But it does take \ntwo to tango, and when it comes to courting the House of \nRepresentatives, it feels as though they have one shoe nailed to the \ndance floor. I can't figure out for the life of me what it is going to \ntake to reach an agreement on behalf of the American people. The House \nof Representatives just can't take yes for an answer.\n  The real problem, at least in my estimation, seems to be that a small \ngroup of people are set on running up the political score rather than \ndoing the\n\n[[Page S4933]]\n\nright thing for our country. If that is the case, now is the time to \nfinally come to the table.\n  Here is the truth: Many of us here are trying to prevent our economy \nfrom driving off a cliff, but others seem to be busy cutting the brake \nlines. On that point, I was proud of the Senate and the Democrats and \nRepublicans who came together on the bipartisan Bowles-Simpson \nCommission and came up with a plan on reducing the deficit. They were \nwilling to be a part of the solution.\n  The Bowles-Simpson Commission recommended taking important but \ndifficult steps to reduce our debt by $4 trillion over the next decade. \nThat plan is the right one for the country, and despite the significant \npolitical risks attached to taking those positions, Senators in both \nparties were willing to support it. The House Members, on the other \nhand, when the fiscal commission offered them the bipartisan deficit \nreduction plan, walked away, both Democrats and Republicans, to be \nfair.\n\n  Unfortunately, this has become a pattern. When Vice President Joe \nBiden and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor were close to finally \nreaching an agreement on a deficit reduction plan, it was the House \nRepublicans who walked away. When President Obama and Speaker Boehner \nsought to strike a ``grand bargain,'' to do something great for the \ncountry, the House walked away. President Obama likened this to being \nleft at the altar, but I cannot think of any description that is more \napt than ``irresponsible.''\n  For my friends and my colleagues who know me, I am not quick to \nanger. But I have to say, time is not our friend here and we cannot \ndelay action any longer. I was pleased to see Senator Alexander, the \nthird ranking Republican in the Senate, say last night:\n\n       What would be best, instead of having a Republican plan \n     competing with a Democratic plan, would be to have the \n     Speaker, Senator Reid, and Senator McConnell recommend to us \n     a single plan.\n\n  I understand the Senate leaders are speaking frequently, and I have \nall the faith in the world that the Senate could work this problem out. \nBut that is only half the problem. We need statesmen, we need patriots, \nwe need problem solvers over in the House to emerge. Campaign politics \nand partisan talking points do not take courage. Now is the time for \ncourage and leadership.\n  Instead of going back to the drawing board on the Boehner plan, we \nneed to refocus our efforts on a plan that meets three tests. Such a \nplan has to, No. 1, raise the debt limit to avoid a first ever Federal \nGovernment default; No. 2, provide enough certainty to investors that \nAmerica will pay its bills to stave off a downgrade in our credit \nrating; and, No. 3, reduce the deficit enough that we can begin the \nhard work to get our fiscal house in order.\n  The Reid plan, in my estimation, achieves each of those goals. While \nI am disappointed we could not all come together on a larger $4 to $5 \ntrillion deficit reduction package that would be both bipartisan and \ncomprehensive, the Reid plan adequately addresses the most pressing \nissues that confront us, which are preventing a default and staving off \na downgrade in our credit rating.\n  The Boehner plan, on the other hand, is only a short-term fix, and a \nhost of economic forecasters and business leaders have said it would \nalmost certainly lead to a downgrade in our, in America's, credit \nrating, which would raise interest rates, could sabotage seniors' \nretirement savings, and increase consumer costs on almost every \nAmerican.\n  Bank of America, Standard & Poor's, JPMorgan Chase, and other major \nplayers have all warned us that future economic instability and short-\nterm political solutions will almost certainly lead to a downgrade in \nour credit rating. That is some serious business.\n  What is sad about all of this is that the unstable political \nclimate--which one observer called ``amateur hour on Capitol Hill''--\nitself may lead to a downgrade.\n  I respect the Speaker's desire to go back to the drawing board to try \nto secure more Republican votes, but the fact is we do not have time. \nThe Reid plan is ready to go, and it meets the three-part test I laid \nout. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office stated that the Reid plan \nreduces the deficit by twice as much as the House Republican plan. As \nreported this morning ``in the battle of budget scores, the Senate \nDemocrats deficit reduction bill is the clear winner thus far.''\n  Our economy has been in critical condition, and I think we are \nfeeling recently that it is beginning to come back to life, that we \nhave been nursing it back to health. The last result we need is a self-\ninflicted heart attack caused by an overdose of partisanship. People \nwonder why we cannot get it done.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is a mountain climber, as am I, and we \nare both, I guess, old mountain climbers in more ways than one. I can \ntell you that there are some similarities between attempting to climb \nthe world's highest peaks and our work here in Washington. But the \ndifference seems to be, especially when the going gets tough here on \nCapitol Hill, that not only are you trying to conquer mountainous and \nchallenging and difficult terrain, you seem to have a team of saboteurs \nhere who are trying to push the rest of us off the mountain as we are \ntrying to climb it. The Scots have a saying: It is not the falling off \nthat hurts. It is the sudden stop at the bottom. I can tell you, if we \ndo not raise the debt ceiling, that is going to involve a sudden stop \nat the bottom for all of us.\n  The people of Colorado have told me--and I suspect the rest of the \nNation feels this way--they do not care who wins politically. Frankly, \nI do not care who wins politically either. What I care about is passing \nlegislation that will stave off government default and a downgrade in \nour Nation's credit rating. At this point, the Reid plan is the only \noption that meets that criteria. Let's get it done. Let's get it done.\n\n\n                       Tribute To Hillary Daniels\n\n  Mr. President, as I close, I want to change the tone of my remarks a \nlittle bit because there are wonderful people who work here on Capitol \nHill and make a difference day in and day out, and I want to recognize \nHillary Daniels, who has been one of my budget and appropriations \nlegislative assistants, who joined my team when I first came to the \nSenate 3 years ago.\n  She is a native of Colorado's western slope, the great county of Mesa \nand the town of Grand Junction. She is going to be leaving my office \nnext month to go to law school at Washington University in St. Louis, \nMO.\n  She has been an invaluable team member, and I can speak for my entire \nstaff when I say we are both excited for her to take this next step in \ndeveloping her career and I am very grateful for the guidance she has \ngiven me over the last few years.\n  It is for the Hillary Daniels of the world, who will be leaders of \nour country in the next decade and the decade after that, that I think \nwe owe an obligation to getting this job done as soon as we possibly \ncan, assuring the markets that the full faith and credit of the United \nStates will be preserved and protected and nurtured.\n  Let's turn back to job one here, which is to focus on our economy and \njob creation. The longer we are stalled out in a political crisis of \nour own making, the less we are concerned and focused on putting the \nAmerican people back to work.\n  Mr. President, thank you for your interest, thank you for your \nattention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just filed an amendment to S. 1323 to BRAC \nthe spectrum. This would give us the maximum auction revenue and access \nto spectrum for economic development and deficit reduction. I am proud \nto have the amendment endorsed by Americans for Tax Reform.\n  It is very important for the Congress to authorize spectrum incentive \nauctions. While we should protect broadcasters who choose not to \nparticipate in such actions and their customers who rely on over-the-\nair broadcast for entertainment and public emergency information, \nincentive auctions would free up much needed spectrum for the civilian \nside in making sure that broadband communications are fully available \nin the United States.\n  It should be, in short, the policy of the United States to offer the \nwidest\n\n[[Page S4934]]\n\namount of broadband spectrum to empower the 21st century economy here--\ncell phones were invented in the United States, in fact, mostly in my \nhome State of Illinois--and making sure this is the country where not \njust 1G and 2G and 3G were invented and deployed, but to make sure 5G \nand 6G and 7G are also deployed first in the United States and not in a \ncountry such as China or India.\n  According to the Federal Communications Commission, the U.S. Treasury \nhas already collected $50 billion in spectrum receipts since 1993. \nSenator Reid's plan does authorize such auctions, but it is missing a \nkey element to ensure they are very successful. Unfortunately, like \nmany other agencies in the administration, the Federal Communications \nCommission has worked to promulgate regulations that stifle innovation \nand economic growth. It is important for Congress to prohibit the FCC \nfrom establishing new, similar rules or conditions that are outside the \nscope of technical, ethical, or geographic qualifications. Such \nconditions, for example, the ``net neutrality'' provisions, will only \nserve to depress the market value of the spectrum; therefore, \ndecreasing government revenues and lowering our ability to reduce the \ndeficit in this way.\n\n  One recent study found that ``Congress has tremendous discretion \nabout the amount of proceeds it could raise in exchange for spectrum'' \nbecause ``the amount of money that an auction can raise for the [U.S.] \nTreasury [and the government] is impacted at least in part by \ncontrollable decisions about how the auction configures the spectrum \nfor sale and the conditions imposed on it.'' The study analyzed a \nprevious spectrum auction to estimate the potential receipts from \nfuture actions based on conditions the FCC may or may not impose. The \nresearchers found that the full auction potential of the broadcast \nspectrum with no conditions imposed would raise as much as $91 billion, \nwhereas the same auction with heavy and unappealing conditions, such as \nnet neutrality, would only raise $26 billion. That is a difference of \n$65 billion. We could raise, to lower our deficit, 250 percent more in \nfunds with an incentive auction if we ensure that the FCC does not \nimpose market-killing restrictions.\n  My proposal would place limits on the FCC, in addition to \nestablishing a number of other prohibitions to make sure the FCC does \nnot artificially reduce the spectrum value, to lower our deficit. The \nKirk amendment would prohibit the FCC from restricting participants in \nany auction and from prescribing certain rates, terms, or services that \nmay be offered by bidders in order to encourage the most robust \nparticipation and license bidding. To avoid future devaluation of \nspectrum licenses, the amendment would also prohibit the FCC from \nchanging the rules of the game after an auction was completed.\n  But simply selling spectrum voluntarily given up by broadcasters is \nnot enough to solve our credit crunch. We know that wireless \nsubscribership in the United States has increased more than 400 percent \nin the last 15 years, and experts expect mobile data traffic to be 35 \ntimes higher in 2014 than it was back in 2009. Yet only 22 percent of \nall viable wireless frequencies are licensed for mobile broadband. \nIndustry experts anticipate spectrum will be exhausted in the most \npopulous markets by 2014. Such a restriction then would stunt wireless \nand other technological development in the United States because we \nwill not have enough bandwidth to continue innovating. Internet service \nwill then slow and calls will be dropped. We should not let this \nscenario unfold. We should reach our full technological potential \nbecause broadband development is a key job creator for the 21st \ncentury.\n  According to one estimate, the information and communications \nindustry contributed more than $1.7 trillion to the U.S. gross domestic \nproduct in 2009 or over 12 percent of our total national income. \nAnother study found that broadband provides additional annual consumer \nbenefits of roughly $32 billion per year. It is widely acknowledged \nthat wireless broadband also generates productivity gains of \napproximately $28 billion annually, and one cost estimate even puts \nproductivity gains from the development and use of wireless broadband \nat almost $860 billion in 2016. In my own State of Illinois, this study \nestimates that the savings from increased productivity will reach about \n$5.8 billion in 5 years. This demonstrates that every sector of our \neconomy benefits from wireless development.\n  For example, broadband development will vastly improve health care \nservices for seniors. One study finds that reduced medical costs, \nreduced costs of institutionalized living, and increased output \ngenerated by seniors and disabled individuals will save about $927 \nbillion between 2005 and 2030. Advancements in wireless technologies \naim to reduce the burden on the chronically ill by providing remote \nmonitoring of medical functions and to save lives through public safety \ninteroperable networks.\n  Yet very little of this will be achievable unless we make more \nspectrum available to the civilian sector. Not surprisingly, the \nFederal Government itself is the largest and most stubborn squatter on \nthe spectrum. According to the Technology Policy Institute, the \ngovernment currently has exclusive or shared ownership of more than \nhalf the ideal spectrum for wireless development.\n  Much of the spectrum is not even being used or used efficiently by \nthe government. Unfortunately, it is largely unknown how exactly \nFederal agencies and departments are using the spectrum and which \nspectrum we could better use on the civilian side.\n  My amendment, in short, would establish a process identical to the \nsuccessful Base Realignment and Closure Commission to determine which \nFederal spectrum should be offered for sale or shared use by the \nprivate sector. While the government has much of this authority, it \nconsistently fails to utilize it.\n  A BRAC-like commission for the spectrum is a key model for its \nreallocation and would help accelerate the development of broadband in \nthe United States, without the standard congressional roadblocks that \nwould inhibit development.\n  The amendment also provides assurances that the government will \nvacate spectrum once the process is complete and requires the Office of \nManagement and Budget to intervene in the relocation process if \nagencies are failing to comply with the relocation plan and penalizing \nagencies if they do not meet the BRAC timeline.\n  The Kirk amendment would provide the telecommunications industry with \na certain path forward for reliably clear spectrum to advance \nemployment in the United States through wireless advancement.\n  I urge congressional leaders to consider this proposal. It comes from \nneither Republican nor Democratic sides. It is one of the most valuable \nassets that the government is currently squatting on and could be part \nof an overall deficit reduction plan totalling upward of $90 billion, \nbut I think that benefit understates the true potential. Because if we \nset a goal of the United States being the country that offers the most \nbroadband wireless spectrum, then we ensure that this critical 21st \ncentury industry remains in the United States and that the pace of \ninnovation in wireless always is fastest in America as opposed to Asia \nor Europe.\n  That is why I put the amendment forward. I would seek its adoption as \npart of our deficit negotiations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/27/senate-section/article/S4934-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4934-S4936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE DEBT CEILING\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, Senate majority leader Harry Reid has \npresented a plan to address our deficits and to end the debt ceiling \nimpasse that threatens to cripple our economy.\n  The Treasury is projected to run out of money next week and time is \nrunning short. Senator Reid has shown great leadership with his \npragmatic package. Leader Reid's proposal would give the Treasury the \nauthority to ensure the United States does not default on its debt, \nwhile at the same time cutting $2.7 trillion from our budget.\n  The unprecedented set of cuts would have a significant effect in \nbalancing\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n\nour budget and restoring fiscal sustainability to the Federal \nGovernment. I wish to highlight one key fact. Unlike the House \nRepublican budget and unlike the so-called cut, cap, and balance plan, \nLeader Reid's plan will preserve Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid.\n  Protecting Social Security and Medicare benefits is particularly \nimportant. The Republicans have long coveted Social Security and wanted \nto turn it over to Wall Street. George Bush tried and failed to do this \nbecause the American people wanted none of it, but they tried.\n  The House Republican budget attacked Medicare, effectively turning it \nover to the private health insurance industry in 10 years. When the \nAmerican people found out this was hidden in the Republican budget, \nthey wanted none of it. Huge majorities of the American public \ndisapproved of the Republican budget attack on Medicare.\n  But instead of relenting, the Republicans came back with cut, cap, \nand balance. Hidden behind that slogan was an even worse attack on \nMedicare. The House budget would have raised senior's costs more than \n$6,000 a year. Cut, cap, and balance would have gone $2,500 beyond \nthat. Cut, cap, and kill Medicare was a better name for it.\n  Against that relentless Republican effort to go against the will of \nthe American people and kill off Medicare, Leader Reid's proposal \nprotects this vital program and the freedom and security it provides to \nAmerican families.\n  Make no mistake about it, our deficit reduction plan will not be \neasy. It will cut discretionary spending by $1.2 trillion over the next \ndecade. These budget reductions will require some tough but necessary \nchoices. The plan would also count for an accelerated wind-down of U.S. \nforces in Iraq and Afghanistan, saving $1 trillion in the process.\n  Our troops in the Middle East deserve our admiration and praise for \nso successfully carrying out their missions. We must, however, continue \nto press for a strategy that will bring our troops home as soon as we \nsafely can.\n  The Reid deficit plan would find an additional $40 billion savings by \ncutting fraud and abuse in tax compliance and a number of nondefense \nFederal programs and $60 billion in other savings, including cutting \nunnecessary spending on agricultural subsidies and auctioning off \nelectromagnetic spectrum that the government currently holds.\n  Finally, by cutting the budget by over $2 trillion, we will have to \nborrow less money than anticipated, and that will save an additional \n$400 billion in projected interest costs. In total, the Senate \nDemocratic plan on which we will vote would cut the deficit by $2.7 \ntrillion over the next 10 years.\n  While Senator Reid's proposal would not address the tax gimmicks and \nloopholes throughout our Tax Code that help favor the well-connected, \nthis omission does not mean Democrats have given up on ensuring that \nthere is shared sacrifice as we work to balance the budget.\n  Instead, this package acknowledges the political realities of the \nmoment. Many House Republicans have flatly refused to entertain raising \nany revenue: not one tax loophole, no cutting of taxpayer subsidies to \nprofitable oil companies, no closing down of offshore tax havens. That \nis wrong. The Reid package reserves the tax side of budget reform for \nanother day.\n  We look forward to a robust discussion in the weeks and months ahead \nover Republican priorities that put special interest loopholes ahead of \nthe interests of American families and ahead of the interests of the \nAmerican economy.\n  The Reid plan would establish a bipartisan commission to recommend \nbudget changes and those recommendations would then be guaranteed an \nup-or-down vote in both Houses of Congress before the end of the year. \nThese recommendations should focus on cutting the unjustifiable tax \ngiveaways--the tax earmarks--that allow profitable companies to avoid \ntaxes entirely and permit megamillionaires and billionaires to pay \nlower effective tax rates than do middle-class families.\n  The Reid plan meets the Republicans' initial demands in the debt \nceiling negotiations. It cuts $2.7 trillion from the budget--greater \nthan the amount by which the debt limit would be increased--and leaves \ntax reform for the next round of budget reform. But it does not yield \nto the Republican attack on Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid.\n\n  I hope Republicans in the Senate and the House will appreciate the \nbalance of Senator Reid's approach and support it. But what if they do \nnot? The House is in disarray. The Speaker does not appear to have the \nvotes. Some of the extremists will not take yes for an answer, and some \nof the most extreme appear to relish the prospect of America's economy \ncolliding with the debt ceiling.\n  Let's consider what should occur if Congress fails to lift the debt \nceiling. Congress will have sent President Obama three different \nmessages, and they create an irreconcilable conflict. Think about it. \nMessage 1 is: We want him to spend money on all these things. We want \nhim to conduct our wars and our national defense. We want him to send \nout Social Security checks. We want him to pay the doctors and the \nhospitals that provide Medicare services. We want him to keep guards on \nour borders and in our prisons, keep air traffic controllers in the \ntowers, run the rest of the Federal Government.\n  We tell the President to do that by passing laws. It is by law that \nthe President does these things. Message 2 that we send is: Here is the \nmoney we will allow him to collect for the Treasury to pay for all \nthose things. Again, it is by law that we authorize the President to \ncollect that money for the Treasury--by law.\n  There is a slight problem. The things we have instructed the \nPresident to do by law add up to a lot more expense than the money by \nlaw we allow him--the executive branch--to collect. So the executive \nbranch has had to borrow--and borrow they have--up to $14 trillion.\n  If we do not lift the debt ceiling, we send message 3: Do not borrow \nany more. We do not change message 1, and we do not change message 2. \nWe just add message 3: Do not borrow any more.\n  As anyone can see, there is no way to reconcile those three \ninstructions. One, by law, we tell the executive branch to send out all \nthese checks and make payments; two, by law, we appropriate too little \nmoney to pay for what we have told the executive branch to do; and, \nthree, by law, we would tell the executive branch of government they \ncannot borrow the difference.\n  That creates an irreconcilably mixed signal. Do this, but there is \nnot enough money, and do not borrow. This is irresponsible and it is \nbad government. If Congress wants to stop paying the troops, stop \nsending out Social Security checks, shutter agencies of the Federal \nGovernment or defund Medicare, we should have a proper debate and say \nso and be responsible for it.\n  But we have not, and that failure creates an impossible situation for \nthe executive branch under our constitutional principles of separation \nof powers. Remember why officials in the executive branch pay the \nsoldiers and contractors who support our war efforts. Because Congress \nhas told them to. Congress has the power of the purse.\n  Remember why the executive branch sends out Social Security checks \nand payments to doctors and hospitals for providing Medicare services. \nBecause Congress has told them to. Congress has the power of the purse. \nRemember why the President pays the salaries of Border Patrol agents \nand prison guards and air traffic controllers and FBI agents and staff \nin our veterans hospital. Because Congress has told him to do that. \nCongress holds the power of the purse.\n  Who is responsible for not giving the President enough money to pay \nfor all of this, for forcing the Treasury to borrow? Congress has set \nhow much the executive branch can collect because Congress has that \npower of the purse.\n  Now we are telling the President to do all we have told him to do but \nwithout enough money and do not borrow. We all learned in civics that \nCongress has the power to make laws and the power of the purse. We \nlearned that the President has the solemn obligation to faithfully \nexecute the laws Congress has passed. That is the basic structure of \nAmerican Government.\n  Outside of a few narrow and specific areas that are assigned \nexclusively to the executive or judicial authority by\n\n[[Page S4936]]\n\nour Constitution, the constitutional rule is clear: Congress instructs \nthe President by law what to do, and the President faithfully executes \nthose laws.\n  But what happens if Congress will not instruct clearly? What happens \nunder our Constitution when faithfully executing one law Congress has \npassed requires the President to fail to faithfully execute another \nlaw? How can the President faithfully execute irreconcilably \nconflicting instructions from Congress?\n  As a matter of constitutional principle, there is only one logical \nresolution I can see to this constitutional predicament which Congress \nhas created.\n  When the matter is sufficiently grave to merit the President's \nattention, and when Congress sends irreconcilable messages for the \nPresident to faithfully execute, a zone of executive discretion must \nnecessarily open to allow the President to make the best decisions for \nthe American people in the area where Congress has sent those \nirreconcilable mixed signals.\n  Of course, the instant Congress resolves its conflicting signals, \nstops speaking out of both sides of its mouth, and sends a clear \ndirection, that zone of executive discretion disappears. Congress has \nthe power. Congress makes the laws. Congress controls the purse. \nWhatever fiscal path Congress instructs the President to embark on, he \nmust faithfully execute that instruction from Congress.\n  But Congress can't put the President in the untenable position of \nhaving to fail in the ``faithful execution'' of one set of laws in \norder to ``faithfully execute'' another. That is exactly where it seems \nto me we would put the President if we failed to lift the debt ceiling.\n  The damage to the country from such failure would be profound. At \nleast 40 cents of every Federal dollar would suddenly stop flowing into \nthe economy. Considering what would have to be done with the remaining \n60 cents, it is not very likely that the Federal regulatory process \nwould keep running. That means every job in the country, depending on a \nFederal permit or Federal approval or a Federal grant or a Federal \ncontract, would likely grind to a halt.\n  There would be a jump in interest rates that would hit Federal, \nState, municipal, corporate, and family budgets. A lot of other stuff \nmight also go wrong, but those three are a bare minimum, and they alone \nwould constitute a brutal shock to our struggling economy. The damage \nwould be grave.\n  Bad enough if Congress instructed the President to do this kind of \ndamage, but do we really expect him to do that sort of damage without \nour clear instruction? The scale of this damage lights up in sharp \ncontrast to the constitutional predicament Congress would create \nthrough Congress's failure and inaction to send clear direction.\n  The 14th amendment provision, that the public debt of the United \nStates of America ``shall not be questioned,'' may or may not be \ncontrolling here. That specific amendment is not my point. My point is \na more basic one: How, under our separated powers, when Congress gives \nconflicting directives, does the President ``faithfully execute'' those \nconflicting directives? The conflicting directives problem is \nultimately a problem for Congress to solve. But until Congress sorts \nitself out and gives a clear directive, all that can be \nconstitutionally expected of the President is to do the best he can for \nthe country. He cannot ``faithfully execute'' conflicting directives.\n  In a sense, conflicting directives by Congress are a form of \nabdication by Congress--an abdication of the duty imposed on Congress \nby article I of the Constitution to make and pass laws. It is only \nreasonable and proper to infer that the constitutional duty of Congress \nto make and pass laws implies that the Congress will make and pass laws \nthat are capable of faithful execution by the executive.\n  A Congress that cannot meet that standard is in no position to \ncomplain that the executive branch has usurped its authority. More to \nthe point, the constitutional cure is always right in Congress's hands: \nSort out your differences; give the executive branch the direction it \nis Congress's duty to provide.\n  To me, at least, this is a reading of the separation of powers in the \nU.S. Constitution that makes sense, that is consistent with the \nunderlying principles of that great document, that is practical and \nworkable, and that allows for governance rather than paralysis in \ncircumstances when congressional dysfunction deprives the President of \nthe clear legislative direction that by clear implication is Congress's \nduty to provide.\n  I hope before we pitch over the looming fiscal precipice, the \nexecutive branch gives these views thoughtful consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/27/senate-section/article/S4936-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will address the issue of the pending \ndebt limit.\n  Although the President's most recent speech on this did not give me \ngreat cause for confidence, I still hope he will drop his insistence on \nthe huge tax increase in return for making the meaningful spending cuts \nand reforms that we need. I hope, most of all, he will drop his \nopposition to putting our budget on a path to balance.\n  That is the big item I think we need in this debate. I think we ought \nto be willing to raise the debt limit, as I am, if in return for that \nwe would have a commitment of the President to put us on a path to a \nbalanced budget, as President Clinton committed to and he achieved with \na Republican Congress back in 1995. I hope we will reach an agreement \nthat solves the underlying problem prior to August 2.\n  I am here this afternoon because I think we all have to acknowledge \nthat we are late in the process, and I think it is indisputable that \nthere is at least a possibility that August 2 will arrive without \nhaving raised the debt ceiling, whatever our personal preferences might \nbe about that.\n  In my view, since that is a possibility, it is essential that the \nFederal Government have a plan for what we will do if those \ncircumstances arise. Specifically, what is going to have to happen is \nthe government will have to spend some period of time--probably a very \nbrief time, but a period of time nevertheless--operating exclusively on \nthe ongoing tax revenues that will be coming in without the ability to \ngo out and borrow additional money. That means necessarily that \nsomebody is going to make decisions about prioritizing payments, by \nsome criteria that somebody will come up with.\n  Rather than simply wait and stumble into this period and discover \nwhat somebody has come up with, I think we ought to lay out a plan. So \nthat is what my recently introduced legislation is meant to do.\n  Some of us have made this argument for a long time. We saw this day \ncoming, and we have known that we would face a difficult time raising \nthis debt ceiling. It has always been possible that we would not do it \nby August 2. I have been arguing that we ought to have this plan.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has persisted in denying that it is \neven possible to prioritize. It is ridiculous. It is going to happen. \nThey are predicting that we are going to default on our bonds if we go \npast August 2 without having raised the debt ceiling.\n  In a letter to Congress, Treasury Secretary Geithner said:\n\n       This would be an unprecedented event in American history. A \n     default would inflict catastrophic, far-reaching damage on \n     our Nation's economy.\n\n  President Obama said this in May of this year:\n\n       If investors around the world thought that the full faith \n     and credit of the United States\n\n[[Page S4937]]\n\n     was not being backed up, if they thought that we might renege \n     on our IOUs, it could unravel the entire financial system.\n\n  These are scare tactics. These things need not happen. I am afraid \nthey are meant to intimidate Members of Congress into voting for a debt \nlimit increase without the underlying reforms and spending cuts that \nthe President resists. I think its irresponsible to make these \nsuggestions because it is entirely within the power of the \nadministration to avoid a catastrophic default even if the debt limit \nis not raised.\n  Now we have published reports that Treasury officials are making \nprivate phone calls to senior executives at big banks informing them \nthat the Treasury will not allow a default--will choose not to default \non our bonds. I think they should not default on our bonds, but it is \nall well and good to tell the big banks this. How about ordinary \nAmericans who wonder: What about our savings, and what about Social \nSecurity payments?\n  This is unacceptable. That is why we introduced a bill called \nEnsuring the Full Faith and Credit of the United States and Protecting \nAmerica's Soldiers and Seniors Act. We have over 35 cosponsors.\n  Our bill would instruct the Treasury Secretary that in the event, \nhowever unlikely, that the debt ceiling is not raised prior to August \n2, they make certain obligations and priorities so they will be paid in \nfull, on time, and without delay. Those three priorities are: interest \non our debt, so we will not default and plunge our country into \neconomic chaos; No. 2, Social Security payments because millions of \nsenior citizens, including my parents, depend on Social Security \npayments. They have earned that benefit by virtue of the payments they \nhave made. We can and must honor that obligation. Next is payroll for \nActive-Duty military personnel because those risking their lives for us \ndeserve this certainty.\n  The fact is, there are far more than enough resources for the \nadministration to make these payments. As this chart illustrates, the \ngreen bar reflects total minimum revenue expected to come in in August. \nThe combination of interest on our debt, Active-Duty military pay, and \nSocial Security benefits would add up to less than half of the revenue \nthat we are going to take in in August alone. These are not my numbers. \nThey come from the Bipartisan Policy Center. They illustrate clearly \nthat we have the ability to pay these items and many others.\n  Let me be very clear. I am not suggesting this is a desirable \noutcome. I am not suggesting this bill is the substitute for raising \nthe debt ceiling.\n  Mr. President, this chart illustrates that there clearly are more \nthan enough financial resources that will be coming into the Treasury \nday in and day out in the form of ongoing tax revenue to easily be able \nto afford interest on our debt to avoid a default, Social Security \npayments to seniors so that they can be assured of the income they \ndeserve, and Active-Duty military pay, with a great deal left over.\n  These are not my numbers. They come independently verified by many \norganizations, including the Bipartisan Policy Center. This bill is not \nmeant as a substitute for raising the debt limit. It is a mechanism for \nminimizing the disruption that might otherwise occur if the debt limit \nis not raised prior to August 2.\n  It is my hope that this legislation never needs to be implemented. \nBut I believe it would be irresponsible for us to go into this period \nwithout having planned for how we will handle it in the event this \nhappens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin).

MUELLER, III, TO BE DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL \n                        BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider Executive Calendar No. 276, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Robert S. Mueller, III, of \nCalifornia, to be Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a \nterm expiring September 4, 2013.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before I begin, unless all time is yielded \nback, we have 2 hours on this debate. I ask unanimous consent that any \nquorum calls during that 2 hours be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider the \nPresident's nomination of Robert Mueller to continue serving as the \nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This is consistent \nwith the President's May 12, 2011 request that Congress pass \nlegislation to enable the Director to continue serving, in light of the \nleadership transitions at several key national security agencies.\n  Prior to the President's request, I had discussed this with President \nObama, and one of the things he noted was that we were going to have a \nnew Secretary of Defense, a new Director of the CIA, and that he did \nnot want to have yet a third key member of the national security team \nbe replaced at this time. I applaud the President for this, as he could \nhave taken another route and named somebody who would serve for 10 \nyears, beyond any time the President might be in office. Instead, the \nPresident decided to do what is best for the country and extend \nDirector Mueller for 2 years. With the tenth anniversary of 9/11 \napproaching and the continued threat from al-Qaida, we find ourselves \nfacing unique circumstances. We need leadership, stability, and \ncontinuity at the FBI as the President makes necessary shifts to his \nnational security team.\n  After I met with the President and heard his request, I immediately \nwent to work with a bipartisan group of Senators to draft and introduce \na bill to create a one-time exception to the statute that limits the \nterm of the FBI Director to 10 years. I worked in a bipartisan manner \nto hold a hearing and report the legislation to the full Senate on June \n16, 2011. We worked in such a way it could not be seen as a Democratic \nor Republican bill but as bipartisan. Unfortunately, it then took a \nmonth to get consent from the other side to consider the bill. Once we \nobtained consent, the Senate was able to pass a version of it on July \n21. The House of Representatives, to their credit, followed suit on \nJuly 25 and the President signed the bill into law yesterday.\n  The President's nomination of Director Mueller shows there was never \nany effort to impose a legislative appointment upon the President. The \nrequest to extend Director Mueller's term originated with the \nPresident, not Congress. Nor was it Director Mueller's idea. The \nPresident has prevailed upon Director Mueller and his family, for the \ngood of the country, to alter their plans for Director Mueller to leave \nthe FBI. Instead, both Director Mueller and Mrs. Mueller have answered \nthe call of the country. Incidentally, I don't think I am disclosing \nanything inappropriate by saying that in my discussions with the \nPresident, when he was talking about extending the term of Director \nMueller, I asked him: How does Director Mueller feel about this? The \nPresident said: I haven't talked with him yet, but he is a good, loyal \nAmerican, a good Marine, and he will answer the call. And that is \nprecisely what he did.\n  When we passed our legislation, I did insist we include a unanimous \nconsent agreement to expedite consideration of this nomination when \nothers insisted we adopt a form of statute that would require Director \nMueller's renomination. The Majority Leader now has consent to take up \nthe nomination, and after the use or yielding back of time for debate, \nthe Senate will vote on the nomination. Some asked why I insisted upon \nsuch a unanimous consent agreement. I did it to prevent a recurrence of \nthe delays and obstruction that have been used to complicate \nconsideration\n\n[[Page S4938]]\n\nof so many of the President's nominations, especially in the area of \nnational security, such as the Deputy Attorney General, the Assistant \nAttorney General for National Security, and so many others.\n  We have Senators who speak on the floor about the importance of \nprotecting the security of the United States, but then at the same time \ndelay and delay the people the President needs in place to protect our \nnational security. The irony is that after these nominees have been \nheld up month after month, they pass overwhelmingly in this body. In \nfact, there was even a hold originally on the legislation making \nDirector Mueller's nomination possible. But now that is behind us and \nthe Senate can vote to reconfirm Director Mueller to a new 2-year term \nbefore the August 2 deadline and avoid any lapse in leadership at the \nFBI.\n  Let me speak a little about the Director. He took over as FBI \nDirector just days before the attacks of September 11, 2001. Since \nthen, he has overseen and guided the Bureau through a major \ntransformation and evolution. Of course, as in any major \ntransformation, there have been problems, but the Director has \nconsistently displayed professionalism and focus in increasing the \nFBI's national security and counterterrorism efforts, while still \ncarrying out the Bureau's essential law enforcement responsibilities. \nSo I applaud Director Mueller's commitment to ensuring that the FBI \nadheres to the values and freedoms Americans hold dear, while \nvigorously pursuing important law enforcement national security \nobjectives.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I intend to continue to \nconduct vigorous oversight of the FBI, and will work closely with the \nDirector on these important issues. After all, oversight is one of \nCongress's most important responsibilities. For example, on June 17, I \nwrote a letter with Ranking Member Grassley to Director Mueller about \nthe proposed changes in the FBI's revised edition of the Domestic \nInvestigations and Operations Guide. I remain committed to ensuring \nthat this revised guide provides the FBI with the latitude it needs to \ncarry out its duties while not infringing upon the civil liberties of \nAmericans, and ensuring the Judiciary Committee and public are kept \ninformed from its implementation.\n  I will continue to monitor the implementation of the USA PATRIOT Act, \nwhich Congress extended this past May. At the start of this Congress, I \nintroduced legislation that would have extended the three expiring \nprovisions of the USA PATRIOT Act, while improving oversight, promoting \ntransparency, and expanding privacy and civil liberties safeguards in \ncurrent law. Unfortunately, despite the fact that legislation was \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee, it was never allowed to \nreceive an up-or-down vote during the debate to extend the expiring \nprovisions of the USA PATRIOT Act earlier this year. Nonetheless, I \nwill work with Director Mueller, the Department of Justice, and all \nSenators of both parties to ensure oversight of the USA PATRIOT Act \nauthorities.\n  It is important that we vote for this renomination this afternoon, \ngiven the ongoing threats to our Nation, and I appreciate Director \nMueller's willingness to continue his service. At the Judiciary \nCommittee hearing on the legislation allowing for this extension, while \nI noted that Director Mueller has dedicated his life to public service, \nI also made a point to mention his wife, Ann. All of us who serve in \npublic office know that it puts extra strain on our family members. I \nknow how much of a partner she has been with him in bringing him to \nwhere he is, and I know it has to have been a large part of their life \ntogether. I am certain that they both were hoping to be able to have \nsome time without the pressures of being in such demanding public \nservice. So I thank him for being willing to serve, but I thank Mrs. \nMueller, too. So often we forget that. Director Mueller has dedicated \nhis life to public service, and we are grateful to him and his family \nfor their continued sacrifice.\n  Mr. President, I see the distinguished ranking member on the floor, \nso I yield the floor to Senator Grassley. And I note for the Senator \nfrom Iowa that I have already asked consent that when there is a quorum \ncall, the time be divided equally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to support the \nrenomination of Robert Mueller to be Director of the FBI.\n  Director Mueller has served as Director since days immediately \npreceding the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In the wake of \nthat tragedy, he has overseen a top-to-bottom transformation of the FBI \nfrom a domestic law enforcement agency to a national security agency \nand with a necessary global presence to combat terrorism.\n  Director Mueller has led the charge to ensure that the FBI's \ntransformation is successful. This includes upgrading the workforce \nfrom an agent-driven agency to one that includes an ever-increasing \nnumber of intelligence analysts. I applaud the hard work that has been \ndone, and I also applaud the leadership of Director Mueller. But more \nwork remains.\n  Despite the recent successes, the FBI also has its share of black \nmarks and skeletons in the closet. I have been an outspoken critic of \nthe FBI's culture for many years because of its unwillingness to own up \nto mistakes. Too often, officials sought to protect the agency's \nreputation at the expense of the truth. My concerns are magnified by \nthe way the FBI has treated internal whistleblowers who come forward \nand report fraud and abuse. But these problems are not necessarily the \nfault of Director Mueller, and many of these problems were in place \nlong before he arrived.\n  The Director has been forthright in coming before Congress and \nexplaining these mistakes and not simply passing the buck. I appreciate \nhis candor, and I believe the FBI is in good hands with his leadership. \nBut I will continue, as he knows, to conduct extensive oversight of the \nFBI to ensure that taxpayers' dollars are spent appropriately and that \nthe civil liberties of Americans are protected.\n  In 1976, following the excesses of J. Edgar Hoover, Congress limited \nthe term of the Director of the FBI to one nonrenewable 10-year term. \nCongress did so to prevent the accumulation of excess power by a \nDirector as well as to provide some political independence for the FBI.\n  Despite his knowing about Director Mueller's impending term limit and \nhis initiating a search for a successor led by Attorney General and \nVice President Biden, President Obama chose not to send the Senate a \nnomination for the Director of the FBI. Instead, the President decided, \nnotwithstanding those statutory provisions, Director Mueller should \ncontinue to serve in this position for another 2 years.\n  Presidential decisions to make transitions in other national security \npositions are not a special circumstance supporting the extension of \nthe Director's term. Those personnel changes were entirely within the \ncontrol of the President. However, we do live in extraordinary times \nand currently face unusual national security threats. Between the \nrecent death of Osama bin Laden and with the upcoming 10th anniversary \nof the 9/11 attacks, there is an increased threat of a possible \nterrorist attack. Against this backdrop and with a heavy heart, I \nagreed to support the President's request to provide a one-time \nexception to the 10-year term limit on the FBI directorship.\n  With some reluctance, I joined as a cosponsor of the original S. \n1103. The President recently signed into law a modified version of that \nbill that provides a one-time extension of the FBI Director's term. \nEarly in the process, I said that as a requirement for my support of \nany legislation extending the 10-year term, regular procedure be \nfollowed. The purpose of this requirement was to set a substantial \nprecedent against pursuing a simple process eviscerating the 10-year \nterm limit.\n  The process of getting to today's confirmation vote has met my early \nrequirement. A precedent has been set that the FBI Director's term \nwould not be routinely extended--the process of holding a hearing where \nthe FBI Director testified, a legislative markup, and a floor vote in \nboth the House and Senate. Further, the bill was coupled with a \nunanimous consent agreement requiring a vote on the renomination of\n\n[[Page S4939]]\n\nDirector Mueller. Taken together, this process has established a \nhistorical record that we do not take this extension lightly and that \nany future extensions should have to go through no less than this same \nprocess.\n  The 10-year limit has achieved its intended purpose. Until Director \nMueller, no Director subject to the limit has served the full 10-year \nterm. The limit has been successful in reducing the power of the \nDirector and in preserving the vital civil liberties of all Americans.\n  It has also provided important political independence for the FBI \nDirector. Only one Director has been fired in this period, and this did \nnot occur for political reasons. The prohibition on reappointment has \nalso preserved the Directors's independence by eliminating any \npotential that the Director will attempt to curry favor with the \nPresidents to be reappointed.\n  Director Mueller has done an admirable job on some areas of reform in \nan agency under difficult circumstances. I strongly support Director \nMueller and believe he will continue to provide steady leadership at \nthis agency during what continue to be extraordinary times, and you can \nsay extraordinary times going back to at least September 11, 2001, but \nas you look on the history of the war on terror, it probably started 25 \nyears before that in one form or another. However, it is clear to me, \nas the legislation the President signed requires, that in 2 years \nDirector Mueller will need to move on and the President will send the \nSenate a new nominee to fill his shoes.\n  In the meantime, we all ought to thank Director Mueller for his \nwillingness to serve for another 2 years in this very important \nposition because I am sure he was already ready to move on. So the \npeople of the United States as well as this Congress need to say thank \nyou, Director Mueller, for being willing to serve your people again.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I support the President's nomination of \nRobert Mueller to be the Director of the FBI for an additional 2-year \nterm.\n  I believe Mr. Mueller is a fine Director of the FBI. I had the \nopportunity to observe him within the Department of Justice for a \nnumber of years. I served as U.S. attorney in Alabama for 12 years, and \nduring that time he was the U.S. attorney. He was an attorney in the \nDepartment of Justice, and he was one of the top administrators of the \nDepartment of Justice. Director Mueller was a decorated Marine officer \nand served in Vietnam. I truly believe he represents the highest and \nbest ideals of American patriotism and capability.\n  He had the opportunity over the years to go into private practice and \nmake a lot of money. He has stayed and committed himself to public \nservice according to the highest ideals, I believe, of public service.\n  He had a 10-year term. Normally, we would expect that it would be \njust that, a 10-year term. The Director has given that long a period of \ntime because there was a concern that when people stay too long, \nproblems can arise in the system because it becomes personality driven \nrather than meritocracy and people can become entrenched in that sort \nof thing. So we have a 10-year term. I am not sure that is a perfect \nperiod of time, but that was the one that was decided, so it should not \nbe lightly changed to a longer period of time without some serious \nthought.\n  Are we violating the very purposes of the act that limited his \nterm? I am pleased that, instead of moving forward with the proposal as \noriginally drafted, we are now moving forward with the proposal Senator \nCoburn offered, his substitute amendment. I think that is the better \nway to extend the term. I would like to talk about that a little bit.\n\n  The original proposal would have just amended the statute providing \nthat the Director serve for only one 10-year term and created an \nexception to allow Director Mueller to serve an additional 2 years. I \nam concerned about the potential for creating a dangerous precedent \nthat the 10-year term limit applies depending on who is the Director, \nhis or her political popularity, and the political dynamics of the \nWhite House and the Congress. That was not our goal.\n  I do understand the President's desire to retain Director Mueller \nduring this time in our Nation's history and to do so expeditiously and \nnot to have some sort of interim uncertainty. Actually, I congratulate \nthe President on his judgment in concluding that Director Mueller can \ndo a good job and has done a good job. While it is true that the \noriginal legislative proposal would have accomplished those things, I \nbelieve it was the easy way out and would not only have been a \ntemptation to future generations to replicate it, but, more important, \nit might have run afoul of the Constitution.\n  At the hearing before the Judiciary Committee, of which I am a \nmember, concerns were raised about the original proposal. Those were \nraised by University of Virginia James Madison Distinguished Professor \nof Law John Harrison.\n  As we all recall, James Madison was considered to be the Founder of \nour Constitution, the most active member of our Constitutional \nConvention, the one whose notes told us what went on, the one who went \nto the convention with an outline, a framework for the structure of \ngovernment that eventually became our Constitution.\n  Mr. Harrison testified that it was an unconstitutional ``attempt by \nCongress to exercise directly through legislation the appointments \npower.''\n  Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution, the appointments \nclause--it is in the Constitution--states that the President ``shall \nnominate and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall \nappoint Ambassadors and other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of \nthe Supreme Court and all other Officers of the United States, whose \nappointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be \nestablished by law.''\n  In the case of Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court held that ``any \nappointee exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the \nUnited States is an `Officer of the United States' and must, therefore, \nbe appointed in the manner prescribed by [section] 2, [clause] 2, of \nthat Article.''\n  In addition, the Supreme Court has long recognized that ``the power \nof removal [is] incident to the power of appointment.'' Therefore, \nCongress may not involve itself in the removal process insofar as it \ninterferes with the ability of the President to exercise Executive \npower and to perform his constitutional duty.\n  Professor Harrison explained that because ``an appointment is a legal \nact that causes someone to hold an office that otherwise would be \nvacant or held by someone else,'' a ``statutory extension of the term \nof an incumbent causes the current incumbent to hold an office that \notherwise would have been vacant upon the expiration of the incumbent's \nterm. It is thus a statutory appointment.''\n  Professor Harrison further testified that the original proposal would \nhave also run afoul of the fundamental constitutional principle that \nunderlies the appointments clause. This is a fundamental principle \nbecause the President has the ultimate veto--the power to decide \nwhether to appoint someone at all--and he has the absolute \nresponsibility for their nomination, good or bad. He nominates them.\n  Indeed, the rationale for the structure of the appointments clause \ndates back to Federalist No. 76 in which Alexander Hamilton explained:\n\n       The sole and undivided responsibility of one man will \n     naturally beget a livelier sense of duty and a more exact \n     regard to reputation. He will on this account feel himself \n     under stronger obligation and more interested to investigate \n     with care the qualities requisite to the stations to be \n     filled, and to prefer with impartiality the persons who may \n     have the fairest pretensions to them.\n\n  That is pretty effective language.\n  Dilution of the President's sole responsibility for nomination and \nappointment is inconsistent with constitutional principles.\n  Given that constitutional concerns were raised by these scholars, it \nwas at\n\n[[Page S4940]]\n\nleast arguable that had we proceeded with the original proposal, a \njudge could find Director Mueller's appointment and term of service to \nbe unconstitutional if it were to be challenged by someone in court, \nand that was possible.\n  Particularly concerning was the suggestion that in a properly \npresented case involving an individual subject to a purported exercise \nof government power by the Director who was appointed pursuant to a \nstatute such as the original proposal, a court could find that exercise \nof power to be invalid, either prospectively or retrospectively. In the \npast, courts have enforced the appointments clause by holding invalid \nthe actions of purported officers whose appointments did not comport \nwith the Constitution.\n  When questioned about this possibility at the hearing, both Director \nMueller and former Deputy Attorney General of the United States James \nComey agreed that if serious constitutional concerns could be raised, \nthey would favor proceeding with the reappointment process in a \ndifferent way, one that would pass constitutional muster and not raise \nquestions.\n  Professor Harrison advises an alternative constitutional method, \nwhich is the proposal Congress passed and the President signed into law \nyesterday. He gave us a suggested way to proceed that would be \nconstitutional, and we drafted it, agreed with it, and passed it.\n  I think it speaks pretty well of Congress that we are attuned to the \ncomplexities of the Constitution and are committed to being faithful to \nthat document, not just taking convenience and going faster but taking \nthe time to hear professors, to think it out, because in that way we \nrespect the Constitution, we venerate it, we strengthen it. When we \njust bypass it or slide by, dismiss lightly concerns that actions of \nCongress or the President may be in violation of the Constitution and \ndon't give due weight to that, we disrespect the document.\n  This law creates a new 2-year term that would run until September 4, \n2013. It assumed that President Obama would nominate Director Mueller \nto that new term with the advice and consent of the Senate, requiring \nthe confirmation vote we will proceed to shortly. Under the new law, \nDirector Mueller is not eligible for another term after September 4, \n2013, and after the expiration of that new term, the term for the \nDirector of the FBI will revert to the previous law, the 10-year term; \ntherefore, whoever is the President in 2013 can appoint a new Director \nto a 10-year term.\n  While I agree Congress should work to expedite the confirmation \nprocess in this unique situation, I also saw no reason to proceed in a \nconstitutionally unsound manner. The formalities of the Constitution \nmay sometimes create obstacles to getting things done as quickly as \nsome would like, but the Constitution and its formalities exist for a \nvery important reason; that is, our constitutional tradition of the \nadherence to the rule of law. We cannot circumvent those formalities in \nthe interest of some expediency or because it is a convenient means to \na desired end. The words of the Constitution have meaning. They are not \nsuggestions that we are free to ignore if it is inconvenient today.\n  I believe in the process by which we are now proceeding--creating a \nseparate 2-year term and then calling on the President to make a new \nnomination. He didn't have to renominate Director Mueller, but he \nindicated that was his desire, and we have accorded him the opportunity \nto do that. He has renominated Director Mueller, and I hope in a few \nmoments we will confirm him to this important position.\n  One of the discussions we had at that hearing was with Professor Van \nAlstyne. I heard him make a speech many years ago--I was a U.S. \nattorney, so it must have been 15, 20 years ago--at the Eleventh \nCircuit Conference, I think, in Georgia. He spoke to the judges. He \nsaid he had come to the belief that if one really respected the \nConstitution, they would follow it faithfully, the good and the bad \nparts, because that was the only way you respected the Constitution, \nthat was the way to honor the Constitution. That is the way to respect \nit, to follow what it says.\n  To the extent to which we are tempted to move around the plain words, \nthe plain intent of the Constitution for convenience, we weaken that \ndocument. In the long run, a weakened document will be less of a \nbulwark protecting our liberties and our freedom as individual \nAmericans.\n  I thank the President, I thank the leadership, and I thank Senator \nLeahy, the chairman of our committee, for responding to the professor's \nrequest and ideas and proceeding in a way that I think raises no \nquestion about constitutionality--or if it does, it is small--and in a \nway that took a little more effort.\n  I once again express my deep admiration for Director Mueller. He is a \nthoroughly professional law enforcement officer. For virtually the \nentire time of his law enforcement career, he has tried individual \ncases, prosecuted individual defendants for all kinds of crimes and \ndepredations. He has understood the reality of courtroom experience. He \nhas worked as a prosecutor with the FBI investigative agents over his \nentire career as a law enforcement officer, and now, as the Director of \nthe FBI, he brings a unique experience to it. I believe he has done a \nfine job, and I believe he will continue to do a fine job for the \npeople of the United States.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of FBI \nDirector Robert Mueller continuing in his current position for another \n2 years. He valiantly served our country in the Marine Corps, earning \nvarious commendations including the Purple Heart. He also served our \ncountry in a variety of other important positions including as a \nFederal prosecutor, as the head of the of the criminal division at the \nDepartment of Justice, and as Acting Deputy Attorney General. He is the \nsecond-longest serving director in the FBI's history.\n  Robert was sworn in as the FBI Director exactly 1 week before the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. He inherited an agency ill-\nequipped at that time for detecting the emerging threats posed by \nterrorist organizations such as al-Qaida. Change does not come easily \nto Federal Government agencies, but Director Mueller immediately \ncommitted to Congress that he would alter the status quo that dominated \nand redefined the culture of the Bureau to effectively address the new \nemerging threats facing our Nation.\n  As Congress began looking at providing the FBI with badly needed \nterror investigation tools such as the USA PATRIOT Act and the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, Director Muller was a prominent and \ncritical part of the process. In the 10 years since that terrible \nattack on our Nation, the agency that Director Mueller leads has \ndetected numerous plots aimed at attacking Americans both at home and \nabroad. At the same time, the FBI still carries out its function as the \nNation's leading criminal investigative agency at the Department of \nJustice.\n  Robert Mueller had a baptism by fire in those first days and weeks of \nhis tenure. His leadership, character, and poise have remained constant \nand the net result has been a revamped FBI that is smarter, more \nnimble, and better equipped to meet the continuing threat of terrorism \nthat America faces every day.\n  I not only support this opportunity for Director Mueller to serve for \nanother 2 years, but I am very pleased that we achieved this end \nthrough a constitutional means. The initial legislation would have \nsimply extended Director Mueller's statutory term without a new \nnomination and confirmation. That would have amounted to an appointment \nby the Senate. The Constitution, however, gives the appointment power \nto the President. We must not use unconstitutional means to achieve \neven desirable political ends.\n  I applaud the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, who offered the \nalternative of creating a single separate 2-year term that would be \navailable only to Director Mueller. That approach leaves in place the \nstatutory 10-year term for the position of FBI Director and respects \nthe constitutional process of nomination and confirmation. It is \nindisputably constitutional. We have all taken the same oath to support \nand defend the Constitution, and that at least means we should choose a \npath that is constitutionally firm over a path that is constitutionally \nshaky. We did in this case, and I think it is a win-win. It achieves a\n\n[[Page S4941]]\n\ngood purpose through a constitutional process.\n  So I am proud to vote once again to support Robert Mueller's \nnomination to be FBI Director. He is a great public servant and the \nright leader for these challenging times.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support wholeheartedly \nthe nomination of Robert S. Mueller III to continue serving as the \nDirector of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, for an additional \n2 years.\n  I have three criteria for nominees: (1) competence; (2) commitment to \nmission of the agency; and (3) highest integrity. Director Mueller \nsurpasses all those tests with flying colors.\n  His competence cannot be questioned. Director Mueller came to the FBI \njust a week before the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001. Since then, he \nhas provided steadfast leadership as the FBI has transformed from a \ntraditional domestic law enforcement agency into a global \ncounterterrorism and anticrime police force that has successfully kept \nAmericans safe from terrorist attacks here at home and abroad. Prior to \nthe FBI, he served our Nation as a decorated marine in Vietnam, and as \na Federal prosecutor who tackled cases ranging from the bombing of Pan \nAm flight 103 to the prosecution of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega.\n  He has shown unwavering commitment to the FBI's mission. Director \nMueller is the only FBI Director to serve out a full 10-year term. From \nhis first day on the job, he fought to make sure the hardworking men \nand women at the FBI have the tools they need to carry out their \nextraordinary responsibilities. As chairwoman of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee that funds the FBI and as a member of the \nIntelligence Committee, I am proud to call Director Mueller my \nsteadfast partner in that fight. Together, we work to provide the FBI \nwith the capabilities to stop terrorists before they attack us here at \nhome, go after schemers and scammers who prey on hardworking American \nfamilies, prevent cyberterrorists from devastating our technology \ninfrastructure, and catch sexual predators before they harm our \nchildren. I look forward to continuing our strong partnership for the \nnext 2 years.\n  Lastly, Director Mueller has strong integrity. He speaks truth to \npower, even when the truth is unpopular or inconvenient. He answered \nthe call to service when President Bush asked him to serve as FBI \ndirector in 2001. And he has answered the call of President Obama when \nasked to serve 2 more years.\n  We live in extraordinarily critical times, facing threats from both \nwithin and outside our Nation, and the President's national security \nteam has experienced major leadership changes in recent months. Keeping \nDirector Mueller at the FBI for another 2 years means that one of the \ntested ``Nighthawks'' will continue guarding our Nation's national \nsecurity. The broad bipartisan support in the Senate to have him \ncontinue serving as Director is a testament to the faith we place in \nthis proven leader. We are privileged to have such a committed and \ndedicated public servant leading the FBI, and I am proud to support his \nnomination.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of \nthe nomination of Robert Mueller to continue as the Director of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation for an additional 2 years.\n  In his 10 years at the FBI, Director Mueller has served admirably, \ninstituting important reforms at the Bureau and strengthening its \ncounterterrorism capabilities. An extension of his term will insure \nthat those efforts can continue and provide important stability to the \nPresident's national security team during this challenging time.\n  It is not surprising that when searching for a replacement for \nDirector Mueller, the President determined that it would be best if the \nDirector would continue his service. Director Mueller has a long and \ndistinguished career in public service and we are fortunate that he has \nagreed to continue in his position.\n  I know that my colleagues are generally familiar with Mr. Mueller's \nbackground, but I think this is an appropriate time to review his many \naccomplishments.\n  Director Mueller first began his service to our Nation when he joined \nthe U.S. Marine Corps after graduating from Princeton University. He \nserved as an officer for 3 years, leading a rifle platoon of the Third \nMarine Division in Vietnam. He received the Bronze Star, two Navy \nCommendation medals, the Purple Heart, and the Vietnamese Cross of \nGallantry.\n  After receiving his law degree from the University of Virginia Law \nSchool, Mr. Mueller headed to my home State of California to begin his \nlegal career. He worked in San Francisco as a litigator until 1976, \nwhen he joined the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Northern District of \nCalifornia. Eventually, he would become the chief of the criminal \ndivision in that office.\n  In 1982, he moved to Boston to serve as an assistant U.S. attorney. \nHe investigated and prosecuted major financial fraud, terrorism, and \npublic corruption cases.\n  After serving in several positions in the public and private sectors, \nin 1998 Mr. Mueller was named U.S. attorney in San Francisco. That was \nwhen he first came to my attention as a skilled and committed \nprosecutor.\n  Mr. Mueller continued in that role until he was nominated to be FBI \nDirector by President George W. Bush on July 5, 2001. That was an \nextremely challenging and difficult time to take on this \nresponsibility, as he came to office only a few months before the \nterrorist attack on September 11, 2001.\n  Director Mueller more than rose to the occasion. He provided strong \nand steady leadership, and worked to transform the Bureau into an \nagency that can better detect and prevent terrorist attacks against the \nUnited States.\n  Under Director Mueller's direction, the FBI has played an essential \nrole in more than 20 significant counterterrorism operations, while \ninfiltrating and arresting groups of individuals charged with planning \nattacks against our country.\n  The FBI has also built its cyber investigation capability, focused on \ncounterintelligence, investigated public corruption cases, and tracked \nand disrupted gang activity.\n  Time and again, Director Mueller has met the many challenges facing \nthe Bureau, and it is now one of our most respected government \ninstitutions.\n  Of course, Congress had good reasons for placing a term limit on the \nDirector of the FBI. History has shown that the enormous power wielded \nby the Director and the FBI can be subject to abuse in the wrong hands.\n  Congress has recognized those concerns with regard to the extension \nof Director Mueller's term. With the implementing legislation that has \npassed Congress, and this subsequent nomination, Congress and the \nPresident have created a one-time extension that would only apply to \nDirector Mueller. Future FBI Directors would still be limited to a 10-\nyear term.\n  Extending Director Mueller's term at the FBI for an additional 2 \nyears will ensure that the important reforms and progress he has made \nwill continue. Additionally, it will provide important stability to the \nPresident's national security team during this sensitive and \nchallenging time and while it is otherwise going through important \nleadership changes.\n  This summer Leon Panetta has succeeded Robert Gates as Secretary of \nDefense. Although General David Petraeus has been confirmed to be the \nnext Director of the CIA, he will not arrive at Headquarters in Langley \nto take leadership of the Agency until after Labor Day.\n  There are additional changes in key military leadership positions, as \nwell as at the National Counterterrorism Center.\n  In the midst of these changes, Director Mueller will be an \nexperienced, steady hand among the President's national security \nadvisors. Keeping Director Mueller in his position will provide \nimportant continuity and leadership during this transition.\n  Personally, I have deep admiration and respect for Director Mueller. \nHis integrity, courage, and dedication are an inspiration, and his \nleadership and effectiveness serve as an example for all. I am very \npleased to call him my friend, and thank him for his willingness to \ncontinue to serve for another 2 years.\n  I urge my colleagues to support his confirmation.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S4942]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Budget cut Impact\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, we are clearly at a momentous moment in \nAmerican history. We are getting tens of thousands of people visiting \nour Web site, sanders.senate.gov, every day. People want to know what \nis going on. As the longest serving Independent in history in Congress, \nlet me give my view of where we are right now.\n  First, I do wish to say I get a little bit tired of hearing some of \nour pundits and some of the politicians around here blithely talking \nabout trillions of dollars in cuts. I see some of these guys making \nhuge salaries on TV saying: Why don't they just come to an agreement--\n$2 trillion in cuts, $3 trillion in cuts. That may be OK if one is \nmaking a whole lot of money on television doing a television show, but, \nclearly, those people have not been talking to real Americans.\n  Let me go over what the media and many of us in Congress have not \nbeen talking about, and that is what the impacts of these trillions of \ndollars of cuts are about. These are not just words on a piece of \npaper. These are cuts which are going to have devastating impacts on \npeople who are already suffering as a result of the worst recession \nsince the Great Depression. Some people come up with this great idea \nand they say: The cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security is too \nhigh today, seniors and disabled vets are getting too much, and ``noted \neconomists''--I have not heard from these noted economists--think it is \ntoo extravagant.\n  Mr. President, go back to Baltimore and I will go to Vermont and we \nwill ask seniors whether they think the COLAs they are getting now are \ntoo extravagant, given the fact they haven't gotten a COLA in the last \n2 years. Studies I have seen say not only are the COLAs today not too \nextravagant for Social Security and disabled vets, they are, in fact, \ntoo low because they underestimate the real expenses of seniors, which \nlargely have to do with health care and prescription drugs. The costs \nare soaring. Any of these pundits or any of these economists who go out \nand talk to real people and say Social Security COLAs are too high are \ngoing to get laughed right out of the room because it isn't true.\n  If we come forward with this so-called chained CPI, this new \nformulation for COLAs, this is what it will mean in the real world: If \nsomeone is 65 today, when they become 75 in 10 years, that will result \nin a $560 decline in what they otherwise would have gotten in Social \nSecurity benefits, and when they are 85, 20 years from today, that will \nbe a $1,000-a-year decline. I know in DC, with the lobbyists making \nmillions a year, when we talk about $1,000, that is what these guys \nspend on a fancy dinner. It is laughable. They don't know what goes on \nin the real world.\n  There are millions of seniors today hanging on, trying to pay their \nprescription drug costs, trying to pay their out-of-pocket costs for \nhealth care, and $1,000 a year in 20 years is a lot of money for those \npeople. In my view, it would be immoral and unacceptable to do what a \nnumber of plans out here are talking about; that is, to cut Social \nSecurity benefits very significantly. Clearly, that is where the \nRepublicans are coming from, but it distresses me that I hear the \nPresident and Democrats in Congress also talking about that. This \nSenator will do everything he can to protect this enormously important \nprogram which, by the way, just in passing, has not contributed one \nnickel to the deficit because it is funded by the payroll tax and has a \n$2.6 trillion surplus. From a moral perspective, we cannot and must not \ncut Social Security.\n  There are other geniuses out there who are saying: Well, the way \nMedicare health care costs are going up, maybe it is time we did \nsomething like make major cuts in Medicare, including raising the \neligibility age from 65 to 67. What is the problem? What is 2 years? \nClearly, those folks have not talked to anybody who has been struggling \nwhen they are 60 or 63 and looking forward to Medicare at 65. What \nhappens if a person is a modest-income person and they are 66 years of \nage and they are dealing with a health care crisis? Maybe they were \nhospitalized, but the government has said, pundits have said, my \nRepublican friends have said, we are going to raise the Medicare age to \n67. Tell me what happens. Let the American people tell me what happens \nto those millions of people? What are they supposed to do? They get \ndiagnosed with cancer, they have a serious heart problem, they are 66, \nhave no money in the bank, what happens to them? How many of those \npeople will not survive?\n  Then other people say: Well, Medicaid is an easy program to cut. I \nmean, let's be politically honest about Medicaid. Medicaid is for lower \nincome people. They don't have lobbyists, they don't make large \ncampaign contributions. Many low-income people don't vote. They are \neasy to go after. Let's cut hundreds of billions of dollars from \nMedicaid. Let's be clear. According to a recent study at Harvard \nUniversity, some 45,000 Americans die each year unnecessarily because \nthey don't get to a doctor on time. That is 45,000 Americans, 15 times \nwhat we lost in the disaster of 9/11. Every single year those people \nare dying.\n  What happens if we make savage cuts in Medicaid? How many children do \nwe throw off the Children's Health Insurance Program? What happens to \nthe older people who are now in nursing homes on Medicaid? What happens \nto all those people? I guess we don't have to worry about them. Their \nlobbyists are not here. What happens to people on disability? We turn \nour back on those people, that is what we do.\n  One of the very interesting aspects of this whole debate and why the \nAmerican people are so angry, so frustrated, and so disillusioned is \nthat Congress is moving in a direction of exactly the opposite way that \nthe American people want us to handle deficit reduction. Every single \npoll I have seen and in my experience in talking to people in the State \nof Vermont, people want shared sacrifice. People understand that the \nwealthiest people in this country are doing phenomenally well. Over a \nrecent 25-year period, 80 percent of all new income went to the top 1 \npercent. The rich are getting richer, and you know what. Their \neffective tax rates today are one of the lowest in American history, \nabout 18 percent. So the richest people in America who are doing \nphenomenally well are paying a lower tax rate than nurses, teachers, \nand police officers. The American people who see the middle class \ndeclining and the rich getting richer are saying: Hey, it is only fair \nthat the wealthiest people help us contribute to deficit reduction. We \ncan't place the whole burden on the backs of people who are getting \npoorer and poorer as a result of the recession.\n  The American people also understand we have large multinational \ncorporations, such as General Electric, ExxonMobil, and many others \nthat have been making billions of dollars in profits in recent years \nand don't pay a nickel in Federal taxes. Then, on top of that, we have \nthe absurdity of a tax policy which allows the wealthy and large \ncorporations to stash huge amounts of money in the Cayman Islands and \nin other tax havens so we are losing about $100 billion a year in \nrevenue. The American people are looking around and saying: That is \ncrazy. The wealthy and large corporations, which are doing phenomenally \nwell, which are not paying their fair share of taxes, have to \ncontribute to deficit reduction. It cannot simply be on the backs of \nthe elderly, the children, the sick, the poor. That is what the \nAmerican people are saying in poll after poll.\n  There was a poll that just came out the other day--just one more of \nmany polls. Washington Post: Should the wealthiest people in this \ncountry be asked to pay more? That is the question. They asked: In \norder to reduce the national debt, would you support or oppose the \nfollowing: raising taxes on Americans with incomes of over $250,000 a \nyear. The response in that poll was 72 percent of the American people \nsaid yes, 27 percent said no. Overwhelmingly, every poll we see says \nthe wealthy have to pay more in taxes, and then the same polls say: \nProtect Social Security, protect Medicare, protect Medicaid, protect \neducation. Here is the irony: We are marching down a\n\n[[Page S4943]]\n\npath which will do exactly the opposite of what the American people \nwant. Our Republican friends have been absolutely fanatically \ndetermined that no matter what happens, billionaires and large \ncorporations will not pay a nickel more in taxes. That has been their \nreligious belief, not a nickel more from the wealthiest people in this \ncountry. I have to say Democrats have not been particularly strong in \nopposition to that nor has the President been strong, with retreat \nafter retreat.\n  In recent months, we have heard more and more discussion from \nDemocrats about cuts in Social Security, cuts in Medicare, cuts in \nMedicaid. Now there is apparently a willingness to come forward with a \nproposal that would include only cuts and no revenue at all--no revenue \nat all.\n  I think the American people are angry. I think they are frustrated. I \nthink they are disillusioned because what they want to see happen is \ndeficit reduction done through shared sacrifice, although with the \nwealthy and large corporations playing their role appears not to be \nhappening. And when they have said loudly and clearly that we must \nprotect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, they are also seeing \nthat it is not happening.\n\n  So I just conclude by saying I think there is a path toward deficit \nreduction which is fair and responsible. It does ask the big-money \ninterests to understand that they are Americans also and they have to \nplay a role in deficit reduction. It does say that at a time when we \nhave tripled military spending since 1997, we have to make significant \ncuts there as well.\n  I hope our Republican friends give up their fanatical opposition to \nasking billionaires and millionaires and large corporations to play a \nrole in deficit reduction. I hope my Democratic friends will stand \ntall. And I hope that at the end of the day, we have the deficit-\nreduction program the American people will feel good about.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          FAA Reauthorization\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, we all know we are running against the \ndeadline of Tuesday, August 2, on raising the debt of our Nation, and \nthere is a real risk that if we don't make that deadline on Tuesday, \nthere will be checks from the Federal Government that will not be able \nto go out. The number of 70 million is used as the number of checks \nwritten each month by the Federal Government that go to employees, that \ngo to contractors, that go to recipients of certain benefits.\n  Let me talk about 4,000 Federal workers who already have been \nfurloughed. It doesn't have to do with raising the debt ceiling; it has \nto do with the failure of the House of Representatives to send a clean \nextension of the Federal Aviation Administration--the FAA \nreauthorization bill--for us to consider. As a result of the failure to \npass the reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration or to \npass a short-term extension of the FAA, 4,000 workers at the Federal \nAviation Administration have been put on furlough. That in and of \nitself has a major impact on our economy. That is 4,000 Americans who \nare no longer receiving a paycheck. It affects people who work for the \nFAA in such fields as safety engineers, computer scientists, \naeronautics engineers, physical scientists--the list goes on and on--\njeopardizing the progress we have made in keeping our airways safe and \njeopardizing the convenience to those who travel by air. Many of those \nworkers live in the State of Maryland, so it is having a direct effect \non the State I have the honor of representing in the Senate.\n  It goes beyond just the Federal workforce who have been put on \nfurlough as a result of the failure to pass a short-term extension of \nthe FAA. It also goes to construction contracts that are funded through \naviation funds. At many airports around the Nation, there have now been \nstop orders on construction of runways, construction of towers, and \nconstruction of other improvements that are important to keep our \nairports modern and safe and convenient in handling the increased \nnumber of air passengers.\n  Let me tell my colleagues that, yes, it affects those large \ncontractors who are doing the work of the Federal Government. It is \ngoing to affect their payrolls and their workforce, but it also affects \na lot of small businesses in Maryland and around the Nation.\n  Let me give one example. Chappy Corporation is an electrical and \nmechanical operations small business specializing in airport landing \nsystems and lighting. Chappy Corporation is the lead contractor \nimplementing BWI's--the main airport in Maryland--ASDE-X project, a \nrunway safety mechanism that enables air traffic controllers to detect \npotential runway conflicts by providing detailed coverage of movement \non runways and taxiways. For the safety of all of us, I hope we would \nwant to move forward with those types of improvements in our major \nairports in the Nation, including the one which most Marylanders use--\nBWI Airport. Chappy Corporation has been told to stop work on this \nimportant aviation safety project, thus decreasing their value and \nmaking it more difficult to make payroll. It is already tough for small \ncompanies out there today, and now, because of the failure of the House \nto send over to us a clean extension of the FAA bill, which we have \ndone many times in the past, we have a company such as Chappy which is \nrunning the risk of its strength to continue with its current workforce \nand to do important work at airports for safety.\n  It also goes beyond the Federal employees and the contractor \nemployees who are not getting a paycheck and the contractors whose work \nhas been stopped and they are not getting their construction contract \npayments. It also affects the Federal Aviation Administration's \nrevenues. They collect a lot of revenue. There is a ticket tax. When a \nperson buys an airline ticket, they pay a tax that goes into the \nFederal Aviation Administration's funds which are used for improvement \nprojects at our airports. That amounts to about $30 million that will \nnot be collected. What happens to that money? Well, we lose it in the \nFederal Treasury. People say: Well, maybe it will make it less \nexpensive for people to travel. But that is not the case.\n  Let me quote a headline from Reuters: ``Airlines Raise Fares as Taxes \nLapse.''\n  I am quoting:\n\n       Many U.S. airlines have raised fares in recent days to take \n     advantage of a lapse in U.S. ticket tax collection after \n     Congress failed last week to fully fund the Federal Aviation \n     Administration's budget, but passengers are not likely to \n     notice any price difference.\n       JetBlue Airways Corp. and Southwest Airlines Co. began \n     raising ticket prices by at least 7.5 percent on Friday, \n     according to FareCompare.com. Other airlines, such as Delta \n     Air Lines and United Continental Holdings Inc., boosted \n     prices on Saturday.\n\n  So we can't collect the 7.5-percent tax and the airlines are \npocketing the money. The people who are purchasing tickets are still \npaying the same amount even though none of that money is going to \nimprove our airports. It makes no sense whatsoever.\n  All of these occurrences--the Federal workers not getting a paycheck \nand being put on furlough, contractors not getting paid and \nconstruction work not being done, revenues not being collected that are \nnecessary for the Federal Government--are hurting our economy. All are \nmaking it more difficult for our recovery.\n  Why has this happened? The reason, quite frankly, is that we have not \nbeen able to pass the reauthorization bill. We passed the \nreauthorization bill early in the session, the Senate did. The House \npassed a bill about 100 days ago but has refused to appoint conferees \nto work out the differences. Then the House sends over--because we \ndidn't meet the deadline--an extension bill that includes a partisan \nlabor provision, an antilabor provision. Now, that should never be in \nan extension bill. It shouldn't be in any legislation. But it should be \nnegotiated between the conferees of the House and Senate so we can get \na reauthorization bill done. They shouldn't use an extension bill in \norder to get that done, and that is what they have done. As a result, \nwe have the consequences of Federal workers being furloughed, \ncontractors not being paid, and revenues necessary for our airport \nimprovements not being collected.\n\n[[Page S4944]]\n\n  So what should we do? What do we need to do? Well, we need to first \npass a short-term extension, a clean short-term extension without these \nkiller amendments attached to allow our workforce to be able to work \nand to get their paychecks, to allow contractors to continue the work \nthey are doing, and to allow the government to collect the revenue \nnecessary to keep our airports modern. That is the first thing we \nshould do.\n  Secondly, we need to negotiate in good faith between the House and \nthe Senate conferees so we can pass the Federal Aviation Administration \nreauthorization bill. That bill contains many very important \nprovisions, including what we call NextGen, which is the way in which \nwe can operate our air service in a much more efficient way, using less \nfuel, less time, and helping our economy. The FAA reauthorization bill \nis estimated to create hundreds of thousands of jobs for our country. \nWe need to get that done. So we need to negotiate the bill, get that \ndone, and all of that will help create more jobs for our community.\n  I urge my colleagues, particularly those in the House, to send us a \nclean extension bill, negotiate in good faith, and let's get the FAA \nbill done.\n  Actually, I see the ranking member of that committee, our colleague \nfrom Texas, who may wish to talk about it or some other issue.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am here to talk about the \nrenomination of FBI Director Mueller, but I certainly heard my \ncolleague from Maryland, and I agree we must pass a clean extension of \nthe FAA. We are losing the revenue, and we are losing the capability \nfor projects that are ongoing to continue. Work has stopped at many of \nthe airports that have building and repair projects that are supported \nby the FAA.\n  Honestly, the House needs to send a clean extension. There is a clean \nextension pending in the Senate. It has been objected to by one Member. \nThis is not the way to go forward. I happen to agree with much of what \nthe House wants to do, but not in this way. We have to put that in the \ncontext of the whole bill, which we certainly should be doing, and I \nhope the House will send us a clean extension so there will not be \nanother weekend of disruption and people can get on with the projects.\n  I come to the floor today to speak about FBI Director Robert Mueller. \nHe has been FBI Director since 2001. During a critical time when our \ncountry has experienced such major leadership changes on our national \nsecurity team, this nomination offers the necessary stability and \ncontinuity from a proven leader who has wide support.\n  Director Mueller has strong bipartisan support. He was appointed on \nAugust 2, 2001--just before the 9/11 tragedy--by President Bush, and he \nbegan serving a week before the September 11 attacks. His term is said \nto expire next week on August 2.\n  The FBI has never experienced a larger transformation than while \nunder his leadership, adding counterterrorism, counterintelligence, and \ncyber security to the Bureau's traditional crime-fighting mission. In \nthe 10 years Mr. Mueller has been Director of the FBI, he has worked \ntirelessly to ensure that no international terrorist attacks have \noccurred on U.S. soil since 9/11, and there have been several plots \nthat have been uncovered and kept from occurring.\n  Director Mueller has ensured that the FBI is a full member of the \nU.S. intelligence community and serves as a critical and singular link \nbetween the intelligence and law enforcement communities in the United \nStates. He served our Nation with valor and integrity as a marine in \nVietnam and as a Federal prosecutor. He answered the call to service \nfrom President Bush to be FBI Director and is once again answering the \ncall by agreeing to serve 2 more years under President Obama. He is an \nadmirable public servant, and I urge his swift confirmation.\n\n\n                            The Debt Ceiling\n\n  Mr. President, we are less than 6 days away from the date the \nDepartment of the Treasury has signified would shut down the Federal \nGovernment and exhaust all borrowing authority.\n  We all know we are at this point because we have a fundamental \ndifference in the principles on how our government should be run. We \nall know we are at this point because the financial viability of our \nNation is at stake.\n  I believe this debt ceiling debate presents Congress with a critical \nopportunity to get our country back on a sustainable and prosperous \npath. We must send a message to the markets, to the American people, \nand to American businesses that we are going to get our fiscal house in \norder with spending cuts, caps on future spending, and permanent budget \nreform in the form of a balanced budget amendment.\n  What we need now is a serious proposal to provide certainty and clear \ncommitment to a reform measure that ensures spending cuts before the \ndebt ceiling is raised. The Senate majority leader's and the House \nSpeaker's plans have similarity, and I believe a common ground can be \nfound in the two.\n  First, neither of the plans proposes tax increases to achieve deficit \nreduction, and both plans aim for significant deficit savings in the \namount of $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  Now, is that what we wanted? No. I would have had more cuts. We \nshould be reaching for $4 trillion in cuts, not $1.2 trillion. But we \nhave had plans put forward for $4 trillion, we have had plans put \nforward for more, and we could not get those through. We could not get \none through the Senate. Furthermore, entitlements are not in the plans \nthat are before us, and entitlement reform is essential for us to \naddress. We can certainly put Social Security on the fiscally \nresponsible path that will make it secure for 75 years with very minor \nchanges and gradual changes if we do it now. This is an opportunity. \nBecause we have only 6 days, we are not going to be able to do it in \nthis vehicle.\n  But there is a plan going forward that our leader, Senator McConnell, \nand Senator Reid, along with a bipartisan group of Senators, have put \nforward a plan. I think we need to look towards the long term and not \nlet this opportunity pass to do something that will be enduring for the \nfiscal responsibility of our country.\n  But we have 6 days, and now we have to do something as responsible as \npossible with the time we have left and keep open the option of doing \nwhat we should be doing for the long term before the end of this year. \nThat is what Senator McConnell, Senator Reid, and many other Senators \nhave put on the table. That is what we need to try to achieve.\n  But we have made great strides. What Republicans said from the \nbeginning is, they are not going to support tax increases of any kind \nin this economic climate. Businesses are not hiring. A 9.2-percent \nunemployment rate is unacceptable. Our businesses are afraid of the \nObama health care plan and its costs. They are factoring that into \ntheir plans, and they are not hiring people because of the expense. Add \nmore tax increases on top of that and our economy is going to be \nstagnant for a long time. So tax increases are off the table.\n  But I do hope we can also make the cuts that will put us on a \nfiscally responsible plan so we will not have to address this debt \nceiling ever again.\n  So we have made a major achievement. Sometimes it seems as though \nwhen we have to come together to do something that is not ideal, we do \nnot take acknowledgment of the fact that we are making one smaller step \nin the right direction. I think in order to avoid a fiscal calamity, we \ndo need to make the strongest step we can make, which is cutting \nspending and doing it without increasing taxes.\n  The idea that we could tax our way out of debt has been totally \ndiscounted. Neither of these plans includes tax hikes to offset the \ndeficit reduction, and that is a strong endorsement. Both proposals \nalso include budget enforcement of discretionary caps by requiring \nautomatic across-the-board cuts if the caps are not met. That will put \na Governor on future spending that will keep the promise we are making \nto cut spending.\n  Both proposals establish a bipartisan committee to identify further \ndeficit reduction that would include tax reform and fix the broken \nentitlement programs. I hope we will not throw that out the window. \nHaving a commission--I know people roll their eyes and say: Oh, another \ncommission. Really?\n\n[[Page S4945]]\n\nWell, if we have a finite end date and have the opportunity to make \nmore real cuts, it is worth another chance. We do need to make \nentitlement reforms.\n  If we can do tax reform that lowers the tax rate for everyone and \nbrings in revenue by having more people hired off the unemployment \nrolls, that is a win. We raise revenue by putting more people back to \nwork. That is the way you raise revenue, not by tax increases that put \na lid on hiring.\n  So I think we have some good things that can be put together. We need \nto make sure we go forward, as much as we can with a divided Congress, \nand try to make a step in the right direction. Then, hopefully before \nthe end of the year, we will be able to take stronger steps that will \nhave a more lasting impact.\n  I, for one, think it is not even a possibility that we would allow \nthe debt ceiling to be met and start the process then of watching the \nPresident decide who gets paid and who does not.\n  I have a bill I have introduced with strong support that would make \nthe priority paying the interest on our debt and paying our soldiers, \nour men and women who have boots on the ground in harm's way. If you \nare Active-Duty military, you should not waste 1 minute thinking about \nwhether you are going to make your mortgage.\n  I want to say that I commend USAA. USAA is the corporation that \nserves so many of our military personnel. They have put out their \npolicy that in case the debt limit is reached, USAA has stated that for \nthose military members, who are on active duty and have their paychecks \ndirectly deposited into their USAA account, they are going to provide a \none-time, interest-free advance for their paycheck.\n  They also know the stresses on those members of the armed services. \nUSAA is doing a wonderful thing by putting the families of loved ones \nacross the sea fighting for our security at ease.\n  So I commend USAA. At the same time, I would like for my bill to be \npassed that assures that those military servicemembers who are not \ncustomers of USAA will also have the comfort of knowing their paychecks \nwill be there on time. So I hope if all else fails in this body, we can \npass the legislation that says we will pay our debts and we will pay \nour military and Social Security recipients will also be paid.\n  But I do not think we ought to get that far at all. That is why I am \nurging our Members to work with our leaders. Do not throw stones at our \nleaders. They have a tough job corralling 100 pretty big egos, and we \nought to be helping them get to the point where we are all comfortable \nthat we are doing the right thing. Sometimes we cannot get 100 percent \nof what we want when there are 100 people who have their individual \nideas as well.\n  So I hope we will take this chance to do so much for our country that \nwe have the opportunity to do. We may have to do it in smaller steps to \nreach that goal, but if we reach the goal, we will have secured the \nfuture for our children, and that is what we are here for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            The Debt Ceiling\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for the \nmajority leader's plan to raise the debt ceiling and reduce the \ndeficit. Our Nation, as we all know, faces a looming crisis.\n  The markets have already warned us. Businesses are already postponing \ninvestments. We know the consequences of inaction. They are \npredictable. Borrowing costs for businesses and individuals will \nescalate. Interest payments on the debt will grow. Already anemic job \ngrowth will decline. Our Nation will run the risk of another financial \ncatastrophe and possibly a return to recession. As Chairman Bernanke \nrecently stated, the outcome would be ``calamitous.''\n  Many Americans are struggling. Far too many remain out of work. They \ncannot be asked to absorb the shock waves of yet another failure to \nact. It is time, as the Senator from Texas just pointed out--and others \nhave--for both sides and both Chambers to find common ground.\n  Reasonable and responsible editorials from across the country have \nendorsed the majority leader's proposal. Well-meaning people on all \nsides have a genuine concern and have shown genuine concerns. We all--\nmost all of us--share those concerns about the implications of not \nacting.\n  There are in the other party some individuals who view themselves as \nrevolutionaries in the best sense of the word. They appear less \nconcerned with the here and now than with where they want to take the \ncountry in the future. We all understand the two are connected and that \nlooking to the future is vital to the country. The question, though, is \nthe harm that might be caused by precipitous action.\n  Columnist George Will wrote a column a few days ago likening the tea \nparty movement of today to the beginning of the Goldwater-Reagan \nconservative era; that the Goldwater movement of 1964, even though it \ndid not bring Senator Goldwater to the Presidency, was the first step \ntoward the conservative revolution that culminated in Ronald Reagan's \nelection in 1980.\n  I am going to quote a couple of sentences Mr. Will wrote:\n\n       The tea party, [which in his view is] the most welcome . . \n     . development since the Goldwater insurgency in 1964, lacks \n     only the patience necessary when America lacks the consensus \n     required to propel fundamental change. . . .\n\n  Mr. Will goes on to say:\n\n       If Washington's trajectory could be turned as quickly as \n     tea partyers wish . . . their movement would not be as \n     necessary as it is.\n\n  Those are Mr. Will's words. That is Mr. Will's considered opinion. \nThat may be so, and it may not be so. But the first rule of good \ngovernance is to do no harm. That does not mean we should not make \ncuts. That does not mean we should not look toward some of the \ndirections this debate has taken us. But it means be careful when you \nare dealing with a fragility of national policy at a time like this.\n  Some things sound better in a speech to a room full of activists than \nthey actually are in the reality of how to govern and the practicality \nof how to actually bring about change, where change is needed.\n  Senator Goldwater did not attempt to torpedo the economy in order to \nget his way. Ronald Reagan, in whose administration I proudly served, \nby the way, raised the national debt 18 times--more than any other \nPresident.\n  I fought in Vietnam as an infantry marine. I am very proud of that. \nThose of us who did fight in Vietnam all remember the regretful quote \nof one infantry officer who lamented that during one battle he had to \ncall in heavy artillery and airstrikes on a populated village; that he \nhad to destroy a village in order to save it.\n  I do not think the Republicans who are using this issue as a lever to \nbring about their view of radical change want to look back at a \nfractured economic recovery, a downgraded credit rating for the world's \nNo. 1 economy, a citizenry that has become more angry and less capable \nof predicting its own financial future, and then say, as if all of this \nwere not predictable, that they destroyed the American economy in order \nto save it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know my distinguished colleague, the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, is going to be seeking recognition, \nand perhaps others. I certainly have no objection to that. I realize we \nare on the Mueller nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding any interruption for \nother business, the Mueller vote still be at the time we originally \nplanned, which is around 4 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                          FAA Reauthorization\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, last week I came to the Senate floor \nto\n\n[[Page S4946]]\n\nask unanimous consent to pass something called--a very easy thing--a \nclean extension of the FAA bill, something the Senate has done 20 \ntimes. This is the 21st time--4 years waiting to pass a reauthorization \nbill.\n  But for the first time in these 4 years, the Republicans objected to \nthis extraordinarily routine request. Shortly, I will renew my request \nto pass our 21st short-term extension of the FAA. But before I do, I \nwant to highlight the very painful consequences of failing to pass this \nbill, which we can only do by getting a clean extension.\n  By objecting to my request last week, Republican Senators made sure \nthat 4,000 hard-working FAA employees were furloughed already. Hundreds \nof critical airport safety capacity air traffic control projects were \nbrought to a halt. Payments were stopped to hundreds of small \nbusinesses dependent upon reimbursement from the FAA for their work.\n  The Federal Government is being forced to forego almost $30 million a \nday in aviation tax revenue that is critical, obviously, to supporting \nour overall airport infrastructure program. The introduction of the \nnewest Boeing aircraft is being delayed because the FAA cannot certify \nthat the planes operate safely.\n  I know in Washington we have a tendency to view these fights as \npurely policy disagreements that have no real impact on people. I \nstress that there is an enormous effect on people and businesses, large \nand small, and on the economy of the United States. Because some \nRepublicans have refused to allow another clean extension of the FAA \nprograms, something we have done 20 times in the last 4 years, we are \ninflicting real pain on very real people.\n  People are suffering. Small businesses are hurting. We are losing \njobs and will lose a lot more. Even consumers are losing out on the \nairline ticket tax holidays.\n  The majority of the airline industry has greedily chosen to pocket \nthose revenues rather than reducing ticket prices. In other words, they \nhave a tax holiday because the expiration of the tax has already taken \nplace a number of days ago. So they are taking this tax holiday, and \nrather than leaving at the present level the cost of a ticket for \nconsumers--as Alaska Airlines is doing and Virgin Airlines is doing and \none other airline is doing--they are taking the money to themselves, \ngiving it to themselves.\n  I find that extraordinary. It reminds me of ``Too Big to Fail''--the \nmovie--the greed, the promise to help with small mortgages and they got \nall the money and didn't spend a dime to help with small mortgages.\n  The damage we are doing to our aviation system is incredibly real. If \nwe fail to act in a timely manner, it may be so devastating as to \nbecome irreversible. It makes sense when we think about it. If one were \nto operate on somebody and cut beyond a certain point, they can't \nreverse the damage.\n  With so much pain being inflicted on so many, one may ask why my \nRepublican colleagues have refused repeated requests to pass a clean \nextension--something we have done 20 times in the past 4 years.\n  They are willing, evidently, to hurt so many of these people for the \nbenefit of one company. It is called Delta Airlines. As the chairman of \nthe House Transportation Committee has stated publicly, the House \ninserted language on the Essential Air Service Program to leverage the \nSenate on including provisions relating to the National Mediation \nBoard.\n  What do I mean? What they sent to us was all about essential air \nservice. But that is not what it is about at all. The chairman, my \ncounterpart in the House told me many times that essential air service \nis not a big deal to him. He doesn't particularly have a dog in this \nhunt. We need to do some reform on it, which we offered to do. He \ndidn't mention a thing about the National Mediation Board. That is the \nonly thing that motivates the House.\n  Delta Airlines is nonunion. The other airlines, for the most part, \nare union. Delta Airlines has had four elections in the last several \nyears to unionize. Each time the company has prevailed over the union. \nSo one might ask: Why is it that they are so strongly suggesting they \nneed this National Mediation Board, which they changed in their bill.\n  It had been changed 2 years ago to say the number of votes that were \ncast were the number of votes that were reflected. In their bill, they \nwant to say that anybody who does not vote in a union certification \nelection, by definition, has voted no. I have never heard of that in \nAmerica anywhere else. It is a rather ridiculous ploy.\n  This is not policy, this is pettiness. It has become the typical ``my \nway or the highway'' thinking of the House Republicans.\n  I note that we have forgone almost $150 million in tax revenues by \nfailing to act. It will go up by about $25 million a day, which, when \nwe think about it, would come close to paying for the whole Essential \nAir Service Program anyway, in just a week or so. Again, by the end of \nthe week, we will have lost more revenue used for aviation \ninfrastructure spending than on the entire Essential Air Service \nProgram cost all of last year. It is embarrassing.\n  I wish my Republican colleagues would have defended the prerogatives \nof the Senate. Instead, some chose to back the House leadership.\n  Last week, as my friend from Utah--who is here now--outlined so \nhonestly, Senate Republicans are not permitting the Senate to pass a \nclean extension because they want the Senate to accept language \naltering 85 years of labor law and legal precedent.\n  I wish I understood why the policy objections of one company--Delta \nAirlines--mattered so much to so few and also mattered so much more \nthan the livelihood of thousands of American workers who have or will \nbe furloughed.\n  Last year, the CEO of Delta made $9 million. Whether that was a \nsalary or salary plus options, I know not. Delta paid its top \nexecutives almost $20 million. Yet it is fighting to make sure its \nemployees cannot organize--they already had four elections, and in all \nfour Delta has prevailed--for fear they may secure a few extra dollars \nin their paychecks.\n  At the same time, it is pushing for special interest provisions in \nthe FAA bill. Delta is not shy. Delta announced it was abandoning air \nservices to 26 small, rural communities--leaving many of them, \nobviously, without any air service. One only has to live in a small, \nrural community or a State such as mine to understand what that means \nand what the cost truly is.\n  Delta then had the gall to announce publicly it would seek EAS \nsubsidies to continue this service. Maybe Mr. Anderson and his \ncolleagues can forgo some of their own salaries to help subsidize the \nair service. That is not my business. Maybe they could use some of the \nmillions of dollars they are collecting in a tax holiday windfall to \npay for this service. That is not my business, but it is theirs, and it \nis shameful.\n  Let me be clear. House Republicans and their Senate allies have \nthrown nearly 4,000 FAA employees out of work already, stopped critical \nairport safety projects, hurt hundreds of small businesses, and gutted \nthe Aviation Trust Fund--or began to--so Delta Airlines--that one \ncompany--doesn't have to allow its employees to organize in a fair or \ntimely manner, if they chose to.\n  The needs of one company should not, in any deliberative body, \ndictate the safety and soundness of our aviation system. We need to \npass a clean extension that will get people back to work and businesses \nand their employees back to work and build out our airport \ninfrastructure.\n  It is so simple to pass a clean extension bill. We have done it so \noften. We have done it 20 times. The one time where there was some \npolicy attached was 2 years ago, when the House and the Senate totally \nagreed on what was in the extension, and it passed. But it is such a \nsimple thing to do. By not doing it, it is holding up our whole \nprocess.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2553\n\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that, as in legislative session, \nthe Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 109, H.R. 2553; \nthat a Rockefeller-Hutchison substitute amendment, which is at the \ndesk, be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read the third time \nand passed; and that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. I object, Madam President.\n\n[[Page S4947]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I will take a few minutes to explain why \nI am, once again, objecting to the legislation offered by my dear \nfriend from West Virginia, my Finance Committee colleague. I wish to \nmake it absolutely clear that a long-term FAA reauthorization is a \npriority for this country, and it is a personal priority for me.\n  Once again, I point out that I have worked with Chairman Baucus on \nreporting a Finance Committee title to the bill that passed the Senate \nearlier this year. The current lapse in FAA taxes and expenditures \nauthority from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund is a detrimental \nsituation brought on by the Senate majority's refusal to discontinue \ngranting excessive favors for big labor and their refusal to cut any \nwasteful spending.\n  As I have said, I share House Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee Chairman Mica's frustration that favors to organized labor \nhave overshadowed the prospects for a long-term FAA reauthorization.\n  Last year, the National Mediation Board changed the rules under which \nemployees of airlines and railroads are able to unionize. For decades, \nthe standard has been that a majority of employees would have to agree \nin an election to form a union. However, the National Mediation Board \nrules changed that standard so all it takes to unionize is a majority \nof employees voting. This means the NMB wants to count an employee who \ndoesn't vote as voting for big labor. Somehow, organized labor is able \nto claim it is democratic to appropriate someone else's vote without \nthat person's input and participation.\n  The FAA reauthorization bill that passed the House earlier this year \nundoes this heavyhanded rule and lets airline employees decide for \nthemselves how to use their own votes. The House bill would merely undo \na big partisan favor done at the behest of big labor and put efforts to \nunionize airline workforces on the same footing they have been on for \nyears.\n  The House bill does not create a new hurdle to unionization. Instead, \nit restores the longstanding ability of airline employees to make \ndecisions for themselves. The House bill only undoes the NMB action \nthat was taken to reverse 70 years of precedent for narrow political \ngain.\n  In addition to an impulse to cater to big labor, the Senate majority \nalso is resistant to any attempt to cut any government spending, no \nmatter how wasteful that spending may be. The House bill I am going to \nask unanimous consent for in a few minutes has aroused the ire of the \nmajority because it contains a provision that would limit essential air \nservice eligibility to communities that are located 90 or more miles \nfrom a large- or medium-hub airport. This would save $12.5 million a \nyear. That is right, million with an ``m'', not a ``b'' or a ``t.''\n  The majority is resisting a provision that already passed this body \nas part of the Senate's long-term reauthorization bill that would save \n$12.5 million a year, and they are willing to put the FAA's finance at \nrisk in the process. The House bill I am going to offer also contains \nan additional proposal to limit essential air service subsidies for \ncommunities where the cost per passenger is greater than $1,000. This \nprovision would affect a grand total of three airports in the whole \ncountry. It is my understanding these three airports would also have \nceased to receive EAS subsidies under another provision in the Senate-\npassed, long-term FAA bill that limited subsidies to airports averaging \n10 or more passengers a day.\n  To sum this up, our friends on the other side, the Democrats, are \nholding this up over wasteful spending and handouts for President \nObama's big union allies.\n  The point is, the Senate majority has cut the FAA off from its \nprimary source of financing and created confusion for travel companies \nand tax-paying passengers by objecting to a short-term extension \nmeasure that doesn't do one single thing that is not done by a bill \nthat passed the Senate by unanimous consent on April 7 of this year.\n  I wish to briefly discuss and hopefully clear away some of that \nconfusion. Passengers who bought tickets while the taxes were still \nbeing collected may be entitled to a refund if they are traveling \nduring a period in which the taxes have lapsed. I wish to make it clear \nthat the inability of the Senate majority to process legislation should \nnot constitute an additional burden to the already beleaguered travel \nindustry. It is the responsibility of the IRS to refund ticket taxes, \nand while I recognize they want to do the right thing for taxpayers, I \nencourage the IRS to work closely with the travel industry. The travel \nindustry is not responsible for the lapse in FAA taxes, and they should \nnot bear extra costs because of that.\n  The lack of a long-term bill is bad for airports all across the \ncountry because they don't have the funding stability to plan and \ncomplete projects. Kicking the can farther down the road is not a \nviable alternative to actually doing what is in the best interests of \nall parties.\n  As a Senate conferee to the FAA bill, I stand ready to do everything \nI can to get to work with my House and Senate colleagues on a long-term \nFAA reauthorization, as soon as they are willing to get down to work.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2553\n\n  Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2553, \nwhich was received from the House. I ask unanimous consent that the \nbill be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on \nthe Mueller nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Mueller nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, how much time remains until the vote on \nthe Mueller nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I hope all Senators will step forward and \nvote for this nomination. I can think of no reason why they should not. \nDirector Mueller is typical of many in our government who serve the \npeople of America tirelessly, without any gain to themselves but \ninstead for what is best for all Americans and for our \ncountry. Director Mueller has worked--along with the thousands of \nindividuals at the Department of Justice and the FBI who work around \nthe clock every day to keep America safe to protect us from crime and \nto protect us from terrorists. Unfortunately some people try to lump \ntogether and deride government employees. The fact is the people at the \nFBI and Department of Justice are very brave men and women, many of \nwhom put their lives on the line for us day by day, and we ought to \nacknowledge that.\n\n  Bob Mueller is the public face of the FBI, as its long-serving \nDirector. Amazingly, he and Ann, his wife of many years, along with \ntheir grown children, are able to separate that their private life from \nthe public life. Like so many who serve this country, Director \nMueller's public life takes an inordinate amount of his time, and I \nthink it is a testament to his dedication that he was willing to do \nthis job for another two years, but it is also important to acknowledge \nthe sacrifice of his wife Ann and his children. I think all Americans \nshare in the good fortune that when the President asked Director \nMueller to step forward and serve for another 2 years, he answered the \ncall.\n  I also want to compliment President Obama. He knew he had the \nopportunity to name somebody who would be there as long as he, Barack \nObama, may be President, whether he serves one term or two, and beyond. \nInstead, the President, as he has often done, did what he thought was \nbest for the country.\n  Director Mueller is a fine public servant, and I would urge all \nSenators to vote ``aye'' on this nomination.\n  Madam President, how much time remains?\n\n[[Page S4948]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I see no one else seeking the floor, so I \nyield back the remainder of the time, which is now about 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have spoken several times over the last \nseveral weeks with regard to the issue at hand. Clearly, the time \ncontinues to escape us, and the day of reckoning is coming in regard to \nthe debt ceiling issue. I have said from the very beginning that in my \nview it would be irresponsible not to raise the debt ceiling, but it \nwould be as irresponsible if not more so to raise the debt ceiling \nwithout reducing the spending, getting our books more in balance, and \nmoving us in the right direction toward a balanced budget in the \nfuture. I recognize this cannot be accomplished overnight, and I \nrecognize there are those who bring different points of view and \nperspectives to the Senate floor. This is a body of people who \nrepresent individuals who live in all 50 States and have points of view \nand philosophies and backgrounds that are different than perhaps the \nconstituents I represent from the State of Kansas.\n  I have been a strong supporter of the legislation entitled ``cut, \ncap, and balance.'' I actually believe it is not just cut, cap, and \nbalance; it is cut, cap, balance, and grow. We could do so much for our \ncountry both in the fiscal sense and with the idea that we could better \npay our bills if the revenues are increased by putting people to work, \nby creating a climate in which people could find jobs, people could \nimprove their situation in regard to their jobs, and in the process of \ndoing that the revenues increase to the Federal Treasury.\n  It was back in the days of President Clinton that we came the closest \nto having our books balanced. While there was spending restraint and \ndisagreement among Republicans and Democrats about new spending \nprograms or bigger government, in my view, the real reason we had a \nbalanced budget was because the economy was growing.\n  So I again ask my colleagues to pay attention to what I believe was \nthe message of the 2010 election: It is the economy. It is the desire \nof people to have a better life, to save money for their children's \neducation, to save money for their retirement, and to be satisfied that \nthe job they have today is the job they will have tomorrow.\n  I believe there is much that we can do with regard to the regulatory \nenvironment, making the Tax Code fair and certain, issues regarding \naccess to credit, a trade policy that will allow us to increase \nexports--both agricultural and manufactured goods--and a trade policy \nthat reduces our reliance on foreign energy and gives us greater \ncontrol over its costs. But the time has come for us to reach an \nagreement, and we anxiously await what action the House of \nRepresentatives may take.\n  In light of this point in time, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues in the Senate an e-mail I received from one of my \nconstituents, a Kansan named Gina Reynolds. Gina is from Shawnee. She \nexpresses this point of view I think very appropriately for where we \nare today. In asking Gina if I could share with you what she wrote to \nme, she indicated this was the very first time she had ever written a \nMember of Congress. Here is what she had to say that I hope we will \ntake into account. Again, while we bring philosophies and viewpoints \nand approaches to government to Washington, DC, there is an opportunity \nfor common sense and good judgment to prevail.\n  Here is what she says:\n\n       I firmly believe the United States needs to start living \n     within our means. However, I am frustrated beyond belief with \n     the inability of Congress to do their jobs and ensure that we \n     do not throw the country back into recession. While I and my \n     husband are employed, we feel lucky to have jobs. We work \n     hard, pay our taxes and try to raise our children the right \n     way. It absolutely boggles my mind that we cannot come to a \n     compromise on the debt ceiling issue that is so critical to \n     the financial markets and the average American citizen.\n       For it is us, the middle class, that will suffer the most; \n     from lost jobs, to lost 401Ks, and lost savings. We need real \n     tax reform, real entitlement reform (for even though I am 42 \n     years old, I do not believe I will ever see a dime of Social \n     Security) and real spending cuts. Congress has had months to \n     work on this issue, and now the time is to act in the best \n     interests of the People, not the political interest groups, \n     not some ideology.\n\n  It is sad to say, but I honestly don't know if my children will have \na better future than me. I know that there are a lot of tough decisions \nyet to be made regarding spending and taxes, but we only make it harder \nby defaulting on any of our country's obligations. I am fiscally \nconservative and generally vote Republican, but I do not blindly follow \nany one path. I try to use my vote wisely and pledge my loyalty to my \nGod and my country, not a political party.\n\n[[Page S4949]]\n\n  I believe we have the greatest country on Earth, but our inability to \ncompromise, to stop acting like spoiled children, saddens me. The \nFounding Fathers were able to compromise and write a document that has \nstood the test of time for 235 years. Can we not now do the same? \nPlease do the right thing for the American People, the ones frustrated \nand angry and hurt by this self-produced impasse.\n  I thank Gina Reynolds for her message to me and Members of the \nSenate, for taking the time to communicate with her Senator, with me as \na Member of Congress. I think she in many ways expresses a conservative \nyet commonsense point of view so many Kansans have.\n  I often think too many times we are caught in a circumstance that we \nfind an inability to resolve. Sometimes we are trapped by our political \nparty. In my view, while we ought to have strong opinions and ought to \nhave a solid philosophy, we need to make certain that we are motivated \nfor the right reasons and that the good of America is at the forefront \nof our minds.\n  I indicated in my maiden speech when I spoke here on the Senate floor \n4 months ago as a new Senator that when I need a perspective as to what \nwe need to do here--and sometimes we get bogged down in those things \nthat are a lot less important--I will put my walking shoes on, my \nrunning shoes, and I will walk up to the Lincoln Memorial. You go by \nthe World War II Memorial, you walk on past the Vietnam Wall, and you \nwalk by the Korean War Memorial, and in each one of those locations, I \nam reminded that no American memorialized in those settings fought and \ndied, sacrificed for their country for purposes of Republicans or \nDemocrats but because they believed they had an obligation to serve our \ncountry and because they believed that in that service, they had the \nopportunity to make life better for their family and for future \ngenerations of Americans. We need to remind ourselves that we need that \nperspective. It is not a fight between the Republicans and Democrats. \nIt is about doing what is right for America. We owe it to those who \nsacrificed in military service for our country, and particularly those \nwho have died in that service, we will do what is right. I know my \ncolleagues share that point of view. I think from time to time we have \nto be reminded about what the priorities have to be, what the focus \nmust be.\n\n  Again, I appreciate the sentiments expressed by this Kansan and would \nindicate that we, as American citizens, and certainly me, as a Member \nof the Senate, our primary responsibility as citizens is to make \ncertain we pass on to the next generation of Americans this country \ncalled the United States of America in which we maintain the freedoms \nand liberties guaranteed by our Constitution and we allow the next \ngeneration of Americans, our children, our grandchildren, and young men \nand women yet to be born, people we don't even know, the opportunity to \npursue the American dream.\n  I think this Kansas constituent of mine expressed those sentiments \nvery well, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to see that \nwe do what is right for the future of our Nation and that this next \ngeneration of Americans can pursue that which we all idolize and \nbelieve in, the American dream.\n  I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, let me, first of all, compliment my \nfriend and colleague, the Senator from Kansas, for his comments and for \nhis approach. He made a few comments we haven't heard much of in this \nChamber or in the other Chamber in the last few days. He said before he \nwas a Democrat and before he was a Republican, he was an American. I \nwant to compliment him on those sentiments, and I want to rise in that \nsame vein because whether you are somebody from Kansas or somebody from \nNorth Carolina or folks I hear from Virginia who keep saying to me: Why \ncan't you guys get this thing done? Why can't you both be willing to \ngive a little to put our country first? As somebody who has had the \nhonor of serving as Governor of Virginia and somebody who served as a \nbusinessman for 20 years, I never thought that I would be standing on \nthe floor of the Senate 6 days, 5\\1/2\\ days away from the United States \nof America potentially defaulting on our obligations. Yet most of the \ndebate and, Lord knows, almost all of the press conferences have been \nless about solutions and more about who is to blame.\n  Whether they are sitting in the gallery or they are watching at home \nor, like most Americans, trying to get through an unbearably hot \nsummer, they wonder who are these folks they hired to get the people's \nbusiness done.\n  I have been involved with a group of Senators over the last 9 months \nwho have done something I didn't think was extraordinary, but \nunfortunately today is pretty extraordinary. There is a group of \nDemocratic and Republican Senators who have said the most important \nissue we face in our country is to get our debt and deficit under \ncontrol, and who have said that the only way we can get that under \ncontrol is to sit together for hours on end, reason together, argue, \nand do something as basically American as compromise.\n  After months and months of going back and forth, last Tuesday, when \nwe revealed the so-called plan--which, frankly, the Gang of 6 has built \nupon the work of a previous year's work of Democrats, Republicans, \nIndependents, and business leaders, the President's deficit \ncommission--a remarkable thing happened for a couple of days in this \nbody. Instead of everybody coming out and saying why this couldn't \nhappen, they said: Hey, this isn't perfect, but this would actually \nlower our deficit by close to $4 trillion, take on tax reform, take on \nentitlement reform, and cut spending. It might just be a path out.\n  Well, that lasted a couple of days, and then we got back to who was \ngoing to score points in the next 24-hour news segment.\n  Well, I desperately hope and pray that at this moment in our country \nwe will rise to the task and make sure, with the eyes of not only the \nNation but the world on us, that we do our basic job. Let's make sure \nthe United States of America doesn't default next Tuesday.\n  The only way I think we are going to get there is if we lower the \nrhetoric, lower the finger-pointing, and recognize it is going to take \nideas from both sides. It is going to take a change in attitude from \nsome.\n  There is a Congressman who gave a press conference sometime in the \nlast day or two who paraphrased Winston Churchill. He said:\n\n       We're going to fight you on the beaches. We're going to \n     fight you at sea. We're going to fight you in the air to make \n     structural changes in the way this place known as Washington, \n     DC, operates.\n\n  Who is the ``you'' he is going to fight? Is he going to fight people \nwho say maybe America and Americans want us to actually work together \nand compromise? I mean, this kind of sentiment goes beyond the pale in \na moment when our Nation is in this kind of crisis.\n  There has been a lot of talk recently--particularly coming from the \nother body--that the only way to solve this problem is an amendment, a \nconstitutional amendment. Well, I would point out 49 States have that \nkind of amendment. They have to balance their books. My State, \nVirginia, and the Presiding Officer's State, North Carolina, meet that \ngoal. There are an awful lot of States that have that kind of amendment \nin place. I don't know what kind of accounting they use, but I have not \nheard many folks point to the California State budget and say: That is \na balanced budget.\n  So some kind of process argument isn't going to solve the problem. We \nhave to make the hard choices. We have to cut spending. We have to \nreform our entitlements. We have to reform our Tax Code to generate \nadditional revenues.\n  The numbers don't lie. We are spending at an all-time high, 25 \npercent of our GDP. We are collecting revenues at only 15 percent of \nGDP. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out any time our \nNation's budget has been in relative balance is when we have been with \nspending and revenues at 19.5 percent to 20.5 percent. Why can't we \ncome together to put a plan in place that does that?\n  Folks who are watching are saying: Well, there is actually a plan. \nMore than one-third of the Senate has said: We will be with you--about \nan equal\n\n[[Page S4950]]\n\nnumber of Democrats and Republicans. But instead we are going back and \nforth, ping-pong, who is going to have which plan? Who is going to win \neach day? It is also pretty remarkable at this moment in time--I don't \nknow who this Congressman is, but when we have roughly one-fifth of the \nHouse who at least on record saying they will never vote to increase \nthe debt limit, I wonder when they took the oath to uphold the laws of \nour country, which said we have to pay our bills, how that commitment \nmatches with those promises or those political positions.\n  My sense is they want to have an amendment to the Constitution. What \nthey are advocating, this we will never change, our way or the highway \napproach, the amendment they ought to talk about is basically \nrestructuring our whole Constitution and turning our government into a \nparliamentary system. There are a lot of places around that if you win \nan election, you get to choose the chief executive. You get to control \nthe legislature. You can pass anything you want. Yet these very same \nfolks are the ones who say they want to support the Constitution.\n  Well, the Constitution and the genius of our Constitution was the \nfact that the Founders said the most basic American principle was \nchecks and balances. We have a House, we have a President, and actually \nthey have to work together. Somehow the attitude of some of these \nMembers in the House, do it our way or let's drive our country over the \ncliff, is dramatically as un-American as anything I have ever seen.\n  At the same time, we hear other Members who say: Maybe we just need a \nlittle more economic shock to make us do the right thing. What are \nthese folks thinking of? The stock market closed down 200 points today. \nIt has been down about 400 points this week. There are an awful lot of \nAmericans who only now are starting to recover from the financial \ncrisis of 2 years ago. There are an awful lot of retirees who saw their \n401(k)s plummet 2 years ago, who slowly have seen that nest egg that is \ngoing to get them through rough times recover.\n  Now 400 points--how much more stock market decline do we need before \nwe all have the courage to do the right thing, 1,000 points? Do we need \nto put another 1 million Americans out of work? Do we need to throw \nmore people out of their homes because of the tax increase that will \nresult--the real increase that will result with the rise in interest \nrates that will happen next week?\n  There are others who say: Let's do it short term. Let's kick the can \ndown the road for a short while, something that is being discussed in \nthe House. It doesn't matter whether it is Democrat or Republican. It \nmatters because that approach will result in a lowering of our debt \nrating. I know people's eyes glaze over when they hear about debt \nratings. Unfortunately, debt ratings matter--and we are the only \ncountry in the world with a AAA debt rating. That means we are kind of \nthe gold standard.\n  If we have that debt rating reduced, it is not only a black eye for \nAmerica, it not only means that what we have to pay in interest rates \nwill go up, not just for government but if you have a school bond, if \nyou have a State bond, the prices are going to go up. You have an auto \nloan, a home mortgage, you have a student loan, you are a business \ntrying to expand, the cost of that is all going to go up.\n  The very same folks who say they will never look at raising more \nrevenues don't seem to mind at all that if we have to have an interest \nrate rise because of a default or downgrade of our debt, doesn't that \ntake more money out of Americans' pockets? I just don't get it.\n  Frankly, as the Presiding Officer knows, I have been pretty obsessed \nabout this issue for months on end. I hope that we will check our \nDemocratic and Republican hats and go with what my colleague, the \nSenator from Kansas, said and recognize when we get out of bed tomorrow \nmorning we get out of bed as Americans, not as Democrats or \nRepublicans; that we not only get over the debt limit, which, \nhopefully, through some convoluted process we will, but we also \nrecognize that getting past August 2 doesn't mean, OK, we are done, \neverybody go have a nice August. All that does is buy us a bit of time \nto decide whether we are going to come back to the really hard issues \nof not only how we start with some spending cuts, which will be part of \nour down payment, but how we really make sure the entitlement \nprograms--important to so many of us on both sides of the aisle, but \nparticularly on this side of the aisle--are actually there 10, 20, 30 \nyears from now.\n  The notion that they are not going to change, that they cannot \ncontinue to be sustainable at the current rate, it is not Democratic or \nRepublican.\n  Thank goodness a lot of us are living a lot longer. When I was a kid \nthere were 15, 16 people paying in for every Social Security retiree. \nNow there are 3. We have to make sure that for my kids, your kids, that \nthere is Social Security in their framework. At the same time we have \nto have our colleagues on the Republican side recognize that we have to \nreform our Tax Code in a way that makes it simpler, flatter, and, yes, \ngenerates some additional revenue.\n  The only way we are going to get there, if and when we get past this \nAugust 2 date, is if we combine that effort with long-term debt \nreduction. I am more than open to any valid, balanced comprehensive \nbipartisan plan that is around.\n  For the effort of the so-called Gang of 6, a third of the Senate \nsaid, yes, this is worth considering. It isn't perfect, I can assure \nyou. Some would even say, from some of the descriptions I have heard, \nthat it may not meet all of those. But I will tell my colleagues three \nthings it is: It is comprehensive, bipartisan, and, under any analysis, \nit does what our country desperately needs: It starts to drive our \ndebt-to-GDP ratio in the right direction, which is a fancy way of \nsaying we can maintain our books on a path to lead us to fiscal \nstability. Frankly, what that would also allow us to do is get back to \nwhat we should be spending our time on, which is creating growth in \nthis economy and starting to unleash American creativity and \ninnovation. But that is not going to happen if we spend all of our time \npointing fingers back and forth about how we got here or which short-\nterm plan best meets the short-term interests of the next 5 or 6 days.\n\n  I, for one, believe the plan Senator Reid has laid out is not \nperfect, but it gives us the time to deal with this debt and deficit \nproblem in a serious way. It gives us the ability to ensure that we \ndon't have a credit downgrade. Unfortunately, the plan being debated in \nthe House right now may have some merits, but the one thing that is \nclear is that it will lead to a downgrade--not my words, but the words \nof all the rating agencies. Whether we like them or not, they are the \nfolks who set that standard.\n  Again, I urge folks who are making statements such as ``We are going \nto fight you on the beaches, we are going to fight you at sea, we are \ngoing to fight you in the air,'' to consider your fellow Americans \nhere. If you don't like our system of government, then be honest and \npropose a change to a parliamentary system. If you do honor and respect \nthe Constitution which we all took an oath to uphold, recognize that it \nis a Constitution that puts in place checks and balances to have us all \nwork together, give a little, and recognize that when we get out of bed \nin the morning, we are not a Democrat or a Republican but an American \nfirst and foremost.\n  I hope and pray we will find the path through these next 5 days and \nthat we won't do the unthinkable. I have said on a couple of \noccasions--I am sure it will come back and bite me--that if we don't do \nthis we should all get fired, because the fact is the most basic \npromise we make is to uphold the laws and rules of our country. \nFrankly, I can't think of anything that is more quintessentially \nAmerican than making sure we pay our bills and that we honor our \nobligations. So let's get that done, and then let's work together to \nmake sure we put in place the long-term, comprehensive, bipartisan \napproach that is needed so we can get this Nation back on the right \nfiscal path but, more importantly, back on the right path to ensure \nthat everybody gets that fair shot for that economic growth we all seek \nso much.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Mr. President, we have a lot in front of us as a nation. \nOur perception is that our country is anxious, and I think it has good \nreason to be anxious, but it doesn't have anything to do with the debt \nceiling debate. It should be anxious because we are not listening. We \nare not paying attention to the anxiety and fear and worry that the \ncountry they know and the freedoms and liberties they have are slipping \naway from them. They are slipping away because we are putting America \ninto debtor's prison. We are slowly losing our ability to make free \nchoices about our future because we failed to be responsible in the \npast with the money the American people have given us.\n  We have had a lot of debates and a lot of statements over the last \ncouple of weeks, but no one ever talks about what the real problem is. \nThe real problem is we are spending money on things with good \nintentions that don't accomplish their purposes. We are spending money \nwe don't have on things we don't absolutely need, and the programs we \ndo have, we fail to oversee to see that they are running both \nefficiently and effectively. As a consequence, we find ourselves in the \nmidst of an economic downturn with a $1.5 trillion to $1.6 trillion \ndeficit, borrowing $4 billion a day. That means every day and a half, \nwe borrow more money than the State of Oklahoma spends in a year. We \nhear all of the political speeches and all of the fingerpointing, but \nwe don't hear the real solutions to our problem.\n  Let me explain what I mean. Everybody agrees we are going to have to \nmake some cuts, but not everybody is honest about the numbers \nassociated with those cuts. Everybody agrees we are going to have to \ntighten our belt, but nobody wants to offer specifically where to \ntighten our belt. What I wish to do today is offer specific places \nwhere the government today--right today, in this body and the one \nacross the Capitol--could make a big difference in the outcome of our \nfuture by cutting specific programs this week and next week.\n  That is the one rare thing we never hear in Washington. Everybody \nsays we need to cut, but when it gets down to talking about what to \ncut, nobody wants to come up with any cogent ideas because they don't \nwant to take the political heat, because every program, no matter how \nwell intended and how inefficient, has those people who are going to \nfight for that program because it has money coming into the coffers for \nsomething.\n  The other point I wish to make is the reason we are anxious and the \nreason we are worried is we have abandoned the very principles our \nFounders gave us that would keep us healthy, and that was the \nConstitution and its enumerated powers section, which spelled out very \nsuccinctly what was our responsibility and what was the States' \nresponsibility.\n  So we have whole departments. One, for example, would be the \nDepartment of Education that Thomas Jefferson said if we ever have the \nFederal Government doing anything on education, we would have to change \nthe Constitution. That is a direct quote of his. He was one of our \nFounders. He, as well as Madison and Monroe and others, wrote \nextensively about what their intentions were in the Federalist Papers. \nYet we have allowed ourselves to be walked, like in a dream state, into \nthe contention that the Constitution does not make any difference and \nthat it would, in fact, if we paid attention to it, limit our \nopportunities for the mistakes we have made. The mistakes we have \nmade--though well-intentioned--are that we can be the answer for every \nproblem in America. We cannot.\n  What made our country great was self-reliance, individual freedom and \ninitiative, personal responsibility and accountability. That is what \nbuilt our country, in a system that said: If, in fact, you work hard, \nthe opportunity is there for you to gain, for you and those you love. \nNow we have a government that at every place, for every decision that \nis for the economic benefit of those individuals who would grab that \ndream, they are confronted with layers upon layers of bureaucracy, with \nrules and regulations, to the point where no longer are they presumed \ninnocent by the Federal Government, they are presumed guilty, and they \nhave to prove themselves innocent to the bureaucracy to be able to \naccomplish that which would set them free, that which would put them \nahead, that which would establish an opportunity to gain the wealth \nthis country promised.\n  I put forward a week ago last Monday $9 trillion in potential cuts. \nNow, I know people are not all going to agree with me, but every one of \nthese cuts is backed up with a government study that says what we are \ndoing in these programs is not effective. Whether it is the \nCongressional Research Service, the inspector generals, the Government \nAccountability Office, OMB, or the Congressional Budget Office, there \nare over 3,000 footnotes to the 600 pages that are in here that explain \nvery well why we should not be doing this $9 trillion worth of stuff.\n  I understand we can have a great debate on whether, one, it is our \nconstitutional responsibility. Some of it certainly is when it comes to \ndefense. No. 2, we can have a great debate on what we think are \npriorities, those things that fit within the Constitution that are our \nresponsibility. But we cannot debate the facts of the outright waste, \nthe outright fraud, the outright abuse, and the outright duplication of \nmultiple sets of programs.\n  This is far from a complete list, as shown in this chart. But over \nthe next 10 years, we could save $150 billion to $200 billion just by \neliminating duplicative programs. We have over 100 programs on surface \ntransportation. That is 100 sets of bureaucracies, 100 offices, 100 \nsets of regulations, 100 sets of rules. The question we ought to ask \nis, If we have responsibility on surface transportation, why in the \nworld do we have 100 different programs?\n  We have 82 teacher improvement and training programs run by the \nFederal Government. Nobody will come down here and answer me why. It is \nindefensible we have it. Yet nobody will come down here and join me to \neliminate it. We have to be asking the question: Do we have good reason \nto be anxious when we will not do the obvious?\n  We have over 180 economic development programs, but we have 88 \neconomic development programs that we spend $6.8 billion a year on run \nby four separate agencies, and not one of them has a study that shows \nthey are effective in developing economic activity--not one of them. So \nwhy would we continue to send money into programs with good intentions \nthat are not working? Yet we have over 180 of them, 88 within four \ndepartments. We have not been able to find all the rest of them, but we \nknow they exist.\n  That is 88 sets of bureaucrats, well-intentioned Federal Government \nworkers doing what this Congress and Congresses before us have told \nthem to do but not accomplishing the purpose for which that money--\nalmost $7 billion a year--is sent.\n  We have 80 other separate programs for transportation assistance. You \nsee the little community vehicles, the ones to help those who have a \ndisability. Why do we have 80 separate programs? Nobody can answer \nthat. It is easy to figure out how they happen. They are well-\nintentioned. We ought to help people who cannot get around. The \nquestion that ought to be asked is, Is that a State responsibility or a \nFederal responsibility? If it is a Federal responsibility--that is \ndebatable, but if it is, why would we have 80 separate programs?\n  We have 56 different programs run by seven different agencies to \nteach Americans financial literacy. We have to ask ourselves the \nquestion: How can a government that is running a $1.6 trillion deficit \nand has $14 trillion of debt--and our debt-to-GDP ratio is 100 \npercent--how do we have any authority to teach anybody about financial \nliteracy? That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, where is it in the Constitution that we are responsible for \nteaching people financial literacy? That is both a State function, a \ncity function, and a\n\n[[Page S4952]]\n\nfamily function. Yet we have 56 programs, and not one of them has a \nmetric to study whether it is effective--not one of them.\n  Job training: We spent $18.8 billion on job training this last year. \nWe have 47 different programs. The Government Accountability Office \nsays, of those 47 programs, all of them overlap except 3. So based on \nthe study of the people we pay to study this, the most we should have \nis 4 job training programs. And we are going to spend almost $19 \nbillion on that? Here is what we know. The results cannot justify that \nwe are spending the money because the results do not show performance. \nYet we are spending $18 billion.\n  We have 20 different programs for homeless assistance and prevention. \nThat is a great role. We all want to help the homeless. We want to do \nwhatever we can to get them in a stable situation, to assist them. But \n20 different programs? Why would we do that? Why wouldn't we have one? \nAnd why wouldn't only the one program be administered through a State \nif, in fact, it is our role? I happen to think that is the State of \nOklahoma's role to take care of the homeless people in Oklahoma, not \nthe Federal Government's. But if it is the Federal Government's role, \nwhy would we have 20 programs?\n  Food for the hungry: 18 separate programs, 5 different agencies. \nAgain, I am all for helping those people who need to have food. Why \nwould we have 18 sets of bureaucracies, 18 different sets of rules--18 \ndifferent sets? And 2 of these actually work; 16 do not, but we have \nnot eliminated them. We are still sending the money out the door.\n  Disaster response and preparedness inside FEMA: Just for disaster \nresponse and preparedness, there are 17 programs just inside FEMA. That \ndoes not count all the disaster response and preparedness programs in \nall the other government agencies. That is just inside FEMA. We have to \nask the questions: What are we doing? One, what have we done in the \npast? And what are we going to do about the problems that are in front \nof us today?\n  So I would propose that we are off base, and we have a good reason to \nbe anxious about us because we will not address these problems. When we \nbring amendments to the floor, they get routinely defeated. Why is \nthat? Is it that we are being dishonest about the facts or is it we are \nprotecting the politicians so they are not attacked by the very people \nwho are benefiting indirectly--not directly, but indirectly--from these \nprograms, the bureaucracies and the other quasi-governmental agencies \nthat feed off these programs?\n  So where do we go to start fixing this $1.6 trillion deficit? I had \nsome wonderful employees of the Social Security Administration come to \nme about a year and a half ago, and they said--and they wanted to \nremain anonymous; and I understand why--they said our disability \nprogram is broken. We are giving disability checks to thousands of \npeople every year who are not disabled.\n  So we started looking at it in the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, and here is what we found. If we take veterans totally \nout of the mix--this does not apply to veterans--1 in 18 people in this \ncountry today is collecting a disability check.\n\n  As a physician, I have done all sorts of disability examinations. \nWhat we are finding is about 40 percent of the people who are on \ndisability are not disabled because the law says to be disabled in this \ncountry, and to receive a check from the rest of us for that \ndisability, there can be no job in the economy they can do.\n  Yet we have judges who never deny anybody when they come through the \ndisability program. We have people on disability who are working full \ntime at other jobs. Once they are eligible for a disability check, 2 \nyears after that they are eligible for health care.\n  So now we have undermined the system that was designed to help the \ntruly disabled by having thousands upon thousands upon thousands of \npeople collecting a disability check, which means there is not going to \nbe a check for somebody else.\n  The disability trust fund, which we pay into when we work--as well as \nSSI, which is a separate fund that comes just from our tax dollars--is \nbelly up. Next year, the Social Security disability trust fund runs out \nof money. The reason it is running out of money is the Social Security \nsystem does not say: If you were disabled and now you are not, why are \nyou still taking the money when you are back at work? They do not do \ntheir job because the leadership at Social Security does not demand \nthat the job is being done.\n  So we have significant ways of improving that to make sure we are \nhelping those people who are truly disabled. But we cannot get anybody \nto help us get that law passed. To say we want to clean up Social \nSecurity disability does not mean we do not care about the people who \nare disabled. It means we care about those who are going to be disabled \nin the future, so we will have a dollar to help them when that need \narises for them.\n  So it is just one of those areas. It has not been looked at in 25 \nyears. The Social Security system--once you are on, you are on. They \nrarely take anybody off. The fraud associated with collecting a \ndisability check and working for cash in our economy--and working not \nfor cash, even working full-blown jobs--we had three instances where we \nhad the Government Accountability Office film people, two of whom \nactually worked as salaried employees for the Federal Government, who \nwere collecting disability at the same time they were collecting checks \nfrom the Federal Government as a Federal employee. And it is not small; \nit is big.\n  So there is $60 billion over 10 years that we could save just by \nreforming the Social Security disability system. That does not say we \ndo not want to help people who are disabled. It says we want to do the \nbest for our country and help those people who are disabled. But we \nhave undermined self-reliance. We have found people who want to take \nadvantage of our charity and love and care. So, therefore, they cheat \nthe system. We have an incompetent bureaucracy that does not take them \noff the system, and we have an incompetent system of jurisprudence \nwithin the Social Security Administration that puts people on who \nshould never be on. But the attack comes that we do not care about \npeople if, in fact, we want to fix this program.\n  Social Security: Everybody says do not touch Social Security. This \nCongress and the Congress before it has stolen $2.5 trillion from the \nmoney we put into Social Security. They have written a little, bitty \nIOU note and said: Well, when you need the money, we will pay it back.\n  What does that mean? That means the full faith and credit of this \ncountry has to be good enough that when we get ready to pay the $2.5 \ntrillion back, we can borrow the money at an acceptable interest rate \nto be able to pay it back.\n  So what do the Social Security Administration trustees say we need to \ndo? They say we have to make it sustainable. And, oh, by the way, \nwouldn't it be nice if the poorest people on Social Security could get \na little bump so we could help those who are truly dependent on it and \nmake it sustainable so we never have to discuss Social Security again? \nEven with the baby boomers, we ought to do that.\n  So what we have done is designed a solvent path over 75 years based \non Social Security where we are likely to achieve it. We did not raise \nanybody's taxes. We help those the most who are in need the most, and \nfor those who are the most well off, we said: You cannot have quite as \nmuch. In other words, we means tested it.\n  We said: If you are very wealthy, you will eventually get your money \nout, but not like everybody else will. The people who need it the most, \nwe are going to help the most. It alters the retirement age just to go \nalong with life expectancy. It does not alter life. It alters that 2 \nyears over 60 years.\n  But the fact is, our life expectancy is far advanced from what it was \nwhen we first started Social Security.\n  When we first started, we had almost 50 people working for everybody \nwho is on Social Security. Now we have less than five, and it is not \ngoing to be long where we are going to have less than three. It is not \nsustainable unless we change that. So the point is, I understand Social \nSecurity is important to people in this country. But if we do not \nchange it, in 2035, we are going to get two-thirds of the benefits you \nput in. We are not going to get any more than that.\n  So do we fix it now and make it sustainable forever or do we just \nwait until it goes belly up, knowing we cannot borrow the $2.5 trillion \nthat was\n\n[[Page S4953]]\n\nstolen from it and let it go belly up? The typical politician says: I \ndo not want to do that because I do not want to take the heat to have \nto explain that to people on Social Security or coming on Social \nSecurity.\n  I do not have any problems trying to explain it. It is the right \nthing for us to do. We have to fix it, and we can fix it, if, in fact, \nwe are going to save our country. That is one of the things we have to \ndo to make sure the people who buy our bonds, loan us the money, \nrecognize we have a salvageable situation. Ignoring Social Security--it \nis our second biggest issue now, other than health care--it is our \nsecond biggest issue. To ignore it and not fix it says we will not be \nable to borrow the money for it or anything else.\n  Let me spend a minute going through a couple things we can do next \nweek that would save a lot of money--not hard, not controversial. The \nquestion America ought to ask is, Why have we not already done it? Let \nme give some examples. We ought to quit paying unemployment \ncompensation to millionaires. Do you realize last year we paid $20 \nmillion out in unemployment compensation to people who were making $1 \nmillion that year. Is that nuts or what?\n  Unemployment is to help those people who are in need who are \nunemployed. It is not to give money to people who do not need it \nbecause they are unemployed. Yet we spent almost $20 million last year \npaying people unemployment compensation who made $1 million last year.\n  We could save $1 billion over 10 years if we quit making payments to \ndead people. You say: Oh well, you do not make payments to dead people. \nYes, we do--$100 million a year that bureaucracies pay to people who \nare dead and a good portion of it we never get back. It is gone. We do \nnot follow that up.\n  We know we can save $5 billion a year minimum--minimum--if we just \neliminated some of the overlapping programs I talked about. That is a \nvery conservative estimate. It is probably more akin to $25 billion a \nyear. But let's say it is one-fifth of that--$5 billion a year. That is \n$50 billion. That would keep us from borrowing money for 14 days just \nby eliminating duplication in government programs.\n  We could eliminate $2 billion over 10 years by eliminating sweetheart \ncontracts and bonuses to contractors who work for the Federal \nGovernment who do not earn their bonuses. Yes, we do that. We pay \nbonuses to people who both do not perform and do not perform on time. \nYou would not do it. If someone came in to do something for you on a \nfixed price with a bonus based on quality and time and they did not \nmeet it, you would not pay them the bonus. But your Federal Government \ndoes anyway.\n  We could save $1 billion over 10 years by collecting unpaid taxes \nowed to us by our own Federal employees. Taxes that are owed, they have \nbeen adjudicated, there is nothing else going on, it is final, it is \nset, but we do not take the money out of their pay. That number is \ngrowing every year, the amount of money they owe.\n  We could save $3.82 billion by reducing the amount of money Congress \nspends on itself by just 15 percent. Would it be too much to ask of the \nCongress to tighten its belt by 15 percent and save 1 day's borrowing? \nNo. I turn back, on average, about $500,000 to $600,000 a year on what \nis allocated to my Senate office. I do not do that to be able to say I \ndo it; I do it because I do not need it because I know how to run an \noffice efficiently and pay people effectively. But the fact is, we have \ntoo big a budget, and we need to trim it. We need to lead by example.\n  We could save $480 million a year just by having HRSA, the Health \nResources and Services Administration, pay the right prices for drugs \nin their programs versus paying too high prices--prices higher than \nwhat they contracted for. One-half billion dollars does not sound like \nmuch. But $\\1/2\\ billion over 10 years, that is $5 billion. That is one \nthree-hundredths of what our problem is right now in terms of the \ndeficit.\n  We could save $5 billion by eliminating unnecessary government \nprinting. We could do that tomorrow--$5 billion.\n  We could get $15 billion back by getting rid of unnecessary \ngovernment buildings we are not using, that are costing us $8 billion a \nyear to maintain. I cannot remember the exact number. I think we have \n63,000 facilities right now the Federal Government owns--63,000 that \nare underutilized or not utilized at all. That is 12,000 more than we \nhad 2 years ago, and we are signing new leases for buildings all the \ntime and abandoning the buildings the government owns.\n  The Federal Government should dispose of excess property within 5 \nyears. According to President Obama's own administration, we could \nsave, at a minimum, $15 billion. Every time we have tried to do this, \nsomebody stops it in the Senate.\n  We can end subsidies for ethanol blending. We voted on it, had 74 \nSenators vote on it, but it did not happen. That is $2 billion we could \nsave this year if we passed it tomorrow. We can decrease the number of \nlimousines owned by the Federal Government, save $115 million. We could \nreduce the Federal vehicle fleet, $5.6 billion.\n  The Federal Government--you will not believe this number--the Federal \nGovernment owns 662,000 cars--662,000. The average mileage on them is \nless than 20,000 miles. The fleet has grown by 5 percent and the cost \nof maintaining and servicing the fleet has grown over 25 percent in the \nlast 2 years--$4.6 billion a year just maintaining these 600,000-plus \ncars.\n  The amount of vehicles in our fleet could easily be decreased by 20 \npercent. We have all the capability of having GoToMeeting, of having \nInternet, of having live chats, of having telecommunications with \nvisual conferencing. We have all those things available. We do not need \nthe cars we have. Even the Obama administration agrees we can do that.\n  We could save $43 billion by decreasing travel by government \nagencies--same reason. We spend $15 billion a year on travel--$15 \nbillion. Anything that is not mission critical and that could be done \nthrough teleconferencing ought to be done. We advertise. The \nadvertising budget for the Federal Government, $5.6 billion a year. \nThey do not pay for public service ads. These are ads outside of public \nservice ads--$5.6 billion. We spend $1 billion a year hosting \ngovernment conferences. The Federal Government now owns 685 million \nacres in the United States. The cost to maintain that, we are not \nfunding. The land is falling in worse disrepair. We are adding land \nevery year. There is lots of land we could give up that is not a \nprecious resource, is not a heritage area, is not forest, is not a \npark. Yet we own it.\n  We could save a lot of money by not having so much land and put it \nback on the tax rolls. We could save $4.1 billion just on our last 2 \nyears' average, in terms of slowing down and not buying additional \nland, unless there is a direct necessity for the Federal Government to \nhave it.\n  We could save $19 billion over 10 years by combining the PXs and \nexchanges on our military bases--$19 billion just by putting them \ntogether. That is what we could save.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 30 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I shall not \nobject--but I would like to add 3 minutes to my time as well.\n  Mr. COBURN. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me end with this. It costs us, to educate a student \non our military bases, an average of $51,000 a student. If we look at \nthe locations where all those are located, the cost outside is one-\nfourth of that. We could easily do that and pay the community. But we \nwill not.\n  I will end with this. We can solve our problems. There is $9 trillion \nworth of specific savings in this. We do not have to agree with all \nthis. We do not even have to agree with half of it. If we agreed with \none-third of them, we would be well on our way. The fact is, nobody \nwants to be specific. We need to be specific. Everybody wants to talk \nin generalities. Nobody wants to make the hard choices. Hard choices \nare what we are here for.\n  Our time has come to stop living the next 30 years on the backs of \nour kids. It would be my hope that as we go through this process the \nnext 2 weeks,\n\n[[Page S4954]]\n\nwe will see a renewal in the spirit of our country that says: We are \ngoing to live within our means, we are going to reward self-reliance, \nwe are going to reward individual accountability, we are going to \nreward personal responsibility, and we are going to put the role of the \ngovernment back where it should be both at the Federal and State level \nand have commensurate policies that will reflect that, that will renew \nour country, that will create jobs, that will create opportunity for \nthe future of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/27/senate-section/article/S4954-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4954-S4955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DEBT CEILING\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to say to the Senator from Oklahoma \nthat standing and going through the list of things that offer \nopportunities for saving is very important. I have a list as well. For \nexample, on my list, we know of well over $1 trillion of money owed to \nthe United States of America by people who have not paid it. If we even \ngot a portion of that over a 10-year period--that is over a 10-year \nperiod--we could do that. I look forward to working with the Senator on \nthat.\n  But tonight we are not facing a 3-week timeframe as my colleague \nperhaps suggested, we are just facing down a 5-day timeframe and we are \nfacing a manmade crisis and, by that, I have to say a Republican-made \ncrisis on raising the debt ceiling.\n  We have never in the history of this country faced a situation such \nas this. Why do I say this? Because the debt ceiling has been raised 89 \ntimes--89 times--and I can tell you because I voted for it a number of \ntimes and voted no four times.\n  Yes, on occasion you vote no on it and send a message, but you don't \nbring it down. I have never seen anything like this. We are going down \na dangerous path. When I say we have raised the debt ceiling 89 times, \nthat is in the Record--55 times under Republican Presidents, 34 times \nunder Democratic Presidents. The debt limit was raised the most times \nduring Ronald Reagan's Presidency. During his 8 years, the debt limit \nwas increased by 200 percent. And this is what President Ronald Reagan \nsaid when it was time to raise the debt ceiling, which, again, under \nhis Presidency was raised 18 times:\n\n       The full consequences of a default--or even the serious \n     prospect of default--by the United States are impossible and \n     awesome to contemplate. Denigration of the full faith and \n     credit of the United States would have a substantial effect \n     on the domestic financial markets and on the value of the \n     dollar in exchange markets. The Nation can ill afford to \n     allow such a result.\n\n  That was in a letter written to Senator Howard Baker in 1983.\n  The debt limit was raised seven times during the Presidency of George \nW. Bush. During his 8 years, the debt limit was increased by 90 \npercent. Honest to goodness, I don't remember one Republican \ncolleague--and I could be wrong on this--who suggested that we don't \nraise the debt ceiling when George W. Bush was President.\n  I will tell you something. We all know that when you raise the debt \nceiling, it is for debts already incurred.\n  George W. Bush took a surplus of over $200 billion a year and he \nturned it into a deficit. The reason we have to raise the debt ceiling, \nmostly, is because of George W. Bush. I never heard one Republican in \nthose years say: Let's bring this down; let's not raise the debt \nceiling. They went on a binge. They put two wars on the credit card. \nThey never paid for those wars. They put a tax cut for the richest \npeople in America on that credit card. They didn't care. They put a \nprescription drug benefit which tied the hands of Medicare and said: \nYou can't negotiate for lower drug prices, and instead of being \naffordable for the government, it became a budget buster--they put that \non the credit card. I never heard them say: Let's not raise the debt \nceiling, even though, under their policies, they took a surplus and \nturned it into a deficit. They took us off a path where we were about \nto finish up with our debt, frankly, and added debt as far as the eye \ncould see.\n  The hypocrisy, honestly--and I am being cautious in the way I express \nmyself--doesn't even begin to describe what is going on here. It is \ndisingenuous, it is just plain wrong to play politics with this.\n  We know politics is at play here. I have run for election many times \nin my career--I think 11 or 12 times--and I know you have to pay \nattention to politics when you are running. We all understand that. We \nare not naive about it. We are tough on the trail. We know. But there \nis a time to govern. There is a time to set aside the politics and \ngovern. If ever there were a moment in history, it is now.\n  I have to say that my friend Senator Coburn said people are anxious \nin the country, but they are not anxious--he basically said \nspecifically that their anxiety has nothing to do with the debt \nceiling. I disagree respectfully. Anybody who has a 401(k) and has seen \nthe stock market down 400 points is worried. Anyone who gets a Social \nSecurity check is worried. Anyone who fears we could default is \nworried. Anyone on Medicare is worried. Anyone on veterans disability \nis worried. Every Federal employee is worried. Every Federal private \ncontractor in business is worried. Every worker who works for those \npeople is worried, too, because they know very well that if we don't \ncome together in a fair compromise, we will not be able to pay all of \nour bills. Again, raising the debt ceiling is something you have to do \nbecause you have already incurred all of the debt.\n  I would like to talk a little bit about how we got into this \nunnecessary crisis and how we need to get out of it. We got into it \nbecause Republicans said they would not vote for a clean increase in \nthe debt ceiling, as has been done 89 times before. They wanted to \nextract a pound of flesh and say: We demand that you cut spending now, \ntie it to this debt ceiling, and that is what we want. We said: OK, we \nare ready to talk.\n  As a matter of fact, the Democrats on the Budget Committee put out an \nexcellent plan. It cut not $850 billion, as John Boehner's plan does, \nbut $4 trillion, and it protects Social Security, Medicare, and it \nbasically said: We have a problem, and we are going to solve it with $2 \ntrillion in cuts and $2 trillion in revenues--50-50, which is kind of a \nfair way to approach it--and we are going to ask millionaires and \nbillionaires to pay their fair share.\n  Frankly, that plan is the ideal plan. It is a fair plan; it gets us \non safe, good, solid fiscal ground; and it says we will have cuts and \nwe will have revenue, and we will move forward and look at Medicare and \nSocial Security to make them stronger--not to cut benefits. If I were \nacting like the Republicans over in the House, I would stand here and \nsay: That is the only plan I will ever consider. I love that plan. It \nspeaks to my values. It speaks to my State's values. But I understand \nthat in a negotiation, in a situation such as this, no side gets \neverything they want.\n  Now President Obama says: Let's all come together and work on a plan. \nLet's do something big, something real. First, Eric Cantor, the \nRepublican whip, marched out of there with his teddy bear and his \nblanket, and then a few weeks later Boehner walks out.\n  I have to say that I watched Speaker Pelosi sit at the White House \nmany times. She sat across from George W. Bush. She did not agree with \nhim. She felt that he had added to the debt, that he had added to the \ndeficit. She disagreed with him on protecting millionaires and \nbillionaires. She disagreed with him on the environment and on the war \nin Iraq. Nancy Pelosi never stalked out of a meeting. I find it, \nfrankly, appalling that that is what happened.\n  But the President keeps reaching out because he will take the \npersonal hits because this country gave him everything, and he is not \ngoing to allow it to fall and to default and become a deadbeat nation.\n  Speaker Boehner said: I am going to put together my own plan. So he \nputs together his own plan. Frankly, it hardly has any cuts. He comes \nback very short--$850 billion in cuts--and doesn't get past this \nproblem we are facing. He only says it is for 4, 5, or 6 months, and \nthen we are going to be back in the soup, in this mess, in this chaos, \nand back into the market selloffs, back into the uncertainty, back in \nthe time when people can't even sleep well at night because Speaker \nBoehner and his people over there\n\n[[Page S4955]]\n\nwant to keep this thing boiling over. They think somehow it is good for \nthem. I say it is not good for them.\n  But you know what, I don't care if it is good or bad for them or \nwhether it is good or bad for us. What I care about, what you care \nabout, what we care about is this Nation that is everything to us. We \nhave to stand up for this Nation. That means we have to leave the \npolitical labels at the door and set aside our favorite plan, as I have \nset aside my favorite plan, and support a real compromise.\n  Let me tell you the real compromise we have before us. It is the Reid \napproach. It is a real compromise because what does compromise mean? \nNobody gets everything they want, but everybody gets something they \nwant. What do the Republicans say they want? They wanted cuts and no \nrevenues. They got that in the Reid plan. Our leader, Majority Leader \nReid, has heard them. Not only does he have cuts, he has twice as many \ncuts as the Boehner plan--cuts that hurt a lot of the things that many \nof us don't want to hurt, but we understand we have to give something. \nSo they get that. What do we get? We get certainty. We believe it is \nvery important that we take this issue of the debt ceiling and get it \npast the election, past January or February of 2013, and get back to \nthe business of job creation and all of the things we need to do--we \nget that.\n  We also talked about a committee that would look at the long-range \nproblems of this deficit and debt and the need to do reforms and the \nneed to look at what revenues make sense. There is a committee in that \nbill. This is a true compromise. I agree that the other things the \nDemocrats got are no cuts in Social Security and Medicare.\n  But if you really, truly look at this, the Reid plan gives the \nRepublicans more than even he gives the Democrats. But it is worth it \nto us to get certainty in the markets, protect Social Security and \nMedicare, avoid the chaos of the Boehner plan, and avoid the danger we \nface if our bonds are downgraded.\n  The Boehner plan risks catastrophic default, and we are concerned \nthat if it were to pass, we would again see this economy being held \ncaptive; we would again be facing deep cuts in Medicare and Social \nSecurity; we would again be facing all kinds of hostage-taking to \nprotect the millionaires and the billionaires.\n  I believe that no one who loves this country, regardless of political \nlabel, should take any action to result in America becoming a deadbeat \nnation.\n  I am a first-generation American on my mother's side. My mother never \neven went to high school because during her time in high school her \nfather got very ill and she had to go to work. Because I was born in \nthis country, even though we had barely anything, I was able to get an \neducation. I was able to go toe-to-toe with my colleagues who went to \nfancy schools. I remember when I went to Brooklyn College in New York, \nthey raised the tuition from $9 a semester to $14 a semester. My dad \nsaid, ``Honey, you are getting awfully expensive.'' But I got a college \neducation in this country. I got to the Senate in this country.\n  But I have to say, if we are going into a circumstance where \neverything we do to fight for the middle class is held hostage to \nprotect the richest among us--the billionaires, the millionaires, the \nmultinational corporations--if that is the pattern we are getting into \nhere, I fear for this country. We can't let it happen, and that is why \nwe have been very clear that the Boehner plan just continues this \nhostage taking. So the Reid alternative is the true compromise. It \ngives us substantial cuts in deficits, it gives us a process for more \ndeficit and debt reduction, and it gives us certainty in the \nmarketplace.\n\n  In closing, I would say this: When each of us has won our election, \nwe go up there to the place where the Presiding Officer is sitting and \nwe put our hand on the Bible and we swear to uphold the Constitution. I \nhad the honor of serving with Senator Robert Byrd--and most of us here \nhave--and he always carried around this Constitution in his pocket. \nToday, I took a look at section 4 of the 14th amendment, and it says: \nThe validity of the public debt of the United States shall not be \nquestioned.\n  I held up my hand and I swore to uphold this Constitution. It says \nthe validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by \nlaw, shall not be questioned. So I am not going to play games with \nthis, and I am not going to allow the public debt to become a political \nfootball.\n  Before I leave the floor, let me show a couple more charts. This is \nwhat Speaker Boehner said on July 22 of this year. He said:\n\n       I'm not really interested in a short-term increase in the \n     debt limit.\n\n  And on May 9 he said:\n\n       Our economy won't grow as long as we continue to trip it up \n     with short-term gimmicks from Washington.\n\n  That is what Speaker Boehner said. So what does he give us? A short-\nterm extension of the debt limit. A few months. We can't do that. In \nhis own words he says that would hurt the economy.\n  Eric Cantor said to Politico:\n\n       If we can't make the tough decisions now, why would we be \n     making those tough decisions later? It is my preference we do \n     this thing one time. Putting off tough decisions is not what \n     people want in this town.\n\n  Yet what do they do? They send us--and we don't know if they will get \nthe votes to send us, but they are planning to send us--a short-term \ndeal which leaves this great Nation in chaos.\n  You talk to every businessman and they will tell you the thing they \nworry about the most is uncertainty. And that is the path of \nuncertainty. Eric Cantor said it, Boehner said it: No short-term deal. \nBut they are sending us a short-term deal.\n  I will close with this from the New York Times. The headline reads: \n``The Mother of All No-Brainers.''\n\n       If the debt ceiling talks fail, independent voters will see \n     that Democrats were willing to compromise but Republicans \n     were not. If responsible Republicans don't take control, \n     independents will conclude that Republican fanaticism caused \n     this default. They will conclude that Republicans are not fit \n     to govern. And they will be right.\n\n  I appeal to our Republican colleagues in this Senate Chamber who have \nshown, working with Senator Durbin, working with Senator Warner, \nworking with others on our side--Senator Conrad--they are willing to \ncome forward and do something meaningful and put the politics aside. I \nhope they will do just that. They will find in Leader Reid someone who \nunderstands the art of compromise, who understands we have to put aside \nour party labels and do what is right for this Nation.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet).

Mr. President, I rise today to pay honor to a life cut \ntragically short, to a young man whose service to this country went \nbeyond the call of duty.\n  West Point Cadet Jacob Bower, from my great State of West Virginia, \nand my hometown of Fairmont, died at the age of 18 last week and will \nbe laid to rest Friday at a family cemetery with full military rights.\n  Cadet Bower was the sort of young man who would make any--any--parent \nproud. He was a three-sport athlete at East Fairmont High School, where \nhe graduated in 2011. He was in the National Honor Society and was \nvaledictorian of his graduating class. He was a role model and led his \npeers by example.\n  Cadet Bower had something that set him apart: He was a young man who \nfelt the spark to attend West Point. I learned from his mother Ginger \nthat as a young man--or a boy, really--he was very interested in \nhistory. He studied the paths that have formed our greatest leaders--\nthe men and women whose names are in the history books. He learned the \nbest of the best have attended our military academies, and he told his \nmother that is what he wanted to do. I think he wanted to be in the \nhistory books. He wanted to be a part of that. He wanted to give \nsomething back. He told his mother: Mom, I have had everything given to \nme. It is time for me to give back now.\n  Cadet Bower was 18 when he died during a land navigation exercise \nThursday of what may be a heat-related cause, though we are not sure \nyet and it is too early to tell. We do know that Cadet Bower trained \nvigorously before\n\n[[Page S4956]]\n\nthe exercise and had successfully completed the first 3 weeks of his 6 \nweeks of basic training.\n  Nothing can explain a death so tragic, a life cut so unfairly short. \nThis is the one time, above all others, that you have to believe and \ntrust in your faith. My wife Gayle and I send our prayers and thoughts \nto Cadet Bower's mother Ginger, his father Dean, his brother Ryan, and \nthe entire Bower family and all their friends. We continue to pray \nevery day for the safety of the brave women and men who put their lives \non the line every day for all of us.\n  Mere words cannot pay tribute to the magnitude of this tragedy and \nthe depth of his sacrifice. In these challenging times, our entire \ncountry would do well to think of Cadet Jacob Bower as we work together \nto put this country first, as he did, before our own interests. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with this family. May God bless them through \nthis difficult time, and may God continue to bless the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/27/senate-section/article/S4956-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4956-S4958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me salute my colleague from West \nVirginia. It is a sad task that we have to come to the floor to \nrecognize those who have passed. He pays tribute to a young man whose \nlife was cut too short but who was determined to serve our country, and \nI thank him for bringing that man's life to our attention in the Senate \nand to those who follow this across the Nation. I am sure the Senate \njoins him in expressing our sympathy to the family on the tragic loss \nof their son. I thank Senator Manchin for coming to the floor.\n  Many people have asked about the state of the recession in our Nation \nand what it will take to turn this economy around. There is a lot of \nspeculation, and I don't profess to be an expert, but I think there are \ntwo things that are hurting us and that we will have to deal with to \nbring ourselves out of the current state we are in. One of them is the \nprice of real estate. I don't think we have quite reached the point \nwhere we know where the bottom is in the real estate values in many \nparts of America. That has been a real problem, because for many \nhomeowners and buyers it means they are underwater--the value of their \nhome has gone down below the value of their mortgage. Some of them have \ngiven up, others have to give up when they lose their jobs. This real \nestate market and its volatility, the foreclosures that have followed, \nstill haunt us years after the subprime mortgage fiasco that led us \ninto the recession.\n  But I think there is another element that is even more basic. My \nmother and father were married in 1928. My first brother was born in \n1930 and the other in 1932. They started their family in East St. \nLouis, IL. My dad was working for a railroad. My mother, an immigrant, \nbegan working as a switchboard operator at a telephone company in East \nSt. Louis, IL. They each had eighth grade educations and they were \nhard-working folks. That is the way they were raised. They started \ntheir family as the Great Depression started, and they never forgot it \nas long as they lived.\n  I used to take a look at their lifestyle and think that is the \nlifestyle of every family in America, because that was all I knew. Now \nthat I look back on it, it was a lot different. My mom and dad, because \nof that Depression experience and starting a family, had some basic \nrules in our house: Never borrow money. Save it. When you have saved \nenough, buy what you need. Otherwise, wait and do without. I thought \nthat was the way everybody lived. It certainly was the way I was \nraised, and my brothers.\n  They also had some basic things they did to save money. Even after \nyears had passed--decades had passed, and they were comfortable, by \nmiddle-class standards--they were always very careful in the way they \nspent their money. I always felt perhaps there was a fear that those \nbad times might come back and they wanted to be ready. That was the way \nI was raised. It is the way my wife and I raised our children, and it \nwas the way my wife was raised, being from Depression-era families who \nhad lived through that experience. They modeled their lives afterwards \nbased on the fears and concerns they had during the Great Depression.\n  Something happened over the last several years which calls that to \nmind. In 2007, households across America had borrowed the equivalent of \n127 percent of their annual income--127 percent. In the 1990s, the \naverage was 84 percent. So it was literally a 50-percent increase in \nhousehold indebtedness in a matter of 15 or 16 years. Though Americans \nhave been working hard to reduce that debt, because they understand \nwhat a drag it is on their lifestyle and their wages, the debt-to-\nincome level in America is still 112 percent--still substantially \nhigher than it was back in the 1990s, when it was 84 percent. That \nslows down economic recovery. People who are trying to shed debt are \ncareful not to incur new debt, not to buy the things that would put \nthem in debt, and that slows down the purchase of goods and services, \nwhich is exactly the opposite of what you need when you are recovering \nfrom a recession.\n  So I think those two elements--the value of real estate and household \ndebt--are holding us back in this economic recovery. There is one \naspect of household debt I wish to call to the attention of the Senate \nin our record of proceedings, and that is the fact that in October of \nlast year we reached a milestone in America, though most people didn't \nnotice. For the first time in the modern history of our country, total \nstudent loan debt exceeded total credit card debt in the United States, \nwith $850 billion outstanding in student loan debt across America.\n  Mr. President, I don't know your circumstance, but mine was borrowing \nmoney to go to school with National Defense Education Act loans. This \nwill date me for sure, but when I graduated law school in the late \n1960s, and they accumulated all the money I had borrowed--undergraduate \nand law school--they came to me and said: Now you have to start paying \nit back, 12 months from graduation. You had to pay 10 percent a year \nuntil you paid it off, with a 3-percent interest rate. I gulped and \nsaid: How much is it? They said: It is $8,500. I thought I was \nfinished. I couldn't imagine coming up with $8,500 a year, plus \ninterest, to pay off my student loan. My wife and I had a baby and \nanother on the way, and I was starting a new job that didn't pay a lot \nof money. I couldn't imagine how I was going to do that, but I did.\n  Now that I look back on that, and consider what students face today, \nit is no wonder they laugh when I tell that story--$8,500. They would \nbe lucky to get through the book store for $8,500 at most colleges and \nuniversities today. I may be exaggerating a little bit. The cost of \ncollege has been skyrocketing, with the average 4-year nonprofit \ncollege tuition last year at $27,000. The in-State tuition at a public \n4-year university averaged $7,600.\n  The cost of room and board, of course, would raise that higher. \nTuition has been running faster than inflation for the last 20 years, \nsometimes growing at more than double the rate of inflation. But \nhousehold income hasn't been growing. More and more families, unable to \npay for their kids' education, join their kids in borrowing money, \nstudent loans. Sometimes they cosign. In a bad economy, some students \nwho never anticipated having to take out student loans were forced to \ndo it, and others have had to borrow more than they expected they \nwould.\n  In 2009 alone, student borrowing grew by 25 percent. Today, two-\nthirds of college students borrow to pay for college. The result is a \ngeneration of young Americans beginning their professional lives with \nunprecedented levels of debt. The average student leaves college with \n$31,000 in student loan debt, but it is not unheard of to run into \nstudents who have a lot more debt, sometimes as high as $100,000, for \nan undergraduate degree. Going on to graduate school or law school is \nvery expensive.\n  I went to Georgetown Law School. I can't even remember what the \ntuition was when I went there, but I would be amazed if it was more \nthan $1,500 a year. It is now $50,000 a year at Georgetown Law School, \nwhich means if you borrowed the money to finish law school on top of \nyour undergraduate debt, you just added $150,000 in debt to your life \nbefore you draw your first paycheck.\n  If you are lucky and one of the best law students, you might get into \na law\n\n[[Page S4957]]\n\nfirm that pays you a huge amount of money. Most law school graduates \nwill not. They will make life decisions then based on their \nindebtedness and how to pay it off.\n  Students who begin their adult lives paying $600 or $1,000 a month on \ntheir student loan payments have to make some difficult choices. They \nmay put off doing the job they really wanted to do or buying a house or \neven getting married. They may end up moving back home with their \nparents, which more and more students do. It is tough to imagine how \nyou get out of that debt burden and create a life that leads to savings \nand happiness and retirement.\n  High levels of household debt keep these borrowers from contributing \nto our economic recovery. We need young people to invest in the economy \nand help it. Some of these students will find they can't afford monthly \npayments and they face default.\n  Here is something we cannot say enough to students today who are \nconsidering a college education: There is something you ought to know \nabout a student loan. It is not like your car loan. It is not even like \nyour home loan. It is not like your credit card debt because student \nloan debt is not dischargeable in bankruptcy.\n  What does that mean? If you get in deeply over your head and cannot \npossibly make the payments, you are stuck. You can't discharge that \ndebt in bankruptcy. You will carry it with you to the grave. It is with \nyou for the rest of your life.\n  That is the difference between student loan debt and a lot of other \nloans people take out.\n  Mr. President, as tuition growth has outpaced Federal student loan \nlimits, private banks and lenders have entered the higher education \nmarketplace with private student loans. I don't know why, and I \ncertainly wish I would have been more attentive to this when it \nhappened, but we decided years ago to treat government student loans \nthe same as private student loans, which means if a private entity \nloans money for school, they are protected as creditors like the \ngovernment.\n  In other words, even if you borrowed $10,000 from a local bank to go \nto college as a student loan, you can't discharge that in bankruptcy \neither. You are stuck with that for a lifetime. It doesn't apply to \nvirtually any other debts, other than perhaps a tax liability under the \nBankruptcy Code. So it is an unusual situation we have created, an \nunusual burden on young people.\n  Federal student loans for most undergraduates are capped at $5,500 \nfor the first year of school and go up to $7,500 a year by the time a \nstudent graduates. That doesn't always cover the cost for students when \ntuition can exceed $30,000 at private colleges, so students turn to \nprivate student loans to fill the gap. This can be disastrous. These \nprivate loans are made with interest rates and fees as high as credit \ncards. There are reports of private loans with variable interest rates \nreaching 18 percent. Unlike Federal student loans, there are few \nconsumer protections. Students don't have access to flexible repayment \nplans, free deferment, or loan forgiveness with private student loans. \nSome students who take out private loans find themselves trapped under \nan enormous amount of debt. Because of the bankruptcy law, it is a debt \nthey are stuck with the rest of their lives.\n  Now, I want to say a word about another phenomena. Today, Secretary \nErnie Duncan spoke before Chairman Harkin's Appropriations Subcommittee \non Education. I think Secretary Duncan is one of the President's best \nappointments, not to mention the fact we have been personal friends for \na long time, and I have watched as he struggled to change the Chicago \npublic school system. It goes beyond his efforts in public service. He \nhas given a lifetime to education. His mother was a teacher. He used to \ntutor kids after school. He has it in his blood, and it shows, and I \nthink he is a man of great, immense personal talent and integrity, and \nhe has done some remarkable things in the tenure that he has had at the \nDepartment of Education.\n  Today when he came to testify, we talked about a phenomena that \nrelates to this. I explained to him how I borrowed money to get through \ncollege and how students today borrow more than ever, with student loan \ndebt passing credit card debt. Then we talked about the phenomena of \nfor-profit colleges. Here is what the facts are:\n  When we look at students who have finished high school, 10 percent of \nthem go to for-profit schools. These for-profit schools are not the \nlocal community colleges or even the traditional public or private \nuniversities. They are businesses. Ten percent of the students go to \nthese private for-profit schools, but the for-profit schools end up \nreceiving 25 percent of all Federal student aid, far in excess of what \nyou might expect with 10 percent of the students. Twenty-five percent \nof the Pell grants and Federal student loans go to for-profit schools.\n  Then there is the default rate. The student loan default rate is \nhighest at the for-profit schools. For-profit colleges represent 44 \npercent of all defaults on student loans. The rate for public colleges \nand universities is in the single digits, but 25 percent for for-profit \nschools. What it tells us is these students who are attracting more \nFederal student aid end up defaulting more when it comes to the payment \nof their debt.\n  For-profit colleges are the fastest growing sector of higher \neducation. In Illinois, enrollment has more than doubled over the last \ndecade in these schools.\n  The largest chain of for-profit colleges, the University of Phoenix, \nhas become the second largest higher education system in America. There \nare over 450,000 students in the University of Phoenix, more than the \ncombined enrollment of all the big 10 colleges and universities.\n  A for-profit college education isn't cheap. Tuition at for-profit \nschools is 5\\1/2\\ times the price of community colleges and twice as \nmuch as public 4-year colleges. Two-thirds of the for-profit students \nreceive Pell grants which target low-income students and don't have to \nbe repaid. But Pell grants aren't enough to pay for for-profit schools. \nTo make up the difference, students take out loans. At 4-year, for-\nprofit schools, 96 percent of students are borrowing money. When \nstudents leave school, many for-profit college students find their \ntraining didn't prepare them for a job, and employers don't recognize \ntheir degrees.\n  Buried in debt, without good career and job prospects, these students \nsimply can't keep paying the loans. That is why the default rate is so \nhigh.\n  Within 3 years, 25 percent of students who leave a for-profit college \nwill default on their student loans. Let me tell you the story of two \nof them.\n  Christine lives in southern Illinois. She received a degree in \nmedical billing and coding from Sanford-Brown College. She took out \nstudent loans to pay for college, and she now owes a total of $24,000 \nfor her 2-year associate's degree. She now refers to that degree as, \nand I quote, ``completely worthless.'' Christine said that when she \nwent interviewing for jobs, one company told her her degree was a \nstrike against her. Another said they don't hire Sanford-Brown \ngraduates because they have to retrain every one of them. She wasn't \nable to find a job, and she put her loans in deferment to go back to \nschool and borrow more money.\n\n  Another student, Michelle, spoke at a forum I held in Chicago a year \nago. Michelle received a degree in criminal justice from Westwood \nCollege, and she wanted to be a police officer. After graduating, she \nlearned that the law enforcement agency she applied to in Illinois \nwould not recognize her diploma from Westwood. She was left with nearly \n$90,000 in debt. She has no career prospects.\n  Michelle is living at home with her parents in their basement. She is \nworking part-time seasonal retail jobs struggling to pay about $900 a \nmonth on her student loans. She can't borrow any more money now to even \ngo back to school and get a degree that might help her. Instead of \ncontributing to society, she is trapped. Michelle's school loaded her \nup with Federal and private student loans for a degree that wasn't \nworth anything when she graduated.\n  Because of her student loan debt, she is not going to be buying a \nhouse, she can't save for retirement, she certainly can't invest. She \ncan't even go back to school to start over. And because there is no \nescape for her, no bankruptcy protection, she may be burdened with this \ndebt for the rest of her life.\n\n[[Page S4958]]\n\n  Mr. President, we can't continue on this path. When I sat down on the \nbudget negotiations, one of the things President Obama put on the table \nwas extending Pell grants. There was a time when I would have \ninstinctively said: Sign me up. I believe if you don't help that \ngeneration of students, like myself, who don't have the resources to go \nto school, you are denying them the opportunity that I had. I think \nyoung people deserve that opportunity.\n  But I have to say now when I hear Pell grants and student loans and \nconsider these for-profit schools, I stop and think. We have to step \nback and ask which of these schools are good and worth supporting and \nwhich are not.\n  I said to Secretary Duncan today we should have accreditation \nstandards so these schools are known to be worth the money the students \nare paying to attend. We should follow their progress to make sure if \nthey are steering young people in debt and then dumping them into a \njobless situation in life, that we stop subsidizing them with Federal \nstudent loans and Pell grants. That is incumbent upon us.\n  The administration recently took up the for-profit college cause. \nThey are asking for more reporting. It is a step in the right \ndirection. As I said to Secretary Duncan, we should have done more. We \nare going to find the worst of the worst. Maybe we will stop them from \nexploiting the students, but there are going to be a lot of awful \nschools still in business because our standards are not as strong as \nthey should be at the Federal level.\n  Mr. President, as we consider the future of higher education, let's \nconsider the fact that the cost of it is outstripping the resources of \nmany families, the debt that students incur will change their lives, \nand there is a process of exploitation at many of these for-profit \ncolleges that we should not tolerate. It is not fair to the students \nnor their families. It certainly isn't fair to America's taxpayers \nbecause, as they default on these student loans, the American taxpayers \nwill be the ultimate losers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MOORE PARISH HOUSE AND LIBRARY\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. On August 22, 1911, more than \n1,000 people, including Governor Frederick Plaisted, gathered in the \nsmall downeast Maine town of Steuben to dedicate the Henry D. Moore \nParish House and Library. Given that the crowd was far larger than the \nentire population of the town and the difficulty of travel from the \nState capital to Maine's easternmost county in those days, this clearly \nwas an important event.\n  Its importance was twofold. First, the people of Steuben worked hard \nto wrest a living from the sea; it was a life that offered the rewards \nof independence in surroundings of great natural beauty, but few of the \namenities found in more prosperous, less remote towns. Now, thanks to \nthis marvelous gift, they had a center for intellectual and spiritual \ngrowth, a place to come together as a community.\n  Just as important as the gift was the giver. Henry Dyer Moore was \nborn in Steuben in 1842, the son of a carpenter and shipwright. From \nthat modest start, he went on to achieve remarkable success in \nbusiness, with interests that ranged from snuff to railroads and \nbanking. His career took him to the centers of commerce, but his heart \nnever left Steuben.\n  In the century since, the people of Steuben have turned that gift \ninto a treasure. Today, the Henry D. Moore Parish House and Library \nhosts concerts, plays, adult education classes, and many other events. \nThe library resources are considerable and modern, and are a great \nasset to the entire region, including the students at the Ella Lewis \nGrammar School. The building is more used than ever, and more beautiful \nthan the day it was dedicated.\n  There is another fascinating aspect to this story. Henry D. Moore had \na cousin, 6 years younger. He, too, came from a seafaring family of \nSteuben, and he, too, went on to achieve astonishing success. John \nGodfrey Moore was a pioneer in the telegraph industry and one of the \nmost prominent international financiers of his day. Like his older \ncousin, he never forgot the place of his birth. The land he bought, \npreserved, and kept open to the public on the Schoodic Peninsula near \nSteuben is now one of the most spectacular sections of Acadia National \nPark.\n  One might simply observe that philanthropy ran in the Moore family. \nThe greater truth is that such generosity runs throughout Maine and \nacross America. Achieving success and then giving back to the place and \nthe people that instilled the values that led to success is among the \nhighest qualities of our national character.\n  Cherishing the gift and building upon it for the generations to come \nis another. That quality is demonstrated today by the people of \nSteuben, ME, and I offer my congratulations as they gather again to \ncelebrate the centennial of the Henry D. Moore Parish House and \nLibrary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/27/senate-section/article/S4958-5", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4958-S4959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FARMERS AND MERCHANTS UNION BANK\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I recognize the 150th \nanniversary of Wisconsin's own Farmers and Merchants Union Bank. I am \nhonored to have the opportunity to celebrate this extraordinary \nmilestone.\n  The year 1861 will forever mark the beginning of one of the most \ntrying times in American history. With the onset of the Civil War, \nfinancial and banking institutions suffered as a result of the division \nof our Nation. Inspired by the courage and determination of President \nAbraham Lincoln, businessman John Wheeler chose that year to open two \nbanks in the town of Columbus, WI. On September 5, John Wheeler became \nthe first president of the Farmers and Merchants Union Bank of \nColumbus.\n  Wheeler's passion and commitment to customer service continued in \nthose who followed him as bank leaders. His grandson J. Russell Wheeler \nwas committed to honoring the legacy his grandfather left behind and \nexpanding the bank's profile, reach and influence. He commissioned \nrenowned architect Louis Sullivan who has often been called the \n``father of the skyscraper,'' to design and oversee the construction of \nthe new Farmers and Merchants Union Bank building. Sullivan acted as a \nmentor to architect Frank Lloyd Wright and was diligent in making sure\n\n[[Page S4959]]\n\nevery detail lived up to the standards on which the institution was \nfounded. The product of Sullivan's work has become one of Wisconsin's \nprized architectural attractions. On October 18, 1972, the bank was \nentered on the National Register of Historic Places, and later \ndesignated a national historic landmark.\n  Today, Farmers and Merchants Union Bank strives to provide the best \nin modern banking to customers in Columbus, Fall River, Friesland, \nJuneau, and the areas that surround those Wisconsin communities. Their \nmission endures as ``an independent bank known for maintaining a \nreputation for integrity and fair dealing and promoting growth and \nstability in the communities they serve.''\n  I have great admiration for independent banks that are focused on \nbuilding communities in both the good and hard times. For 150 years, \nFarmers and Merchants Union Bank has done just that; continued to \nrepresent the importance of local ties and their critical role in the \nhealth and vitality of the Wisconsin communities they serve.\n  So for their commitment to providing every customer with the highest \nquality banking service and to reaching out to the community--a \ndedication that has helped sustain this institution for a century and a \nhalf--I am proud to celebrate this historic occasion and the 150 years \nof service that the Farmers and Merchants Union Bank has provided to \nthe people of the State of Wisconsin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/27/senate-section/article/S4959-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO STEVE LEVESQUE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Steve \nLevesque, the executive director of the Midcoast Regional Redevelopment \nAuthority, or MRRA, which is the entity charged with the transition of \nthe former Brunswick Naval Air Station into a vibrant commercial \ncenter. Steve has been a longtime leader in economic development in the \nState of Maine, having previously served as commissioner of the Maine \nDepartment of Economic and Community Development. His most recent \nefforts have earned him recognition from the Association of Defense \nCommunities, which presented Steve with its Base Redevelopment \nLeadership Award last week at its annual conference in Norfolk, VA.\n  An era came to an end on May 31 when the Brunswick Naval Air Station, \nalso known as BNAS, was officially closed as an unfortunate casualty of \nthe base realignment and closure process. As the executive director of \nthe MRRA, Steve Levesque was charged with the unenviable task of \noverseeing the reuse of the 3,200-acre former air station. Many \nanticipated that the closure would be a devastating blow to the \nMidcoast economy, but under Steve's leadership the air station's \nclosure has transformed into an exciting redevelopment project with \nmuch hope for the future.\n  Always reluctant to accept credit for the successes at Brunswick \nLanding, Steve is always quick to laud the efforts of those around him. \nWhile the MRRA staff and board unquestionably embody the finest \nattributes of Maine's legendary work ethic, Steve's buoyant outlook, \nforesight, and true leadership capacity have undoubtedly accelerated \nthe redevelopment of BNAS into Brunswick Landing, which is home to an \never-growing number of businesses focused on projects as diverse as \naviation, advanced composites, and education. Tenants include both new \nand existing business from across the globe, including Kestrel \nAircraft, Molnlycke Health Care, Southern Maine Community College, and \nBowdoin College.\n  Under Steve's leadership, there are presently 10 companies in the \nprocess of relocating to Brunswick Landing, and many other businesses \nare actively considering moving to the site because of the proactive \nefforts of Steve and his team at MRRA. There are 90 jobs associated \nwith those 10 firms, and an additional 515 are projected. In April, \nSteve also oversaw the successful launch of Brunswick Executive \nAirport, and just over a month later hosted the first annual Brunswick \nInternational Fly-In for pilots from across the region and the entire \ncountry.\n  In acknowledging Steve's commitment to Brunswick Landing with its \nprestigious Base Redevelopment Leadership Award, the Association of \nDefense Communities noted that ``[m]uch of the success so far in \npromoting the base's redevelopment can be attributed to Levesque's \nstrong working relationship with the Navy, the state's congressional \ndelegation, the governor's office, the legislature, local officials and \nthe business community.'' I can attest that Steve has been a reliable \npartner and a tremendous asset to the redevelopment effort as he has \nlabored tirelessly to ensure that the Midcoast region is an attractive \nlocale for businesses seeking to open, expand, and grow.\n  Steve exemplifies the very best of Maine. Aside from his professional \nduties, he has been active in the local community as the founder of the \nMaine Moose Junior Hockey team. From 2006 until 2010, Steve served as \nthe president and general manager of the Maine Moose, sharing his love \nof hockey with kids from across the State. Steve's passion for and \ncommitment to public service and the people of Maine is truly \ncommendable.\n  I have long respected Steve Levesque for his intelligence, \nconfidence, and ability to accomplish great things. At a time when job \ncreation and economic growth are paramount to revitalizing midcoast \nMaine's economy, I know no one more suited to the task than Steve \nLevesque. I thank Steve for his incredible work thus far, and wish him \nsuccess as he continues his efforts to construct Maine's Center for \nInnovation at Brunswick Landing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/27/senate-section/article/S4959-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1383.

A bill to amend section 242 of the National Housing Act to \nextend the sunset provisions for the exemption for critical access \nhospitals under the FHA programs of mortgage insurance for hospitals; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Health Care \nCapital Access Reauthorization Act. This\n\n[[Page S4962]]\n\nlegislation will allow Critical Access Hospitals, CAHs, to continue to \naccess the Federal Housing Administration's, FHA, 242 program.\n  There are approximately 1,327 CAHs throughout the United States. \nThese hospitals are vital to our health care system because they \nprovide individuals who live in rural areas care they might not \notherwise have. Many of these hospitals were built over 40 years ago \nand are in need of significant renovations. Without the exemption, many \nrural hospitals would not qualify for the low-cost loan insurance based \non patients' average length of stay or because the hospital operates a \nnursing home, and as a result, many rural hospitals would face higher \nfinancing costs on construction and renovation loans.\n  Many CAHs provide a significant level of non-acute or long-term \nservices, and therefore do not qualify for the FHA 242 program based on \nlength of stay. Additionally, some CAHs operate nursing homes, further \nlengthening the average stay and causing the hospital to be ineligible \nfor the 242 program. In 2006, Congress recognized the uniqueness and \nimportance of these hospitals and passed the Rural Health Care Capital \nAccess Act. This Act provided an exemption from the acute care \nprovision in the FHA 242 program for Critical Access Facilities. The \nexemption expires on July 31.\n  After July 31, CAHs applying for financing will be unable to receive \nfinancing if the exemption is not extended. Since the initial exemption \nwas passed in 2006, 10 rural hospitals in 10 states have received \nmortgage insurance through the program as a result of the exemption in \nEdgerton, Wis., Columbus, Mont., Springfield, Ga., Monticello, Ill., \nL'Anse, Mich., Cambridge, Neb., Hot Springs, S.D., Grand Coulee, Wash., \nMoab, Utah and Holyoke, Colo. The program has provided financing for \nthese hospitals on loans ranging from $14 to $31 million and totaling \nmore than $241 million.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would provide a five-year \nextension of the exemption in the Rural Health Care Capital Access Act, \nallowing the many rural hospitals that provide significant levels of \nnon-acute or long-term care to continue applying for financing under a \nFHA 242 program. Without the exemption, these rural hospitals would not \nqualify for an FHA loan based on patients' average length of stay, \nresulting in fewer options for construction and renovation loans.\n  I would like to thank the original coponsors of this bill: Senators \nConrad, Tim Johnson, Thune, Johanns, and Tester for their leadership \nand support for Critical Access Hospitals.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Maximizing Spectrum \n     Efficiency and Value Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Demand for spectrum is sharply rising due to the \n     growing advanced network of communications devices that rely \n     on spectrum to transmit and receive information.\n       (2) It is necessary for the United States to maintain its \n     investments in innovation of spectrum and broadband \n     infrastructure to ensure the United States is a global leader \n     in the wireless age.\n       (3) Spectrum is a finite resource, and in order to spur \n     innovation, the United States must provide for better and \n     more efficient spectrum management.\n       (4) Many spectrum holders do not efficiently use their \n     frequency assignments, and a re-structuring of the usable \n     spectrum is a viable solution to make up for this lost \n     opportunity.\n       (5) Making available additional spectrum to meet the \n     demands of broadband technologies and services will prevent \n     dropped connections, blocked service, decreased connection \n     speed, and even higher prices for certain advanced \n     applications.\n       (6) The availability of increased spectrum will allow \n     advanced technologies such as 4G mobile services, high-speed \n     wireless, high definition television, and more to continue \n     operating without network problems and interferences.\n       (7) The United States public debt totals more than \n     $14,300,000,000,000.\n       (8) Congress should look for ways to increase the \n     government's revenues without additional taxpayer burdens.\n       (9) Auctioning spectrum is the most economically sound \n     method for accurate valuation and assignment of spectrum to \n     develop the next generation of wireless technologies, expand \n     broadband service to under served areas of our county, \n     develop an interoperable public safety network and reduce our \n     deficit.\n       (10) Recent spectrum auctions in Germany and India raised a \n     combined $20,000,000,000.\n       (11) Frequencies within the spectrum have substantial \n     market value and could raise near $30,000,000,000 in a public \n     auction.\n       (12) Barriers such as regulatory and administrative delays \n     are not conducive to the free market approach and can hurt \n     innovation.\n       (13) Government spectrum, while extremely important, is \n     vast and should be included in any spectrum reform \n     initiative.\n\n     SEC. 203. AUTHORITY FOR INCENTIVE AUCTIONS.\n\n       Section 309(j) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     309(j)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (3), by striking subparagraph (F) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(F) for any auction of eligible frequencies described in \n     section 119(f)(1) of the National Telecommunications and \n     Information Administration Organization Act, the recovery of \n     110 percent of estimated relocation costs as provided to the \n     Commission under section 119(e)(1)(D)(iii) of the National \n     Telecommunications and Information Administration \n     Organization Act.'';

Mr. President, I rise to discuss legislation \ncalled the All-American Flag Act of 2011 and make some comments about \nwhat has happened to American manufacturing and how this is a small \nstep but an important step in beginning to convince this body that \n``Made in America'' is something we should focus on, that a \nmanufacturing strategy from the White House is something they should \nfocus on, and that putting people back to work to make things in \nAmerica again is the right strategy to pull us out of a recession.\n  The Labor Department's most recent jobs report confirmed what workers \nin my State are already aware of--that employers are still not hiring. \nWorkers who have jobs are seeing smaller paychecks, and they are barely \nkeeping up with bills and insurance costs.\n  In too many cases, soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan are \nfacing even greater challenges in the labor market. I was at Youngstown \nState University recently talking about the specific programs there. In \nCleveland, through MAGNET--a group called MAGNET in Youngstown and in \nnortheast Ohio is helping soldiers and sailors\n\n[[Page S4969]]\n\nand marines leaving the service, integrating into the classroom, and \nhelping them find jobs in that region--someplace we have fallen \nwoefully short.\n  Manufacturing, which was moving along steadily earlier this year--we \nhad seen 12, 13, 14, 15 months of job growth in manufacturing, not \nenough job growth but some--that is even slowing down. Steps that were \ntaken through the auto rescue and other things we did in the last \ncouple of years dealing with this terrible recession created in 2007 \nand 2008--the auto rescue and other efforts saved millions of Americans \nfrom joining the unemployment rolls. We are seeing a better auto \nindustry, an auto industry coming back, especially in places such as \nDefiance and Toledo and Northwood and Cleveland and Lawrenceville, OH. \nBut the challenges remain severe.\n  Like many in this Chamber, I believe manufacturing is the key not \nonly to our economic recovery but to the strength and vitality of our \nNation. To many, manufacturing is also a ticket to the American middle \nclass.\n  In the last 12 years, we have witnessed the closure of more than \n54,000 factories in the United States. Last year, we lost 8,000. That \nis 5,400 factories per year, 15 per day in the last 12 years. The \nmanufacturing sector, since the beginning of the Bush administration, \n2001, has lost 5 million jobs. Only 11.5 million people are employed in \nmanufacturing jobs now. The last time it was that low was in 1941, \nbefore the country scaled up for production for World War II.\n  When Members of this body talk about the need to support \nmanufacturing, others will say that is ``picking winners and losers'' \nand that ``the government has no role in helping manufacturing.'' First \nof all, that makes no sense, but second, I have heard all those before. \nI think the government already has picked winners and made choices. \nManufacturing in the early 1980s exceeded 25 percent of our GDP. Now it \nis only 11 percent of our GDP. Over that same time period--financial \nservices back 30 years ago was about 11 percent of our GDP, and now \nthey are about 21 percent. So a government that put way too much focus \non and interest in and support for financial services at the expense of \nmanufacturing has clearly cost us far too many middle-class jobs.\n  It is a result of tax policy; it is a result of not investing in \ninnovation; it is a result of the China PNTR, the permanent normal \ntrade relations; it is a result of NAFTA; and it is a result of not \nenforcing our trade laws. There is blame to go around, but the blame \nwill not create a job that a former autoworker in Youngstown or a \nrubber worker in Akron or a chemical worker in Columbus or a \nsteelworker outside Cincinnati--that will not create a job they are \nlooking for, nor reduce the rising cost for them of food and gas and \nshelter.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider taking big steps, not just slight \nchanges at the margin, in rebuilding our manufacturing base and \nrebuilding the middle class. Those steps include rebalancing our \neconomic policies, reinvesting in education, reinvesting--putting real \nsupport into workforce training, and enforcing trade laws that increase \nour exports and reinforce trade, three examples of enforcing trade laws \nthat happened in the last couple of years, thanks in part to a more \naggressive Obama administration finally on trade law. We have seen \nhundreds of jobs created in Lorain, OH; in Youngstown, OH, because of \nenforcement of trade laws on Oil Country Tubular Steel. We have seen \nrubber worker jobs, tire manufacturing jobs created in Finley, OH, \nbecause of enforcement of international trade law. We have seen coated \npaper jobs, paper manufacturing jobs in Butler County, OH, again, \nbecause of an aggressive Federal policy about enforcing trade law, but \nwe don't see enough of that.\n\n  There are other steps more modest but demonstrate a commitment to our \nmanufacturing sector--one step requiring the Federal Government when \npurchasing flags to purchase only those flags 100 percent American \nmade. That sounds fairly amazing that they are not made in America \ntoday. It sounds fairly amazing that would make much difference but \nreally it does.\n  Currently, Federal law requires that American flags purchased by the \nU.S. Government contain a minimum of 50 percent American-made products \nor components. So the U.S. Department of Defense, the U.S. Department \nof Homeland Security or the U.S. Capitol buys the American flags and \nunder law they only need to be 50 percent made in the United States of \nAmerica. These are American flags. This legislation we will offer \ntoday, which has the support of Senator Rockefeller, a Democrat from \nWest Virginia, Senator Collins, a Republican from Maine, Senator \nSanders, an Independent from Vermont, have joined me as cosponsors. It \nhonors our country by ensuring American flags flown over government \nbuildings are actually American flags.\n  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the value of imported American \nflags to the United States was $3.2 million with $2.8 million coming \nfrom China. When I think about all of the production in China, I often \nthink about young workers--and when I say young workers, I mean young \nworkers in China--who make things people in the United States buy. I \nhave to think Chinese workers, if they think about this while they are \nworking, must be a bit amused that they are making American flags in \nChina and selling them to us. They must think what kind of country is \nthis that doesn't make their own flags. It just occurred to me that \nwould be amusing if it weren't somewhat tragic.\n  The Congressional Research Service said there are at least eight all-\nAmerican flag manufacturers in the United States. There are eight \ncompanies that can do this. This isn't a question of rare Earth \nmaterials that we can't get enough of. I know the Senator from Colorado \nhas been interested in that issue, the Presiding Officer.\n  The increased demand for made in the U.S.A. flags will lead to more \njobs. Thanks to this legislation we will have more production.\n  In a time when we face economic hardship, it is critical to invest in \nthe manufacturing base. There is no product that deserves a U.S.A. \nlabel more than American flags. Manufacturing built a strong middle \nclass. When you think of the combination of large-scale manufacturing \nof all kinds of products and collective bargaining laws that let people \ncome together and bargain and negotiate collectively, it clearly is the \nway we built the middle class in this country.\n  It is critical today that the government lead by example. That is why \nthe Ohio Senate bill 5 is so important, the repeal of the repeal of \ncollective bargaining. It is why manufacturing is so important.\n  This legislation today that I will bring up in a moment is a modest \nstep towards building that manufacturing strategy, moving forward on \nmade in America and a modest step towards enhancing and strengthening \nour manufacturing base.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Homeland Security \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1188 and that \nthe Senate proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado).
