Mr. President, I know Senators are anxious as to what is \ngoing to happen here today. The Republican leader and I have been in \nclose contact the last several days. We are fortunate that we are now \nin a position to complete work today. We should be able to do it \nquickly. It all depends on the cooperation of Senators.\n  We actually know the House is planning to vote around 12:30 today. \nThey could do it more quickly. They could do it as late as 1 o'clock. \nWe have the ability, now that the papers have been filed over in the \nHouse, to act before they do, as we have done before. So we will have \nto see how the morning moves on.\n  We are working on a consent to have votes in relation to the \ntransportation conference report this morning. I know Senators have \ncalled me and, I am sure, the Republican leader on a number of \noccasions. As soon as we have something firmed up, we will let everyone \nknow.\n\n\n                          Health Care Decision\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed \nthat no family should live one illness or one accident away from \nbankruptcy. The Court decision is not a victory for Democrats or \nPresident Obama, it is a true victory for the American people. Let me \ngive you a few reasons why that is the case, and just a few.\n  Since the act was signed by President Obama, more than 6 million \nyoung people have signed up for their parents' health plan. Why is that \nimportant? As most people know--in the Senate, at least--I am from \nSearchlight, NV. It is a very small community. Someone I care a great \ndeal about was the assistant postmistress there. Her husband has been \naround town. They have been together for many years. They have a boy \nnamed Jeff. I can remember, when we first had our home in Searchlight, \nhe would help us as a young boy, climbing up into a Joshua tree and \nputting up Christmas tree lights.\n  Well, he has grown past that. He was in college and doing quite well. \nHe started getting sick. He had just turned 23. As embarrassing as it \nwas, he had to go to a doctor to find out what was wrong. He had \ntesticular cancer. That happened a matter of weeks after he was no \nlonger on the insurance plan of his parents. They had no money. They \nwere desperate to help their boy, and they did everything they could to \nhelp him.\n  He had two or three surgeries. His life was saved. It really put a \ndent in what limited savings they had. She worked part time in the post \noffice. He had worked down at the Mohave generating facility, which \nclosed. So they had limited means. It was very difficult on what \nsavings they had been able to accumulate.\n\n  That will not happen anymore. He would have been able to complete \ncollege because the magic age is not 22 anymore, it is 27. So that is \none thing, and 6 million young Americans have taken advantage of that. \nThey will not have to have the problems Jeff Hill had. He is doing OK \nnow. He recently\n\n[[Page S4732]]\n\nmarried. But it was a struggle for a long time, physically and \nemotionally. Because children can now stay on their parents' insurance \nuntil they are 26, no young person will have to defer his or her dreams \nto take a job that offers insurance.\n  Since health reform took effect, 5 million seniors have already saved \nabout $600 each on prescription drugs. The doughnut hole is being \nfilled. Maybe people watching this presentation here today do not know \nwhat the doughnut hole is, but every senior citizen knows what it is \nbecause it costs them lots of money.\n  Because of this law now no longer being debatable as far as whether \nit is going to stand--it is the law of the country--millions have \ngotten free wellness checks and cancer screenings. They could never \nhave done that before. Millions--free wellness checks and cancer \nscreenings. That means millions of seniors have more money in their \npockets for food, gas, and the electric bill. Frankly, a lot of them \nwould not have spent that money anyway; they would have just worried \nabout whether they had cancer or whether they should wait a while to go \nsee the doctor for their annual physical which was way overdue. It \nmeans millions of seniors, if, in fact, they are spending for this \nwellness check, will not have to anymore, and they can use this money \nfor food, gas, and electric bills.\n  Hundreds of thousands of businesses already offer their employees \nhealth insurance using tax credits. They are doing the right thing.\n  Since Congress passed the law, insurance companies can no longer put \nprofits ahead of people.\n  It is no secret that the insurance companies have been lobbying for a \nlong time. Now 17, 18 years ago, they lobbied against the Clinton \nhealth care plan. They were very effective. ``Harry and Louise'' ads \ndefeated that legislation. They spent millions of dollars. They tried \nto defeat this legislation, and they have been lobbying hard. I do not \nknow how they expected to affect the Supreme Court, but maybe they have \nways none of us understand. I think they wasted their money.\n  In the future, insurance companies will no longer be able to put \nprofits ahead of people. They can no longer discriminate against \nchildren with preexisting conditions.\n  I served in Congress with a man named James Bilbray, and we have been \nfriends since I was going to law school back here--Jimmy Bilbray. He \nhas had a wonderful career in politics in Nevada. But he and I as young \nmen back here were raising our little kids together. We were going to \nlaw school. We both worked here on Capitol Hill. His little boy Kevin \ngot so sick. He was just a baby--just a baby. He didn't know what was \nwrong. He had a diabetic coma. This little baby had diabetes. Kevin \nlived to be about 20 years old. He had a diabetic reaction when he was \ntaking a shower, fell over the stop on the bathtub where the shower was \nand drowned--it killed him. He died. Kevin Bilbray. He had diabetes.\n  Of course, getting insurance was always a problem for that family. No \nlonger. No longer. If a child like the Bilbrays', like little Kevin, \nhas diabetes, they will not have to worry about, can I get insurance? \nAnd not only will it apply in the future--it applies right now to \npeople under age 18, but in the future everybody who has a preexisting \ndisability will be entitled to insurance. They cannot be denied because \nof a preexisting disability.\n  It is not only diabetes, it is heart defects. I know he never talks \nabout this, but I know about it. Senator Durbin had a child who from \nthe time she was a baby had a heart defect. She was sick her whole \nlife. Dick and Loretta lost their girl a couple of years ago. She was \n40 years old, thereabouts. Her whole life, she had a heart defect. In \nthe future, people like that will be able to get insurance. They cannot \nbe denied.\n  Right over in the LBJ Room yesterday morning, at my ``Welcome to \nWashington,'' there were a number of people there. The granddaughter of \nsomeone with whom my oldest brother went to school--Teddy Vasquez's \ngrandchild--was there. Why? Because she was there representing her \nbrother, who has cystic fibrosis.\n  I do not know if the Presiding Officer has ever before been around \nanyone with cystic fibrosis, but, as I explained to them over there \nyesterday morning, one of my son's coaches had a son who had cystic \nfibrosis. They would have to beat on his chest. They had this process \nto try to loosen the stuff that accumulates in the lungs because of \nthis disease. Kids used to not live very long with this. We are doing a \nlot better now. We have some medicines. But in the future, anyone with \ncystic fibrosis will not be denied insurance because of this dread \ndisease. Now, if you are under 18, you cannot be denied insurance \nbecause you have this dread disease.\n  Insurance companies can no longer raise your rates for no reason. How \nmany times have we heard stories about insurance companies raising \nrates for no reason other than they wanted to? And there was no way to \nstop it. They can no longer drop coverage if you get sick. They did \nthat. They can no longer do that. That is now against the law of this \ncountry.\n  Millions of Americans are already seeing the benefit of this law, and \nsoon 35 million more who cannot afford health insurance will have \naccess to reasonably priced insurance and quality care. Here is how it \nworks. Each State will set up its own health insurance marketplace \ncalled an exchange, which will offer a menu of private insurance plans \nfrom which people can choose.\n  The Presiding Officer is a relatively new Senator here. I have been \nin Congress now for a long time. Every year, we get a menu of options, \nlike all Federal employees. Senators do not get treated any differently \nthan any other Federal employees. We get a number of options as to what \nwe want to buy, the price of one up here or down here. That is what we \nwant for everybody in America, something just like the millions of \nFederal employees have. That is what we will have.\n  We will offer a menu of private insurance plans from which people can \nchoose what they want. Once these exchanges are in place, insurance \ncompanies will no longer be able to discriminate against any American \nwith a preexisting health condition, just as I have talked about. They \nwill not be able to deny you insurance because you are sick. They will \nnot be able to charge you more just because you are a woman. That is a \nfact. They will not be able to do it anymore or because you do not \nalready have insurance. If you cannot afford the premiums, you will get \na tax credit to help pay for them.\n  But what if you are one of the 250 million Americans who already have \ninsurance? Nothing will change--nothing. Nothing will change except you \nwill no longer have to worry that if you lose your job, you will lose \nyour insurance. Nothing will change except that if you get cancer or \nhave a stroke, your insurance company will not be able to deny you \nlifesaving care because you have reached some arbitrary lifetime cap.\n  These are not theoretical. A man in Las Vegas was a car racer. He was \nnot racing a car, but somebody hurt him. He became a paraplegic. He got \nalong pretty well. He needed a lot of care. He arrived at some lifetime \ncap. He had an insurance policy. He had his own insurance. They cannot \ndo that anymore. That provision on this lifetime cap will help untold \nhundreds of thousands of people.\n  Nothing will change, except when one gets a checkup and preventive \nwill be free--a provision that has already helped 54 million Americans \nwith private insurance.\n  You will be able to keep your plan and keep your doctor. But now \nyou--not the insurance company--will be in control.\n  By August, almost 13 million people will get a rebate check from \ntheir insurance company because it spent too much on administrative \ncosts and not enough on health care. They can't any longer put all the \nprofits into these multimillion dollar bonuses and salaries people got. \nThey cannot do that; 80 percent of what they get has to be put into \nhelping people get well.\n  It is so very important to explain to people what is in this bill. \nAre these things people want to take away? I don't think so. They can \nyell and scream about ObamaCare but explain these individual \nprovisions. This money will come back in August. I was listening to \npublic radio this morning, and they interviewed someone who ran\n\n[[Page S4733]]\n\nan insurance exchange, I think they called it. He was waiting by the \nphone for this decision to come out yesterday. He was so happy because \nCNN and FOX announced the case had been overruled. He was so happy. But \nwhen he learned it was actually still in effect, he was very sad. Why? \nHe said: We will not be able to pay our salaries as much as we had.\n  He was paying a lot for salaries for the bosses and not enough money \ninto taking care of people.\n  The Affordable Care Act is already helping millions of Americans--\nseniors on Medicare, children with heart conditions, and students \nfollowing their dreams.\n  In the coming months, millions more will benefit from this law. That \ndoesn't mean the law is perfect. We all know that. We are willing to \nwork next year, and if there are problems to work out, we are happy to \nwork with our colleagues to do that.\n  But now the Supreme Court has spoken; it is time to renew our focus \non the most pressing challenge facing America: the high unemployment \nrate we have. Too many Americans are struggling, and Congress cannot \nafford to waste time refighting old battles. We need to work together \nto put Americans back to work.\n  As a side note, these people who talk about repeal, it would cause \nthe loss of 400,000 jobs. If we look at all the job statistics in the \npast year, some of the most significant growth is taking place in \nhealth care. I don't think we want to lose 400,000 jobs right off the \nbat.\n  Thanks to cooperation on both sides, I am glad to say the Senate will \nvote sometime today on the Transportation bill conference report. It is \na wonderful piece of legislation that includes student loans and the \nproblems we have had with flood insurance. These things will be \ncompleted fairly early today. The Flood Insurance Program being \nextended will allow millions of home closings to go forward at a time \nwhen our real estate market is beginning to rebound. Preventing \ninterest rates from doubling on 7 million students was a major priority \nfor all of us.\n  Passing the 2-year, 3 months Transportation bill will create or save \n2.8 million American jobs--many of them in the hard-hit construction \nindustry. It will also restore millions of miles of crumbling roadways, \nrailways, and bridges. It is very important. It streamlines the process \nand gets rid of a lot of the ability for entities to stall the \nconstruction of these much needed roads. I had an experience similar to \nthis in Nevada. That is why it was important to Senators Boxer and \nInhofe.\n  This has been a very productive week. It has been a fruitful session \nthat we have had. We have passed a bipartisan farm bill and have taken \na hard look at how we are going to make the Postal Service better. The \nfarm bill was very difficult and took a long time to get done.\n  I am optimistic the Senate will remain in the spirit of cooperation \nduring the next work period, when we consider a number of other \nimportant job creation measures and other things we need to do.\n  I hope my colleagues have a constructive week at home. We have a lot \nof work to do, and I understand that. I hope everybody is safe and \nhappy, and I certainly extend my recognition to the State of Colorado, \nwhich has had devastating fires, and the West is having real problems. \nThey have about 200 fires burning as we speak. Eleven of them are major \nfires. We have to make sure we give the firefighting people the \nresources to do this. I was happy, within the past month, to be part of \na program to advance the purchase of these tankers to fight these \nfires. We were able to do that.\n  When we come back to work in 10 days or so, everybody has to \nunderstand we have a lot to do to ensure this country's economic \nfuture. I look forward to taking up the challenge together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/29/senate-section/article/S4733-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4733-S4735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PILOT'S BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Commerce be discharged from further consideration of S. 1335 and the \nSenate now proceed to that matter.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report the bill \nby title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1335) to provide rights for pilots, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                         Pilot's Bill of Rights\n\n  Mr. Rockefeller. Mr. President, S. 1335, the Pilot's Bill of Rights, \ntakes several steps to protect the rights of pilots, including \nmodifications to the appeals process, and improvements to the Federal \nAviation Administration's Notice to Airman System and medical \ncertification process.\n  Most importantly, it preserves the FAA's authority to take actions to \nmaintain the safety of the air transportation system, and we want to be \nclear about the Congressional intent regarding one particular section \nof the bill.\n  Three provisions of the bill eliminate language in current statute \ngoverning the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) \nadjudication of appeals of FAA orders that deny, amend, modify, \nsuspend, or revoke an airman's certificate. Specifically, language in \n49 U.S.C Sec. Sec.  44703(d)(2), 44709(d)(3), and 44710(d)(1), which \nexpressly binds the NTSB to ``all validly adopted interpretations of \nlaws and regulations the Administrator carries out and of written \nagency policy guidance available to the public related to sanctions to \nbe imposed . . . unless the Board finds an interpretation to be \narbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not according to law.''\n  It is not the intention of the Senate to eliminate the NTSB's \npractice to observe the principles of judicial deference to the FAA \nAdministrator when reviewing airmen appeals. The Senate only finds that \nthis language is redundant of what is already provided for under the \nlaw and it is not the intent of the Senate to prevent the NTSB from \napplying the principles of judicial deference in adjudicating Federal \nAviation Administration cases.\n  The purpose of these changes is simply to make the statute consistent \nwith the laws governing all other Federal agencies. Thus, it is the \nintention of the Senate that the NTSB, in reviewing FAA cases, will \napply principles of judicial deference to the interpretations of laws, \nregulations, and policies that the Administrator carries out in \naccordance with the Supreme Court's ruling in Martin v. OSHRC, 449 U.S. \n114 (1991).\n  Mr. Inhofe. Mr. President, I concur.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Hutchison-\nInhofe amendment at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, \nbe read the third time and passed; that the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the measure be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2489) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                Surface Transportation Conference Report\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will address two issues. I commend, \nin particular, the senior Senator from Oklahoma for the extraordinary \nwork he has done to produce a transportation bill that has significant \nreforms in it. He has been tenacious and effective. He has tugged on \nour sleeves and pointed out to us repeatedly the importance of getting \nthis job done. I congratulate him for an extraordinary accomplishment.\n  With regard to the bill, the highway conference report contains \nsignificant reforms to the surface transportation program. Projects \nwill now be completed in a more timely manner because, for the first \ntime, there are hard deadlines on agencies to complete environmental \nreviews.\n  Also, States are given maximum flexibility to use their \ntransportation dollars the way they choose, rather than how Washington \ndictates. This bill is fully paid for with a package of offsets mostly \nincluded in the Senate-passed highway bill.\n  The conference report also contains important legislation to reform \nthe National Flood Insurance Program and prevent the interest on \ncollege student loans from doubling.\n  The flood insurance bill is a model of reform: It moves this long-\nfailing program closer to where it should be--the private sector. These \nreforms actually cut subsidies, save the taxpayers money, and greatly \nimprove the program's financial position. It was negotiated and \nreported out of committee on a bipartisan basis.\n  On the student loan issue, Republicans and Democrats worked hard to \nfind common ground. The agreement we have reached will ensure that \ncollege students who are already facing enormous challenges in the \nObama economy will not be paying higher interest rates next month.\n  Students can't wait for the President to get off the campaign trail \nand actually work with Congress to prevent student loan interest rates \nfrom rising this year. So while the President continues to ignore the \nbipartisan proposals sent more than 3 weeks ago, Senate Democrats \ndropped their demand for job-killing tax hikes and worked with \nRepublicans to find solutions.\n  It is nice to finally see the Senate actually work as the Senate used \nto. It proves that if this body ignores the campaign attacks from the \nPresident and if our Democratic friends stop pushing job-killing tax \nhikes, we can actually get a lot done around here. I, once again, thank \nmy colleagues for all their hard work on these important measures.\n\n\n                          Health Care Decision\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the most important issue brought to the \nfront page in the last 2 days is the state of the new ObamaCare law.\n  Two and a half years ago, President Obama teamed up with Democrats \nright here in Congress to pass a health care bill they knew most \nAmericans didn't want. Americans have been very clear about what they \nthought of this bill. So Democrats settled on a deeply dishonest sales \npitch aimed at convincing them otherwise.\n  Nearly every day since then, the promises that formed the very heart \nof that sales pitch have been exposed for the false promises they were.\n  Americans were promised lower health care costs. But, of course, they \nare going up. Americans were promised lower premiums, and they are \ngoing up. Seniors were promised Medicare would be protected; it was \nraided to pay for a new entitlement instead. We were promised it would \ncreate jobs; CBO predicts it will lead to 800,000 fewer jobs because of \nObamaCare. People were promised they could keep the plans they liked; \nmillions have now learned they cannot.\n  For 2 years, the list of broken promises has grown longer and longer \nand longer.\n  But yesterday morning, we got powerful confirmation of what may have \nbeen the biggest deception of all. For years, the President and his \nDemocratic allies in Congress have sworn up and down--sworn up and \ndown--that failing to comply with the individual mandate did not result \nin a tax on individuals or families. ``It is not a tax,'' they said.\n  The reason was obvious. If Americans knew that failure to comply \nresulted in a tax hike, of course, the bill would never have passed. If \nour friends on the other side had conceded the obvious--that it was, in \nfact, a tax hike--we all know it never would have passed. The President \nwould not be able to claim his health care bill didn't raise taxes on \nthe middle class, as he did again and again and again.\n  Yesterday, the Court blew the President's cover. In a narrowly upheld \ncase on one basis only--that the penalty associated with the individual \nmandate is a tax--the Court spoke. It said Congress doesn't have the \nconstitutional authority to mandate insurance coverage under the \ncommerce clause. Congress doesn't have the authority to mandate \nindividual insurance coverage under the commerce clause, but it \nobviously does have the power to tax. So they upheld the central \nprovision of the bill on the fact that the penalty for failing to \ncomply with it was a tax.\n  In the eyes of the Court, that is all the penalty tied to the \nindividual mandate ever was: a tax imposed by a Democratic Congress--\nwithout a single Republican vote--primarily, interestingly enough, on \nthe middle class. It is a tax on the middle class. Let's be very clear \nabout that. The tax connected to the individual mandate is not \nprimarily a tax on the rich but on the middle-class Americans who will \nbear the brunt of it.\n  Listen to this, colleagues. According to the CBO, at least 77 percent \nof the people paying this tax will meet the President's own definition \nof the middle class; 77 percent of the people paying this tax will meet \nthe President's own definition of the middle class.\n  Those who have to pay the tax will pay an average tax of $1,200. Even \nif they pay it every year, they still will not have insurance.\n  Yesterday's decision turns the President's campaign rhetoric on its \nhead. Those who will end up paying the heaviest burden for not buying \ngovernment-mandated insurance are not going to be the wealthiest \nAmericans--oh, no--but the very middle-class families the President \nclaims to defend.\n  That is the truth the Court unmasked yesterday.\n  Most Americans thought the process Democrats used to pass the health \ncare bill was unseemly, secretive, partisan, even antidemocratic. They \nalso thought it was unconstitutional for the government to create \ncommerce in order to regulate it--for the government to create commerce \nin order to regulate it.\n\n  All of that is still true. But what many Americans may not have \nappreciated when this bill passed was how empty all of the promises \nwere--how completely empty all the promises were. And at the center of \nthem all was the claim that failing to buy health insurance did not \nresult in a tax. That was the central claim: Failing to buy health \ninsurance did not result in a tax.\n  But the Court has now spoken: It is a tax--largely on the middle \nclass. This is just one more reason this law needs to be repealed in \nits entirety. With every passing day we learn something new about this \nterrible law. Not only does it make the problems in our\n\n[[Page S4736]]\n\nhealth care system worse, it leads to a tax on middle-class families \nwho are either unable or unwilling to purchase health insurance. What a \nterrible idea.\n  So it is time for Democrats to stop trying to defend the indefensible \nand join Republicans in wiping this colossal legislative mistake clear \noff the books. Yesterday's decision gives us the clearest proof yet \nthis bill has to go. It needs to be repealed to clear the way for \ncommonsense, step-by-step reforms that protect Americans' access to the \ncare they need from the doctor they choose at a lower cost. That is \nprecisely what Republicans intend to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, Senators \nare permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                          Health Care Decision\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday the Supreme Court overturned \nthe mandatory Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act. As of \nyesterday, the States now have a choice to expand or not expand \ncoverage to the poorest people in society without being subjected to \nharsh Federal penalties.\n  I would like to draw attention to a speech I gave on the Senate floor \nin December 2011 on the subject of the constitutionality of the \nMedicaid expansion. I expressed my concerns then about the potential \nimpact of a Supreme Court decision on Medicaid expansion.\n  I said on the floor that day:\n\n       A Supreme Court ruling in favor of the States in this case \n     could not only jeopardize the mandated Medicaid expansion in \n     the Affordable Care Act but could challenge the fundamental \n     structure of Medicaid and have broader implications outside \n     of health care.\n\n  The concerns I expressed then have, to a degree, come true.\n  Reading from a Washington Post editorial this morning about the Court \nruling on Medicaid:\n\n       This restriction of federal authority may have greater \n     ramifications than the court's limiting of the Commerce \n     Clause. One can imagine challenges to federal conditions \n     across a wide spectrum of programs, including but not limited \n     to the environment, education and transportation.\n\n  This decision overturns the mandatory expansion of the Medicaid \nProgram. While I realize most of the focus is on the decision related \nto the tax mandate, we should spend a moment talking about the \nconsequence of the Medicaid decision.\n  Mr. President, one of the goals of the health care reform was to \nprovide coverage for people in need. I would argue the people most in \nneed of coverage are people without a job, people without an income, \nand the poorest of the poor. The Affordable Care Act required States to \ncover people below poverty through Medicaid. States were mandated to \nexpand to cover people below poverty. Yesterday, the Supreme Court \nruled that mandatory expansion unconstitutional.\n  Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts said:\n\n       Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering \n     funds under the Affordable Care Act to expand the \n     availability of health care, and requiring the States \n     accepting such funds to comply with the conditions on their \n     use. What Congress is not free to do is to penalize States \n     that choose not to participate in that new program by taking \n     away their existing Medicaid funding.\n\n  With this decision, States now have the option to expand Medicaid to \ncover people below poverty. Mr. President, the States had that option \neven before the Affordable Care Act was passed. So what does this \ndecision mean in real terms?\n  It will be up to the States to determine if they will cover the \npoorest of the poor. The Federal Government cannot guarantee coverage. \nSo now people with jobs will have to purchase insurance under the tax \nmandate. People without an income, people who are below poverty, are \ndependent upon the State in which they reside.\n  I know some people will believe the choice is perfunctory, that \nMedicaid expansion will move forward because the Federal Government has \noffered to pay for more than 90 percent of the expansion. But if you \nwere a State, would you really trust a promise from a Federal \nGovernment that is $15 trillion in debt? If you were a State, would you \nreally trust an Obama administration that proposed eliminating that \nspecial Federal payment rate through a proposal known as the blended \nrate?\n  States will very reasonably be risk averse. States can now expand if \nthey choose to or not at all. No one should assume for a second all \nStates will expand to cover as much as was mandated under the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  Of course, one might think people below poverty could still get \nhealth care through tax credits, but the people who wrote this bill \nmade people below poverty ineligible for tax credits. That is right--\nineligible. It is all or nothing for the poor with Medicaid. With \ntoday's ruling, the answer is, nothing.\n  On December 15, 2011, I said on the Senate floor that the expansion \nof Medicaid and the coverage of poor people was in jeopardy because \n``the White House and the Democratic majority put their partisan goals \nahead of collaboration with Republicans and States to build legitimate \npublic policy.''\n  Today, that is the outcome. When people with income, people with jobs \nare mandated to purchase health insurance and face a tax penalty if \nthey do not, while the poorest people in society, those without a job \nor without income have a guarantee of nothing, I think victory laps are \npremature.\n  After this decision, a person in a family with an income of more than \n$80,000 a year would be guaranteed access to a subsidy to buy private \ninsurance, while a person in a family with no income would be \nguaranteed nothing. When people below poverty, the people who can least \nafford coverage or the consequence of not having coverage are left with \nnothing, it sounds like failure to me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, regarding yesterday's Supreme Court decision, \nthere have been a variety of very interesting editorials, op-ed pieces, \nand blogs--many of them erudite and very useful for the analysis of the \nCourt's opinion. Of course, it will take a long time for us to know \nprecisely how all of this will work out over time. I thought I might \nrefer to a couple of these opinions and op-eds and put them in the \nRecord for people to see what a sampling might look like so they can \nmore thoroughly analyze the opinion and then pose a question at the \nend.\n  I start with one of my friends, and I think one of the best \ncolumnists, even nationally, that I know. He writes for my local paper, \nthe Arizona Republic. His name is Bob Robb, and he writes in his column \non June 29:\n\n       Roberts' decision controlled the outcome, even though it \n     was fully joined by no other justice. Here's what he \n     concluded:\n       The federal government has no power under the \n     Constitution's Commerce Clause to require individuals to \n     purchase health insurance, as Obamacare does. However, the \n     federal government does have the power to impose a financial \n     penalty on people for not complying with the mandate the \n     federal government has no authority to impose. That's because \n     the penalty is actually a tax under Congress' constitutional \n     taxing authority.\n       However, the penalty is not a tax for purposes of the Anti-\n     Injunction Act, which would preclude the court from \n     considering the legality until someone actually pays it.\n\n  Obviously, Mr. President, these dilemmas require some explanation. It \nmay be--and this is my phrasing, not Bob Robb's--this is a good example \nof where the phrase of ``legal legerdemain'' comes into play.\n  Robb continues:\n\n       If Congress has no authority to require people to do \n     something, such as purchase health insurance, how can it \n     penalize them for not doing it?\n       And how can money owed exclusively because of failing to \n     comply with an unconstitutional mandate be regarded as a tax \n     and not a penalty?\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The purpose of the constitutional taxing power is to raise \n     the money to operate the government. The clause reads: \n     ``Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes . . \n     . to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and \n     general welfare of the United States.''\n       The purpose of the penalty for not buying health insurance, \n     however, isn't to raise revenue. The government would prefer \n     not to get any money from it at all. The purpose is to compel \n     compliance with the mandate that Roberts says the government \n     has no power to impose.\n       There is nothing in the Constitution that can remotely be \n     construed as giving Congress the power to tax people, not to \n     raise revenue but to punish them for failing to do what \n     Congress would like them to do.\n\n\n[[Page S4737]]\n\n\n  And Robb concludes:\n\n       If Congress cannot do something directly, it shouldn't be \n     able to do it indirectly through taxation.\n\n  Mr. President, this raises a very important question. If the taxing \npower can be used to institute mandates such as ObamaCare, the real \nquestion is, What limits are there on such taxing power? I believe this \nmay be one of the most important unanswered questions in Justice \nRoberts' opinion.\n  One attempt to square the circle, in effect, was by a writer named \nJoshua Hawley in the Daily Caller in his column entitled ``What's \nbehind Roberts' surprising decision?'' I note that Hawley comes to this \nwith some credentials, being described as a former law clerk to Chief \nJustice Roberts as well as an associate law professor at the University \nof Missouri. In effect, as I read Hawley's piece, he said Justice \nRoberts actually constrained Congress's power dramatically by, first of \nall, drawing a clear line on the reasonable and proper extension of the \ncommerce clause power. But he also said the taxing authority Roberts \nuses to justify Congress's action in ObamaCare is actually very \nlimited.\n  In fact, he says that Roberts attempted to make this case sui \ngeneris--that is the Latin phrase for ``one of a kind''--and that only \nin this particular case would the taxing authority be permissibly used \nfor Congress to require the people to do something.\n  I hope Hawley's analysis is correct. I am not so sure it is. Roberts' \nopinion certainly will make it more politically difficult for Congress \nto pass things that extend its authority because it will have to be \nclothed in the cloak of a tax, and Congress doesn't generally like to \npass new taxes on people. But Congress and the lawyers who advise us \nare pretty clever about phrasing legislation in such a way that it \nwould meet constitutional challenges.\n  Now that we have a new example of a power that we might exercise--\nnamely, this expanded taxing power--I suspect we will see efforts in \nthe future to clothe our legislation under the guise of that taxing \npower. If so, the constraints in Chief Justice Roberts' opinion would \nbe no constraints at all.\n  There is an old saying that hard cases make bad law. I don't know \nthat this was all that hard of a case, but it clearly resulted in a lot \nof different points of view from the Justices, from which one could \nconclude that at least they saw it as a hard case. I just hope the end \nresult is not bad law, as I have suggested it could be here today.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks the following pieces: first, the Robert Robb \ncolumn dated June 29 from the Arizona Republic; second, the Wall Street \nJournal editorial of June 28, ``ObamaCare and the Power to Tax''; a \nRich Lowry piece in National Review Online dated June 29, ``The Umpire \nBlinks''; a National View Online piece by The Editors dated June 28, \n``Chief Justice Roberts's Folly''; and the Joshua Hawley piece dated \nJune 28 from the Daily Caller.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, June 29, 2012]\n\n                  False Premise Lets `Obamacare' Go On\n\n                            (By Robert Robb)\n\n       For whatever reason, Chief Justice John Roberts decided to \n     rescue ``Obamacare'' from the constitutional trash heap.\n       His reasoning in doing so should be an embarrassment to \n     him. It certainly tossed more dirt on the burial site of the \n     Founders' vision of a federal government with limited, \n     enumerated powers.\n       Roberts' decision controlled the outcome, even though it \n     was fully joined by no other justice. Here's what he \n     concluded:\n       The federal government has no power under the \n     Constitution's Commerce Clause to require individuals to \n     purchase health insurance, as Obamacare does.\n       However, the federal government does have the power to \n     impose a financial penalty on people for not complying with \n     the mandate the federal government has no authority to \n     impose. That's because the penalty is actually a tax under \n     Congress' constitutional taxing authority.\n       However, the penalty is not a tax for purposes of the Anti-\n     Injunction Act, which would preclude the court from \n     considering its legality until someone actually pays it.\n       Where to begin?\n       If Congress has no authority to require people to do \n     something, such as purchase health insurance, how can it \n     penalize them for not doing it?\n       And how can money owed exclusively because of failing to \n     comply with an unconstitutional mandate be regarded as a tax \n     and not a penalty?\n       The purpose of the constitutional taxing power is to raise \n     the money to operate the government. The clause reads: \n     ``Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes . . \n     . to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and \n     general welfare of the United States.''\n       The purpose of the penalty for not buying health insurance, \n     however, isn't to raise revenue. The government would prefer \n     not to get any money from it at all. The purpose is to compel \n     compliance with the mandate that Roberts says the government \n     has no power to impose.\n       There is nothing in the Constitution that can remotely be \n     construed as giving Congress the power to tax people, not to \n     raise revenue but to punish them for failing to do what \n     Congress would like them to do.\n       If Congress cannot do something directly, it shouldn't be \n     able to do it indirectly through taxation.\n       Congress, unlike Roberts, understood that it was enacting a \n     penalty, not a tax. The law repeatedly calls the money owed \n     for failing to comply with the individual mandate a penalty.\n       Roberts says that what Congress calls it isn't dispositive \n     regarding whether it is a tax under the Constitution. But it \n     is dispositive for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.\n       The Anti-Injunction Act prevents those who are subject to \n     federal taxes from challenging their legality until after \n     they have been paid.\n       If the penalty is a tax, then no one could challenge its \n     legality until after someone pays it, which won't happen \n     until 2014. The case wouldn't properly have been before the \n     court.\n       So, Roberts declared that the money owed for failing to \n     comply with the individual mandate is a tax for purposes of \n     the Constitution because he says so. But it's a penalty for \n     purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act because Congress says so.\n       In Robertsworld, an unconstitutional mandate becomes not a \n     mandate if the money owed for not complying is dubbed a tax \n     and not a penalty. But the same money can be both a penalty \n     and a tax depending on who is asking and why.\n       It's as though Roberts were channeling Lewis Carroll in \n     writing the opinion.\n       This decision is hardly the end of the Obamacare saga. \n     Obamacare will implode as it is implemented.\n       The country will have to readdress the question of how to \n     most cost-effectively subsidize the care of the seriously and \n     chronically sick.\n       But for today, let's mourn the death of reasoning and \n     something more important.\n       In Federalist No. 45, James Madison wrote: ``The powers \n     delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal \n     government are few and defined.''\n       That's not the federal government we have today. Roberts' \n     pettifogging on Obamacare can be seen as its final interment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 28, 2012]\n\n                     ObamaCare and the Power To Tax\n\n                               (Opinion)\n\n       `Judicial tax-writing is particularly troubling. Taxes have \n     never been popular, see, e.g., Stamp Act of 1765.'\n       Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, \n     Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissenting from the majority \n     opinion that upheld most provisions of the Affordable Care \n     Act on Thursday:\n       The provision challenged under the Constitution is either a \n     penalty or else a tax. Of course in many cases what was a \n     regulatory mandate enforced by a penalty could have been \n     imposed as a tax upon permissible action; or what was imposed \n     as a tax upon permissible action could have been a regulatory \n     mandate enforced by a penalty. But we know of no case, and \n     the Government cites none, in which the imposition was, for \n     constitutional purposes, both. The two are mutually \n     exclusive. Thus, what the Government's caption should have \n     read was ``ALTERNATIVELY, THE MINIMUM COVERAGE PROVISION IS \n     NOT A MANDATE-WITH-PENALTY BUT A TAX.'' It is important to \n     bear this in mind in evaluating the tax argument of the \n     Government and of those who support it: The issue is not \n     whether Congress had the power to frame the minimum-coverage \n     provision as a tax, but whether it did so.\n       In answering that question we must, if ``fairly possible,'' \n     construe the provision to be a tax rather than a mandate-\n     with-penalty, since that would render it constitutional \n     rather than unconstitutional (ut res magis valeat quam \n     pereat). But we cannot rewrite the statute to be what it is \n     not. ``[A]lthough this Court will often strain to construe \n     legislation so as to save it against constitutional attack, \n     it must not and will not carry this to the point of \n     perverting the purpose of a statute . . . or judicially \n     rewriting it.'' In this case, there is simply no way, \n     ``without doing violence to the fair meaning of the words \n     used,'' to escape what Congress enacted: a mandate that \n     individuals maintain minimum essential coverage, enforced by \n     a penalty.\n       Our cases establish a clear line between a tax and a \n     penalty: ``[A] tax is an enforced contribution to provide for \n     the support of government; a penalty . . . is an exaction \n     imposed by statute as punishment for an unlawful act.'' In a \n     few cases, this Court has held that a ``tax'' imposed upon \n     private conduct was so onerous as to be in effect a penalty. \n     But we have never held--never--that a\n\n[[Page S4738]]\n\n     penalty imposed for violation of the law was so trivial as to \n     be in effect a tax. We have never held that any exaction \n     imposed for violation of the law is an exercise of Congress' \n     taxing power--even when the statute calls it a tax, much less \n     when (as here) the statute repeatedly calls it a penalty. \n     When an act ``adopt[s] the criteria of wrongdoing'' and then \n     imposes a monetary penalty as the ``principal consequence on \n     those who transgress its standard,'' it creates a regulatory \n     penalty, not a tax.\n       So the question is, quite simply, whether the exaction here \n     is imposed for violation of the law. It unquestionably is. \n     The minimum-coverage provision is found in [the Affordable \n     Care Act's individual-mandate provision], Sec. 5000A, \n     entitled ``Requirement to maintain minimum essential \n     coverage.'' (Emphasis added.) It commands that every \n     ``applicable individual shall . . . ensure that the \n     individual . . . is covered under minimum essential \n     coverage.'' (emphasis added). And the immediately following \n     provision states that, ``[i]f . . . an applicable individual \n     . . . fails to meet the requirement of subsection (a) . . . \n     there is hereby imposed . . . a penalty.'' (emphasis added). \n     And several of Congress' legislative ``findings'' with regard \n     to Sec. 5000A confirm that it sets forth a legal requirement \n     and constitutes the assertion of regulatory power, not mere \n     taxing power. . . .\n       We never have classified as a tax an exaction imposed for \n     violation of the law, and so too, we never have classified as \n     a tax an exaction described in the legislation itself as a \n     penalty. To be sure, we have sometimes treated as a tax a \n     statutory exaction (imposed for something other than a \n     violation of law) which bore an agnostic label that does not \n     entail the significant constitutional consequences of a \n     penalty--such as ``license'' or ``surcharge.'' But we have \n     never--never--treated as a tax an exaction which faces up to \n     the critical difference between a tax and a penalty, and \n     explicitly denominates the exaction a ``penalty.'' Eighteen \n     times in Sec. 5000A itself and elsewhere throughout the Act, \n     Congress called the exaction in Sec. 5000A(b) a ``penalty.''\n       Judicial tax-writing is particularly troubling. Taxes have \n     never been popular, see, e.g., Stamp Act of 1765, and in part \n     for that reason, the Constitution requires tax increases to \n     originate in the House of Representatives. That is to say, \n     they must originate in the legislative body most accountable \n     to the people, where legislators must weigh the need for the \n     tax against the terrible price they might pay at their next \n     election, which is never more than two years off. The \n     Federalist No. 58 ``defend[ed] the decision to give the \n     origination power to the House on the ground that the Chamber \n     that is more accountable to the people should have the \n     primary role in raising revenue.'' We have no doubt that \n     Congress knew precisely what it was doing when it rejected an \n     earlier version of this legislation that imposed a tax \n     instead of a requirement-with-penalty. Imposing a tax through \n     judicial legislation inverts the constitutional scheme, and \n     places the power to tax in the branch of government least \n     accountable to the citizenry.\n       Finally, we must observe that rewriting Sec. 5000A as a tax \n     in order to sustain its constitutionality would force us to \n     confront a difficult constitutional question: whether this is \n     a direct tax that must be apportioned among the States \n     according to their population. Perhaps it is not (we have no \n     need to address the point); but the meaning of the Direct Tax \n     Clause is famously unclear, and its application here is a \n     question of first impression that deserves more thoughtful \n     consideration than the lick-and-a-promise accorded by the \n     Government and its supporters. The Government's opening brief \n     did not even address the question--perhaps because, until \n     today, no federal court has accepted the implausible argument \n     that Sec. 5000A is an exercise of the tax power. And once \n     respondents raised the issue, the Government devoted a mere \n     21 lines of its reply brief to the issue. At oral argument, \n     the most prolonged statement about the issue was just over 50 \n     words. One would expect this Court to demand more than fly-\n     by-night briefing and argument before deciding a difficult \n     constitutional question of first impression.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the National Review Online, June 29, 2012]\n\n                           The Umpire Blinks\n\n                            (By Rich Lowry)\n\n       Chief Justice John Roberts famously defined himself as an \n     umpire in his confirmation hearings. But an umpire is willing \n     to make the toughest calls.\n       In his Obamacare decision, Roberts the umpire blinked. By \n     issuing a decision that forestalled the tsunami of criticism \n     that would have come his way had he struck down the law (as \n     an activist, a partisan, and an altogether rotten human \n     being), Roberts effectively rewrote the constitutionally \n     problematic portions of it. He overstepped his bounds. The \n     umpire called a balk, but gave the pitcher a do-over. The ref \n     called a foul, but didn't interrupt the play.\n       As a result, there's Obamacare as passed by Congress. Then \n     there's Obamacare as passed by the Supreme Court.\n       Obamacare as passed by Congress had a mandate to buy health \n     insurance and a penalty for failing to comply. Obamacare as \n     passed by the Supreme Court has an optional tax for those \n     without health insurance. Obamacare as passed by Congress \n     required states to participate in a massive expansion of \n     Medicaid, or lose all their federal Medicaid funds. Obamacare \n     as passed by the Supreme Court makes state participation in \n     the Medicaid expansion optional.\n       In pursuit of a judicial modesty deferential to Congress, \n     Roberts usurped its role. Obamacare as passed by Congress \n     didn't pass constitutional muster. Obamacare as passed by the \n     Supreme Court didn't pass Congress--and might not have passed \n     Congress had it been presented for an up-or-down vote \n     festooned with yet another tax.\n       Roberts vindicated the core of the constitutional argument \n     against the individual mandate that had been sneered at by \n     the legal establishment and pronounced preposterous by the \n     likes of Nancy Pelosi. The mandate is unprecedented in that \n     it doesn't regulate existing activity; it compels people to \n     undertake an activity--namely, buying insurance--that \n     Congress then regulates under the Interstate Commerce Clause. \n     This stretches the Commerce Clause beyond the breaking point.\n       The chief even reverted to the widely derided broccoli \n     argument: If the federal government can make you buy \n     insurance, it can make you eat vegetables. The government's \n     logic, Roberts wrote, ``authorizes Congress to use its \n     commerce power to compel citizens to act as the Government \n     would have them act. That is not the country the Framers of \n     our Constitution envisioned.''\n       Then, Roberts went out in search of some way, any way, to \n     find the mandate constitutional. He alighted on the argument \n     that the mandate isn't a mandate at all, but a tax. Never \n     mind that the tax argument was an afterthought in the \n     administration's defense of the law. Never mind that \n     administration officials, from the president on down, \n     vociferously denied that it was a tax during the debate over \n     the bill. Never mind that the law itself never defines it as \n     a tax and includes the mandate (and its penalty) in a \n     different title of the act from the revenue provisions. ``To \n     say that the Individual Mandate merely imposes a tax is not \n     to interpret the statute, but to re-write it,'' the four \n     conservative dissenters from the Roberts opinion write. The \n     chief was willing to take out his rewrite pen to avoid \n     striking down the mandate. He did the same to keep from \n     throwing out the Medicaid expansion. He considers it, too, an \n     offense against the constitutional order. Wherever exactly \n     the line for impermissible coercion of the states falls, he \n     noted, ``this statute is surely beyond it.''\n       Roberts gets points for cleverness. He set clear \n     constitutional boundaries without striking down the law. He \n     largely sided with the critics of Obamacare without enraging \n     its supporters. He came up with the only 54 decision that \n     wouldn't subject his court to the calumny of the Obama \n     administration and law-school deans everywhere. All the op-\n     eds that had been drafted trashing the legitimacy of the \n     court have been filed away for now.\n       As chief justice, Roberts has competing priorities, of \n     course. But it's not his job to redraft laws under the guise \n     of judicial restraint. On Obamacare, the umpire struck out.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the National Review Online, June 28, 2012]\n\n                     Chief Justice Roberts's Folly\n\n                            (By the Editors)\n\n       In today's deeply disappointing decision on Obamacare, a \n     majority of the Supreme Court actually got the Constitution \n     mostly right. The Commerce Clause--the part of the \n     Constitution that grants Congress the authority to regulate \n     commerce among the states--does not authorize the federal \n     government to force Americans to buy health insurance. The \n     Court, by a 5-4 margin, refused to join all the august legal \n     experts who insisted that of course it granted that \n     authorization, that only yahoos and Republican partisans \n     could possibly doubt it. It then pretended that this \n     requirement is constitutional anyway, because it is merely an \n     application of the taxing authority. Rarely has the maxim \n     that the power to tax is the power to destroy been so apt, a \n     portion of liberty being the direct object in this case.\n       What the Court has done is not so much to declare the \n     mandate constitutional as to declare that it is not a mandate \n     at all, any more than the mortgage-interest deduction in the \n     tax code is a mandate to buy a house. Congress would almost \n     surely have been within its constitutional powers to tax the \n     uninsured more than the insured. Very few people doubt that \n     it could, for example, create a tax credit for the purchase \n     of insurance, which would have precisely that effect. But \n     Obamacare, as written, does more than that. The law \n     repeatedly speaks in terms of a ``requirement'' to buy \n     insurance, it says that individuals ``shall'' buy it, and it \n     levies a ``penalty'' on those who refuse. As the conservative \n     dissent points out, these are the hallmarks of a ``regulatory \n     penalty, not a tax.''\n       The law as written also cuts off all federal Medicaid funds \n     for states that decline to expand the program in the ways the \n     lawmakers sought. A majority of the Court, including two of \n     the liberals, found this cut-off unconstitutionally coercive \n     on the states. The Court's solution was not to invalidate the \n     law or the Medicaid expansion, but to rule that only the \n     extra federal funds devoted to the expansion could be cut \n     off. As the dissenters rightly point out, this solution \n     rewrites the law--and arbitrarily, since Congress could have \n     avoided the constitutional problem in many other ways.\n\n[[Page S4739]]\n\n       The dissent acknowledges that if an ambiguous law can be \n     read in a way that renders it constitutional, it should be. \n     It distinguishes, though, between construing a law charitably \n     and rewriting it. The latter is what Chief Justice John \n     Roberts has done. If Roberts believes that this tactic avoids \n     damage to the Constitution because it does not stretch the \n     Commerce Clause to justify a mandate, he is mistaken. The \n     Constitution does not give the Court the power to rewrite \n     statutes, and Roberts and his colleagues have therefore done \n     violence to it. If the law has been rendered less \n     constitutionally obnoxious, the Court has rendered itself \n     more so. Chief Justice Roberts cannot justly take pride in \n     this legacy.\n       The Court has failed to do its duty. Conservatives should \n     not follow its example--which is what they would do if they \n     now gave up the fight against Obamacare. The law, as \n     rewritten by judges, remains incompatible with the country's \n     tradition of limited government, the future strength of our \n     health-care system, and the nation's solvency. We are not \n     among those who are convinced that we will be stuck with it \n     forever if the next election goes wrong: The law is also so \n     poorly structured that we think it may well unravel even if \n     put fully into effect. But we would prefer not to take the \n     risk.\n       It now falls to the Republicans, and especially to Mitt \n     Romney, to make the case for the repeal of the law and for \n     its replacement by something better than either it or the \n     health-care policies that preceded it. Instead of trusting \n     experts to use the federal government's purchasing power to \n     drive efficiency throughout the health sector--the vain hope \n     of Obamacare's Medicare-cutting board--they should replace \n     Medicare with a new system in which individuals have \n     incentives to get value for their dollar. Instead of having \n     Washington establish a cartel for the insurance industry, \n     they should give individuals tax credits and the ability to \n     purchase insurance across state lines. Instead of further \n     centralizing the health-care system, in short, they should \n     give individuals more control over their insurance.\n       Opponents should take heart: The law remains unpopular. Let \n     the president and his partisans ring their bells today, and \n     let us work to make sure that they are wringing their hands \n     come November.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Daily Caller, June 28, 2012]\n\n              What's Behind Roberts' Surprising Decision?\n\n                           (By Joshua Hawley)\n\n       Say this for the lead opinion in the health care case the \n     Supreme Court handed down Thursday: nobody saw that coming. \n     Chief Justice Roberts joins with the court's more liberal \n     wing to uphold the Affordable Care Act . . . as a tax? The \n     result is, to put it mildly, counterintuitive. Scribes have \n     been busily dissecting the chief justice's doctrinal analysis \n     from the instant the opinion went viral, but here's a \n     different thought: doctrine may not be the key to this \n     judgment. As Leo Strauss once made a point of telling his \n     students, a text can be read in many different ways, and will \n     mean different things depending on the lens with which one \n     reads it. The text the chief justice published on Thursday \n     may or may not make good sense read as constitutional \n     doctrine. But read it as constitutional politics and things \n     get more interesting.\n       Not politics in the way the Washington punditry means, of \n     course. Roberts' opinion has nothing to do with helping or \n     hurting President Obama's re-election chances this fall. The \n     truth is, Supreme Court justices are rarely interested in \n     that sort of thing. They see themselves as above partisan \n     allegiances and the grand questions of law they decide as \n     more important than run-of-the-mill partisan disputes.\n       No, I mean politics in the constitutional sense, concerning \n     the Supreme Court's role in the Constitution's structure. The \n     danger this case held for the court from the beginning was \n     the possibility--indeed, high likelihood--that it would draw \n     the institution into an acute confrontation with the \n     executive branch in the middle of an election year, and at \n     the same time force the justices into the thick of a policy \n     debate where they have no genuine expertise. The chief \n     justice's opinion can be fruitfully read as a sort of \n     maneuver, an effort to avoid these evils while simultaneously \n     blocking the federal government's attempted power grab.\n       Consider: Roberts begins with the Commerce Clause question, \n     where the Obama administration placed nearly all the weight \n     of its argument. According to the administration, the \n     Commerce Clause permits Congress to regulate any behavior (or \n     non-behavior) that has some incidental effect on commerce. \n     Roberts rejects that contention root and branch. Indeed, for \n     the first time in the Supreme Court's modern Commerce Clause \n     jurisprudence, he announces a clear and decisive limit to \n     what the federal government may do with its commerce \n     authority: it may regulate only actual economic activity, and \n     then only if the activity has a substantial effect on \n     interstate commerce. It may not regulate a person's choice \n     not to enter the stream of commerce in the first place.\n       Had this been the sum and substance of the opinion, \n     liberals would have bewailed it as the constitutional \n     apocalypse they feared. But of course it is not the end; \n     Roberts goes on to the administration's secondary argument. \n     Yet by placing the Commerce Clause discussion where he does, \n     by holding unequivocally that the individual mandate cannot \n     survive on commerce grounds, Roberts makes the Commerce \n     Clause holding necessary to the final judgment. That means \n     the limits on the commerce authority he announced (and with \n     which the four dissenting justices agree) will control in \n     future cases.\n       This is a significant, even major, development, but one \n     that is largely concealed by the opinion's ultimate judgment. \n     Yet even that judgment turns out to be rather less a victory \n     for the government than it first seems.\n       The key move in Roberts' opinion is his conclusion that the \n     individual mandate is actually a sort of tax, and therefore \n     constitutional by virtue of Congress' unquestioned power to \n     tax. That allows the mandate to stand, yes--but effectively \n     makes the mandate sui generis, and thereby denies the \n     government a new source of regulatory power.\n       This is why: Roberts does not say that the government may \n     now regulate anything it likes by calling the regulation a \n     tax. He says this mandate can be read as a tax in these \n     circumstances--that is, in light of the fact that it would be \n     unconstitutional on any other ground and the court is \n     supposed to avoid finding statutes unconstitutional if it \n     can--and on these grounds: because it is administered by the \n     IRS through the tax code and operates in many respects like a \n     normal tax. Only if future regulatory schemes can meet all \n     these criteria would they be valid under the taxing power. \n     Yet Roberts does not give a single example of any such \n     scheme--and we know for a fact, because they have told us \n     repeatedly, that members of Congress would never have voted \n     for this regulation if they had believed it was a tax.\n       Making the mandate a tax has at least one other effect. It \n     makes repeal easier. Now that the mandate has been deemed \n     taxation, it can likely be jettisoned through use of the \n     reconciliation process--meaning the Senate will need to \n     muster only a bare majority for repeal, not 60 votes.\n       By converting the mandate to a tax, then, Roberts limits \n     the ability of the government to do the same sort of thing in \n     the future and underlines the political unpopularity of the \n     law, all while allowing the law to stand. And because it does \n     stand, the court is spared a nasty turn at center stage in \n     the November elections.\n       Whether the chief justice's stratagem actually works is a \n     different question. Suffice it to say, I have my doubts. The \n     text and structure of the law seem overwhelmingly to indicate \n     that the mandate is a legal requirement--namely, to buy \n     insurance--enforced with a fine. The mandate does not qualify \n     as a tax under the Supreme Court's settled rules for \n     identifying taxes, and both the text of the law and those who \n     wrote it said it was not.\n       But then, Roberts' aim may be less to apply tax doctrine \n     than to shift the law's fate from the court to the voters. At \n     the beginning of his opinion, the chief justice pointedly \n     notes that the court ``do[es] not consider whether the Act \n     embodies sound policies. That judgment is entrusted to the \n     Nation's elected leaders.'' He repeats this sentiment at the \n     opinion's close, but with a subtle variation. ``[T]he Court \n     does not express any opinion on the wisdom of the Affordable \n     Care Act, he writes, for ``[u]nder the Constitution, that \n     judgment is reserved to the people.'' Could it be that the \n     chief justice is asking the people to render a verdict on the \n     leaders who wrote the law in the first place? In all events, \n     they should take him up on it.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I also refer people to an excellent piece in \nthe Wall Street Journal, ``A Triumph and Tragedy for the Law,'' by \nDavid Rivkin, Jr., and Lee Casey, both fine lawyers who frequently \nopine on matters of this sort.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n          125th Anniversary of the United Way of West Virginia\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, to lighten the mood a little bit today, I \nrise to recognize West Virginia's United Way as this special \norganization celebrates its 125th anniversary.\n  The United Way was founded in 1887 by community leaders in Denver, \nCO. The renowned organization originated through a group of individuals \nwho came together with the drive to improve community conditions. Since \nthen, the organization has grown to 1,800 community-based United Ways \nin 41 countries and remains the world's largest privately supported \nnonprofit, raising nearly $5 billion annually.\n  In our little State of West Virginia, United Way has touched the \nlives of so many. United Way volunteers have clocked thousands of hours \nof community service through health services,\n\n[[Page S4740]]\n\nsenior assistance programs, student tutoring, nutrition sites, job \nskills training, and financial literacy services.\n  United Way has enthusiastically embraced local institutions \nthroughout our State. This wonderful organization has provided for at-\nrisk teens at residential treatment centers, such as the Daymark around \nKanawha Valley. It has supported comprehensive medical and health \nservices at establishments such as the West Virginia Chapter of the \nAlzheimer's Association, West Virginia Health Right, Cabell Huntington \nChildren's Hospital, Thomas Memorial Hospital, and the Putnam County \nDental Health Council. United Way has supported family counseling at \nthe Kanawha Valley Fellowship Home and at Family Counseling Connection. \nIt has also benefited emergency assistance facilities, such as the \nBoone County Community Organization and Madison Baptist Church, \nMountain Mission, and Nitro-St. Alban's Care and Share.\n  In 2011 alone, 68,337 individuals were served by United Way-supported \nprograms in West Virginia alone. More than 13,162 children and youth \nbenefited from the services of United Way partner agencies, and more \nthan 26,997 people received financial assistance from a United Way \npartner agency. In addition, nearly 28,000 people received health-\nrelated assistance from a United Way partner agency.\n  I have always been an avid supporter of United Way and their \ncommunity service efforts. My wife Gayle also served as chairwoman of \nMarion County's United Way. I applaud the organization's ability to \ninspire members in their communities to work together and improve all \naspects of their neighborhoods.\n  United Way has so many laudable goals. The organization is working to \npromote a healthier society by working with families to develop healthy \nlifestyles. While Americans continue to struggle in tough economic \ntimes, United Way has worked with families to help them achieve \nfinancial stability. For example, United Way launched the Financial \nStability Partnership, which aims to halve the approximately 40 million \nAmericans who are working in low-paying jobs without basic health \nbenefits. United Way has also targeted key areas of education, \naddressing problems such as the student dropout rate and preparing \nchildren for success at an early age.\n  United Way also has identified community health care needs and \nfocuses efforts on changing health policies and practices for Americans \nof all ages. About 47 million Americans don't have health care \ncoverage, and more than 80 percent are working families. The \norganization tackles tough health problems, such as health insurance \ncoverage, along with the obesity epidemic and prescription drug abuse. \nThese are tough issues that oftentimes have no easy solutions.\n  I applaud United Way and all of its staff members, its volunteers, \nand community leaders for their efforts to improve the quality of life \nin all of our communities. Today the United Way has every reason to \ncelebrate its success as they face this impressive milestone. I once \nagain congratulate their achievements, and I look forward to seeing \nwhat this great organization will accomplish in the next 125 years and \nbeyond.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                         Pilot's Bill of Rights\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, before the Senator from West Virginia \nleaves, I would like to publicly thank him for all his support in \nsomething that just happened a few minutes ago; that is, passage of the \nPilot's Bill of Rights.\n  Several--certainly Senator Begich--have been working hard, including \nSenator Pryor and Senator Manchin, as well as many on the Republican \nside. But it is a reality now.\n  This is kind of a strange day for me because I have been working on \ntwo bills for 1\\1/2\\ years, and both will become a reality on the same \nday: the highway bill that everyone knows about and then the Pilot's \nBill of Rights that only pilots know about.\n  I have been a pilot for 55 years, and I get the calls and complaints \nthat come in. But pilots are really the only ones in our society who \nare denied access to justice like every other citizen has, and this \ncorrects it. So I just want to say to my friend that I very much \nappreciate his support in making this a reality.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, if I may say I appreciate the leadership \nof my good friend from Oklahoma and his unwavering support in bringing \nthis to all of our attention. I have been a pilot for not quite 55 \nyears, but 45 years, and I understand completely. Senator Inhofe \nbrought it to the attention of all of us, even the nonpilots here. His \nsteadfast leadership in support of this action and also his ability to \nwork across the aisle with those on our side of the aisle, Democrats, I \nappreciate so much.\n  I know Senator Boxer feels very compelled about this and the \nSenator's leadership in working with her on the Transportation bill and \nboth of them bringing that to the forefront for all of us. We are all \ngoing to benefit from that.\n  I thank the Senator and look forward to continuing to work with him.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. President, I will make a couple comments and be more detailed \nlater. I know a lot of people will want to talk about the bill that \nwill most likely pass today in both the House and the Senate.\n  A lot of people are not aware of the fact that a general aviation \npilot doesn't have the same access to remedies as everybody else does. \nWhat makes this a little bit more compelling to do something about is \nthat if you are not a pilot, you may not appreciate the fact that a lot \nof them are single-issue people.\n  I had an experience where my license was in jeopardy for something \nthat we found out I didn't do. I thought about all these complaints I \nhave had over the years about abusive treatment by some of the \nenforcement people, and I never appreciated it until it happened to me.\n  I know more people in the FAA who do a great job. They are very \nconscientious. These are career people. The problem is that every once \nin a while you have someone in the field with enforcement powers who \njust can't handle that kind of power.\n  I was mayor of Tulsa for several years a number of years back. We had \na great police force, but every now and then you had someone on the \nforce who couldn't handle the power. They would abuse that power, and \nyou would have to seek them out. And that is what this is all about--\nyou hear from these people when abuses take place.\n  So what we have done is we have corrected that. We have a system set \nup in this legislation that if someone is accused of or cited for doing \nsomething that was wrong or that might be a violation of one of the \nFARs, that person will now have access to the evidence that would be \nused against that person.\n  People might say: Well, wasn't that happening anyway? No, it wasn't. \nWhen this happened to me, I can remember very well--and I say to the \nPresiding Officer because we are very close and he knows I have been \nactive in aviation for a long time--one year ago in October, I went to \nland at one of the southernmost airports in America, in South Texas, \none at which I have landed more than 200 times. I know every square \nfoot of it. It is a noncontrolled field.\n  When I came in--there is a thing called NOTEM, Notice to Airmen. You \nare supposed to and you should find out what the NOTEMs are on the \nrunway you will be landing on so if there is work on the runway--any \ntowers going up, construction going on--you will know that in advance. \nThat is your obligation.\n  The problem is there has never been a central location where that can \nbe found. In this case there was no NOTEM that had been published. \nThere I go in, with the controller in the valley down there who has \nactually cleared me to land. Here I am, a United States Senator. It \ntook me 4 months to get the voice recorder and I never did find out, \nearly on, what the evidence was against me. It turned out fine, but \nnevertheless 4 months to get a voice recording that you were cleared to \nland, that is unreasonable.\n  I see my friend from Indiana is on the floor. I do not want to take \nany more time on this, but on the NOTEM situation we will have a \ncentral location for that.\n  The other problem we are having right now is medical certification. I\n\n[[Page S4741]]\n\nhave case after case. In fact, at the AOPA, Aircraft Owners and Pilots \nAssociation--we are talking about 400,000 pilots out there--they have \nas their No. 1 concern the lack of consistency and uniformity in \nmedical certification. A person could be a pilot and have a condition, \ncould be a light heart attack or something, temporarily lose his \nlicense, then go back and have it reinstated. However, if he lives in \nanother town, has a different doctor, that may not happen. So we have \npeople out there who have lost their licenses. We are going to have a \npanel set up that is going to include the general aviation, include the \nmedical community, and try to get uniformity. So those are three of the \nreforms we have in this legislation.\n  I yield the floor. I will be talking about that later and also \ntalking about the upcoming highway bill. I want to remind people, my \ngood conservative friends, people who are trying to say this is not a \nconservative bill--it is. The worst thing we can do is continue to \noperate our roadbuilding and our construction in this country on \nextensions. When you do an extension you lose about 30 percent of the \nmoney. Obviously, the conservative position is to do this.\n  We have reforms, incredible reforms, enhancement reforms. We will be \ntalking about that during the course of the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, can I ask what the procedure is regarding \ntime?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senators are permitted to speak for \n10 minutes each.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nspeak up to 20 minutes. I do not intend to take that much time, I do \nnot think I will take that much time, but I think I will probably go \nover the 10-minute limit.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, and I will \nnot object, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to have 20 \nminutes following my friend from Indiana.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Surface Transportation\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise here today to express my deep \nconcern with this transportation conference report; in particular, \nabout a provision that was slipped into the transportation conference \nreport literally in the dark of night earlier this week.\n  This provision, which I will describe, could have a devastating \neffect on my State as well as the State of Illinois. The Greater \nChicago metropolitan region--whether it is northwest Indiana or \nnortheast Illinois--is a region that works together. It is part of the \nexpanded metropolitan area. A critical part of this is a waterway, \nwhich allows goods to be transferred up and down all the way to the \ndelta and the Mississippi and all the way out to the St. Lawrence \nSeaway. It is the middle-west access to commerce that centers around \nthe Chicago-northwest Indiana area.\n  This provision, which was slipped in without debate, without \nconsideration--it did not appear in the Senate bill, the transportation \nbill, and it did not appear in the House transportation bill and \ntherefore is a blatant violation of rule XXVIII, which simply states \nyou cannot do this kind of thing--but it was done anyway. I will at the \nproper point here raise an objection to that in a procedural way.\n  Let me first talk, if I could, about the way in which we do business \naround here. Throughout my campaign in 2010 to return to the Senate, I \ncontinually heard from people as to how frustrated they were with the \nprocess by which laws are passed. We come home and people say why did \nyou vote against that? You say I voted against that because it included \nthis over here which was not relevant to it, and even though I liked \nthe rest of the bill I did not like this part--or vice versa. I voted \nfor this even though I did not like what it included because they \npackaged it all together and therefore there is nothing on record as to \nwhere I stand. They say to us where do you stand? We don't know whether \nyour yes is a yes or your no is a no because it is so confusing the way \nyou mix the whole thing together.\n  That is exactly what is happening here today. We have taken a \ntransportation bill, which was adeptly led by the Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Oklahoma, they did a marvelous job \nputting a transportation package together, and now it is merged with \ntwo other major provisions. So we get one vote on this. People say: I \nhave a real problem with the student loan bill or I have a real problem \nwith the flood insurance bill, but I wanted to vote for the \ntransportation bill. Now I am stuck in the position of having to vote \nyes on the whole thing, except what I have a problem with, another bill \nover here, or no, even though I want parts of the other bills to pass.\n  Then we go home and explain this to the people we represent and they \nsay: Why can't you guys and ladies take up one thing, vote yes or vote \nno, come home, defend your vote, but we at least know where you stand? \nInstead of this gobbledygook, throw everything in one big pot and vote \nyour yes or vote your no. The way we package bills here, it is no \nwonder people are skeptical. It is no wonder our approval rating is \nwhere it is. This gobbledygook, so-called magic dust that we use around \nhere to obscure what we stand for and stand against, is very \nfrustrating for the American people. I can't tell you how much that has \nbeen expressed to me when I can go home and talk to them and try to \nexplain certain votes and procedures. They say be straight up, be \ntransparent. Pick out something; you are either for it or against it. \nWe will evaluate whether we want to support you or not support you in \nthe next election on the basis of your voting, but when you cloud over \nthe whole thing we do not know what is going on. That is one thing, \npackaging bills.\n\n  Second, we have a problem here, a major problem with our debt. We \nhave known that. We spent the first 6 months of 2011 trying to come up \nwith a long-term solution which would restructure some of our spending \nand put a lid on some of our spending. Finally, by August of 2011, \nCongress reached an agreement called the Budget Control Act which \nbasically put caps on how much we would spend, trying to hold down this \nplunge into debt.\n  By the way, just before I came over here I checked the debt clock \nwhich I have on my Web site. The numbers of course turn faster than you \ncan write them down because that is how fast we are plunging into more \ndebt, but as of probably minutes or so ago, our national debt stood at \n$15 trillion, nearly $16 trillion.\n  None of us can comprehend what $1 trillion is. It is impossible. \nThere have been all kinds of examples--if you stack dollars on top of \neach other you can go to the Moon and back and so forth--but I think it \nis important that we understand the gravity of our situation in terms \nof our plunge into debt and what impact it is going to have on the \nfuture for this country and what a debt burden it is going to be on \nfuture generations now getting ever closer to--$15,935,594,616,879 was \nwhat our debt was. That is 14 digits; 15,935,594,616,879.\n  We took a little bit of a step in August, a mini step in August, \nsaying we are going to cap this spending so we do not spend more than \nthat going forward. That will at least slow down the rate of plunging \ninto debt. It does not begin to do what we need to do to address this, \nbut it will slow it down.\n  What have we done since? What we have done is bring a number of bills \nto this floor, all of which continue to spend beyond our means. I did \nnot vote for the Budget Control Act because I had a lot of skepticism \nabout it. First of all, I felt it was woefully short of what we needed \nand, second, I believe that, having served here before and seen how \nthis process works, I thought we are going to waive points of order \ntime after time.\n  We congratulate each other by voting for spending controls. ``This is \nan important step to dealing with our budget crisis. We have committed \nnow not to spend more than the budget we deemed allows.''\n  The postal reform bill violated budget rules; the student loan \ninterest rate extension, it looks as though we have the score now, and \nwe are going to violate agreed to levels; the Senate version that went \nover on the transportation bill violated budget rules; the payroll tax \nextension and the Violence Against Women Act--all violated what\n\n[[Page S4742]]\n\nwe promised we would do. And we wonder why the American people are \nskeptical? We wonder why our approval rating is in the low double \ndigits? I mean really low, almost into single digits--why people are \nfrustrated and upset with us? Because we tell them we have made this \npromise to be fiscally responsible and virtually every bill we bring up \nhere is irresponsible and we waive what we had agreed to do. We can \nhardly blame them for their skepticism here.\n  Let me talk about this middle-of-the-night stuff. Another problem you \nhave--you go home and what you simply can't explain is the fact that, \nno, this was not talked about in the Senate; no, this was not talked \nabout in the House; there was no process--yet somebody, as we tried to \nmerge the two bills, in the dark of the night, unnamed, no process, \nslipped in a provision and there it is. Usually we find out about this \nlater.\n  In this case we had a process. Senator Coats from Indiana worked with \nSenator Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and worked with another \nDemocrat, the senior Senator from Ohio, to come to an agreement on a \nprovision that impacted our area, the Great Lakes area, in a \nsignificant way. That was part of the Senate Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill.\n  In the dark of the night, during the conference deliberations, \nanother provision was added, not the bipartisan provision by Senators \nlooking out for the economic interests of their State. And by the way, \nthe economic interests of this country--because what was dropped in, in \nthe middle of the night, is something that could potentially cost our \nGovernment and therefore cost our taxpayers hundreds of billions of \ndollars.\n  We were fortunate enough to have discovered that because bringing \nthose bills to the floor was delayed and we had time to dig into it and \nall of a sudden find out that this was done. What is egregious here is \nthat this is not a partisan issue. We all know the House is controlled \nby my party. I don't know who put this in. I don't know exactly the \nmotives as to why they put this in. But here it is, a dark-of-the-night \nslip it into the bill and overturn something that was processed through \nthe appropriations committee, deliberated, discussed, and voted on.\n  So what are the consequences of all that? What does this have to do \nwith what I am talking about here? It sounds minuscule. We are talking \nabout Asian carp. Why is the Senator from Indiana talking about Asian \ncarp and hundreds and billions of dollars of costs? Let me tell you \nwhy. Asian carp is a generic term for four species of nonnative fish: \ngrass, bighead, black, and silverhead carp. These fish were introduced \nto the United States in the 1970s to assist agricultural interests in \nthe southern States.\n  At some point--probably through flooding--the carp escaped into the \nMississippi River system, and they have since spread throughout the \nwhole watershed. They are voracious eaters, which make them beneficial, \nand we can see why they were imported. They were beneficial for \ncontrolled agricultural settings, fish farms, and so forth, but they \ncreate serious ecological challenges when competing for food with \nnative species.\n  I agree wholeheartedly that the spread of Asian carp throughout the \nMississippi River and potentially into the Great Lakes is a serious and \npressing problem, and I am committed to addressing this, as is Senator \nDurbin and Senator Brown from Ohio. We worked out a compromise \nagreement in terms of how we should go forward with this.\n  A number of steps have already been taken by the Corps of Engineers. \nIn 2002, the Army Corps of Engineers installed the first of a series of \nelectric barriers along the lower reach of the Chicago area waterway \nsystem. In doing so, they believe, to date, they have successfully \nprevented the migration of carp into the Great Lakes.\n  In 2009, the Corps began DNA testing to detect Asian carp in \nlocations upstream in the barrier system. The testing showed these \nbarriers have been very effective--to use the Corps' words--in \npreventing Asian carp from entering the waterway. In fact, when the \nIllinois Department of Natural Resources wanted to check this out, they \npurposefully dumped a bunch of toxins into the Chicago waterway to \ndiscover the extent of the Asian carp infestation. Those toxins killed \ntens of thousands of fish, but only one Asian carp was found among \nthem. Since that time, the Army Corps has firmly held that the electric \nbarriers are working as designated.\n  Furthermore, in 2010, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources \nconstructed barriers in the watershed. No State has gone further or \ngone to greater lengths to address this question than my State of \nIndiana, as well as the State of Illinois, in terms of preventing the \nintroduction of Asian carp in the Great Lakes system. It is \neconomically devastating for us if this happens and it is economically \ndevastating for us and for Illinois if what was proposed in this bill \nin the dark of the night by the House of Representatives goes forward.\n  Currently, the Army Corps of Engineers is undergoing an extensive \nstudy. Despite all the attempts to take these steps, which so far have \nproven to be successful, this provision that was incorporated in there \ncould result in the closing of the locks of this waterway system, and \nit would endanger about $14 billion per year of economic activity and \nover 100,000 jobs in this area that I described that rely on the \nChicago area waterway system.\n  Closing the locks also may cost up to an additional $100 billion \nbecause it would require completely overhauling Chicago's underground \nwater and sewage system. Closing the locks would also render worthless \nthe billions of dollars that have already been invested to complete the \nCorps of Engineers flood control projects along the entire Mississippi \nwatershed, and they may not even solve the problem.\n  While the Chicago waterway system is the only direct continuous \nconnection between the Great Lakes system, other potential pathways \ncould allow carp immigration in times of flooding. So while it is clear \nthat closing the Chicago locks is not an economically viable solution \nfor stopping Asian carp--and I do understand the concerns the Great \nLakes States have on this issue and I share those concerns--as a result \nof all that, we worked out a bipartisan compromise solution to \naddressing this area. We would allow a study to go forward, allow an \neconomic assessment of the various options that had been presented, and \nthen give Congress the information so it can make a decision as to \nwhich solution was best needed to go forward.\n  What this provision does in this bill is simply give the agency \nresponsible the authority to go ahead with the project and what they \nthink the solution is without Congress having anything to say about it \nwhatsoever. It is a preauthorization on a new project which could \ninclude closing of the locks, and if it does, it would have hundreds of \nbillions of dollars of financial implications for the taxpayers and for \nthis Congress but also have enormous negative economic impact on \nnorthwest Indiana, northeast Illinois and the entire Chicago region and \nall that commerce that flows up and down the Mississippi and up and \ndown the St. Lawrence Seaway. The other problem with this is the new \nlanguage also expedites the study, even though the Corps says they need \nmore time to do so.\n  I guess, in conclusion, there are two things: One is the egregious \nprocedures that continue to give the public such a negative slant on \nhow we do business--this bundling of bills, where we are forced to vote \nyes or no on the whole bundling, up or down, and we can't let our yes \nstand for one purposeful interest or another or a no stand due to \nbundling; second, we need to address these midnight procedures, this \nissue of ``slip it in there,'' without going through the regular \nprocess. This body of Congress, both the House and the Senate, need to \nreturn to regular process, where we bring an idea forward, it is worked \nthrough the committee, it is transparent to all who are looking at it, \nwe give our yea or nay, and we move it through the system, rather than \nsimply changing things in the dark of the night at the last minute, \nwhere we have no opportunity to amend it and no opportunity to address \nit.\n  As we go forward with this, I am going to object on the basis of rule \nXXVIII. I don't know how it will all turn out, but I hope my colleagues \nwill understand this is more than something that just affects Indiana, \nIllinois,\n\n[[Page S4743]]\n\nand the Great Lakes. This is something that affects the way we do \nbusiness here. If we cannot enforce these rules, we will continue to \nfollow these practices the American people have come to absolutely hate \nand think they have a dysfunctional Congress. We deserve better than \nthis. I hope my colleagues will agree with that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Before the Senator from Indiana leaves the floor, I wish \nfor him to know I listened very carefully and I know his concern. I \nhave spoken with Senator Durbin about it, and I hope we can work \ntogether. I do want to say this process where sometimes bills are put \ntogether is frustrating to everybody, and we do need to take a look at \nthe way we do things. However, I do have some measure of sympathy for \nthe leadership around here because it takes so long to get any one \npiece done.\n  So I do agree. I don't like the fact that we cast one vote and there \nare three subjects. It is very difficult for the people at home to \nunderstand it. I also want to say to my friend--before I yield 3 \nminutes of my time to Senator Sanders--to feel proud of the way we put \ntogether the Transportation bill. I think in that case, which is a huge \npolicy bill, it was transparent and that what my friend complained \nabout was something that was put in by the other body and said it is a \nmust have.\n  The truth is, up to that point, everything we have done was very much \nin the open, and I am very sorry my friend feels so negatively toward \nwhat we are about to do because in his State it is tens of thousands of \njobs and in my State it is hundreds of thousands of jobs. It is \nthousands of businesses. It is going to mean a boost to this economy \nand a boost to the private sector. I wish to say to my friend, I \nunderstand his frustration, and I will do everything I can to help him \non this issue.\n  Mr. COATS. If the Senator would yield, I appreciate very much her \nsaying that. I did commend, and I will again, the work the Senator from \nCalifornia and Senator Inhofe have done in bringing this bill forward \nin the right way. I know my friend is as sorry as I am that someone in \nthe other body decided to violate the rule, injecting into all the hard \nwork that has been done. I regret that. I hope in the future we can \navoid this.\n  I thank the Senator for her good words.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I definitely share the frustration. At this time, I would \nlike to yield 3 minutes of the remainder of my time to Senator Sanders.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for yielding. As a \nmember of the Transportation Committee, I would like to congratulate \nSenator Boxer for her extraordinary efforts in pushing this bill \nforward. This is an enormously important bill that took a lot of hard \nwork, and I commend her for the work she and her staff have done. \nSenator Inhofe and I have very little in common politically, but I also \nwish to applaud him and his staff for coming together on this issue and \ndoing something that is extremely important and doing it in a \nbipartisan way.\n  Anyone who drives in the State of Vermont or, for that matter, drives \naround America, understands, to a significant degree, our \ninfrastructure is collapsing. In Vermont, we have dozens and dozens of \nbridges that are in need of repair. We have many hundreds of miles of \nroads that need repair. Our public transit system needs help. What this \nbill is about is a start toward rebuilding our crumbling \ninfrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our public transit and, in the \nprocess, putting a significant number of people back to work.\n  It is estimated this bill will save more than 1.8 million jobs \nnationwide in each of the next 3 years, and it will create 1 million \nnew jobs through an expanded infrastructure financing program. What \nthat means in the State of Vermont are thousands and thousands of \ndecent-paying construction and other types of jobs, something we sorely \nneed. So this bill is an excellent start. Does it go as far as it \nshould? No, it does not. Compared to China, compared to Europe, our \ninvestments in infrastructure are minimal. When we invest in \ninfrastructure, we make our country more productive, we put people back \nto work, and we make ourselves more internationally competitive. So I \njust want to say this is an important step forward, but we have more to \ndo.\n  Today, we are focused on roads, bridges, public transit--very \nimportant--but that is not the entire infrastructure. We have to pick \nup the issue on rail. We are falling further and further behind China, \nJapan, and Europe in terms of high-speed rail. We have to invest in \nrail and there are great jobs in doing that. We have to invest in our \nwater systems and in our wastewater plants. We have to make sure every \ncommunity in America has high-quality broadband as well as cell phone \nservice. That is what infrastructure is about. We have not invested \nanywhere near the degree we should, and now is the time to get started.\n  So this bill, which focuses on roads, on bridges, and public transit \nis an important step forward, and I wish to congratulate Senator Boxer \nand her staff, Senator Inhofe and his staff for their important work.\n  With that, I would yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 14 minutes.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend, Senator \nSanders. He is a very active member of the Environmental and Public \nWorks Committee. He is focused on jobs, jobs, jobs. He has looked at \nthe green job sector. He has looked at the effect of what we do on the \nconstruction industry. I am ever so grateful to him. He also has been a \nvery clear voice for the way to move this country forward by having a \nclean energy policy, which we are definitely going to be looking at in \nthe days and weeks ahead. We are now at the moment where we are waiting \nto see whether our friends on the other side of the aisle will allow us \nto proceed to finish our work on three issues: One is flood control, \none is helping to make sure student loan interest rates do not double, \nand the third and biggest one involves the transportation sector.\n\n  We all know, whether we are Republicans or Democrats, our focus is on \nboosting this economy. This bill will do that like no other. In this \nTransportation bill we are talking about protecting 2 million jobs that \nare currently in place in this country in the construction sector and \nthe transit sector. So these are the jobs that construction workers do \non the highways, the freeways, the bridges, making sure our roads are \nin good shape and our bridges are not going to collapse because we have \n70,000 bridges that are deficient, and we know what happens when there \nis a horrible failure of a bridge.\n  I know my ranking Member, Senator Inhofe, feels very strongly about \nthis because he had an incident in his State where one of his \nconstituents was actually killed by a bridge failing. We cannot sit by \nand allow the highway program and the transit program in this country \nto disappear. We have taken it up to the line.\n  I am very grateful to Ranking Member Inhofe. I am very grateful to \nChairman Mica and to Ranking Member Rahall for the work we have done in \nthis conference. This is a bill that everyone can be proud of, whether \nthey are Republican or Democrat.\n  CBO has scored this, and it actually returns money to the Treasury. \nWe have support from people who don't agree on most matters. I am not \nonly talking about Senator Inhofe and myself, who do not see eye to eye \non many issues; we have come together on this. Besides that, we see the \nAFL-CIO and the Chamber of Commerce walking hand in hand asking us to \nplease pass this bill. So we have a few little holdups now, but I am \nvery hopeful we can work through them.\n  The highlights of this bill: Overall, jobs, jobs, jobs. Jobs in the \nprivate sector, businesses in the private sector. We are talking about \nleveraging a Federal program called TIFIA, which is going to mean, \nfrankly, hundreds of millions of dollars that will go out the door to \nleverage funds at the local level as well as the private sector.\n  As we look at our bill, we see a reform bill. We see project \ndeliveries\n\n[[Page S4744]]\n\nspeeded up from 15 years to 8 years without giving up the health and \nsafety laws people deserve. We have not done away with any \nenvironmental law; we have just put deadlines in the law. We have put \nmilestones in the law, and we have stated if people have a problem, let \nus know the problem and get on with it. If there is anything new--a new \nfactor--we will look at that, but we cannot sit around and wait an \naverage of 13, 12, 14, 15 years to get a project done.\n  There are no riders in this bill. There are no environmental riders \nin this bill. I think that sends a good message to the public that we \nare focused on transportation. These other issues are going to be \naddressed, but they don't have to be addressed on this bill and become \na target of a veto or a standoff between the parties.\n  What did we do on bike paths? We have had a lot of controversy. \nPeople are saying we did away with the money for alternative \ntransportation routes, or bike paths, called safe routes to school, \ncalled pedestrian walkways. No, we saved the same level of funding, the \nsame percentage of funding, but we gave more flexibility to the States \nwith their 50-percent share so if they have another pressing need they \ncan use it for something else. Frankly, if the grassroots people at \nhome are not happy with the State, they can let the State know that. \nFor the first time, the other 50 percent goes to the local people. This \nis very important.\n  We also have the RESTORE Act. This means those Gulf States that got \nhit so hard from the BP spill will be able to restore their areas. If \nthey had economic damage, environmental damage, this will help. The \nmoney will come from the court settlement, and BP will then make those \nfunds available. So it does not add a dime to the deficit.\n  So we have a bill that doesn't add to the deficit. We have a bill \nthat will boost this economy. We have a bill that is supported by \nconservatives and liberals, progressives and moderates. I think it is a \ngreat day. I am sorry there are a few issues that got added on that are \ndisappointing to certain colleagues. Believe me, I want to work with \nthem to help resolve those problems. But I have to tell my colleagues, \nwhen we write a bill of this scope, of this nature, we are going to \nhave some of these issues. We will work on them.\n  For my remaining time--how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 7 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I wish to discuss the Supreme Court ruling. In a very \nfascinating ruling, the Chief Justice decided that the Affordable Care \nAct is constitutional. I am not going to spend a lot of time discussing \nwhy he said it and why they decided it. What I am going to talk about \nis what will happen if the Republicans have their way and this law is \nrepealed.\n  I want the American people to know--and I say this with no animosity \nat all--I am going to do everything I can to stop them from repealing \nit for a reason: The reason is the families in my State and all over \nthe country who are getting the benefits of this law.\n  Governor Romney says it is going to be something he is going to do on \nthe first day--he is going to repeal the health care law, if he gets \nelected, day one. Let me tell my colleagues very clearly what will \nhappen.\n  There are 54 million Americans who are now getting access to free \npreventive services such as mammograms and immunizations, if they have \nprivate insurance. That is most of our people. They would no longer get \nfree mammograms, free checkups--over and out. Fifty-four million \nAmericans lose if Governor Romney and the Republicans repeal this \nbill--6 million of my people in California.\n  My seniors, over 300,000, would no longer get help with their \nprescription drug benefits. Now they are getting help. They will then \ngo back to choosing between taking their prescription drugs or eating \ndinner. I am sorry, I am going to stand in the way, if I can.\n  Under Medicare, millions of seniors would lose access to free \npreventive services. Thirty-two million Medicare patients get these \nservices for free, including cancer screenings and flu shots. Why on \nEarth would somebody or some party want to get up and say: I am \nrepealing that?\n  There are 105 million Americans who will once again face lifetime \nlimits on their health insurance plans. If someone is diagnosed with \ncancer and they look at their plan, it says they are covered up to \n$250,000. That sounds like a lot of money. I can tell my colleagues \nnow, that is not a lot of money for someone who is battling cancer. \nNow, suddenly, in a person's worst moments, when they are facing \nradiation and chemo, they have hit up against their lifetime limit. \nThat will be gone.\n  More than 6 million young adults, including 300,000 in my State, \nwould lose their health insurance because now they have a guarantee. \nBecause of the health care bill, they can stay on their parents' \ncoverage until they are 26. Why would anyone want to repeal that? Ask \nthem. They do.\n  Insurance companies would no longer owe rebates to customers if those \ninsurance companies spent too much on premiums and paid the CEOs \nexorbitant bonuses and paid hardly anything to help people with their \nhealth care. We are going to see 12 million Americans get back $1 \nbillion in rebate checks in August. They will stop that. They want to \nstop that.\n  How about millions of children who are now getting coverage because \nthey have a preexisting condition. Before this law, they couldn't. So \nif a child was born with a heart defect, even if it was something that \ncould be controlled, they couldn't get insurance. We pity those \nfamilies. I have had reports of people in my State crying tears of joy \nwhen the Supreme Court acted because they could not get insurance \nbecause the woman--this particular one--had a preexisting condition, \nand now she can get insurance.\n  Because of the work of Senator Sanders--and I helped him with it--we \nhave community health care centers across the country getting funding. \nSo if a person has no insurance--or even if they have insurance--they \ncan go to a community health center and, based on their ability to pay, \nget health care. That would be repealed.\n  School-based health centers would be repealed. Training of our health \ncare workers would be repealed.\n  I will tell my colleagues, that is just what the benefits are today. \nIn 2014, there will be a slew of new benefits. This bill, while not \nperfect--and we can fix the problems--is a good bill.\n  Just remember that everyone in our country gets health care, but the \ndifference is some of them walk into an emergency room having paid \nnothing for a premium, even if they are wealthy, and they expect us to \npay the bill in the emergency room. With the approach that \nMassachusetts Governor Romney took, he said if a person is responsible \nand can afford it, that person has to buy a minimal health insurance \nplan. President Obama got the idea from Governor Romney. I call it a \npersonal responsibility premium. Some people call it a tax. Some people \ncall it a fee. I call it a personal responsibility premium because most \nof the people I represent buy health care coverage, and a few just say: \nYou know what. I feel terrific. I will wait until something bad happens \nto me and then I will go to the emergency room. And they can all pay.\n  That is what we have. We have the people who are responsible paying \nfor the free riders. The idea that President Obama got was from then-\nGovernor Romney.\n  So this is going to be a long election season, and there are going to \nbe a lot of battles over health care.\n  I hope we will pass the bill that is in front of us and take care of \nthe construction sector and transportation. I hope we will take care of \nflood insurance and student loan interest rates. We can do that with \none vote on a bill shortly, if we get permission to move forward. If we \ndon't, we will be here all weekend or whatever it takes to get it done. \nI am not going to go home until this is done.\n  I will also tell my colleagues--as we look at this health care \nbattle, the lines are pretty clear. There are millions and millions of \nAmericans who are getting benefits today. Why would anyone want to take \naway those benefits? Yet that is where we are in the debate. So I hope \ncooler heads will prevail.\n  Let's get on with bringing this economy back. Let's allow this bill--\nwith a few corrections because we can always fix things that don't \nwork--go forward. Let's stop the heated name calling. Let's make sure \nwe work together, just\n\n[[Page S4745]]\n\nas we did on the Transportation bill. I believe this is a good moment \nfor this Senate today. I hope we can get our work done, and then we can \nactually celebrate something before we start battling over health care.\n  Let's celebrate and say to the construction sector: We need you to \nrebuild those broken roads, those broken bridges. We need you to make \nsure we get those transit systems up and running. Then, I honestly \nbelieve, the rest of these problems we will take up one at a time.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Honoring our Armed Forces\n\n   Sergeant First Class Brad Thomas, Lieutenant Ryan Davis Rawl, and \n                Sergeant John ``J.D.'' David Meador, II\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to three fallen \nNational Guard members from South Carolina who were killed in \nAfghanistan on June 20, 2012, in Khost Province. They were members of \nthe 133rd Military Police Company who were serving on this duty. There \nare now 16 members of the South Carolina National Guard who have died \nin combat in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2003.\n  With the July 4 weekend coming up, we are preceding one of our \nbiggest holidays in America, and people rightfully will take some time \noff, I hope, to enjoy their families and friends and get away from work \nand have some family time. It marks a special event in our Nation's \nhistory: The founding of our Nation through a declaration of \nindependence that was not just words but resulted in men and women \nfighting to achieve our independence.\n\n  Here we are a couple hundred years later and we are still fighting. \nMy belief is, as to the radical Islamists who would kill us all if they \ncould, it is better to fight them over there so we do not have to fight \nthem here.\n  Afghanistan was the place the Taliban took over after the Russians \nleft and invited al-Qaida into the country, with bin Laden as their \nhonored guest. He had sanctuary there and was able to plan the attacks \nof 9/11 from sanctuary provided to him in Afghanistan.\n  Our goal is to never let Afghanistan become a sanctuary for al-Qaida \nor other terrorist groups. Thus, we are in a long struggle. It has been \n10 years. It has been hard, but we are making progress. The Afghan Army \nis getting better and stronger. The police are getting more proficient \nat their job. We are going to be winding the war down in 2014. But I \nthink we can do it in a fashion to make sure Afghanistan remains stable \nand our national security interests are protected.\n  But to make all those things possible--the weekend we are going to \nenjoy, and the holiday season, and denying terrorists safe havens--some \nof us have to leave our families and go off and fight this war.\n  SFC Brad Thomas of Easley, SC, was killed in an attack on June 20. He \nwas a graduate of Travelers Rest High School and attended Greenville \nTechnical College. He was a member of the 133rd Military Police Company \nof the South Carolina Army National Guard.\n  He is survived by his wife Jana and a son Cayden, a brother and two \nsisters. I know the family is devastated. You are in our prayers, and \nGod bless you and give you the healing and understanding during this \ntough time.\n  To SFC Brad Thomas, you died in the service of your country, and you \nwill be missed.\n  LT Ryan Davis Rawl of Lexington, SC, was killed in the same attack. \nHe was a first lieutenant in the 133rd MP Company. He graduated from \nLexington High School. He was a graduate of the Citadel. He is survived \nby his wife Katherine and their daughter Callie and their son Caleb.\n  I just want to acknowledge to Katherine, who interned in our office, \nthat you are certainly in our prayers. You did a great job for us, and \nanything we can do for any of these families in South Carolina, we \nwill. We very much pray for you and your family.\n  Sgt John ``J.D.'' David Meador, II, graduated from Lexington High \nSchool. He was a member of the wrestling team and was a wrestling \ncoach. He was a member of the same MP Company. He is survived by his \nwife Christy and three daughters: Olivia, Brianna, and Elana. To \nChristy and her family, you will be in our prayers.\n  This will be a tough weekend in South Carolina. We are going to have \nthree funerals.\n  To General Livingston and the National Guard family, you are \ncertainly in our prayers. This is a tough blow for an MP company to \nhave three people killed in one attack. So to all the members of that \ncompany, we will do our best to take care of your families while you \nare gone.\n  We have had a big argument about health care and about \ntransportation, and that is great--democracy in action. What is the \nright decision for the Court to have made in the health care case? Is \nthis a good transportation bill? I appreciate in a bipartisan fashion \ntrying to find a solution.\n  But I just wanted to take a few minutes before going to the holiday \nweekend and remind us of one thing we do have in common: Our freedom \ndepends on people willing to fight for it, and the one thing about this \nwar--whether you agree with the war in Afghanistan or not--virtually \nevery American, regardless of political persuasion, has shown an \nappreciation for the troops and their families. I cannot thank Members \nof Congress enough for never losing sight. No matter how they feel \nabout this war, we all appreciate those who fight it, and we all suffer \nand mourn for those who lose their lives in this cause.\n  I believe this is a just cause. I believe these men who joined the \nmilitary voluntarily and left their families to go to Afghanistan were \ndoing so in the most noble tradition of the country--that they were \ntrying to make our families safer, my family safer, and they died in \nthe service of their country. And that is a life well lived. They died \nfar too soon. They left behind young children, but they will never be \nforgotten.\n  May God grant them eternal rest and peace. May God bless and provide \nunderstanding and healing to the families left behind. And may, as \nAmericans, we never forget that our freedom is dependent upon a few of \nus being willing to go to faraway places, with strange sounding names, \nand risk never coming back.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, first of all, I \nthank the Senator for his eloquent statement on behalf of those who \nhave served and sacrificed.\n  Since we will all be spread around at different places over the \nFourth of July and celebrating our independence, I think those are very \nappropriate and moving words.\n  I am reminded of the saying at the battlefield, written:\n\n     They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:\n     Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.\n     At the going down of the sun and in the morning\n     We will remember them.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for a brief colloquy with the \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are also facing another crisis as far \nas the military is concerned; that is, the looming prospect of \nsequestration. The Secretary of Defense has stated that sequestration \nwould have a ``devastating impact'' on our national security. We are \ntalking about layoffs, and some estimates are of as many as 1 million \nworkers in the defense industry. We are looking at unknown effects of \nthe strategic thinking that goes on as we plan to defend our Nation's \nsecurity--for example, our shift in emphasis from Europe to Asia \nPacific, which requires significant air and naval assets amongst other \nthings.\n  I would ask my colleague--I am not sure the American people are fully \naware of the effects of something that is supposed to take effect, as I \nunderstand it, at the beginning of the next fiscal year, which would be \nthe beginning of October 2012. Is that a correct statement, I would ask \nmy colleague?\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So we are asking the Defense Department to plan on what\n\n[[Page S4746]]\n\nour force structure will be, what our mission will be, what our \ncapabilities will be, beginning the first of October, and all I can see \nso far is total gridlock on this issue.\n  Now, if somebody wants to say it is our fault because we refused to \n``raise revenues'' or because of the other side's insistence on that \nand a resistance to spending cuts, I say to my colleague, I do not \nthink people understand we still live in a very dangerous world. The \nSenator just talked about those who have already sacrificed. Don't we \nowe it to them and their families to stop something that all of us \nagree would have a catastrophic impact on our ability to defend this \nNation?\n  Isn't it true--would the Senator agree--that it is time we sat down \nand started having serious negotiations, because there is no greater \nresponsibility the Congress and the people's representatives have than \nto defend the security of this Nation?\n  I know the Senator from South Carolina--before I ask him to answer--\ntraveled around his State, which I intend to do, to the various \nmilitary installations and talked about what would happen with this \nsequestration. We are talking about a very limited period of time. We \nare about to go out of session. We will be in during the month of \nJuly--most of the month of July--and probably the month of September. \nEnd of story.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I ask my colleague to yield, if I could \nadd one other question to his very important question for my colleague \nfrom South Carolina.\n  I have a recollection that during one of the hearings the Senator \nfrom South Carolina specifically asked the Secretary of Defense what \nthe consequence would be, and I recall he had a very dramatic response. \nI wonder if the Senator might share that with us as well.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kyl \nbe included in the colloquy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well, one, I hope my colleagues will stay around for a \nminute or two because this is an important topic to be talking about.\n  Let me put this in the perspective of what we are trying to do and \nwhat we are trying to avoid. We are about $16 trillion in debt. There \nis probably no stronger defense supporters in the Congress than Jon Kyl \nand John McCain.\n  The Senator just spoke of war. John McCain has seen his fair share of \nwar. I think he understands as well as anybody in this body--probably \nbetter than most--what happens in war. People get hurt and people get \nkilled and anybody who has been in the military is no fan of war. But \nthe goal sometimes is to make sure those who are asked to fight a \nparticular war can fight it quickly, overwhelmingly, win, and come \nhome.\n  What we are doing is trying to get out of debt. The three of us are \npretty big defense hawks, but we have all agreed the Pentagon has to \nreduce their spending too. I think all of us--particularly Senator \nMcCain--believe there is a lot of waste in the Pentagon and that we \ncould achieve $50 billion in savings over the next decade by reforming \nthe way the Pentagon does business and, quite frankly, do more with \nless. So count us all in--the three of us--for reducing defense \nspending to help get us out of debt.\n  But here is what has us all upset. The supercommittee that was formed \nby the Budget Control Act had a mission of cutting $1.2 trillion over a \ndecade to help get us out of debt. That is a pretty small number given \nwhat we are going to spend over the next 10 years. But the committee--\nRepublicans and Democrats--could not find common ground as to how to \ncut $1.2 trillion over the next decade. There was a penalty provision \nin the law, and it said that in the event the supercommittee failed, we \nwould cut $1.2 trillion over the next decade as follows: $600 billion \nout of the Defense Department, $600 billion out of the rest of the \ngovernment.\n  If that penalty kicks in, then we will have cut $1 trillion out of \nthe Defense Department over the next decade, blindly, across the board. \nEvery account gets affected.\n  What did Secretary Panetta say? He said: Sign me up for $450 billion. \nI think we can get there. We will lose some capability, but we will be \nOK as a nation. We could fight Iran and win if we had to.\n  Then I asked him: What if we did $1 trillion over the next decade--if \nwe overdoubled what you are trying to cut? He said: We would be \nshooting ourselves in the head as a nation. We would not have the \nability to go in and take out the nuclear program in Iran because the \nweapons we need we could not maintain and afford.\n  When it comes to personnel costs, we are reducing the Army by 80,000 \npeople under the $450 billion plan. If we do sequestration on top of \nthat, I say to Senator McCain, we are taking another 100,000 people out \nof the Army. Under sequestration, the Navy would be down to a little \nover 200 ships. We would have the smallest Navy since 1915, the \nsmallest Air Force in the history of the country, and the Army would go \nback to 1940 levels.\n  To my colleagues, do you believe the world has gotten that much safer \nthat we do not need a Navy bigger than in 1915, given the threats we \nare facing from Iran, China, North Korea? Do you think now is a good \ntime for the country to basically disarm, given the threats we face \nfrom radical terrorism throughout the whole globe?\n  So here is what we are going to do, and our congressional leaders \nneed to be on notice. About 1 million people would lose their jobs if \nwe put these cuts in place, and we would destroy the defense industrial \nbase that provides good jobs to the economy and keeps us free and safe \nby giving our people technology better than the enemy has.\n  Three National Guardsmen were killed in June in Afghanistan. We have \nimproved the National Guard. But when we first started this war, \nNational Guard units were leaving to go to the fight with inferior \nequipment. They did not have armor. So if we do sequestration on top of \nwhat we are already trying to cut in the Defense Department, we will \ndestroy the finest military in the history of the world at a time we \nneed it the most.\n  This is a body known for doing some pretty dumb things. This would be \nthe prize. So what Senators McCain, Kyl, and myself are trying to do is \navoid sequestration before the first of the year so our defense people \ncan plan. If we do not set this aside before the election, that is \npolitical malpractice. I thank Senator McCain and Senator Kyl for their \nleadership.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I wish to add--I note the presence of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire who has also played a very key leadership role, including \nworking with the mayors of every city in America, who have issued a \nresolution about their concern about this issue.\n  I wish also to state to my friends and colleagues that I know the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, whom I have had the \nopportunity of working with for 25 years, the Senator from Michigan, \nalso shares our concern.\n  I hope we could at least get some of us together who have been \ninvolved with these issues of national security for so many years on \nboth sides of the aisle, that we could reach some kind of an agreement. \nWe know additional sacrifices have to be made when we are facing a $16 \ntrillion deficit. But to take the overwhelming majority--well over 50 \npercent of these reductions--out of what is about, I believe, 12 \npercent of our spending is obviously not appropriate.\n  One other point. If the President of the United States shares the \nconcern that the Secretary of Defense shares--catastrophic, impossible \nto plan on, so draconian that it would cripple our ability to defend \nthis Nation; all of those are statements which the Secretary of Defense \nhas made--I would argue that it would be appropriate, and I would \nsincerely ask that perhaps the President of the United States also be \ninvolved and members of his administration or charter members of the \nadministration to sit down with us to see how we could resolve this.\n  So far the executive branch has not been involved in these efforts, \nwith the exception of the Secretary of Defense, who has told us in the \nmost graphic terms the devastating consequences. Again, I want to point \nout to my colleagues: You have to plan, especially in national defense, \nwhat weapons you are going to procure, the number of people you are \ngoing to maintain in the military, what those missions are going to be.\n  All of those right now, if held in abeyance in the Pentagon as far as \nplanning is concerned, cannot have a\n\n[[Page S4747]]\n\ngreat deal of validity if we are staring at sequestration and these \ndraconian reductions.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes. And I know our most eloquent member has arrived on \nthe floor, not to mention other attributes we are lacking.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I would like all three Senators to comment on this \nproposition. You have just challenged the President, who is the \nCommander in Chief, by the way, to fix the problem that your Secretary \nof Defense has said would be most devastating to our ability to defend \nourselves. He said it would be catastrophic, it would be draconian, \nthere is no way to plan for it, we would be shooting ourselves in the \nhead. Mr. President, you are the Commander in Chief. When your \nSecretary of Defense and every general under your command is telling \nyou and the Congress, you need to fix this before it gets out of hand, \nwhy are you not asking us, as Republicans and Democrats, to answer the \ncall of the Secretary of Defense? You are the Commander in Chief, my \nfriend. It is your job to make sure our military has what it needs to \ngo fight wars that we send them to fight and protect our Nation.\n  But that is not enough. It is also our job as Members of Congress to \ntake care of those who serve. So to our Republican and Democratic \nleader: Why do you not convene a group of Senators? And to our leaders \nin the House: Why do you not get a group of House Members, and ask us \nto come up with a plan to do at least one thing, avoid the consequence \nof sequestration for 1 year in 2013, to take the monkey off their back?\n  I am willing to meet our Democratic friends in the middle to find a \nway to offset the $110 billion in defense and nondefense spending. But \nto our leaders and to the President, if you think the rest of us are \ngoing to sit on the sideline and let this matter be taken up in \nlameduck when it becomes a nightmare for the country, you can forget \nit. So we are challenging our leaders and the President to get a group \ntogether to fix this.\n  I ask Senator McCain, do you think that is a good idea?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I know it is the only way we are going to solve this. I \nask unanimous consent that the Senator from New Hampshire be included. \nI know the Senator from Tennessee, our friend Senator Corker, is \nwaiting. But I think my friend from South Carolina, as usual, has \nstated the problem and a solution here. The problem is, we face a \ndevastating impact on our national security. The solution is for our \nleaders and the President--if possible--to convene a group of Senators, \nwhether it includes us or not is immaterial, on both sides of the \naisle, on both sides of the Capitol, to sit down and work this out so \nwe can avoid the sequester.\n  I will take responsibility for sequester if that is what is \nnecessary. But I also say that without concrete, significant, and \nmeaningful action to cause this sequester to be prevented, we are \nrisking the lives of our young men and women who are serving in the \nmilitary. I do not know of a greater responsibility that we have.\n  I ask the Senator from New Hampshire if she agrees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal.) The Senator from New \nHampshire is recognized.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. I join with my colleagues over the concern, deep concern \nthat keeps me up at night about sequestration, because we cannot do \nthis to our national security. Both sides of the aisle have to come \ntogether. We need leadership from our Commander in Chief on this issue.\n  To put it in perspective, I asked the Assistant Commandant of the \nMarine Corps what the impact of sequestration would be on the Marines. \nDo you know what he told me? That the Marine Corps of the United States \nof America would be unable to respond to one major contingency. Talk \nabout putting our country at risk and putting ourselves in a situation \nwhere unfortunately there are still so many risks around the world that \nour country needs to be protected from. To think that our Marine Corps \nwould not be able to respond to one major contingency. It is \noutrageous. It cries for bipartisan leadership on this issue, \nparticularly leadership from our Commander in Chief.\n  To put it in perspective, it is not just an issue of our national \nsecurity. You would think that would be enough to bring people to the \ntable. But we are talking about jobs across this country. The National \nAssociation of Manufacturers has estimated it would be nearly 1 million \njobs; George Mason University, the same.\n\n  To my colleagues, looking around here, polling some States in terms \nof the estimate of job losses: 24,000 for Alabama. When we look at a \nState like Missouri, 31,000, when we look at a State, for example, like \nFlorida, 39,000 for Florida. This is an issue that will hit every State \nin this Nation.\n  But, most importantly, what I am concerned about is it is going to \nhit our military in a way that we break faith with our troops. In fact, \nGeneral Odienero of our Army has said he would have to cut an \nadditional 100,000 troops from our Army on top of the reductions we are \nmaking right now, approximately 72,000, and 50 percent of it would have \nto come from the Guard and Reserve.\n  You think about the important function not only of protecting our \ncountry, we could not have fought in Afghanistan or Iraq without our \nGuard and Reserve. I am the proud wife of someone who served in the \nIraq war. I can tell you, it is not only the function that our Guard \nand Reserve play in terms of protecting us overseas, but they also \nperform a very important homeland function. Every Governor in this \ncountry will be deeply concerned if we are going to diminish our Guard \nand Reserve. So this is an issue that cries out for leadership from \nboth sides of the aisle. I look forward to working with my colleagues \non this now. It cannot wait until a lameduck session. We cannot put our \nnational security in the balance, and nearly 1 million jobs at issue, \nto a lameduck session. This is something we should resolve right now.\n  I appreciate that my colleagues have come to the floor to talk about \nthis issue today. We must get this done on behalf of the American \npeople and our men and women in uniform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I think Senator Corker from Tennessee was \non the floor before me. I do not know if we are going back and forth or \nhow long he expects to speak. I wish to yield to him to see what his \nplans are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois. I am \ngoing to speak for about 2\\1/2\\ to 3 minutes if that is okay.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Tennessee. \nI ask unanimous consent that I follow him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Budget Control Act\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my friends \nfrom New Hampshire and Arizona and South Carolina regarding the \nsequestration. I will say the reason we are in this sequestration mode \nis that six Republicans and six Democrats could not figure out a way, \nover a 10-year period, to cut $1.2 trillion in spending out of $45 \ntrillion that is going to be spent by the Federal Government during \nthat period of time. So I do hope there is a way to resolve that. But I \nam here to speak about something related, but in some ways very \ndifferent.\n  Today we are getting ready to vote on some legislation dealing with \nflood insurance, dealing with student lending, dealing with highways. \nAnd these are all very popular programs.\n  What people who are listening, who may be paying attention to what \nthe Senate is doing today, what they may not know is that for the third \ntime, in a bipartisan way, this body is getting ready to spend more \nmoney than was deemed by the budget that was ultimately created by the \nBudget Control Act last year when the country almost shut down trying \nto save a mere $900 billion over the next 10 years. So a vote today for \nthis piece of legislation is basically a vote to say the Senate cannot \nbe entrusted to carry out what it laid out last August to keep us from \nspending money we do not have. I know there are going to be some budget \npoints of order that will be brought forth at some point later today.\n\n[[Page S4748]]\n\n  I want to say as one Senator from Tennessee, it continues to be \nunbelievable to me that this body does not have the courage, does not \nhave the will, does not have the discipline to even live within a very \nmodest budget that was laid out last August. Today I am certain we are \ngoing to pass legislation that spends billions of dollars more than we \nagreed to in the Budget Control Act and especially the deemed budget \nthat came after that, the deemed budget that was put in place as a \nresult of what we passed last August.\n  I would say all those who vote for this today are basically saying we \ndo not have the discipline to live within our means. The problems our \nNation faces fiscally are only going to get worse. I think this is a \nvery sad day for our country if that, in fact, is what happens within \nthe next 2 or 3 hours on the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                             Sequestration\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his \ncomments. I share his concern about our deficit. I was a member of the \nSimpson-Bowles Commission, voted for the commission report, bipartisan \neffort to reduce the deficit by $4\\1/2\\ trillion over 10 years. I think \nwe set in place a description, maybe a guidepost for how we can do \nthis.\n  I would agree with him that we need to take care in the money that we \nspend now which will add to the deficit, though I have to say my \nunderstanding is this transportation bill is paid for. There are \nrevenue sources that are part of this. I know the student loan \ncontinued decrease in interest rates to 3.4 percent for student loans \nis paid for. I believe the changes within the Flood Insurance Program, \nwhich is part of this package as well, the Republican leader spoke to \nthat this morning, reforms in that program will move it closer to \nsustainability and solvency. It is not where it needs to be, but it is \nmoving closer.\n  But I want to address, if I can, for a minute what has been a topic \non the floor this morning about the planned cuts in the Department of \nDefense. Let me say at the outset what we all agree upon. No. 1, we \nnever, ever want to shortchange America's security, never shortchange \nour men and women in uniform.\n  A nephew of mine who serves as a doorman in the gallery recently \nreturned from 1 year in Afghanistan. We were sending packages and were \nworried about Michael every day. He got home safely. That is happening \nover and over across America. I wanted my nephew to have all he needed \nto come home safely. I think everybody feels the same when it comes to \nthe Department of Defense.\n  Let's step back and look at this deficit debate. Allow me to put it \ninto perspective for a moment. The last time we balanced the Federal \nbudget was not in the 19th century, it was about 11 years ago. It was a \ntime when William Jefferson Clinton was President, and for 3 years we \nhad a balanced budget under a Democratic President--3 years.\n  When we reach a balanced budget, if you said, ``What do you have in \nterms of spending and revenue?''--they are the same--here is what we \nfound: Revenue and spending both equaled 19.5 percent of America's \ngross domestic product. The gross domestic product is the sum total of \nthe goods and services produced in America every year. It changes and \ngrows. The last year we were in balance, taxes equaled 19.5 percent of \nour GDP and Federal spending equaled 19.5 percent. We had a balanced \nbudget.\n  Now we are in deep water. We saw the accumulated debt of the United \nStates more than double under President George W. Bush, and it \ncontinues to grow, because of the recession, under this President. Our \nannual deficits are over $1 trillion and are unsustainable. We borrow \n40 cents for every dollar we spend, whether we are buying military \nequipment or paying for food stamps. That is unsustainable.\n  But now that we know there was a time when we were in balance, it is \nfair to say: What happened to spending since this budget was in \nbalance? If you do it in constant dollars so there is no monkeying \naround with numbers, here is what happened since we were last in \nbalance in our budget: Domestic discretionary spending equals student \nloans, medical research, transportation--all of the different things \nthat don't fit into the Department of Defense. The spending in those \nareas since we were last in balance has been flat, with no increase.\n  What about spending for entitlement programs--Medicare, Medicaid, \nprograms such as those--and veterans' care? What has happened to that \nsince we were last in balance? Since we were last in balance, the \nspending on entitlement programs has gone up 30 percent. Why? The baby \nboomers have arrived; 10,000 people a day reach the age of 65. They \npaid into Social Security and Medicare their whole life, and they show \nup now and say: It is our turn. Because of that, entitlement spending \nhas gone up.\n  Let's look at the third part of the budget, which was addressed by my \nRepublican colleague this morning--defense spending. What has happened \nto defense spending since the budget was in balance? Domestic \ndiscretionary flat; entitlements 30 percent. As of this year's budget, \ndefense spending will have risen 73 percent since the budget was last \nin balance.\n  We created a supercommittee, and Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, who \nis here, was a member. They said: Let's find ways to reduce the deficit \nby $1.2 trillion over 10 years. They tried. I am sure Senator Kerry \nwill speak to that effort. At the end of the day, they could not reach \na bipartisan agreement on how it would be done. The law we passed said: \nIf you cannot reach agreement, we are going to do it automatically. We \nare going to take $500 billion out of defense and $500 billion out of \nnondefense spending. That is what this is about. People are coming to \nthe floor and saying that we cannot take another $500 billion out of \ndefense spending.\n  I will tell you that I think that is a lot to be taken out in light \nof what we have already anticipated we are going to reduce in spending. \nI think it will cause some serious problems. But I reject the notion \nthat that $500 billion, if it is taken out of domestic discretionary, \nwon't have equally horrible results.\n  So I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, when you had a \nchance in the supercommittee to deal with spending cuts of a lesser \namount or deal with revenue, closing tax loopholes, you walked away \nfrom it. Now you are complaining that we may end up cutting defense \nspending.\n  Incidentally, if the sequestration number went through--the \nadditional $500 billion in cuts over the next 10 years--it would bring \nthe amount of money we spend on defense to the same percentage of the \nGDP as it was when the budget was in balance.\n  So my friends who are speaking for national defense, I join you, but \nI also speak for investments in America when it comes to education, \ninnovation, and infrastructure. That will help our economy grow. And \nsequestration on the domestic side is unacceptable, from this Senator's \npoint of view, as well.\n  We clearly need to get beyond this and talk about an honest answer to \nreducing the deficit. An honest answer, going back to Simpson-Bowles, \nputs everything on the table--everything. To my friends on the other \nside, I say that it puts revenue on the table, and it must. It puts \nentitlement programs and spending cuts on the table, and it must. That \nis the only honest way to address this issue. To pick it off and say \nthat we are going to take the one area that has grown in spending by 73 \npercent and ignore it and then have them say that we don't touch \nrevenue leaves two possibilities: If we are going to do anything about \nthe deficit--deeper cuts in programs such as student loans, medical \nresearch, or cuts in Medicare--that is what it comes down to. They are \nhard choices, right? I think the Bowles-Simpson approach of putting \neverything on the table is the right approach.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides to take this pain that we are \nfacing December 31 and turn it into an opportunity to work on a \nbipartisan basis to reduce this deficit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                         Surface Transportation\n\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I stand to raise a concern I have regarding \nthe conference committee report to accompany H.R. 4348.\n\n[[Page S4749]]\n\n  Pursuant to paragraph 9 of rule XXVIII of the Standing Rules of the \nSenate, we are supposed to have adequate notice of a report like this \nbefore we have the opportunity to vote on it. The rule states:\n\n       It shall not be in order to vote on the adoption of a \n     report of a committee of conference unless such report has \n     been available to Members and to the general public for at \n     least 48 hours before such vote.\n\n  The current version of the committee report was filed, as I \nunderstand it, at 8:07 p.m. last night. It is not even close to the 48 \nhours required notice.\n  What we have, ultimately, when we look at this, is the fact that we \nhave a highway bill that was sent to conference, but it came back from \nclosed-door negotiations with a student loan bill and also with a flood \ninsurance bill attached to it. We were neither given the chance to \ndebate nor to amend these provisions before they came to the floor. Now \nwe are approaching a vote on that.\n  We did not provide our fellow Senators or the American people with an \nadequate opportunity to read the 596-page conference report, which is \nrequired by our very own rule. This is somewhat reminiscent of a \nstatement made a few years ago by then-Speaker of the House Nancy \nPelosi when, speaking to Members of her body regarding the passage of \nthe Affordable Care Act, she said:\n\n       We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what's in \n     it.\n\n  This is one of the problems we have in Washington of which the \nAmerican people are becoming increasingly aware. It is a problem that I \nthink we need to address. Time and again, we have a problem in which \nthe Senate waits until the day before a holiday or the day before a \nscheduled instate work period before bringing something to the floor \nfor a vote--without following the Senate's own rules, which are \ndesigned to promote and protect the openness and transparency of the \nlegislative process. This is a troubling trend and one we should seek \nto avoid whenever and wherever possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, currently Congress has about a 10-percent \napproval rating. One of the reasons is that we don't even obey our own \nrules.\n  For goodness' sakes, this is a 600-page bill. I got it this morning. \nNot one Member of the Senate will read this bill before we vote on it. \nWe are going to vote on this in the next 30 minutes. I, Senator Lee, \nand others will object to this. We will have a point of order that our \nown rule says it has to be posted online for 48 hours. It is 600 pages, \nand nobody will read it. No wonder our approval rating is 10 percent. \nNobody knows what we are voting on. In fact, provisions were stuck in \nthis bill last night that have nothing to do with any of these bills. \nThey have been stuck in and we are just now discovering it. I passed \ntwo Senators in the hall who are trying to get something out of this \nbill that affects their States, which they found out about just minutes \nago. Nobody would have known about it if they had not found out about \nit.\n  There are three bills in question here: transportation, student \nloans--on the student loan bill, originally we had loans at 6 percent, \nand it was somehow bringing in money to the Treasury. We were using \nthat money to pay for ObamaCare. Now it is at 3 percent, and that money \nis gone. Where is the money to pay for ObamaCare? We have a shell game \nup here. We say one thing will pay for it, and now this will pay for \nit--the money disappears.\n  Now they are saying they are going to pay for this by taking money \nout of pensions. Raise your hand if you think it is a good idea to \nunderfund pensions more. Over half of the pensions in this country are \ntechnically insolvent because they don't have enough money to pay for \nthem. Is it a good idea to have less money go into workers' pensions to \npay for a student loan program?\n  I have a bill in Congress that says we should read the bill before we \npass it. We should wait 1 day for each 20 pages, to be given time to \nread 600-page bills. At the very least, we ought to adhere to our own \nrules. They say it should be posted online at least 48 hours. Forty-\neight hours is still a challenge to find out everything in here. Do you \nknow how long the Federal Register is--55,000 pages, which is added to \nannually. When you read this, you have to refer to the Federal \nRegister, which is hundreds of thousands of pages, to find out what \nthey stuck in this bill in the dead of night. This isn't the way we \nshould operate.\n  The American people want to know why do we say the government is not \ngoing to do something for 3 days. What were they doing the previous 3 \nmonths?\n  The other side hasn't produced a budget in 3 years. That is against \nthe rules. The rules of the Senate say you must produce a budget, and \nthey didn't do it for 3 years. When we presented them with a budget \nthat we wrote for them, nobody voted for it, and zero on the other side \nvoted for their own President's budget.\n  How are we going to compromise if they are not showing up for work? \nHow are we going to get anything done if they don't obey their own \nrules?\n  I will raise a point of order in the next hour that says that we have \nbroken the rules of the Senate, and I will ask them to vote on it. I \nfully expect that the Parliamentarian will rule in our favor. We will \nsee. The other side will simply close their eyes to the rules, and they \nwon't care what the Parliamentarian says, and they will overturn this \nby saying: We are the majority, and we deem it so. We are the majority, \nand we don't care what is in the bill or to take time to read the bill; \nwe just deem it so.\n  I think this is why the American people are unhappy with what is \ngoing on here. I object strenuously. I will vote against this, and I \nwill raise a point of order that says we should read the bill before we \npass it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Paul for raising these \nissues. We are mismanaging the American people's money. It is good to \nsee Senator Lee, who just spoke, and Senator Paul, both new Members of \nthe Senate, who have been out talking to the American people and made \ncommitments that they are going to work to try to improve the process \nhere. I celebrate their activity, their vigor, and their determination, \nand a lot of others feel the same way in our body.\n  Shortly we will be moving a cobbled-together bill. An attempt will be \nmade to accomplish this. I expect budget points of order and another \npoint of order to be raised.\n  I want to share some thoughts about how it is we do business and some \nof the efforts that are not legitimate as we go about our business and \nare dangerous to the financial health of America.\n  Let's take what we call the LUST fund. I know it is an odd name. The \ntrue name of it is the leaking underground storage tank fund. People \nwho have them have to pay fees, and it goes into a fund. The idea of \nthe fund is to be available when cleanups need to be done. When the \ncompany or other companies have gone bankrupt and there is no money, \nthis fund will pay to clean up the waste. Maybe it makes sense. It has \nbeen operating for quite a number of years. It has run up a surplus. \nThat surplus is in the LUST trust fund--leaking underground storage \ntank fund--and where does it go? What do you do with that money?\n  The Treasury of the United States is spending more money every year \nthan it takes in. This year we will spend approximately $3.7 trillion. \nWe take in about $2.4 trillion, and we have a $1,300 billion deficit. \nThat is how much we are spending. We spend around $3.7 trillion and are \ntaking in about $2.4 trillion, and we have about a $1.3 trillion \ndeficit this year--the fourth consecutive year that we have had almost \na $1,000 billion deficit. We will have a big one again next year \nbecause we are systematically overspending.\n\n  But let's look at this fund--it has some real money in it, a number \nof billions of dollars--and what happens to it. Well, when the \ngovernment spends more money than it takes in, it takes the money from \nthe LUST fund. Well, how does it get it? It borrows it. So there is \nactually a debt instrument from the United States Treasury to the \ntrustees or the holders or managers of the LUST trust fund, and they \nhave loaned the money. They do not need it today, so they loan it to \nthe government so they can spend it. And it has been borrowed and has \nbeen spent.\n  The assets in the LUST fund are nothing more than debt instruments\n\n[[Page S4750]]\n\nfrom the U.S. Treasury. But on the books, it appears this LUST fund has \nassets. I guess in a sense it does. It has U.S. Treasury notes. So the \npeople looking around to spend money and to try to meet the demands of \nour constituents--to build highways in this case--decided they could \ntake that money.\n  And you know something, it does not score as an expenditure in that \nfashion. It is an odd way this is done. It is seen as found money that \nthey can go over and spend. But where does the money come from? The \nmoney is not in the fund, remember? The fund holds Treasury bills. But \nthe highway trust fund doesn't want Treasury bills, it wants money that \ncan be spent. So what happens is the U.S. Treasury, which has been \nborrowing money from another government agency and giving a debt \ninstrument in return, has to come up with the money now. It is going to \nbe spent. It is going to be taken out of the trust fund. So where do \nthey get the money? They convert an internal debt to an external debt.\n  The only thing they will do is borrow more money. So it will be this \nmany billions of dollars more than $1.2 trillion or $1.3 trillion that \nwe have. The debt is converted to a public debt, and somebody in China \nor in Japan or in New York will loan money to the government and they \nwill use that money to pay the highway trust fund with it.\n  You see how circular that is? It allows the money to be double \ncounted. And that is actually what happened with President Obama's \nhealth care bill. That $400 billion was funded this way. Social \nSecurity still has a surplus. Although it has been drawn down, it still \nhas a surplus in its account--or Medicare does. So the Medicare \ntrustees raise Medicare taxes, they cut Medicare benefits, and they \nsave $400 billion, And that would be money of the Medicare and the \ntrustees. It is their money. But what happened with it? Under the \nconventions of accounting, the money was available to be spent by the \nU.S. Treasury, and the U.S. Treasury then would spend it on the new \nhealth care bill.\n  The Congressional Budget Office Director, Mr. Elmendorf, wrote me a \nletter the night before the bill passed--Christmas Eve--and he said \nthis is double counting the money. You can't simultaneously count it as \nmaking Medicare better and providing new money to fund the health care \nbill. Four hundred billion dollars on the night before the vote he \nannounces this is double counting. If a private business were to do it, \nthey would be in big trouble, I suggest. They might be sued for fraud. \nThey would be sued for fraud.\n  So the money was done in that fashion, and the way it happened was \nMr. Elmendorf said it is double counting the money. You cannot \nsimultaneously benefit Medicare and fund a new health care program, \nalthough the conventions of accounting might suggest otherwise. So the \nreal smart financiers, what did they do? They figured out how to use \nthe conventions of accounting in a way that obscured the fact they \ndidn't have the $400 billion and that it was, in truth, borrowed money.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleagues on the floor, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I just have a couple of comments to make \nfor clarification purposes.\n  First of all, I don't think anyone is going to question my \nconservative credentials over the years I have been here. I have been \nreally offended by a lot of the things that have happened structurally \nin this institution, over in the House, but so far as this bill is \nconcerned, let me clarify a couple of things.\n  It sounds good to stand up here and say we have only had a matter of \nminutes to look at something that is 500 pages. We have had this bill \nfor a long time--for several days. We have had it and gone over \neverything. On the bill we sent from the Senate to the House, it is \nessentially the same thing.\n  I didn't agree when they added the two provisions on student loan and \nflood insurance. I didn't agree with that. Everyone knows those issues, \nbut I don't think they should have been on here. Nonetheless, we didn't \nhave any control in this body over that. But as far as the provisions \nof the bill are concerned, these provisions we have seen. And everyone \nwho has spoken against it has been there when we have talked about the \ngreat reforms, and I have commented several times that I thought one of \nthe problems was we did too good a job because we had too many reforms. \nBut when it got over to the House, where they are inclined to have more \nreforms there, they had to start from a base where we had done a good \njob. Streamlining and enhancements and all those things are in it.\n  The only thing I can say, from a conservative perspective, is we have \nseen this bill. We have lived with this bill, not just hours but for \ndays, and actually for weeks, the basic provisions of the bill. But \nwhat we have to realize is there is an alternative to what we are doing \nhere today, and that alternative--and the only alternative--is to go \nback to extensions.\n  If we go back to extensions, a couple of things happen. No. 1, we \ndon't have any of the reforms we have in the bill; No. 2, we throw away \nabout 30 percent of the money----\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair, I would ask my friend, the ranking \nmember of this committee, is it true this is basically the same bill we \nare going to vote on today that passed this institution in March?\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is true, I say through the Chair. It passed this \ninstitution with 74 votes, as I recall.\n  Mr. REID. So again, people have had since March to read this bill and \nto get up to speed a little bit, don't you think?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I answer in the affirmative.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, would my friend yield for 1 minute? I want \nto correct the Record.\n  There are a few changes, there is no question. We have speeded up \nproject delivery, as my friend knows. We gave a little more flexibility \nto the States in terms of the TE program. So a few things were changed. \nBut my friends are right, primarily, this is a similar bill. It takes \nthe money and we say we are going to spend the same thing, plus \ninflation. And it is true these bills have been out here for a long \ntime. Actually, they passed our committee, I say to Senator Inhofe, in \nNovember of last year.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I respond, yes, that is correct. That is accurate.\n  I think that is very important too because we have been talking about \nthis bill for a long period of time. We actually started trying to get \na highway reauthorization bill way back in 2009, when the old bill from \n2005 expired.\n  But the problem is--and I want to get back to where I was--there is \nan alternative to this bill. If we defeat this bill, we go back to \nextensions. If we go back to extensions, first of all, we are losing \nabout 30 percent of the money off the top. Everybody knows that. \nSecondly, we don't get these reforms. If people are concerned out \nthere--conservatives--that they want to defeat this and go back to \nextensions, they are not going to have reform with the enhancements. \nRight now the law requires 10 percent, depending on how we want to put \nit, in total funding or 2 percent of surface transportation. That has \nto be spent on transportation enhancements.\n  My good friend, the chairman of the committee, Senator Boxer, and I \ndisagree on enhancements. She likes them; I don't. I want money to be \nspent on concrete, on roads and bridges. This is what I think we should \nbe doing. But that is a disagreement we had and so we had a compromise \nwhere she can have--and anyone can have--what they want. It is an \noversimplification, but it means, yes, this money is going to be put \ninto something. It can be enhancements. In my State of Oklahoma, it is \nnot going to be in enhancements, it is going to be paying for some of \nthe unfunded mandates. It will be paying for things we have to do in \nterms of the environment and things that are required. So we have \nsolved that problem. If we don't pass this bill, we go right back and \nit will have to go to enhancements.\n  On streamlining, all the streamlining is in this in terms of \nenvironmental streamlining. Talk to any of the road contractors out \nthere and they will tell you about the waste of money and the number of \nmiles of roads they can't do\n\n[[Page S4751]]\n\nbecause of some of these requirements--these environmental \nrequirements. We have streamlined those requirements. If we don't pass \nthis bill, we will go back to extensions and the same thing applies--we \nare going to lose all those opportunities. So not only will it cost \nmore, we will not get the streamlining.\n  I am very proud of a group that has always supported me, the American \nConservative Union. Is there anyone around here who doesn't think the \nAmerican Conservative Union isn't conservative? I made this a part of a \nspeech yesterday, an editorial by Al Cardenas, the chairman of the \nAmerican Conservative Union. It is an op-ed piece he wrote. But let me \nread now two short paragraphs from this op-ed piece from the American \nConservative Union:\n\n       Article One, Section Eight of the Constitution specifically \n     lists interstate road-building as one of the delineated \n     powers and responsibilities vested in the federal Government. \n     In Federalist Paper #42, James Madison makes an early case \n     for the federal government's role in maintaining a healthy \n     infrastructure, by stating ``Nothing which tends to \n     facilitate the intercourse between states, can be deemed \n     unworthy of the public care.''\n\n  And the article goes on to say--and, remember, this is the American \nConservative Union.\n\n       Perhaps most importantly, those of us who believe in \n     constitutional conservatism understand that unlike all the \n     things the Federal Government wastes our money on, \n     transportation spending is at the core of what constitutes \n     legitimate spending.\n\n  That is from the American Conservative Union. I wanted people to \nunderstand that voting for this is the conservative approach. We get \nmore for the money being spent, it has all the streamlining in it, and \nit is our constitutional responsibility. This is what we are supposed \nto do. There are only two ways of doing it: one way is to pass this \nbill and the other is to operate under extensions, and I think it is \nvery important for people to understand that.\n  With that, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Order of Procedure H.R. 4348\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding lack of \nreceipt of the papers with respect to the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 4348, at 12:55 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to a \nseries of stacked votes as outlined in this agreement; that the time \nuntil then be equally be divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees; that the only points of order in order to the conference \nreport be budget points of order or points of order relative to rule \nXXVIII, which is the scope of conference, or rule XXVIII, paragraph 9, \navailability; that if a rule XXVIII scope of conference point of order, \nrule XXVIII availability point of order or budget-related point of \norder is made against the conference report and an applicable motion to \nwaive is made during any debate time, the Senate proceed to vote on the \nmotions to waive in the order they were raised following the use or \nyielding back of time; that if the motions to waive are successful, the \nSenate proceed to vote on the conference report; that adoption of the \nconference report be subject to a 60-affirmative-vote threshold; that \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided in the usual form prior to each \nvote, and all after the first vote be 10-minute votes, and I ask that \nin spite of the fact the votes may not come right after each other, all \nthe rest today will be 10-minute votes; further, that if the conference \nreport is adopted, the title amendment be agreed to; finally, that no \nmotions to recommit be in order to the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Paul, I raise a \npoint of order that the conference report on H.R. 4348 has not been \npublicly available for 48 hours as required by rule XXVIII, paragraph \n9.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to waive paragraph 9 of rule XXVIII \nwith respect to the conference report to accompany H.R. 4348.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet), \nthe Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye), and the Senator from Colorado \n(Mr. Udall) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Senator Coats wishes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to raise the point of order \nthat section 1538 of the conference report to accompany H.R. 4348 \nviolates rule XXVIII as it is a matter not committed by either House.\n  This is not a partisan issue. The Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, \nthe Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Kirk, \nand I reached an agreement on how to deal with this issue. Yet during \nthis conference work that was proceeding in the dark of the night----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is not debatable.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am not debating it. I am explaining it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to waive all scope of conference \npoints of order on rule XXVIII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there further points of order?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask for a recorded vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there are no further points of order on \nrule XXVIII, the yeas and nays have been asked for on the motion to \nwaive.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S4752]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate on the \nwaiver.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I jumped the gun a little bit. This gives \nme a chance to explain it twice. Let me say there was a bipartisan \nagreement that was reached on this. I will not name names, but after it \nwent over to the House, somebody dropped something in the middle of the \nnight to change this whole process.\n  The issue is not just so-called Asian carp; the issue is that if this \nlanguage is allowed to proceed, we will be authorizing over $100 \nbillion of potential spending to address this without any review by the \nCongress. All we ask for in our agreement was a simple opportunity to \nreview the study by the Corps of Engineers so we can make a decision \nbased on all the facts, which included over $100 billion of authorized \nspending. That is why I urge my colleagues to oppose any effort to \nwaive this rule.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the provision in question simply \naccelerates a study of invasive species such as the destructive Asian \ncarp, a study essential to protecting the Great Lakes, a resource that \nis vital to the health, safety, and livelihoods of millions of \nAmericans.\n  The study was included in the Water Resources Development Act of 2007 \nthat authorized the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a feasibility \nstudy to prevent the spread of aquatic nuisance species between the \nGreat Lakes and Mississippi River basins.\n  Since that time, Congress has provided over $13 million to the Corps \nto conduct this study. The Corps maintains that the study cannot be \ncompleted until the end of 2015.\n  The provision included in the conference agreement before us today \nwould accelerate this study and require its completion within 18 \nmonths.\n  We should not minimize the threat of the destructive Asian carp \nentering the Great Lakes.\n  If Asian carp got into the Great Lakes, they would not only pose a \nvery serious threat to the environment but would have a devastating \neffect on thousands of local jobs and a $7 billion fishing industry.\n  Accelerating this study would put us on a better track to protect one \nof our Nation's greatest treasures and the thousands of jobs that \ndepend on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know everyone is anxious to finish. I am \ntoo. This is a massive bill. It is so good for our country. This bill \nincludes student loans, flood insurance, and 2.8 million jobs. There \nare a lot of disappointments. I have a few in this bill that I would be \nhappy to share with someone at the right time. We must waive this. This \nis one of the great accomplishments of this Congress. Please, everyone, \nvote to waive this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays were previously ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, the waiver provisions of applicable budget \nresolutions, and section 4(g)(3) of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of \n2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of those Acts and \napplicable budget resolutions for purposes of the pending conference \nreport, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  However, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from CBO be printed \nin the Record at this point, which indicates that not only is \neverything paid for in this bill, it reduces the debt.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Congressional Budget Office,\n\n\n                                                U.S. Congress,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 2012.\n     Hon.

That \n     figure does not include effects that may be counted for \n     budget enforcement purposes in the House of Representatives. \n     Specifically, the House-passed budget resolution calls for \n     counting transfers from the general fund of the Treasury to \n     the Highway Trust Fund as new spending.\n       Major provisions of the legislation that would affect the \n     budget (see Table 1) would:\n       Reauthorize, through fiscal year 2014, the surface \n     transportation programs administered by the Federal-Aid \n     Highway Administration, the Federal Transit Administration, \n     the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the \n     Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and certain \n     programs administered by the Pipelines and Hazardous \n     Materials Administration;\n       Establish the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund and require \n     that 80 percent of any administrative and civil penalties \n     paid to the federal government under the Clean Water Act in \n     connection with the April 2010 explosion at the Deepwater \n     Horizon facility in the Gulf of Mexico be deposited into that \n     trust fund and made available to be spent;\n       Change the interest rate that pension plans use to measure \n     their liabilities, increase pension premium rates for both \n     variable and flat rate premiums paid to the Pension Benefit \n     Guaranty Corporation, and establish a cap on the variable \n     rate premium;\n       Provide payments to certain states by reauthorizing the \n     Secure Rural Schools and Payments In Lieu of Taxes programs;\n       Allow eligible federal employees to enter into a phased \n     retirement, during which they continue to work part time \n     while drawing a partial salary and a partial civil service \n     retirement annuity;\n\n[[Page S4753]]\n\n       Reduce the additional Medicaid payments to Louisiana that \n     it will receive based on prior declarations of federal \n     disasters;\n       Repeal a requirement that the Department of Transportation \n     reimburse the difference in cost between shipping foreign \n     food aid on a U.S.-flag ship and a foreign-flag ship;\n       Reduce mandatory payments to states that have completed \n     certain reclamation projects on land formerly used for \n     mining;\n       Reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program through \n     2017 and increase premiums for some subsidized policies;\n       Retain an interest rate of 3.4 percent on all new \n     subsidized student loans until June 30, 2013, and change the \n     interest the federal government pays on behalf of some \n     borrowers who are attending school; and\n       Raise additional revenue by increasing the ability of \n     businesses with excess assets in their pension funds to use \n     them for retiree health and life insurance benefits, and by \n     defining businesses that make roll-your-own machines \n     available for consumer use as tobacco manufacturers.\n       CBO estimates that implementing the legislation also would \n     lead to discretionary spending of $95.9 billion over the \n     2013-2017 period (see Table 2); such spending would be \n     subject to future appropriation actions. Of that amount, the \n     spending on transportation programs would total $94.3 \n     billion, which reflects estimated obligation levels for 2013 \n     and 2014 that are approximately equal to the obligation \n     levels for 2012, adjusted for inflation.\n       In addition, CBO estimates that implementing provisions of \n     the conference report for the remainder of 2012, 2013, and \n     2014 would result in an end-of-year balance in 2014 of \n     approximately $4 billion in the highway account of the \n     Highway Trust Fund and about $1 billion in the transit \n     account of the Highway Trust Fund. Table 3 provides a \n     projection of future spending, revenues, and remaining \n     balances in the Highway Trust Fund over the next 10 years.\n       I hope this information is useful to you. If you need \n     additional details, we will be pleased to provide them. The \n     staff contact is Sarah Puro, who can be reached at 226-2860.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Douglas W. Elmendorf,\n                                                         Director.\n\n   TABLE 1--ESTIMATE OF THE EFFECTS ON DIRECT SPENDING AND REVENUES OF THE CONFERENCE REPORT FOR H.R. 4348, MAP-21, AS

Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation. Notes: FMAP = Federal Medical Assistance Percentages; * = between -$500,000 and $0. Amounts may not sum\n  to totals because of rounding.\na H.R. 4348 would provide $12.4 billion in contract authority (a mandatory form of budget authority) for the last quarter of fiscal year 2012, $50.1 billion for fiscal year 2013, and $50.9\n  billion for fiscal year 2014, CBO estimates. Consistent with the rules in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act for constructing its baseline for future contract authority\n  for transportation programs, CBO assumes that the contract authority for years after 2014 would be equal to the amount provided for 2014, the last year of the authorization.\nb CBO expects that most of the outlays from contract authority (a mandatory form of budget authority) for surface transportation programs will continue to be controlled by obligation\n  limitations enacted in future appropriation acts. Those expenditures are displayed in Table 2.\nc The proposed amendment would raise premiums for certain subsidized flood insurance policies, increasing net income to the National Flood Insurance Program by $2.7 billion. However, because\n  many policies would continue to be subsidized and the program would continue to face significant interest costs from its prior and future borrowing, CBO expects that additional receipts\n  collected under this legislation would be spent to cover future program shortfalls, resulting in no net effect on the budget over the 11-year period.\n\n[[Page S4754]]\n\n \nd Pursuant to section 508 of H. Con. Res. 112, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget--Fiscal Year 2013, general fund transfers to the Highway Trust Fund are considered to be new budget\n  authority and outlays for budget enforcement purposes in the House of Representatives. CBO estimates that such transfers would increase the balances attributed to the Highway Trust Fund;\n  however, those transfers would not increase direct spending or affect budget deficits.\n\n\n   TABLE 2--CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION UNDER THE CONFERENCE REPORT FOR H.R. 4348, MAP-21, AS\n                             POSTED ON THE RULES COMMITTEE WEB SITE ON JUNE 28, 2012\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             By Fiscal Year, in Millions of Dollars\n                                               -----------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   2013       2014       2015       2016       2017    2013-2017\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\nSpending from the Highway Trust Fund:\n    Estimated Obligation Limitation a.........     49,409     50,103          0          0          0     99,512\n    Estimated Outlays.........................     12,318     31,794     27,318     12,134      6,780     90,344\nOther Authorized Transportation Programs:\n    Estimated Authorization level.............      2,697      2,198          0          0          0      4,895\n    Estimated Outlays.........................        379      1,011      1,168        817        618      3,993\nNon-Transportation Programs: b\n    Estimated Authorization Level.............        438        437        437        437        437      2,186\n    Estimated Outlays.........................         80        245        337        431        435      1,528\n    Total Changes:\n        Estimated Budgetary Resources.........     52,544     52,738        437        437        437    106,593\n        Estimated Outlays.....................     12,777     33,050     28,823     13,382      7,833     95,865\nMemorandum:\n    Reduction in Offsetting Receipts from.....\n    Lower Employer Contributionsc.............          0          2          3          3          3         11\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Components may not sum to totals because of rounding.\na Estimated discretionary outlays reflect use of funds from the contract authority provided by the legislation\n  under the obligation limitations specified or estimated by CBO. (Outlays stemming from any additional contract\n  authority that would be provided for years after 2014 would be attributable to future legislation.) Under\n  current law, CBO estimates that spending from the Highway Trust Fund would be about $48 billion in 2012. (See\n  Table 3 for estimates of total outlays from the trust fund in 2013 and subsequent years.)\nb H.R. 4348 would authorize the appropriation of $440 million a year over the 2013-2017 period for a national\n  flood mapping program and flood mitigation assistance. The legislation also would lower future federal\n  employer retirement contributions. Those contributions are contingent on future appropriation actions.\nc Employer contributions are intragovernmental transactions that do not affect the deficit; positive numbers\n  indicate a decrease in receipts.\n\n\nTABLE 3--SUMMARY OF CASH FLOWS FOR ACCOUNTS IN THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND UNDER H.R. 4348, MAP-21, AS POSTED ON THE WEB SITE OF THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON RULES\n                                                                    ON JUNE 28, 2012\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                         By fiscal year, in billions of dollars--\n                                                                 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   2012    2013    2014    2015    2016    2017    2018    2019    2020    2021    2022\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHighway Account:\n    Start-of-Year Balance.......................................      14       8       4       4       c       c       c       c       c       c       c\n    Revenues and Interest.......................................      33      33      33      34      35      36      36      36      36      37      37\n    Intragovernmental Transfers.................................       2       6      10       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0\n    Outlaysa,b..................................................      42      43      44      44      44      45      45      46      46      47      47\n    End-of-Year Balance.........................................       8       4       4       c       c       c       c       c       c       c       c\nTransit Account:\n    Start-of-Year Balance.......................................       7       5       5       1       c       c       c       c       c       c       c\n    Revenues and Interest.......................................       5       5       5       5       5       5       5       5       5       5       5\n    Intragovernmental Transfers.................................       0       0       2       0       0       0       0       0       0       0       0\n    Outlaysa,b..................................................       7       8       8       9      10      10      10       9       9      10      10\n    End-of-Year Balance.........................................       5       5       1       c       c       c       c       c       c       c       c\nMemorandum:\nCumulative Shortfall: c\n    Highway Account Shortfall...................................    n.a.    n.a.    n.a.      -6     -15     -24     -33     -42     -52     -62     -72\n    Transit Account Shortfall...................................    n.a.    n.a.    n.a.      -3      -7     -12     -16     -20     -24     -29     -33\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNotes: n.a. = not applicable.\nContract authority is a mandatory form of budget authority typically provided in authorization acts.\nObligation limitations are limitations on the obligation of contract authority typically provided in appropriation acts.\na After 2014, the estimated outlays assume obligations will continue at the 2014 level, adjusted for inflation. The total outlays shown reflect prior\n  and future obligations.\nb Outlays include amounts ''flexed'' or transferred between the highway and transit accounts. CBO estimates that amount would total about $1 billion\n  annually.\nc CBO projects that, under provisions of the Conference Report for H.R. 4348, the highway account and the transit account of the Highway Trust Fund\n  would be exhausted in fiscal year 2015. Under current law, the Highway Trust Fund cannot incur negative balances. However, following rules in the\n  Deficit Control Act of 1985, CBO's baseline for highway spending assumes that obligations presented to the Highway Trust Fund will be paid in full.\n  The memorandum to this table illustrates the cumulative shortfall of fund balances, assuming spending levels that would be authorized by the\n  Conference Report for H.R. 4348.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, if I could have everybody's attention, \naccording to CBO, this is paid for the old way, where we spend all the \nmoney in a year or two and then it is paid for over 10.\n  This body came together last August in a bipartisan way to put in \nplace the Budget Control Act, and this bill violates the deemed budget \nby $2.5 billion. This will be the third time we violate the Budget \nControl Act deemed budget. For all of those people who are meeting in \nthe evenings, meeting in groups in rooms trying to solve our Nation's \nfiscal issues, a vote to waive this motion says we don't have the \ndiscipline, the courage, or the will to do what we told the American \npeople we would do to try to get our fiscal house in order.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this motion to waive right now.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office is a \nnonpartisan body that determines what spending is for the Congress, and \nthey have determined that this bill is paid for and it reduces the \ndebt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am extremely disappointed to be here today \nto discuss a provision in the conference report that impacts my home \nState and potentially impacts a number of other states. The provision \nrelates to the abandoned mine land trust fund, and undoes a carefully \nconstrued compromise that occurred in 2006 between a coalition of \nEastern and Western States, mine workers, and coal companies.\n  This provision was included at the last moment. This pay-for was not \nin either the Senate version of the Transportation bill, nor was it in \nthe House version. Although it has a tremendous impact on Wyoming, \nneither Senator Barrasso nor I were consulted about the impact of the \nprovision. We are extremely disappointed that is the case and seek \ncommitments from our colleagues to fix this provision hopefully as a \ntechnical correction, but at any rate not later than the end of the \nyear to reconstruct the careful compromise that occurred in 2006. While \nI respect the work of the conference committee, provisions like this \nare the reason that Congress is unpopular. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to undo this terrible provision and make Wyoming and \nother impacted states whole.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I second the comments of Senator Enzi. \nThis is an egregious provision that was included at the last moment \nwithout any consultation of Senator Enzi or I. I am extremely \ndisappointed that we have not been able to address this matter before \nthe conference report was filed, and it is essential to fix it as soon \nas possible preferably in a technical corrections bill that will be \ndrafted in the coming weeks but most certainly by the end of the year.\n  This provision is not well thought out. It has the potential to \nimpact not only Wyoming but a number of other States as well. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to fix the provision in an \nexpeditious manner.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I understand the problems that my \ncolleagues from Wyoming have with section 100125 of the conference \nreport. I recognize that this provision was included in the conference \nreport without their consultation. We will be working on a corrections \nbill in the coming weeks, and I intend to work with them to address \nthis issue in that bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I second the chairwoman's commitment to \nworking with the Senators from Wyoming to fix this problem in the \ntechnical corrections bill. It is important that we find a way to \naddress the issue as soon as possible, and I will work with them to \nmake Wyoming and the other impacted States whole.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, a portion of the abandoned mine land trust \nfund program falls within the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. I am also committed to working with my colleagues from \nWyoming to correct this situation. I hope we can do so as soon as \npossible.\n\n\n                             Transit Title\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, we are poised to pass a truly historic \ntransportation bill and I wanted to engage in a brief colloquy with my \ncolleague Chairman Johnson, with whom I have worked closely over the \npast year and a half to craft the transit title of the bill. He has \nbeen a true pleasure to work with and I think we should all be proud \nthat we have secured stable funding for public transportation over the \nnext 2 years.\n  The bill has record amounts of rail funding and by abandoning \nearmarks, all of the major formula programs have been increased \nsignificantly. We have greatly enhanced the Federal Transit \nAdministration's powers to provide safety oversight and set national \nstandards, which will ensure millions of transit passengers can travel \nsafely and efficiently.\n  But for the purposes of this colloquy I wanted to focus on section \n20013 on private sector participation in public transportation. I ask \nthe chairman, does anything in this section show a preference by \nCongress for public transportation to be provided by private operators \nrather than public operators?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Absolutely not. That section is intended \nto help public and private sector providers to better coordinate \nservice and allow for more private investment in public transportation \nprojects. Public providers of public transportation do our Nation a \ngreat service in providing affordable efficient service, lowering \npollution, and easing traffic congestion. There is no reason to have a \npolicy that favors private-public transportation service, and this \nlanguage does not do so.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Chairman Johnson, I completely agree. This language \nshould not be interpreted to encourage or require public-private \npartnership activities in transit or give any preference to grantees \nbased on the decisions they make on this issue.\n  For years, the committee has endorsed the longstanding congressional \npolicy that decisions involving the choice between public and private \ntransit operators should be left to local authorities who are better \nequipped to make local transportation decisions. The Federal government \nis clearly best suited to making broad public policy decisions rather \nthan micromanaging the local transit choices selected to meet the needs \nof rural, urban, and suburban communities. Does the chairman agree?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Absolutely. Nothing in this bill changes \nthe fact that decisions to use public or private service should be up \nto local providers. We firmly believe that the public versus private \nquestion should be decided on the basis of local needs, not ideology. \nAnd most importantly, the Federal Government should remain neutral, and \nit should not intrude on local decisionmaking. The language in current \n49 U.S.C. 5306 regarding private sector participation states that such \nissues are guided by local policies, criteria, and decisionmaking. This \nbill maintains this language, reaffirming Congress' commitment to local \ncontrol on this issue.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the chairman. I look forward to continue \nworking with you to oversee the implementation of this and other \nprovisions in this bill and continue to do all we can do to support a \nrobust, well-funded public transportation program.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues on \nthe transportation conference for including the National Flood \nInsurance Program reauthorization and for removing the controversial \nresidual risk provision.\n  That provision was a real concern to me and more than a dozen cities \nand counties in California. It would have required nearly 1 million \nresidents in my State to purchase flood insurance even though they live \nbehind fully functioning levees that meet or exceed Federal safety \nstandards. That provision alone could have quadrupled the number of \nhomeowners in my State who have to buy flood insurance.\n  The flood insurance bill called this low-level risk behind levees \n``residual risk.'' It is the risk left over after a levee has been \nbuilt--the risk of levee failure, in essence.\n  These are levees that homeowners funded with their own tax dollars, \nand the provision would have forced them to spend even more money. That \nis just not good policy. And I was proud to add my voice to that of the \nSenator from Arkansas in strong opposition to including it in the bill.\n  The bottom line is this: Until the residual risk provision was \nremoved, the National Flood Insurance Program reauthorization would \nhave had a devastating effect on communities in California and across \nthe Nation.\n  Even homeowners in communities who maintain their levees to Federal \nsafety standards with their own tax dollars would have been forced to \npay for Federal flood insurance. I simply could not support such an \nunfair policy. It sent the message to homeowners\n\n[[Page S4756]]\n\nand local communities that regardless of their investments in flood \nprotection, it is simply not good enough. That is not the message we \nshould be sending when this country needs to invest more in flood \ncontrol infrastructure, not when homeowners are struggling to pay their \nmortgages, not when housing starts are near alltime lows, and not when \nour economy is still struggling to get back on track.\n  I was not alone in my opposition to the residual risk provision. I \nreceived letters from elected officials across the State--Oceanside, \nLong Beach, Lakewood, Los Angeles, Santa Maria, Stockton, Sacramento, \nYuba City. Del Norte, Sutter, Yolo, and Butte Counties were opposed, as \nwell as San Joaquin County.\n  This was not a regional issue. The letters came in from southern \nCalifornia, the central coast, northern California and the Central \nValley.\n  In San Joaquin County, in the middle of my State, this provision \nwould have meant 280,000 additional residents had to purchase flood \ninsurance. This is a county where 1 in every 194 homes is in \nforeclosure--3.3 times the national average. At even $1 a day, this \nadded expense could jeopardize the county's already shaky housing \nmarket.\n  The purchase requirement would have covered most of the city of \nStockton, with a population of nearly 300,000. This would have further \ndevastated a city that suffered the second highest foreclosure rate in \nthe Nation last year.\n  In Palo Alto, this provision would have required another 5,500 \nhomeowners to buy insurance.\n  In Sutter County, an estimated 28,000 of the 34,308 parcels would \nhave been affected. That is 81.6 percent of all parcels in the county.\n  In Butte County, 14,000 parcels would have been affected.\n  In Los Angeles County, supervisors Mark Ridley Thomas and Don Knabe \ntell me that at least 200,000 properties and 800,000 residents would \nhave been impacted. These homeowners are currently protected by 130 \nmiles of levees and 18 dams in L.A. County.\n  Many of the affected homeowners live along the Los Angeles River, \nwhich isn't really a river at all--it is a concrete channel. And it is \nvery hard to imagine a flood ever occurring there. More than $200 \nmillion has been invested to minimize the risk.\n  The federally authorized Los Angeles County Drainage Area Project \nreinforced levees along the Los Angeles River to protect against floods \nwell beyond a 100-year event. Local taxpayers contributed $55 million \nto complete this project; Federal contributions totaled another $155 \nmillion. This investment was made so that residents could avoid $32 \nmillion in yearly flood insurance premiums. With the inclusion of the \nresidual risk provision, homeowners in the area would have once again \nhad to pay flood insurance bills every year.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Senators Cochran and the chairman and \nranking member to address this problem, but changes they made to the \noriginal draft did not go far enough. Even with their changes, the \nprovision could have further depressed home prices by driving up \nownership costs in many areas.\n  Let me be clear: This policy wasn't proposed because homeowners lived \nbehind unsafe levees. These were safe levees that meet Federal \nstandards. Some believe this provision was added to the original bill \nto restore the fiscal solvency of the program. By bringing in new, low-\nrisk properties, it is true that the fiscal health of the Flood \nInsurance Program would have improved. But I, for one, oppose propping \nup the Flood Insurance Program on the backs of constituents who played \nby the rules.\n  If the goal is to ensure that people are informed about the risks \nthey face, I continue to be willing to work with my colleagues to \naccomplish that. In fact, California already offers a model for \nachieving that very goal.\n  The bottom line is this: Even with the changes made to the residual \nrisk provision, the bill would have still required homeowners and \nbusinesses protected by certified levees to purchase mandatory flood \ninsurance. Candidly, I was shocked that we even considered adding this \nprovision without a full floor debate because it was not a trivial \nextension. The bill would have imposed substantial new costs to nearly \n1 million homeowners in California alone.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues on the conference committee for removing \nthis provision. This conference report was not the time or place for it \nto be considered.\n  Now, with the 5-year reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance \nProgram in place, we will be taking an important step to stabilize our \nhousing market. We have also taken some very responsible steps to put \nthe program back on the path to fiscal solvency.\n  I commend my colleagues for putting together this package of bills. I \nknow they had a tremendous challenge, and I think they have done an \nexceptional job.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to turn to discussing the \nvital contributions of staff who worked on this bill. We are very \nfortunate in the Senate to be able to rely on the expertise and the \nsupport of so many talented and dedicated staffers whose efforts \nenabled us to finalize this conference report.\n  This bill turned out to be unique because it spanned so many \ndifferent issues. In addition to the ones I have already mentioned, my \nstaff also had to work on pension matters, flood insurance, Federal \ntrust funds, labor, and a range of other issues. All of this combined \nto make this a very complicated bill with many moving parts.\n  Accordingly, I want to take this opportunity to publicly and \nprofessionally thank the following staffers for guiding this bill \nthrough markups in different Senate committees, negotiating with \ncounterparts from the House of Representatives, and getting us over the \nfinish line with a conference report that provides the American people \nwith the good policies included in this bill:\n  There was Tom Lynch, who worked on both the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee's portion of the bill and the Finance Committee's \nportion.\n  Tax Counsel Ryan Abraham, whose work along with Tom Lynch on the \nhighway trust fund was key to being able to fund highways and transit \nprojects under the bill.\n  Tom, Ryan, and Lily Batchelder, chief tax counsel and head of Finance \nCommittee's tax team, held more than 20 staff meetings with Democrats \nand Republicans before our Finance Committee markup.\n  Mark Hybner, who was critical to refining the Indian Reservation \nRoads Program among other things, a program that is very important to \nthe seven tribes in my State.\n  Tax and benefits counsel Tom Reeder, a true seasoned professional \nwithout whom we couldn't have found the essential offsets to ensure the \nhighway trust fund would remain solvent.\n  Spencer Gray, who shepherded the secure rural schools and payment in \nlieu of taxes through this process.\n  Dave Hughes and Ann Cammack, who made critical contributions both to \nraise revenue and in tracking policy.\n  Sean Morrison and Blaise Cote, the Finance Committee's two excellent \nresearch assistants.\n  Heather O'Loughlin, easily one of the most versatile and capable \nstaffers working in the Senate, who was key both to the education and \nthe flood insurance portions.\n  Amber Cottle, Bruce Hirsch, Gabriel Adler, Hun Quach, Chelsea Thomas, \nand Rory Murphy, who were very helpful in the effort to develop offsets \nduring the Finance Committee markup.\n  Department of Transportation detailee and Billings Montana native \nAvital Barnea, who lent helpful assistance at a crucial time.\n  Jeffrey Arnold, who was very helpful in assisting on Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation provisions and phased retirement.\n  Intern extraordinaire Pete Markuson, who logged a lot of meaningful \nhours.\n  The outstanding press team of Jenny Donohue, Meaghan Smith, Ryan \nCarey, Kate Downen, Kathy Weber, and our newest addition, Sean Neary.\n  And my indispensable leadership staff of Jon Selib, Russ Sullivan, \nand Paul Wilkins, who as always remained focused and unflappable \ndespite the challenges.\n  Finally, I also want to use this opportunity to thank Bettina \nPoirier, David Napoliello, Andrew Dohrmann, and Grant Cope from \nChairman Boxer's Environment and Public Works Committee staff; Ruth Van\n\n[[Page S4757]]\n\nMark, James O'Keeffe, Murphie Barrett, Kyle Miller, Dmitri Karakitsos, \nand Alex Renjel from Senator Inhofe's staff; Charles Brittingham with \nSenator Vitter; Tyler Rushforth with Senator Reid; Ellen Doneski, James \nReid, Ian Jefferies, Rich Swayze, Richard Russell, and Bailey Edwards \nfrom the Commerce Committee; and Chris Campbell, Mark Prater, Jim \nLyons, Nick Wyatt, and Preston Rutledge from the Finance Committee.\n  Without the individual and collective contributions of each one of \nthese people I have mentioned, we would not have pulled this off. For \nthem and their efforts to help support American jobs, all of us should \nbe very grateful.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the bill before us today takes several \nimportant steps in several policy areas to move our Nation forward. It \nprevents a pending student loan interest rate hike that would make \ncollege less affordable for American students and their families. It \nmakes important investments in our roads, bridges, and other \ntransportation infrastructure, investments that will put Americans to \nwork today and make our economy more competitive for years to come. It \nreauthorizes the Flood Insurance Program that provides security to \nmillions of Americans, while making the program more efficient and more \nfair to States such as Michigan that for too long have paid more in \npremiums than they receive in benefits. While this legislation does not \ninclude everything I had hoped for or supported, it makes significant \nprogress on issues our constituents need us to address.\n  Millions of Americans will be relieved that this bill avoids a \nlooming increase in student loan interest rates. On July 1, those \ninterest rates are scheduled to double, an increase that Americans \nalready struggling to pay for higher education simply cannot afford. \nExtending the current 3.4 percent interest rate for another year lifts \na significant burden, financial and emotional, from students and their \nfamilies who were looking to us for aid.\n  I am pleased Senate and House conferees have come to an agreement on \na transportation reauthorization. Reauthorization of our Nation's \ntransportation programs is long overdue.\n  Investing in transportation infrastructure creates jobs and improves \nour international competitiveness. We create more than 35,000 jobs for \nevery $1 billion in Federal funds we spend on transportation \ninfrastructure. The bill will create or preserve an estimated 3 million \njobs nationwide. In Michigan, the bill will provide more than $2 \nbillion over the next 2 years for road projects and another $261 \nmillion over the next 2 years for Michigan transit projects. Funding \ntransportation infrastructure improvements at robust levels is one of \nthe most obvious things we can do to help boost the U.S. economy.\n  The conference report extends Federal surface transportation programs \nat current levels, with a small adjustment for inflation, through \nSeptember 2014. Given the difficult budget climate, this has to be \nviewed as a victory. Our State transportation agencies need to be able \nto do long-term planning. This bill helps that cause and is surely \nbetter than the short-term extensions we have been living under. Given \nthe negative budget climate and the difficulty we had finding the \nrevenue to offset the highway trust fund shortfall, a 2-year bill is \nwhat is possible, although I would have preferred a longer term bill.\n  I am pleased the agreement includes a provision that would direct the \nCorps of Engineers to accelerate its feasibility study of preventing \nthe inter-basin transfer of aquatic invasive species, such as the \ndestructive Asian carp, between the Mississippi River and the Great \nLakes basins. While the Corps is planning to produce an interim report \nat the end of 2013, this provision would require a full feasibility \nreport that would also include a recommendation for implementing \npreventative measures. Accelerating this study will put us on a better \ntrack to protect our $7 billion Great Lakes fishery that supports \nthousands of jobs.\n  The conference agreement includes a provision regarding harbor \nmaintenance that is based on an amendment to the Senate Transportation \nbill. This is the first time we have addressed harbor maintenance in a \ntransportation bill, and including this language will help elevate this \nimportant issue and strengthen momentum to use trust fund receipts for \nharbor maintenance.\n  I am disappointed, however, that the provision in the conference \nagreement does not include the strong enforcement language I urged \nconferees to include that would ensure that appropriators actually \ninclude funding for harbor maintenance that is collected for this \npurpose.\n  Navigation infrastructure is a vital link in the transportation \nsystem, one our economy depends upon. Maintaining our harbors and ports \nis vital to our economic competitiveness. I will continue to work to \nensure that we provide sufficient Federal funds to properly maintain \nour harbors.\n  The conference agreement also extends for 1 year mandatory PILT \nfunding, or payments in lieu of taxes, that will provide about $4 \nmillion to Michigan local governments to help offset losses in property \ntaxes due to nontaxable Federal lands within their boundaries. These \npayments can help support a variety of infrastructure and educational \nneeds. I had urged conferees to include this provision in the bill, and \nI am pleased it was included in the final agreement.\n  The conference report should provide some much needed equity to \nMichigan and other States through a 5-year reauthorization of the \nNational Flood Insurance Program.\n  Michigan residents have paid more than six times more in premiums \nthan they have received in payouts from the National Flood Insurance \nProgram. We must correct this disparity, and the conference report \ntakes some steps to do so in requiring that premiums be more reflective \nof the true risk of flooding.\n  The conference report will phase out subsidies for repetitive-loss \nproperties that continue to be rebuilt in high-risk areas. It will also \nphase out subsidized rates for vacation homes and businesses located in \nhigh-risk areas, many of which have received subsidized rates for more \nthan 30 years.\n  This bill will clarify the law to allow property owners to purchase \nflood insurance from a private insurer, rather than the Federal \nGovernment, if they so choose. This means private companies can compete \nwith FEMA to offer consumers a better price.\n  Finally, I am very disappointed that the conference report removes an \noffshore tax provision that I authored with Senator Conrad to fight \nagainst tax evasion. This provision, which was included by voice vote \nin the Senate bill and is similar to a provision I introduced as part \nof a broader offshore tax bill, was scored as raising over $1 billion \nover 10 years and could have helped pay for transportation programs or \nreduced the deficit. I am disappointed that Congress has yet again \nmissed an opportunity to fight offshore tax evasion, which robs \nbillions of sorely needed dollars from our Treasury each year.\n  The legislation before us today does not include everything I had \nhoped for or supported, but it is necessary, and we should pass it \nwithout further delay.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, at the first public meeting of the \nconference committee charged with producing transportation \nreauthorization legislation, I laid out a series of basic principles \nthat I think should guide our efforts to finance transportation policy. \nI had voted against the Senate bill in large part because it failed to \nfollow these basic principles.\n  Boiled down, these principles are simple. The user-pays model that is \nthe reason for the creation of the Highway Trust Fund should be \npreserved. Revenues and spending should line up on a year-to-year \nbasis. We should avoid spending down the trust fund. And we should not \nraise taxes, but rather should examine the spending side of the ledger.\n  The conference agreement is an even further departure from these \nprinciples than the Senate bill was. The conference agreement by and \nlarge uses sources of revenue that are problematic in and of themselves \nto facilitate yet another general fund transfer that requires our \nNation to make payments for 10 years on 2 years of programs.\n  Despite all of the committee markups, and staff meetings, and press \nconferences, and frantic press accounts, at the end of the day we \nsimply got the fourth in a series of general fund transfers that \nstretches back to 2008.\n\n[[Page S4758]]\n\n  I think the supposed consensus the conference committee product \nrepresents can best be summed up by the Margaret Thatcher quote I cited \nat the Finance Committee markup of a revenue title held on February 7.\n  ``To me consensus seems to be the process of abandoning all beliefs, \nprinciples, values and policies in search of something in which no one \nbelieves, but to which no one objects the process of avoiding the very \nissues that have to be solved, merely because you cannot get agreement \non the way ahead . . .''\n  Well I object. The taxpayers of this country deserve better than this \nlegislation, and I will be voting against it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose to the flood \ninsurance language that is included in the conference report to \naccompany H.R. 4348, which the Senate will consider today.\n  The Senate had been debating a stand-alone bill to reform the \nNational Flood Insurance Program for several days, but we were \nprevented from voting on amendments to the bill and ultimately passing \nthe legislation. Since agreement on a process for considering flood \ninsurance amendments was blocked, we are now forced into an up-or-down \nvote on a conference report that contains provisions that will save or \ncreate millions of jobs in the transportation sector and keep Federal \nstudent loan rates from doubling. I will support the conference report \nbecause of those provisions, but I oppose the flood insurance portions.\n  Last September, I saw firsthand how Hurricane Irene's floods \ndevastated communities in my State of New Jersey. President Obama and I \ntoured the wreckage together. It was heartbreaking. We saw families \nwith their belongings on their front lawns, and much of their homes \ndestroyed. Unfortunately, Hurricane Irene was not the only storm to \ncause major flooding in New Jersey recently. In just the last 3 years, \nFEMA has declared five federal disasters that caused major flooding in \nNew Jersey. For many of the people who have been hit by these floods, \ntheir homes are all they have. Many of them have owned their homes for \ngenerations. They have raised their children and built their lives in \nthem. For these homeowners, it would be wrong to turn our backs on \nthem. But I am afraid the flood insurance language in the conference \nreport could do exactly that.\n  The flood insurance language we are considering will require major \ninsurance premium increases for people living in certain homes built \nbefore FEMA's flood maps were finalized. For years, families who bought \nhomes built before floods maps were available paid lower rates for \ntheir flood insurance. We did that because we recognized it would be \nwrong to charge extremely high premiums on families who did not know \ntheir flood risk when they purchased their home. But the flood \ninsurance reform proposals on the table would bring the hammer down on \nthose families. Most families affected by the change would see their \npremiums double. Some may even see their premiums increase five-fold. \nIn New Jersey, we know of families in over 1,800 homes that would see \ntheir premiums increase under these provisions. Residents in other \nStates, including Louisiana, Texas, New York, Pennsylvania, and \nFlorida, would also face these dramatic rate hikes.\n  To address some of these concerns, I introduced two amendments on \nflood insurance this week. One would have prevented premium increases \nfor primary residences built prior to 1974, and the other would have \nallowed the increases to occur for some homeowners, but provided for a \nhardship exemption from premium increases for families that cannot \nafford the higher rates. Let's remember, many of these homeowners rely \non fixed incomes, are retired, and have budgeted with the expectation \nthat their premiums would stay steady. We should not change the rules \nin the middle of the game when homeowners have played by those rules \nfrom day one. Many of these families simply do not have the means to \nraise more money if rates increase.\n  I also cosponsored an amendment from Senator Pryor to eliminate a \nrequirement in the stand-alone bill that owners of homes behind dams \nand levees obtain flood insurance. I am pleased that the language in \nthe conference report does not include that requirement.\n  Flood insurance reform will have real implications for millions of \npeople throughout the United States, including in my home State of New \nJersey. Changes to the National Flood Insurance Program should not be \ntaken lightly, and deserve to be debated and amended on the Senate \nfloor. I am disappointed my Republican colleagues have prevented us \nfrom considering important flood insurance amendments this week, and I \noppose including flood insurance reform in the legislative package we \nare considering today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is \nagreeing to on the conference report to accompany H.R. 4348.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the transportation \nconference report. This legislation will establish for the first time \nFederal safety standards for metro systems.\n  My promises made are promises kept. After the deadly DC Metro crash \non June 22, 2009, I promised two things to the workers at Metro and my \nconstituents who ride Metro. One, I would deliver the $150 million in \ndedicated funding for Metro's capital improvements in the annual \nTransportation appropriations bill. I have done this every year. Two: \npass legislation giving the U.S. Department of Transportation authority \nto establish safety standards for metro systems across the country. \nToday, this legislation delivers on that promise.\n  We always say a grateful nation will never forget. Then we pound our \nchests, hold hearings, and nothing is ever done. Well, not this time \nand not this Senator. Immediately following the Metro crash, I was the \nfirst to introduce a bill, the National Metro Safety Act of 2009, to \nestablish Federal standards. My bill required the U.S. Department of \nTransportation to work with the National Transportation Safety Board to \nimplement their most wanted safety recommendations: crashworthiness \nstandards, emergency entry and evacuation design standards, and data \nevent recorders for rail cars; and hours-of-service regulations for \ntrain operators.\n  Now, 3 years later, Congress has finally acted. This highway bill \nincludes similar language to my transit safety bill. It requires the \nSecretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation to create and \nimplement safety standards and a safety training program. The Secretary \nmust also take into consideration the recommendations of the National \nTransportation Safety Board when establishing the safety performance \nstandards for railcars.\n  This bill before us today also requires transit authorities to \ncomplete comprehensive safety plans and States to have a safety \noversight program approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation. \nThe Secretary must certify that these oversight programs are meeting \nthe new Federal safety standards each year. If a State oversight agency \nis not doing its job, the Secretary can withhold Federal funding or \nrequire that 100 percent of funding be used to fix the metro system's \nproblems.\n  In addition, the U.S. Department of Transportation has the power to \nconduct inspections, investigations, and audits of transit system \nrailcars, facilities, and operations. It can also investigate accidents \nand provide corrective guidance. The Secretary has the authority to \nissue a subpoena when investigating an accident as well as require \nadditional reporting and recordkeeping.\n  Every weekday more than 7 million people board railcars. Now they can \nbreathe a bit easier knowing their metro will soon have Federal safety \nstandards just like commercial buses, airplanes, and commuter rail \nsystems. I want to thank Senators Tim Johnson and Bob Menendez for \nworking with me on this important safety issue.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to speak in \nsupport of the surface transportation conference report. As chairman of \nthe Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, which is \nresponsible for authorizing the public transportation portion of the \nbill, I was proud to serve as one of the conferees.\n  After intense and exhaustive negotiations our conference committee \nreached an agreement on a bill that will benefit every American. In my \nhome State of South Dakota alone,\n\n[[Page S4759]]\n\nthis bill will support 10,000 jobs and across the country it will \nsupport nearly 3 million jobs. It will improve rural transit service \nand make our Nation's highways safer and more efficient. I am relieved \nthat we will not let another construction season go by without \ncertainty of Federal funding.\n  From the start, the Banking Committee worked in a bipartisan fashion \non the transit reauthorization which is why we were able to pass our \nportion of this bill out of committee by a unanimous voice vote. I am \nhappy to say that most of our committee-passed bill is still intact in \nthe final product we have before us today.\n  This conference report will increase funding for public \ntransportation through the end of fiscal year 2014 and deliver critical \ninvestments in the Nation's aging transit infrastructure.\n  In addition, the bill will institute much needed reforms such as \nspeeding the construction of public transportation projects. The bill \nalso includes transit safety provisions that have been stalled for 3 \nyears.\n  Finally, our bill increases formula funding for all types of transit: \nadditional urban and rural formula funds, new money for every State to \naddress state of good repair needs, and more money for tribal transit. \nOur Nation's transit systems need more than $77 billion to address \nbacklogged repairs. This bill can't address all of those needs, but it \ncan ensure that our transit systems don't fall further behind.\n  Americans make 35 million trips on public transportation every \nweekday. Many of these trips are in our cities, but in places like \nSouth Dakota, rural transit service connects seniors with their doctors \nand helps our workers travel long distances to get to jobs. Everyone \nbenefits from public transportation, and this is a bill the American \npeople deserve.\n  This bill wouldn't have been possible without the hard work and \ndetermination of more people than I can name today. However, there are \na few in particular that I must single out.\n  We would not be at the finish line today if we didn't have Senator \nBoxer as our conference chairwoman. And Senator Menendez, our \nTransportation Subcommittee chairman, worked side-by-side with me on \ntransit since we started work on this bill last year. I thank them for \ntheir support.\n  And I would be remiss if I did not mention my staff. Homer Carlisle, \nmy lead transit aide, did outstanding work in helping craft this bill. \nIn the last year, he worked countless late nights that often lasted \ninto the early morning. Additionally, Charles Yi and Dwight Fettig were \ninstrumental in getting us to this point today.\n  There is just so much credit to go around. We had four committees \nworking on this bill and without such dedicated hard-working staffs we \ncould not have reached this agreement.\n  I am also pleased this conference report will provide stability to \nthe Flood Insurance Program by reauthorizing it for 5 years. The \nNational Flood Insurance Program protects millions of homeowners and is \ncritically important to our Nation's housing market.\n  As the people of South Dakota and others across the country have \nexperienced firsthand, flooding is responsible for more damage and \neconomic loss than any other type of natural disaster. It affects \npeople across the Nation, in every State, which is why we are going to \ndo the right thing today and pass this bipartisan legislation to \nprovide stability and much needed reforms for the program.\n  Since 2008, when our last long-term reauthorization expired, we have \npassed 18 short-term extensions of this program. During this time, the \nprogram has lapsed 5 times, for as long as 33 days, with detrimental \neffects on homeowners and the insurance and housing markets.\n  By passing this bill, we will end the uncertainty of month-to-month \nextensions for the NFIP and the families and businesses that rely on \nits $1.2 trillion of coverage.\n  This bill is not perfect, and no one has gotten everything that they \nwanted. Unfortunately, we were unable to reach a bipartisan agreement \non addressing the outstanding debt of the program that has accumulated \nsince Hurricane Katrina. But we have found enough common ground to move \ncritically important reforms forward. As part of that effort, I want to \nthank my colleagues on the Banking Committee and in the House for their \ncooperation and input.\n  The flood insurance bill didn't just come together in one night. It \ncame together in countless late nights worked by staff over the last \nyear. So I want to take this opportunity to thank my committee staff--\nBeth Cooper, Brett Hewitt, Chris Ledoux, Glen Sears, Laura Swanson, and \nCharles Yi for their work on this legislation. Additionally, I want to \nthank Alison Wright MacDonald and James Ollen-Smith from the Office of \nLegislative Counsel.\n  Lastly, I am pleased that the conference report includes a provision \nto avert a catastrophic interest rate hike on student loans. If \nCongress had failed to act, over 7 million students, including an \nestimated 31,000 undergraduates in South Dakota, would have seen their \ninterest rates double.\n  Earlier this month, I talked with students at Southeast Technical \nInstitute in Sioux Falls. They told me a rate hike would make it harder \nfor them to complete their schooling and would likely deter countless \nstudents from pursuing their higher education goals.\n  At a time when too many students are graduating with enormous debt \nloads, we should not make it more difficult for students to finance \ntheir education and manage their debt. I am glad we have reached an \nagreement that prevents the rate hike from taking effect. This is an \nimportant victory for students across South Dakota and throughout our \ncountry.\n  In passing this conference report we will send a clear message that \nit is still possible to work across the aisle and pass commonsense \nbipartisan legislation in the interest of the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this conference report, the conference report is \nagreed to.\n\n\n[[Page S4760]]\n\n\n       The title was amended so as to read: ``An Act to authorize \n     funds for Federal-aid highways, highway safety programs, and \n     transit programs, and for other purposes.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and lay that \nmotion upon the table.\n  The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Vote Explanation\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am disappointed in the final \nversion of this bill. If I had been present, I would have voted against \nit for a number of reasons, including the fact that it violates the \nBudget Control Act, it does not use the money produced from the pension \nreforms to shore up the financial strength of pension systems, and it \nfails to prevent the EPA from regulating coal ash as a hazardous \nmaterial.\n\n\n                            Vote Explanation\n\n Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I want the record to reflect that I \nwould have voted in favor of H.R. 4348, but I went home to Colorado to \nbe with my constituents, many of whom have lost their homes and are \nfacing severe challenges as several fires continue to rage across the \nState.\n  By finally reauthorizing our transportation programs for over 2 \nyears, we will provide some measure of certainty for States, \nmunicipalities, and businesses across the country urgently in need of \nmore than just a 2-month extension. The bill includes resources, \nmodeled on legislation that I introduced with Senator Mark Warner, for \ntransit-oriented development competitive grants to help local \ncommunities work with private investors to promote long-term transit \nplanning, and the legislation also contains a common-sense modification \nto the rural transit formula for which I advocated. These provisions \nwill benefit transit agencies across my State as they provide quality \nservice to Coloradans. The bill also maintains continued funding for \nthe Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) Program and Secure Rural Schools \nand Community Self-Determination (SRS) Act. These programs are \nlifelines for financially strapped rural counties and local businesses.\n  Of course this is not a perfect bill. I am disappointed that the \nconference committee eliminated the Senate provision funding the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund, a program that has been vital to \npreserving Colorado's western heritage. And I would have liked to see a \nlonger reauthorization, with structural reforms to the highway trust \nfund to ensure we can continue to finance improvements to our public \ninfrastructure and leave more--not less--for the next generation. That \nsaid, I commend my colleagues for all their hard work getting this bill \nacross the line.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation will prevent loan rates from \ndoubling and averts an increase that would have put the dream of a \ncollege degree further out of reach for thousands of Colorado students, \nand increased an already crushing debt burden on the middle \nclass.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it has been a very long and winding road \nto get to this place. I am overwhelmed with the amazing vote we just \nhad--the margin of success, the fact that this is the product that is \nnot only bipartisan but bicameral. I understand that the House vote was \nequally lopsided in favor of passage. I think this sends a tremendous \nsignal to the people of America, and that is that we can work together. \nDo not give up hope. When it comes to the well-being of our people, we \nmust get together.\n  I know the President must be smiling broadly because he has stated \nover and over how important it has been for us to pass a highway bill \nand to pass a reduction in student loan interest rate bill in order to \nhelp our people.\n  I have said many times that what kept me going and so many others--\nand I am going to name the various chairmen whom I worked with here and \nover on the House side and staff--what really kept us all going is the \nfact that we know how hard the construction sector has been hit in this \nrecession. The housing crisis started this recession. It has not gotten \nbetter. It is slowly coming around, but new construction is going to \ntake a while before all of the inventories are back in their \nappropriate place. What is going to help us? We could fill 10 Super \nBowl stadiums with unemployed construction workers. We are looking at \nwell over 1 million construction workers who are unemployed. Well, this \nwas the answer.\n  The transportation sector is hurting. The construction sector is \nhurting. And today we have sent a message, a powerful message that for \n2 years and 3 months, we have funded a good bill that is going to \nemploy up to 3 million workers and help thousands of businesses, and it \nis all in the private sector, the things that need to be done.\n  We know we have 70,000 bridges that are deficient. We know we have 50 \npercent of our roads that are deficient. We know we have transit \nsystems that need capital improvements. We know we have bike paths that \nneed fixing and pedestrian walkways that need fixing. All of that has \nbeen resolved.\n  Are there things in this package that I do not like? Absolutely. Are \nthere things in this package my Republican counterparts do not like? \nAbsolutely. We had to give. We had to take. We struggled.\n  I am going to read into the Record the names of these staffers. This \nis an unbelievable list. I am going to do it quickly. I am going to say \nto these staffers from the various committees that they knew how \nimportant their work was.\n  If we didn't succeed, there would be no more money in the highway \ntrust fund, and all of the repairs on our roads would stop and the \nrepairs on our bridges because everybody out there, since President \nDwight Eisenhower was President, depends on the Federal share.\n  We cannot have a strong economy without a strong infrastructure. Here \nare the names. I am not reading Democrats and then Republicans; I am \nreading the bipartisan list of staffers: Bettina Poirier, Ruth VanMark, \nDavid Napoliello, James O'Keeffe, Andrew Dohrmann, Murphie Barrett, \nTyler Rushforth, Kyle Miller, Jason Albritton, Grant Cope, Mike Burke, \nTom Lynch, Mark Hybner, Charles Brittingham, Alex Renjel, and Dimitri \nKarakitsos.\n  I also thank the leadership staff. When things were looking glum, \nthere they were. They are David Krone, Bill Dauster, and Bob Herbert.\n  Here are the staff directors of the key committees who worked on \nthis--remember, this was a four-committee process, including EPW, \nBanking, Commerce, and Finance. I thank Russ Sullivan, Dwight Fettig, \nEllen Doneski and their extraordinary staff. They include Ryan Abrahams \nwith the Finance Committee; Ian Jefferies, David Bonelli, Anna Laitin, \nand James Reid with the Commerce Committee; and Homer Carlisle with the \nBanking Committee.\n  I also want to thank the Senate legislative counsel, Rachelle \nCelebreeze and Gary Endicott, whom I drove crazy yesterday by telling \nthem to please produce the paper.\n  This staff loved their work so much that I thought they would never \nend it. I had to beg them: Please finish because there will always be \nsomething more you can do. You can always find something better or put \na comma in a different place. They wanted to make it as perfect as they \ncould. There was a time when we just had to say, OK, we are done. They \ngot it done. I am very moved of their dedication.\n  I know my staff at EPW--for 3 days, the staff members, whose names I \nread--if they got 4 or 5 hours of sleep, they got a lot. They are \nrunning on empty right now. I tell them that their names will forever \nbe in this record, and people they don't know will flourish because of \ntheir work when we start hiring people to do this infrastructure work.\n  I thank my dear colleagues, Jay Rockefeller, Max Baucus, and Tim \nJohnson. No way could I have done it without them. I also pay tribute \nto Mary Landrieu, who is on the Senate floor today. Senator Landrieu \nand her State have gone through so many traumas--so many--with \nhurricanes and all of the attendant problems, and the BP oilspill, \nwhich did so much terrible damage to her State and the other Gulf \nStates--environmental damage, commercial damage, broken hearts, broken \nspirits.\n  Let me tell you, you never break Mary Landrieu's spirit. She teamed \nup with Senator Vitter, and they wrote\n\n[[Page S4761]]\n\nthe RESTORE Act. Then she went to all of the other colleagues of the \ngulf cost and said: You have to help me. They put together a great \npackage. What it means--without going into detail; she will do that--is \nthat when the court decision comes down and the funds come to the \nFederal Government for all the violations of law that took place with \nthe BP spill, 80 percent of the funds will be directed to the very \npeople who got hurt.\n  Senator Landrieu, it is an honor and a privilege to work with you. \nYou have been a model of a Senator who never, ever stops fighting. I am \nso grateful I was able to step to the plate and help you.\n  I will add more names of colleagues, but I don't have time at this \npoint. Others want to speak. This is a great moment. The bill we passed \nis a good bill. It is going to speed up project delivery without \nwaiving any environmental laws that we keep the protections in and give \na little more flexibility to the States on the alternative \ntransportation routes. But, believe me, we also add a new piece that \ngives more power to the local people to decide on these projects. I am \nso pleased.\n  I will add more statements to the Record later today. We have done \nthis, and we are going to mark this moment.\n  After we get our breath back and get our energy back, we are going to \nlook at a long-term solution to the problem of the highway trust fund. \nWe know the gas tax receipts are going down, and we have to solve the \nproblem. If it wasn't for Senator Baucus and his staff, we never would \nbe at this point because we didn't have the funding. They have to come \nup with it. I thank them and the Republicans on the committee.\n  With that, I yield the floor, thanking one and all for this \ntremendous vote today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, before the Senator from California \nleaves the floor, for a much needed rest and relaxation and celebration \nwith her extraordinary staff, let me be one of the first to thank her, \nto join my colleagues who have thanked her for her leadership.\n  This Transportation bill would not be a reality for the Nation--not \nfor California, Texas, New York, or Louisiana,--if it weren't for the \nleadership of the chairperson of this committee. Senator Rockefeller \nwas there to push, Senator Baucus was there to push, Senator Johnson \nwas there to push, but the leader of this victory was Senator Barbara \nBoxer.\n  Her colleague, Senator Inhofe, stood bravely against winds of \nopposition, ideology, without common sense--ideology without regard to \nthe needs of the Nation. Senator Inhofe, a Republican, stood against \nthose winds and with the Senator from California to produce a jobs bill \nfor the Nation.\n  I hope people appreciate the extraordinary accomplishment this is in \nthe context of the political quagmire we find ourselves in just a few \nmonths before a very significant national election, with both sides \nhugging the opposite wall. For these two to come forward today and meet \nin the middle of the Chamber and produce a bill with this kind of vote, \npeople did not think it was possible up until just a few weeks ago. \nThere was still the majority saying it will never happen.\n  But I know something about Barbara Boxer, as well. She came here as a \nfighter. Her name ``Boxer'' says it all. It is the way she fought her \nway to the Senate, and she continues to fight not just for the people \nof California but the people of the Nation.\n\n  I knew 2 years ago--now a little over 2 years ago--when the Deepwater \nHorizon platform blew up in the gulf, one of the first people I could \ngo to, to ask for help, for support, for ideas and advice about what to \ndo would be Senator Boxer. She is a strong environmentalist. She has a \nheart for our oceans, and she understood the challenge of Louisiana's \neroding coastline--more so than many Members in this body.\n  I will be forever grateful for the fact that she and her staff sat \nwith me and other colleagues and crafted the RESTORE Act, which is a \nhistoric piece of legislation. It has no precedent in Congress. It \nwill, for the first time, set aside such a significant amount of money \nfrom a penalty that has yet to be determined by a polluter that has \nbeen determined--BP--that under the law, after the Valdez spill, now \nhas to pay to the Federal Government $1,000 for every barrel of oil \nthat was spilled or gushed out of the explosion for months on end. They \nhave to pay $1,000 for every barrel of oil that was spilled. The \nestimates are that, unfortunately for our coast, our people, our \nfishermen, shrimpers, charter boat captains, and the pelicans, fish, \nshrimp, and oystermen, for us it was 5 million barrels of oil spilled \nbetween August and July, until the well was capped. It is the largest \npollution event in the history of the Nation. It will be the largest \nfine.\n  I have every confidence that the people of the gulf coast and the \nNation will find justice in the courts. I hope this fine is as high as \nit can be, based on the damage that has been done from Texas to Florida \nand off the coast of Louisiana. When I brought this to Senator Boxer, \nshe understood that we had to find a way for justice in the gulf. I \ncrafted the RESTORE Act with my colleague Dick Shelby. For months we \nnegotiated about how to craft it, what to say, how to specifically \ndirect the funding, and had the benefit of having the support of the \nWhite House, the support of every commission and every individual \nappointed by the President supportive of this idea.\n  So I first thank the VP's Presidential commission that was one of the \nfirst to step up and support this concept of an 80-percent set-aside \nand redirect to the gulf.\n  I particularly thank Secretary Ray Mabus, whom we will remember led \nthe President's first commission, former Governor of Mississippi, who \nknows the gulf coast well and understands Louisiana's coast as a \nneighbor for so long. He stepped up and said: Yes, this is the right \nthing to do. We had hundreds--and, really, thousands--of individuals \nand hundreds of organizations that started to come forward.\n  Let me name a few: the Environmental Defense Fund was absolutely \ninstrumental, National Audubon Society, National Wildlife Federation, \nNature Conservancy, Ocean Conservancy, Oxfam America, and GNO, Inc.--\nGreater New Orleans, Inc. They were some of the first organizations to \nstep up.\n  The Greater Houston Partnership was invaluable in the early days to \nbuild support among the business community, as were the Mobile Chamber \nof Commerce, Ducks Unlimited, America's WETLAND Foundation, Restore or \nRetreat--a vibrant local and dynamic organization in south Louisiana--\nChamber of Southwest Louisiana, Baton Rouge Area Foundation, and Women \nof the Storm--representing thousands of women, not just throughout the \ngulf coast, but as well from your State and every State. Women stepped \nup who said this kind of accident has to stop. This kind of explosion \nshould never happen again.\n  Most important, they said the people who were hurt the most, the area \ndamaged the worst should be compensated by this fine. This money should \nnot come to the general fund of the United States to be spent \neverywhere else in the Nation for a variety of unrelated purposes. The \nRESTORE Act says: No, the right way for this money to be allocated is \nto the area where the accident occurred, where the injury occurred, and \nthat is exactly what RESTORE does--no more and no less.\n  There is one other person who deserves particular thanks and a \nshoutout, and that is the Senator from Rhode Island Sheldon Whitehouse. \nWhen Senator Shelby and I finished crafting this bill, which was \nintroduced by a few colleagues--a similar bill--on the House side, \nRepresentative Steve Scalise, Cedric Richmond, and Representative \nBonner from Alabama--we were having a great deal of difficulty moving a \nbill through a committee that only had two gulf coast Members and \nSenator Boxer.\n  The other Members were sympathetic but not that enthusiastic, and I \ncan most certainly understand why. As you know, this is going to be a \ntremendous amount of money. It is going to direct these funds to only \nfive States. They were sympathetic, but what was in it for everyone \nelse? Sheldon Whitehouse and I put our heads together and came up--it \nwas his idea--with the bill itself and thought maybe we could, as a \npart of RESTORE--an integral part of RESTORE--say perhaps the oceans \ndeserved justice as well because water knows no boundaries. What \nhappened\n\n[[Page S4762]]\n\nin the gulf could have impacts in the Atlantic, up the Atlantic, and \nout to the Pacific. Who knows. And that is the problem. We don't have \nenough scientific research going on in this Nation about our oceans, \nwhich is 70 percent of our planet. In Louisiana, we derive great \npleasure, joy, and income from our oceans, and from our oil and gas \nexploration, which is usually safe, on any normal day. This was not a \nnormal day in the gulf, not a normal operation when the Horizon rig \nblew up. We get our fish, our oysters, our seafood industry, our \nrestaurant industry, our hotels, and our ecotourism--and I could go on \nand on--from the ocean. We make our living from the ocean. Senator \nWhitehouse and I thought--and I think most reasonable people agreed--\nthe oceans deserve something out of this. So at no cost to the five \nStates, we put in a provision that a small portion--a half percent of \nthe interest earnings that would be generated--not the fund itself, not \ntaking money away from the gulf coast, as some have claimed, but \nappropriately saying interest earnings--would create a trust fund for \nthe oceans so that every State could use it for research along their \ncoast.\n\n  But that was a bridge too far for the Republican leaders in the House \nwho think we can learn nothing, who want no partnerships, no research \nwhatsoever, I guess, to go on in the oceans. So as that amendment \nbecame a part of the committee process over here, we had that amendment \nconnected to RESTORE at the committee level. It was part of RESTORE. It \nwas moved to the floor and it enabled us to build a broader coalition, \nwhich is the way legislation is built. It is not one person's idea. It \nis not one person's work. The best of the bills and legislation we pass \nare about teams, about generosity and sharing and understanding, a \nlittle give here, a little take there.\n  It is a shame there are some people on the other side of this Capitol \nwho don't seem to know that is the basic operation of a democracy. I am \nnot sure what books they read in school, but they weren't the ones we \nread at Ursuline Academy, taught by the Ursuline nuns. But Sheldon \nWhitehouse read those same books, and we put this bill together. I \ncouldn't have been happier. Not only could I go home and say we did \nthis great thing for the Gulf of Mexico and that everyone came together \nto help us in our time of need, but I could also look at our great \nfriends from other parts of the country and say there is a portion in \nhere for the oceans.\n  That is how the bill came to the floor. One of my proudest days, in \nmy 16 years here in the Senate, was when this Senate voted, under the \nleadership of Senator Boxer and myself and Senator Shelby, for this \nbill--the RESTORE Act--with 76 votes. I don't think the transportation \nbill itself got 76 votes, to indicate how difficult it is to get 76 \nvotes. Other than just for immaterial items, it is hard to get 76 votes \nfor apple pie and Mother's Day greetings. But we got 76 votes, and I \nwas so proud. Not only was it the right thing to do--a great help to \nthe region I help to represent--but also very fair, with the inclusion \nalso of the land and water, which was not part of RESTORE but an \namendment that was put on to help this effort with other parts of the \ncountry. So the good news is we passed that bill and paid for it in \nfull over here with a pay-for that was also agreed to by 76 Senators.\n  But when the bill went over to the House, one of the first and most \nserious detrimental things that happened was the oceans endowment trust \nfund was stripped out. I want those who stripped it out to know this: \nWe will be back. We are going to lead a coalition of Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate who are going to send a strong message to \nHouse Republicans that the oceans do deserve our time, our attention, \nour love and support and our money. We can't do this on a wish and a \nprayer. We have wildlife and fish and migratory birds that depend on \nhealthy oceans. The people of our country and the world depend on that.\n  This will not be the last time they see the national oceans \nendowment. I will be proud to have my name right next to Sheldon \nWhitehouse's and we will go into battle again.\n  But around here, you don't win everything every day, and so they cut \nit out. But we will put it back and it will be bigger and stronger than \nit was when they took it out.\n  The other thing the House Republicans did, which I have no \nunderstanding of why, to pay for this RESTORE Act, the student loans, \nthe transportation bill, and the flood insurance bill, is they took \n$700 million away from Louisiana's Medicaid budget. I will have more to \nsay about the details of that later, because I want to stay focused on \nRESTORE, but I want to put in the record what our Commissioner of \nAdministration said, who, of course, works for Republican Governor \nBobby Jindal, and Republican Secretary of Health and Hospitals Bruce \nGreenstein:\n\n       . . . the loss of more than $400 million--\n\n  And that was in fiscal year 2013, and it was another $250 million, so \nit was $650 in 2014.\n\n     --in so-called FMAP money, already built into the state's \n     Fiscal 2013 budget passed by the Legislature and signed into \n     law by Gov. Bobby Jindal, would altogether lead to a loss in \n     Medicaid dollars that would require $1.1 billion in cuts.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of this quote from Paul Rainwater and Bruce Greenstein.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Louisiana Commissioner of Administration Paul Rainwater and \n     Secretary of Health and Hospitals Bruce Greenstein said the \n     loss of more than $400 million in so-called FMAP money, \n     already built into the state's Fiscal 2013 budget passed by \n     the Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Bobby Jindal, \n     would altogether lead to a loss in Medicaid dollars that \n     would require $1.1 billion in cuts.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The House Republicans who came up with this idea \ninsisted on this offset when there were others that could have been \noffered that were much more fair, much less impactful, and much less \nhurtful. There were some Republican Members who absolutely insisted \nthis offset be included, and so the Republican Governor Bobby Jindal, \nwith a Republican legislature and a Republican delegation in the House, \nwill have to find a way forward. I am not sure what that way is going \nto be, but when the bill left the Senate that was not even discussed \nunder any circumstance whatsoever.\n  But even this terrible action taken on the House side cannot diminish \nthe extraordinary victory of the RESTORE Act. Bills such as this, that \nbasically distribute anywhere from $5 billion to $20 billion for \ncoastal restoration efforts, take years, even decades to pass. We did \nthis in 2 years, working together, staying focused, and building a \nsupport structure nationwide from the business community to the \nenvironmental community. The Chamber of Commerce stepped up, the \nAmerican Petroleum Institute did their part, and many of the oil and \ngas companies stepped up as well. With the coalition of \nenvironmentalists, business organizations, wildlife enthusiasts, we \nwere able to get this significant bill passed. It is going to be a \ntremendous downpayment for the challenge in the gulf coast.\n  Let me, for the record, say again that there were 86,985 square miles \nof water closed to fishing, approximately 36 percent of Federal waters \nin the gulf that were closed to fishing for months, causing a loss to \nthe industry of $2.5 billion. There were 600 miles of the gulf \ncoastline that were oiled. Over half of those miles were in Louisiana, \nand some oil is still lingering. In fact, scientists who have been \nstudying the baseline said the erosion of the marsh that was oiled was \neroding at twice the speed as normal, and that normal erosion is pretty \nbreathtaking in terms of its rate.\n  We have lost basically the size of the State of Rhode Island in the \nlast 50 years. If our delegation is not successful in continuing to \nhave victories such as this, it is conceivable, with the climate change \nthat is happening, the rising of the tides and the frequency of these \ngreat storms, that one day, if we are not successful in preserving \nthese wetlands--and these are wetlands of all of America, that drain 40 \npercent of our Nation, that supply 40 percent of the fisheries to \neverybody, and 80 percent of the oil and gas to everyone--that New \nOrleans will be existing as a city with a 30-foot concrete levee around \nit and everything else washed away--our culture, our hope, our way of \nlife.\n\n[[Page S4763]]\n\n  I have said this a thousand times: We are not sunbathing here in \nsouth Louisiana. We are not vacationing in south Louisiana. We have \nfun, we have weekends where we fish and we hunt, but we are not \nvacationing for weeks and weeks in south Louisiana, lying on the beach \nand getting a tan. There are no beaches to lie on. We only have two. \nGrand Isle is 7 miles long, and Holly Beach, which got washed away in \nRita and still has not been rebuilt.\n  The Corps of Engineers continues to tell me there is nothing they can \ndo for the last inhabited island off the coast of Louisiana. Well, \nthere is a lot they can do, and we will see to that in another bill. \nBut we want these wetlands preserved for our children, for our \ngrandchildren, and for the economic vitality of the Nation. This is the \nmouth of the greatest river system in North America and we intend to \nsave what we can. We will never get everything back. We have lost 1,900 \nsquare miles since 1930. We lose 25 square miles of wetlands each year, \nand we lose a football field every 30 minutes.\n  Two million people live in coastal Louisiana, about \\1/2\\ million in \nMississippi, about 1 million in Alabama, and probably about 4 million \nin Texas. We cannot get up and move. There is no place to go. We don't \nwant to live in Arkansas and Missouri. We want to live on the gulf \ncoast, and we have been there since before this Nation was a nation, \nand we are not leaving. We are tired of retreating. We know this can be \ndone. We have been to The Netherlands and places around the world where \nwetlands have been saved--levees built that don't break. It is cost \neffective in the long run. In the short run it costs investment. In the \nlong run, it creates wealth for everyone.\n  Three trillion dollars is contributed to the national economy by the \ngulf coast every year, 17 percent of the national GDP comes from the \ngulf coast every year, 50 percent of all the oil and gas that fuels \nthis Nation comes from the gulf coast, and 80 percent comes from \noffshore. Every year, despite how much we do, we get zero back from \noffshore oil and gas drilling off our shore. The interior States have \nreceived 50 percent since 1923, but not Texas, not Louisiana, not \nMississippi, and not Alabama. We drill, drill, drill, and send oil \neverywhere, keeping lights on everywhere. The pipelines just run \nthrough our State. We are happy to have the industry, but we would like \nto share the revenues with the Federal Government. We send to the \nFederal Government about $6 billion a year, and have for decades. So \nwhen people say, don't you ever get embarrassed by asking for so much \nmoney? No. I could not possibly ask for as much money from Washington \nas we have already sent here. So I am going to continue to ask for \nfunding for our State because we send off of our coast, and we are \nhappy to do it, but we believe in fair partnerships and mutual respect. \nAnd until we get that, I am not going to stop advocating for our State. \nSo RESTORE is a first step. It is the right step.\n  It is the fair step and justice for the goals for right now. This \nisn't taxpayer money. No taxpayers are paying this. BP is going to pay \nthis. But we are going to come back next year and talk about the \nsharing of the tax revenues that the oil companies--not individuals but \nthe oil companies--pay to the Federal Government every year for every \nbarrel of oil, every cubic foot of gas they take out of the gulf. That \nsharing should be done not just here in America, it should be done off \nthe coast of Africa, off the coast of South Africa, off the coast of \nBrazil, off the coast of Ghana, so the people who live along the coast \ncan be respected, since that is where the drilling and the exploration \nis taking place.\n  Just as people in North Dakota and Utah and Wyoming share their \nrevenues with the Federal Government, we intend to have a more robust \nrevenue-sharing effort in the future. But until the day that happens--\nand I am confident, as sure as I am standing here, it will--this \nRESTORE money will go as a significant downpayment to help jump-start \ncoastal efforts. We are not doing it like every man or woman for \nhimself. It is not a grab bag for Governors. Senator Shelby and I \ncarefully crafted this so the money will be spent wisely, well, and \nefficiently in coordination with the Federal and State governments.\n  Is it going to be perfect? No. I am sure we are going to have some \nstumbling blocks. But this is unprecedented in its nature. This kind of \npublic works effort has never been undertaken in this great way. So the \nscientists hopefully will lead us, the engineers and designers will \ndesign what we need, and we can continue giving our best effort in \nhopes of saving a great place on this Earth; that is, the great marshes \nof the gulf coast and the great delta that this mighty Mississippi \nRiver built thousands and thousands of years ago and leave it better to \nour grandchildren than most certainly we found it.\n  It has been a wonderful part of my life's work. It has been a worthy \nproject to work on. There are others who have most certainly joined me \nin this leadership. But I am very proud of the work this Senate did and \nvery disappointed in some things the House did on it. But as Senator \nBoxer said, it is legislation and we just can't have a perfect bill. It \nwas better to get this than to leave it on the cutting-room floor, even \nthough they did leave important pieces of it there.\n  I wish to thank Senator Boxer's staff, in particular, Senator \nInhofe's staff for being so courteous, and Senator Boxer's staff for \nbeing very tenacious--to Tina and Jason particularly--to help us \nnegotiate one of the great environmental pieces of legislation in \ndecades.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the \ntransportation reauthorization bill that passed today. Having served on \npast transportation bill conference committees, I know the long hours \nand intense negotiations that were required to prepare this bill for \nconsideration today, and I want to extend my congratulations, \nappreciation, and respect to Senators Boxer and Inhofe. I know from \npast experience that they are both principled, tough negotiators, and I \nam sure that is why the transportation bill returned from conference \nwith so many key provisions intact.\n  In March, the Senate acted in a bipartisan manner to pass a \ntransportation bill that contained significant achievements for our \ncountry, and would have greatly benefited my State of Connecticut. The \nbill would have reduced red tape for transportation projects while \nstill protecting our environment and resources. It included a provision \nI worked on with my colleague from Delaware, Senator Carper, which \nwould have required cities and States to take air quality goals into \naccount when drafting transportation plans. It also would have provided \nmass transit benefits the same tax beneficial treatment as parking \nbenefits, and would have funded Connecticut's transportation programs \nat a level that met our basic needs for the next few years.\n  The bill that came back from conference retained many of these \nprovisions, but I regret to see that it weakened others and discarded \nsome of the rest. As I stated earlier, I am no stranger to working on a \nconference committee, and I fully realize that the best legislation is \nproduced through a give and take on various issues. Clearly, that was \nthe case here. Despite my disappointment on some of these compromises, \nI believe that it was essential that we acted to ensure that our \nnational transportation programs did not lapse on July 1, and that is \nwhy I supported the transportation bill conference report. I would like \nto take a few minutes to briefly explain some of my concerns, and why I \nultimately voted the way I did.\n  My concerns can generally be broken down into three categories: \nenvironmental, Connecticut-specific programs, and the long-term \nviability of the transportation system. First, let me touch upon the \nenvironment. We have come a long way since the days when Federal and \nState transportation departments labored under the mistaken belief that \nbuilding our roads and highways bigger was better, no matter the \nconsequences. We have long since realized that land deserves to be \npreserved, the purity of our water protected, and our air quality \nimproved. I worry that the bill would be a step backwards because it \nwould waive environmental reviews of many transportation projects, \nincluding some in environmentally endangered areas of our country. By \nproviding a categorical exclusion under the National Environmental \nPolicy Act for any projects within an existing\n\n[[Page S4764]]\n\noperational right-of-way, I can foresee wetlands being filled, \nsensitive habitat threatened, and resources spoiled, all without any \nenvironmental review. There is a right way and a wrong way to expedite \nprojects, and I believe this is the wrong way. I understand this was a \nnecessary concession in order to get a conference report agreed to, but \nI hope it will be addressed in the future.\n  The second concern I have is the impact of the bill on my State, \nConnecticut. The Federal highway program is just that: a Federal \nprogram that is intended to address the needs of the national \ntransportation system. Nonetheless, our country's different regions \nhave particular needs. Connecticut, and the Northeast in general, have \nurgent needs when it comes to transportation. My State has one of our \nNation's oldest transportation systems, because Connecticut has been \naround a long time, one of the Nation's highest ratios of traffic \nvolume to miles of road, and is a frequent pass-through State for \ncommuters throughout the Northeast. Federal transportation funding \nshould go to areas with the greatest need, just as happens with other \ngovernment programs such as farm subsidies and disaster relief. \nConnecticut residents do not protest these agricultural support \nprograms despite our paying a disproportionate share of taxes for them, \nbut we deserve to receive adequate funds to address our unique \ntransportation needs. Under this bill, Connecticut will receive \ninadequate funding. I would urge my colleagues to reconsider this \nproblem, as well as the 95 percent minimum rate of return for all \nStates, during deliberations on the next transportation bill just as we \ndid during consideration of the 2005 transportation bill.\n  Finally, I want to take a moment to address a growing concern across \nthe country: the future of our Highway Trust Fund. Since the \nestablishment of the Federal highway system, we have utilized a user-\nfee system to fund our transportation programs. That system served us \nwell for years, and relied on a gas tax to fill the Highway Trust Fund, \nwhich in turn distributed funds to our States. As is so often the case, \nwith the good comes the bad: as we make cars that are more fuel \nefficient, thereby cleaning up our air and reducing emissions, we also \npurchase less gas per mile driven, and the amount of money flowing into \nthe Trust Fund shrinks as a result. The gas tax has stayed static at \n18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. Because it is not adjusted for \ninflation, the federal gas tax has experienced a cumulative loss in \npurchasing power of 33 percent since 1993. For 4 years now, the Trust \nFund has been running a deficit and we have had to bail it out with \ntransfers from the Treasury. This is not the way the system was meant \nto work, and it is not a way it can long survive.\n  The blame lies at all of our feet. Neither party has had the courage \nto face the reality that we are running out of money for our roads and \nbridges. Instead of dealing with the problem, we have continued to bail \nout the trust fund, hoping that some future Congress will take \nnecessary steps to fix this problem. I applaud my colleague from \nWyoming, Senator Enzi, who took a stand and proposed adjusting the gas \ntax for inflation, basically a half-cent a gallon increase. This could \nhave gone a long way to reducing the amount of money we need to use to \nbailout the trust fund. Unfortunately, we never had a chance to discuss \nthe matter. I understand that colleagues do not want to talk about \nraising taxes. But in the end we have no choice but to talk about \nraising taxes if we want our transportation infrastructure to keep pace \nwith our people's needs.\n  We need leadership from Congress, and the President, to face the \nfacts: our transportation system is both broke and broken. The system \ndoes not have funds for some basic repairs, let alone to make the new \ninvestments for infrastructure we urgently need. In 2002, the United \nStates was ranked fifth, in terms of infrastructure quality, worldwide. \nToday, we have dropped to twenty-fourth. We have fallen 19 places down \nin less than a decade.\n  Unfortunately, the large-scale investments we need will not be \npossible until we can fix the funding issue. The Simpson-Bowles \nCommission recommended a 5-cent per year increase to the gas tax for 3 \nyears. Others have recommended shifting to a system that charges users \nfor vehicle-miles-travelled. Such a VMT would ensure that those driving \nfuel efficient, electric, or alternative fuel vehicles pay for the \nwear-and-tear to the roads they cause. Although I will not be a member \nof the Senate when the next transportation bill is debated, I would \nurge my colleagues to begin to address this issue before the trust fund \ngoes broke once again. Washington must have the courage to keep all \noptions on the table, and then do what works to fix this problem.\n  In closing, I wish to again express my gratitude to Senators Boxer \nand Inhofe. This is a true jobs bill, and it will guarantee that \nmillions of construction workers are still employed come Sunday, that \nstudent loan interest rates do not double this school year, and that \nour truly important flood insurance program will be reauthorized.\n  I thank Senator Boxer, Senator Inhofe, the staff of the EPW \ncommittee, as well as the staffers at the Departments of Transportation \nboth in Washington and Connecticut, for their efforts in bringing this \nbill to fruition.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I forgot to thank my own staff, which \nwould be very important to do. Elizabeth Weiner, Elizabeth Craddock, \nJane Campbell, my chief of staff, and my entire staff for their \ntremendous work--we are all going to get a good rest in the week to \ncome--and other staff, Tanner Johnson in particular, no longer with my \nstaff but who put the original bill together.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I previously filed committee allocations \nand budgetary aggregates pursuant to section 106 of the Budget Control \nAct of 2011. Today, I am adjusting some of those levels, specifically \nthe allocation to the Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2013 \nand the budgetary aggregates for fiscal year 2013.\n  Section 101 of the Budget Control Act allows for various adjustments \nto the statutory limits on discretionary spending, while section 106(d) \nallows the chairman of the Budget Committee to make revisions to \nallocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. \nThe Committee on Appropriations reported four bills that are eligible \nfor adjustments under the Budget Control Act. Consequently, I am making \nadjustments to the 2013 allocation to the Committee on Appropriations \nand to the 2013 aggregates for spending by a total of $9.245 billion in \nbudget authority and $2.385 billion in outlays. Those adjustments \nreflect the sum of $5.648 billion in budget authority and $403 million \nin outlays for funding designated for disaster relief, $2.547 billion \nin budget authority and $1.075 billion in outlays for funding \ndesignated as being for overseas contingency operations, and $1.050 \nbillion in budget authority and $907 million in outlays for program \nintegrity initiatives. The two program integrity initiatives for which \nadjustments are in order under the Budget Control Act are continuing \ndisability reviews and redeterminations and health care fraud and abuse \ncontrol.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the \nchanges to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the \nbudgetary aggregates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          BUDGETARY AGGREGATES\n [Pursuant to section 106(b)(2)(C) of the Budget Control

Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment \nand frustration that the Work Incentives Planning and Assistance \nprogram also known as WIPA run by the Social Security Administration is \nbeing shut down today. Congress has not acted to extend this important \nprogram and the Commissioner of Social Security does not believe he has \nthe authority to continue the program. I disagree. I think he could \ncontinue this program under his broad authority to implement the Social \nSecurity Act. It is my belief that if he did that and that was contrary \nto congressional intent, Congress would express that disapproval \nthrough the appropriations process.\n  Let me explain what the WIPA program does. Both the Social Security \ndisability insurance, SSDI, program and the supplemental security \nincome, SSI, program have many provisions to assist beneficiaries in \nattempting to return to work, but the rules and features of the work \nincentives are complex and can be intimidating. Through the WIPA \nprogram, SSA makes grants to community-based organizations to provide \nSSDI and SSI disability beneficiaries with assistance in navigating and \nusing the return-to-work features. The total budget for the WIPA grant \nprogram is $23 million a year. Because it is such a large State, \nMontana has two WIPA grantees. The Montana Center for Inclusive \nEducation at Montana State University in Billings is the WIPA \nspecialist for residents of eastern Montana. Over the last 30 months, \nthe WIPA in MSU Billings has served over 100 Montana residents. On the \nwestern side of the State, the North Central Independent Living \nServices, Inc., near Great Falls runs an innovative program where the \nWIPA grant is dispersed among several Centers for Independent Living in \norder to provide more personal, one-on-one service for residents of \nMontana. That program has served over 220 Montana residents.\n  I think the WIPA program should continue. I know many Members of \nCongress agree. I hope the Commissioner will continue these important \nprograms as soon as possible. Given the state of the economy today, we \nshould not limit important services that can help our constituents who \nwant to help themselves by attempting to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/29/senate-section/article/S4767-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4767-S4768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AUTHORIZED RURAL WATER PROJECTS COMPLETION ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today as an original co-sponsor \nof the Authorized Rural Water Projects Completion Act, introduced by my \ncolleague, Senator Baucus. I am pleased to support this important \nlegislation which would address the serious backlog in the construction \nof Bureau of Reclamation water projects that are intended to serve \nrural and tribal communities.\n\n[[Page S4768]]\n\n  All of these projects have already been studied and authorized by the \nCongress. However, the funding for constructing the projects has \nlagged, causing a delay in addressing the needs of rural and tribal \ncommunities to have potable water delivered for their use.\n  In 1902, the Reclamation Fund was established by Congress, intended \nto be used as a funding source to construct water projects in the West. \nIt is funded through a variety of receipts, including Federal mineral \nleasing receipts. However, the use of monies from the Reclamation Fund \nhas been subject to appropriation, and therefore, large balances have \nremained in the Fund. The average annual surplus in the Reclamation \nFund from FY 2005 through FY 2011 was $960 million. While these monies \nwere intended to be used for water project construction, they have not \nalways been appropriated when needed.\n  The bill that is being introduced today would direct that every year \n$80 million that would otherwise be deposited in the Reclamation Fund \nbe made available without further appropriation for the construction of \nthe authorized rural water projects--projects that Congress has already \ndetermined are in the public interest and should be built.\n  I would like my colleagues to note that according to Bureau of \nReclamation analysis, an increase in funding for the construction of \nrural water projects to $80 million per year would reduce the total \nFederal appropriations needed to complete the projects by more than $1 \nbillion, due to project costs and inflation. Therefore, this bill will \nhave a positive fiscal impact. The bill also includes language that \nstates that amounts may not be transferred for rural water projects \npursuant to the legislation if to do so would raise the deficit.\n  The legislation provides that the Secretary may not expend amounts \nunder the bill until the Secretary develops programmatic goals that \nwould: enable completion of rural water projects as quickly as \npossible; reflect the goals and priorities identified in the laws \nauthorizing the rural water projects; and reflect the goals of the \nReclamation Rural Water Supply Act of 2006. The bill does not direct \nthat a particular project receive funding, but rather provides that the \nSecretary develop funding prioritization criteria to serve as a formula \nfor distributing funds consistent with considerations set forth in the \nbill.\n  This bill is important to our citizens in rural and tribal \ncommunities in the West. Adequate water supplies are fundamental to our \nway of life, and far too many Americans still live without safe \ndrinking water. Congress has already determined that the rural water \nprojects it has authorized are needed to provide water supplies to our \nrural and tribal communities and are in the best interests of public.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation, so that the promise of these important water \nprojects can become an on-the-ground reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/29/senate-section/article/S4768-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INTERNATIONAL BRIDGE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the International Bridge at Sault St. Marie \nstands as an enduring, visible reminder of the connection Michigan has \nwith our neighbor to the north. This nearly 2-mile expanse, quite \nliterally, brings communities in Michigan and Canada closer together, \nforging a mutually beneficial partnership in the process. To \ncommemorate the construction of the bridge, a new, patriotic lighting \nscheme will be introduced on the American side of the bridge this week.\n  Thousands of vehicles cross this bridge each day. In fact, in 2007 \nalone, nearly 2 million cars traversed this roadway. This bridge is a \npathway for commerce and trade; it is a convenient way for families \nseparated by a short distance, but still a Nation apart to visit; and \nit supports recreation and tourism, which are central to the economies \nof many of Michigan's communities. Designed by Dr. Carl Gronquist, this \nsprawling structure has buoyed a number of industries important to \nMichigan, including steel, paper and forestry.\n  Before the International Bridge opened to traffic on October 31, \n1962, Michiganians crossed the St. Mary's River either by car ferry or \nby railway. The need for a more efficient means to connect Sault Ste. \nMarie, MI and Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario was evident. In response, in \n1940, Congress approved an international crossing in Sault Ste. Marie, \nand in 1955, the Canadian Parliament established the St. Mary's Bridge \nCompany to facilitate and oversee an international crossing. The $16 \nmillion construction project that ensued lasted nearly 2 years and gave \nway to the structure we enjoy today.\n  Connecting Sault Ste. Marie with a city of 75,000 in Ontario that \nalso serves as an important international trade crossing in \nNorthwestern Ontario has been very beneficial. The theme of this \ncelebration--Celebrating 50 years of International Friendship--speaks \npowerfully to this point. I also would like to recognize the work of \nthe Sault Ste. Marie Bridge Authority and the International Bridge \nAdministration for their tremendous work and dedication. The work that \nis done each day to ensure an efficient and steady flow of traffic \nacross this bridge has positively impacted the lives of Michiganians \nand countless businesses for the last half century. As we look toward \nthe future, it is important to preserve and maintain the International \nBridge for future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/29/senate-section/article/S4768-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO GUNNERY SERGEANT THOMAS J. BOYD, USMC\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this Sunday, Marine Corps GySgt Thomas \nBoyd, who is currently serving as a legislative fellow in my office, \nwill receive his promotion to master gunnery sergeant at his home in \nUniontown, PA, surrounded by his wife Reagan and his family. I would \nlike to take the opportunity to recognize Tom's accomplishments and \nselfless service to our Nation.\n  Tom enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1996, following in the footsteps \nof his father, older brother, and great uncle. He immediately took on \nthe very demanding occupational specialty of signals intelligence, \nwhich involves the collection and analysis of enemy communications. It \nis a unique and critically important specialty that accepts only the \nhighest quality and most trustworthy marines, which tells you a lot \nabout Tom's character.\n  From 2005 to 2009 Tom was stationed at Fort Meade and served at the \nNational Security Agency. His skills were put to the test in three \ncombat deployments, two to Iraq and one to Afghanistan, during which he \nsupported numerous counterterrorism operations that helped make those \ncountries and our own more secure. The Department of Defense recognized \nhis contributions with the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, one of \nthe highest awards the Department can bestow upon a servicemember.\n  Last year the Marine Corps selected Tom for its Congressional \nFellowship Program, which, as my colleagues know, is highly selective. \nTom is one of only two enlisted Marines selected to serve on Capitol \nHill this year. While working in a Senate office is considerably less \naction-packed than the jobs he has had in the recent past, Tom has \ntackled all the tasks we have assigned to him with the overwhelming \nenthusiasm and tenacity we expect from our marines.\n  I know some of our constituents who have met Tom are sometimes \nsurprised to come to my office and find themselves across the table \nfrom ``Big Country,'' as Tom is affectionately known among his peers. \nThen they realize that not only is Tom as dedicated to serving them as \nany member of any Senator's staff but also that it can be a big \nadvantage to have a man who was clearly born to be a leatherneck on \ntheir side.\n  To my colleagues, should you see Tom walking the halls of the Senate, \nI ask that you take a moment to congratulate him on his promotion and \nthank him and his family for their sacrifices on behalf of our country. \nIn his personality, professionalism, and selflessness, Tom Boyd \nreflects the best traditions of the U.S. Marine Corps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/29/senate-section/article/S4768-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4768-S4769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            REMEMBERING VICE ADMIRAL WILLIAM D. HOUSER, USN\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a great naval \nofficer and a true friend. Yesterday, VADM William ``Bill'' Douglas \nHouser, USN, Retired, was buried with full military\n\n[[Page S4769]]\n\nhonors at Arlington National Cemetery. His was a life spent in service \nto our great country and its Navy and sailors.\n  An Atlanta native, Admiral Houser entered the Naval Academy in 1938 \nat the age of 16, as part of the class of 1942. He was commissioned \nearly with his class in 1941, after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. \nDuring World War II, he served for 3 years as a deck officer aboard the \nUSS Nashville, which saw combat in the battle for Guadalcanal, raids on \nthe Marcus and Wake Islands, and operations around Leyte and Luzon in \nthe Philippines. In 1945, Admiral Houser entered flight training and \nwas designated a naval aviator the following year. He saw combat in \nKorea as commanding officer of Fighter Squadron 44 and during the \nVietnam War as commanding officer of the aircraft carrier USS \nConstellation. Other commands-at-sea included Fighter Squadron 124, the \nUSS Mauna Loa, and Carrier Division TWO as a flag officer.\n  Ashore, Admiral Houser served on the staff of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff from 1960 to 1962 and again from 1967 to 1968 as Director, \nStrategic Plans Division. He was the Military Assistant to the Deputy \nSecretary of Defense from 1962 through 1963; a member of the staff of \nthe National Security Council in 1965; and Director of Aviation Plans \nand Requirements for the U.S. Navy from 1968 through 1970. He was \npromoted to Vice Admiral in 1972 and served his last tour of duty from \n1972 to 1976 as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air Warfare, where \nhe was responsible for all Naval aviation matters. Admiral Houser said \nthat his most satisfying accomplishment as Deputy Chief was saving the \nF-14 fighter from cancellation.\n  Admiral Houser received numerous medals and decorations while on \nActive Duty. They include the Distinguished Service Medal, two awards; \nthe Legion of Merit, four awards; the Bronze Star with Combat V; and \nthe Air Medal, two awards. In retirement, he was also honored to \nreceive the prestigious U.S. Naval Academy Alumni Association \nDistinguished Graduate Award in 2003.\n  After retirement from the Navy, Admiral Houser went on to a \nsuccessful career in the telecommunications industry, working for the \nCorporation for Public Broadcasting, Communications Satellite \nCorporation, and Com21, among others. But he always remained dedicated \nto the Navy he so loved. He served as a trustee of the U.S. Naval \nAcademy Foundation for 30 years. He served on the International Midway \nMemorial Foundation and helped establish the annual Navy Midway Dinner. \nHe spearheaded the creation of a Midway Memorial in the yard of the \nU.S. Naval Academy.\n  Beyond all his accomplishments, Bill was a great friend. When I \nreturned home from prison in Vietnam, he was instrumental in helping me \nreturn to flying status. I remain forever indebted to him for his \nsupport and assistance.\n  Bill passed away on February 5, 2012, and is survived by his wife \nJan; his 3 daughters, Cindy, Gayle, and Francie; his 2 stepdaughters, \nKarla and Louise; 11 grandchildren; and 1 great-granddaughter. \nPresident John F. Kennedy once said, ``Any man who may be asked in this \ncentury what he did to make his life worthwhile, I think can respond \nwith a good deal of pride and satisfaction, `I served in the United \nStates Navy.''' By that standard, VADM William D. Houser, USN, Retired, \nlived a life of immeasurable worth. God bless and Godspeed, old friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/29/senate-section/article/S4769-1", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO REVEREND FRED LUTER, JR.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in congratulating Rev. Fred Luter, Jr., of New Orleans, LA on \nbeing elected to be president of the Southern Baptist Convention and \nacknowledging Reverend Luter's unique role as the first African-\nAmerican leader of the Southern Baptist Convention.\n  Rev. Fred Luter, Jr. preached his first church sermon in 1983 at the \nLaw Street Baptist Church in New Orleans, LA. He then became pastor of \nFranklin Avenue Baptist Church in 1986. Under the leadership of \nReverend Luter, the Franklin Avenue Baptist Church community grew from \n65 members in 1986 to over 7,000 members in 2005. Thanks to Reverend \nLuter, the Franklin Avenue Baptist Church grew to be the largest \nSouthern Baptist Church in the State of Louisiana.\n  In 2005, Franklin Avenue Baptist Church was extensively damaged by \nHurricane Katrina. Along with the church, Reverend Luter also lost his \nhome to flooding. Displaced members of the church totaled approximately \n2,000 people. Reverend Luter, in cooperation with Rev. David Crosby, \nfound a temporary home for Franklin Avenue Baptist Church during the \naftermath of Hurricane Katrina. As well as setting up a temporary \nchurch, Reverend Luter continued to minister to his congregation, even \nholding services in Baton Rouge, LA, and Houston, TX. After tremendous \nhard work and determination, Reverend Luter reopened the door to \nFranklin Avenue Baptist Church in April of 2008.\n  In 2011, Reverend Luter became the first African-American to be \nelected as first vice president of the Southern Baptist Convention. The \nSouthern Baptist Convention is a cooperative of over 45,000 churches \nthey diligently seek to bring about greater racial and ethnic \nrepresentation at every level of Southern Baptist institutional life.\n  Reverend Luter was then nominated by Rev. David Crosby to become \npresident of the Southern Baptist Convention. On June 19, 2012, \nReverend Luter was elected to be the first African-American president \nof the Southern Baptist Convention.\n  It is with a special measure of commendation and heartfelt \ncongratulations on becoming the first African-American president of the \nSouthern Baptist Convention and for his commitment to ministering to \nhis congregation that I ask my colleagues to join me along with \nReverend Luter's family in honoring and celebrating the life of this \nmost extraordinary person.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/29/senate-section/article/S4769-2", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   RECOGNIZING JEWISH FAMILY SERVICES\n\n Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize \nJewish Family Services, a philanthropic treasure in Connecticut. This \nyear marks a momentous 100th anniversary of community service.\n  Founded June 1912, Jewish Family Services was built to assist \nEuropean immigrants coming to this country to seek the American dream \nand escape persecution. These new residents of Connecticut confronted \nthe challenges of their new lives with hope and determination.\n  Jewish Family Services has touched all generations, giving \nunconditionally to all those in need. Following the value of Tikkun \nOlam--``healing the world''--their mission is truly boundless. Their \ncourageous staff of experienced social workers has helped facilitate \nnew lives for many citizens, empowering their first steps towards \nchange.\n  Jewish Family Services has recently focused on programs to support \nnew careers and combat long-term unemployment. Through the Jewish \nEmployment Transition Services, JFS has helped ease the desperation of \njoblessness. These programs complement many others including a food \npantry, mental health services, care for the aging, children, and \nHolocaust survivors, counseling for life transitions such as divorce, \nand financial tutoring.\n  To celebrate its 100th anniversary while preparing for the next \ndecades, Jewish Family Services has created three new funds--one \ndedicated to our children, the Changing Children's Lives Fund, another \nfor those confronting emergency situations or personal crisis, the \nFirst Responders Fund, and a third, aptly named the Future Fund.\n  By giving help and getting help, Jewish Family Services has formed a \nfamily for the Greater Hartford area. It embraces community assistance \nas a given and disperses inspiration and hope. Its one hundred years \nare a prelude to future accomplishment and contribution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/29/senate-section/article/S4769-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4769-S4770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FOREST RIVER, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I am pleased to honor a community \nin North Dakota that will soon celebrate its 100th anniversary. From \nJuly 13 through the 15, the residents of Regan will recognize the \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Regan, like many towns in North Dakota, began with the coming of the \nNorthern Pacific Railroad Company. Regan was named after J. Austin \nRegan, a businessman from nearby Fessenden and an official of Dakota \nLand and Townsite, the company which originally mapped the town. The \nfirst building in Regan was a cream station named Tolchinsky's, where \nearly settlers sold their cream. In the following years, the town grew \nquickly with the additions of a post office, a church, many businesses, \nand a baseball diamond.\n  Dubbed ``Rockin' Regan'' the residents have an extensive list of \nevents for the centennial celebration, including a parade, a raffle, \nand the Centennial Tractor Trek that will travel along ND-Highway 36.\n  Today, Regan, although small, is still a prominent farming community. \nI am reminded of a saying from their 75th celebration: ``We are not \njust a town, but a community, and a community we will remain.'' This is \nthe true essence of the people of North Dakota; no matter what the \nfuture brings, communities will remain.

While the \ntown of Bridal Veil may have decreased in size since its days as a \nbustling mill-town, the dedication and service of this post office has \ncertainly remained.\n  The Bridal Veil Post Office also serves as a testament to a time in \nOregon's past that is too often forgotten; a time that the Bridal Veil \nHistorical Preservation Society and its supporters have fought to \npreserve. Even in the face of post office closures and modernizations, \nthis post office has endured. The efforts of those that have fought to \nmaintain this structure, especially the Historical Preservation \nSociety, serve as a testament to its importance not only to this \ncommunity, but to the state of Oregon as well.\n  To President and Postmaster Geri Canzler, the citizens of Bridal \nVeil, and all those that have fought to preserve this historic site: \nthank you and congratulations on 125 years and counting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/06/29/senate-section/article/S4770-3", "month": "06", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOTIFICATION OF THE PRESIDENT'S INTENT TO TERMINATE THE DESIGNATIONS OF \n GIBRALTAR AND THE TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS AS BENEFICIARY DEVELOPING \nCOUNTRIES UNDER THE GENERALIZED SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES (GSP) PROGRAM--PM \n                                   53\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States which was referred to the \nCommittee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with section 502(f)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, as \namended (the ``1974 Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2462(f)(2)), I am providing \nnotification of my intent to terminate the designations of Gibraltar \nand the Turks and Caicos Islands as beneficiary developing countries \nunder the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program.

A bill to reauthorize the National Dam Safety Program Act, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the National Dam Safety Program managed by the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, FEMA. I thank Senators Boozman, \nWhitehouse, and Crapo for joining me in sponsoring this bill that will \nhelp promote public safety and prevent the destruction caused by dam \nfailures. This fiscally responsible legislation will help states do \nmore to protect communities and avoid costly dam incidents without \nincreasing funding above the most recent authorization level.\n  With more than 84,000 dams listed in the National Inventory of Dams, \ndams are a critical and ubiquitous part of our nation's infrastructure. \nIn Hawaii, 142 State-regulated dams are located across our islands from \nKekaha on Kauai to Paauilo on Hawaii Island. These dams are owned by \nnon-profit organizations, private companies, individuals, and Federal, \nState, and local governments. While they go largely unseen, dams \nbenefit our lives every day. They provide drinking water, hydroelectric \npower, irrigation water, flood control, and recreational opportunities.\n  However, dams also pose a significant risk to public safety, local \neconomies, and the environment. Our nation's dams received a grade of \n``D'' from the American Society of Civil Engineers 2009 Report Card for \nAmerica's Infrastructure, which cited more than 4,000 deficient dams, \nincluding more than 1,800 that would result in loss of life if they \nfailed. Unfortunately, we know that this risk is not just hypothetical. \nIn 2006, the Ka Loko Dam on Kauai collapsed killing seven people, and \ndozens of other dam failures have occurred across the nation since that \ntime. While we cannot avoid all dam incidents, this legislation will \nhelp prevent dam disasters and better prepare Americans for when they \ndo happen.\n  The National Dam Safety Program is the foundation of prevention \nefforts nationally. The program helps states to check for deteriorating \nconditions at dams. This is important so that repairs can be made in \norder to safeguard against incidents that result in loss of life and \nproperty. The program also helps ensure that states have the technical \nassistance, training, and procedures needed to prevent dams from \nreaching a condition that puts communities in danger.\n  I very much appreciate the involvement of experts in dam safety, \nincluding FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers, Hawaii Department of Land \nand Natural Resources, the American Society of Civil Engineers, and the \nAssociation of State Dam Safety Officials, in developing this \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to support his measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3362\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Dam Safety Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act and the amendments made by this Act \n     is to reduce the risks to life and property from dam failure \n     in the United States through the reauthorization of an \n     effective national dam safety program that brings together \n     the expertise and resources of the Federal and non-Federal \n     communities in achieving national dam safety hazard \n     reduction.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 516\n\n       Whereas protecting and respecting private property rights \n     is a basic principle for all democratic governments that \n     operate according to the rule of law;\n       Whereas Nazi or Communist regimes dominated many Eastern \n     European countries without the consent of their people for \n     parts of the 20th century;\n       Whereas the authoritarian and totalitarian regimes that \n     emerged in Eastern Europe\n\n[[Page S4776]]\n\n     after World War II perpetuated the wrongful and unjust \n     confiscation of property, including immovable property, \n     personal property, and financial assets, that belonged to \n     victims of Nazi persecution;\n       Whereas the Nazi regime considered religious property an \n     early target and denied religious communities the temporal \n     facilities that held them together by expropriating churches, \n     synagogues, religious seminaries, cemeteries, and other \n     communal property;\n       Whereas, after World War II, Communist regimes expanded the \n     systematic expropriation of private, communal, and religious \n     property in an effort to eliminate the influence of religion;\n       Whereas, since the fall of the Iron Curtain, only part of \n     the immovable property confiscated during and after the \n     Holocaust has been recovered or compensated;\n       Whereas, in July 2001, the Paris Declaration of the \n     Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe \n     Parliamentary Assembly noted that the process of restitution, \n     compensation, and material reparation of victims of Nazi \n     persecution has not been pursued with the same degree of \n     comprehensiveness by all of the participating states of that \n     Organization;\n       Whereas the Organization for Security and Co-operation in \n     Europe Parliamentary Assembly has called on each \n     participating state to adopt and implement appropriate \n     legislation to ensure that victims of Nazi persecution, \n     including communal organizations and institutions, receive \n     restitution of or compensation for lost property, without \n     regard to the current citizenship or place of residence of \n     the victims or their heirs or the relevant successors to \n     communal property;\n       Whereas the United States Congress has, unanimously and on \n     numerous occasions, urged countries in Europe that have not \n     yet done so to immediately enact fair, comprehensive, \n     nondiscriminatory, and just legislation to provide \n     restitution, or fair compensation in cases in which \n     restitution is not possible, to victims of persecution who \n     had private property looted or wrongfully confiscated by \n     Nazis during World War II or subsequently seized by a \n     Communist government and the heirs of those victims;\n       Whereas the representatives of 44 countries that \n     participated in the 1998 Washington Conference on Holocaust-\n     Era Assets agreed on principles intended to guide just and \n     equitable solutions to confiscated art, insurance, and \n     communal property, but did not address the complex issue of \n     private property;\n       Whereas, 11 years later, representatives of more than 45 \n     countries participated in the Prague Holocaust-Era Assets \n     Conference in June 2009, and agreed to the Terezin \n     Declaration of June 30, 2009, which--\n       (1) recognized that Holocaust (Shoah) survivors and other \n     victims of Nazi persecution have reached an advanced age and \n     that respecting their personal dignity and addressing their \n     social welfare needs is an issue of utmost urgency;\n       (2) recognized that wrongful property seizures, such as \n     confiscation, forced sales, and sales under duress of \n     property, were part of the persecution by the Nazis of \n     innocent people, many of whom died without heirs;\n       (3) recognized the importance of restituting communal and \n     individual property that belonged to victims of the Holocaust \n     (Shoah) and other victims of Nazi persecution and urged that \n     every effort be made to rectify the consequences of wrongful \n     property seizure;\n       (4) urged that every effort be made to provide for the \n     restitution of former Jewish communal and religious property \n     through in rem restitution or compensation in cases in which \n     restitution has not yet been effectively achieved; and\n       (5) recognized that in some countries heirless property \n     could serve as a basis to address the material necessities of \n     Holocaust (Shoah) survivors and to ensure ongoing education \n     about the Holocaust (Shoah) and its causes and consequences;\n       Whereas nearly 3 years have passed since the adoption of \n     the Terezin Declaration and the governments of some countries \n     have still not fulfilled or made progress toward fulfilling \n     the moral obligations expressed in that document, including--\n       (1) the Government of Poland, which is virtually alone \n     among post-Communist countries in not having adopted any \n     legislation providing a process for restitution of or \n     compensation for private property that Nazi or Communist \n     regimes confiscated despite numerous public promises from \n     various administrations;\n       (2) the Government of Romania, which has halted \n     implementation of legislation to return former communal \n     property or pay compensation to claimants;\n       (3) the Government of Latvia, which has failed to press \n     forward with legislation to return Jewish communal and \n     religious properties or provide financial compensation for \n     the loss of those properties despite numerous promises to \n     domestic and international claimants;\n       (4) the Government of Slovenia, which has refused to pay \n     compensation for officially recognized former Jewish \n     property; and\n       (5) the Government of Croatia, which has still not adopted \n     appropriate legislation to provide compensation for property \n     that the Nazis and their allies confiscated during the \n     Holocaust;\n       Whereas the governments of Serbia and Lithuania have \n     recently enacted restitution and compensation programs for \n     private and Jewish communal property, respectively, serving \n     as a potential model for other governments to follow;\n       Whereas some Holocaust survivors, now in the twilight of \n     their lives, are impoverished and in urgent need of \n     assistance, lacking the resources to support basic needs, \n     including adequate shelter, food, or medical care;\n       Whereas the Washington and Prague conferences on Holocaust-\n     era assets should not be the last opportunity for the \n     international community to address property restitution at \n     the highest level;\n       Whereas the European Shoah Legacy Institute will hold an \n     Immoveable Property Review Conference in late November 2012 \n     in Prague to review compliance with the Terezin Declaration \n     as well as the document entitled ``Guidelines and Best \n     Practices for the Restitution and Compensation of Immovable \n     (Real) Property Confiscated or Otherwise Wrongfully Seized by \n     the Nazis, Fascists and Their Collaborators during the \n     Holocaust (Shoah) Era between 1933-1945, Including the Period \n     of World War II'', which 43 countries adopted following the \n     Prague Conference; and\n       Whereas, although those documents are not legally binding, \n     the governments of all countries bear a moral responsibility \n     to uphold and defend the plight and dignity of Holocaust \n     survivors, ensure their well-being, and respond to their \n     social needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the unmet needs of many Holocaust survivors \n     and the urgency of addressing those needs;\n       (2) appreciates the efforts of the governments of countries \n     in Europe that have enacted and implemented legislation for \n     the restitution of or compensation for private, communal, and \n     religious property wrongly confiscated during the Nazi or \n     Communist eras;\n       (3) welcomes the efforts of the governments of many post-\n     Communist countries to address complex and difficult \n     questions relating to the status of wrongly confiscated \n     property;\n       (4) urges each government that has not already done so to \n     complete the process of adopting and implementing necessary \n     and proper legislation to effect the in rem return of or the \n     payment of compensation for wrongly confiscated property;\n       (5) calls on each government to establish restitution and \n     compensation schemes in a simple, transparent, and timely \n     manner to provide a real benefit to those who suffered from \n     the unjust confiscation of their property;

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Israel \n     Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since 1948, United States Presidents and both houses of \n     Congress, on a bipartisan basis and supported by the American \n     people, have repeatedly reaffirmed the special bond between \n     the United States and Israel, based on shared values and \n     shared interests.\n       (2) The Middle East is undergoing rapid change, bringing \n     with it hope for an expansion of democracy but also great \n     challenges to the national security of the United States and \n     our allies in the region, particularly to our most important \n     ally in the region, Israel.\n       (3) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran is \n     continuing its decades-long pattern of seeking to foment \n     instability and promote extremism in the Middle East, \n     particularly in this time of dramatic political transition.\n       (4) At the same time, the Government of the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran continues to enrich uranium in defiance of \n     multiple United Nations Security Council resolutions.\n       (5) A nuclear-weapons capable Iran would fundamentally \n     threaten vital United States interests, encourage regional \n     nuclear proliferation, further empower Iran, the world's \n     leading state sponsor of terror, and pose a serious and \n     destabilizing threat to Israel and the region.\n       (6) Over the past several years, with the assistance of the \n     Governments of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Syria, \n     Hizbollah and Hamas have increased their stockpile of \n     rockets, with more than 60,000 now ready to be fired at \n     Israel. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     continues to add to its arsenal of ballistic missiles and \n     cruise missiles, which threaten Iran's neighbors, Israel, and \n     United States Armed Forces in the region.\n       (7) As a result, Israel is facing a fundamentally altered \n     strategic environment.\n       (8) Pursuant to chapter 5 of title 1 of the Emergency \n     Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2003 (Public Law \n     108-11; 117 Stat. 576), the authority to make available loan \n     guarantees to Israel is currently set to expire on September \n     30, 2012.\n\n     SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States:\n       (1) To reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the security \n     of the State of Israel as a Jewish state. As President Barack \n     Obama stated on December 16, 2011, ``America's commitment and \n     my commitment to Israel and Israel's security is \n     unshakeable.'' And as President George W. Bush stated before \n     the Israeli Knesset on May 15, 2008, on the 60th anniversary \n     of the founding of the State of Israel, ``The alliance \n     between our governments is unbreakable, yet the source of our \n     friendship runs deeper than any treaty.''.\n       (2) To help the Government of Israel preserve its \n     qualitative military edge amid rapid and uncertain regional \n     political transformation.\n       (3) To veto any one-sided anti-Israel resolutions at the \n     United Nations Security Council.\n       (4) To support Israel's inherent right to self-defense.\n       (5) To pursue avenues to expand cooperation with the \n     Government of Israel both in defense and across the spectrum \n     of civilian sectors, including high technology, agriculture, \n     medicine, health, pharmaceuticals, and energy.\n       (6) To assist the Government of Israel with its ongoing \n     efforts to forge a peaceful, negotiated settlement of the \n     Israeli-Palestinian conflict that results in two states \n     living side-by-side in peace and security, and to encourage \n     Israel's neighbors to recognize Israel's right to exist as a \n     Jewish state.\n       (7) To encourage further development of advanced technology \n     programs between the United States and Israel given current \n     trends and instability in the region.\n\n     SEC. 4. UNITED STATES ACTIONS TO ASSIST IN THE DEFENSE OF \n                   ISRAEL AND PROTECT UNITED STATES INTERESTS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States \n     Government should take the following actions to assist in the \n     defense of Israel:\n       (1) Seek to enhance the capabilities of the Governments of \n     the United States and Israel to address emerging common \n     threats, increase security cooperation, and expand joint \n     military exercises.\n       (2) Provide the Government of Israel such support as may be \n     necessary to increase development and production of joint \n     missile defense systems, particularly such systems that \n     defend against the urgent threat posed to Israel and United \n     States forces in the region.\n       (3) Provide the Government of Israel assistance \n     specifically for the production and procurement of the Iron \n     Dome defense system for purposes of intercepting short-range \n     missiles, rockets, and projectiles launched against Israel.\n       (4) Provide the Government of Israel defense articles and \n     defense services through such mechanisms as appropriate, to \n     include air refueling tankers, missile defense capabilities, \n     and specialized munitions.\n       (5) Provide the Government of Israel additional excess \n     defense articles, as appropriate, in the wake of the \n     withdrawal of United States forces from Iraq.\n       (6) Examine ways to strengthen existing and ongoing \n     efforts, including the Gaza Counter Arms Smuggling \n     Initiative, aimed at preventing weapons smuggling into Gaza \n     pursuant to the 2009 agreement following the Israeli \n     withdrawal from Gaza, as well as measures to protect against \n     weapons smuggling and terrorist threats from the Sinai \n     Peninsula.\n       (7) Offer the Air Force of Israel additional training and \n     exercise opportunities in the United States to compensate for \n     Israel's limited air space.\n       (8) Work to encourage an expanded role for Israel with the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), including an \n     enhanced presence at NATO headquarters and exercises.\n       (9) Expand already-close intelligence cooperation, \n     including satellite intelligence, with Israel.\n\n     SEC. 5. ADDITIONAL STEPS TO DEFEND ISRAEL AND PROTECT \n                   AMERICAN INTERESTS.\n\n       (a) Extension of War Reserves Stockpile Authority.--\n       (1) Department of defense appropriations act, 2005.--\n     Section 12001(d) of the Department of\n\n[[Page S4780]]\n\n     Defense Appropriations Act, 2005 (Public Law 108-287; 118 \n     Stat. 1011) is amended by striking ``more than 8 years \n     after'' and inserting ``more than 10 years after''.\n       (2) Foreign assistance act of 1961.--Section 514(b)(2)(A) \n     of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2321h(b)(2)(A)) is amended by striking ``fiscal years 2011 \n     and 2012'' and inserting ``fiscal years 2013 and 2014''.\n       (b) Extension of Loan Guarantees to Israel.--Chapter 5 of \n     title I of the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations \n     Act, 2003 (Public Law 108-11; 117 Stat. 576) is amended under \n     the heading ``Loan Guarantees to Israel''--\n       (1) in the matter preceding the first proviso, by striking \n     ``September 30, 2011'' and inserting ``September 30, 2015''; \n     and\n       (2) in the second proviso, by striking ``September 30, \n     2011'' and inserting ``September 30, 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 6.
