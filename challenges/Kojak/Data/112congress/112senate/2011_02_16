Madam President, as the debate over government \nspending comes into focus this week, I think it is worth noting once \nagain how this debate has shifted in recent weeks.\n  After 2 years of bailouts and stimulus bills, we are finally talking \nabout how much government should cut instead of how much it should \nspend.\n  Obviously, the details matter. And we will be working those out in \nthe weeks ahead. But the fact that this debate has shifted is a \ntestament to the millions of Americans who insisted that their voices \nbe heard on this issue. They have made a difference. It is important we \nacknowledge that.\n  Now the question shifts to whether those in power will actually \nfollow through in any serious way. Will Democratic leaders in \nWashington really do something to rein in a government we can no longer \nafford or will they just pretend to and hope the American people focus \non their words instead of their actions.\n  Unfortunately, the early signs are discouraging.\n  The President's response to the growing national alarm about spending \nand debt was a proposal to freeze government spending at the already-\nirresponsible levels that he himself has set over the past 2 years--\nlevels that, if maintained, will only intensify the current crisis by \nputting us deeper and deeper in debt.\n  The consensus on the President's proposal is that it is both \nunserious and irresponsible, and that, despite what the President may \nsay, he is not in fact treating this crisis with the seriousness it \ndemands. The President even seemed to concede the point yesterday, \nsaying his budget wasn't adequate to the task and suggesting that maybe \nCongress could do something more meaningful than he has.\n  And what do we find in Congress?\n  Well, we find one party in the House of Representatives making a \ngenuine effort to cut spending and debt, and we find Democrats in the \nSenate announcing today that they intend to line up behind the \nPresident's timid proposal for a partial spending freeze.\n  In other words, Democratic leaders in Congress intend to join the \nPresident\n\n[[Page S766]]\n\nin resigning themselves to a future of growing debts and deficits at a \ntime when Americans are demanding cuts instead.\n  So here is what we have learned this week: on the most pressing issue \nof the day, the President and Democratic leaders in Congress have \ndecided to take a pass. They are either unwilling to admit that \nWashington needs to live within its means or they are completely \nunwilling to make the tough choices that will get us there.\n  It is hard to believe, really.\n  Americans are screaming at us to do something about a $14 trillion \ndebt, the President proposes a budget that nearly doubles it, and \nDemocrats clap their hands in approval.\n  Maybe Democrats were so focused on passing their health care bill \nlast year they didn't notice what has been going on in Europe.\n  Maybe they were so focused on defending their stimulus that they \nmissed a national uprising right here at home about the spending and \nthe debt they have racked up.\n  Maybe they missed the fact that while they were busy adding $3 \ntrillion to the debt, nearly 3 million Americans lost their jobs.\n  Maybe they have been so focused on passing their agenda that they \ndidn't notice the fact that the American people just repudiated their \nentire agenda.\n  They need to get real.\n  The men and women who were sent to Washington this year were not sent \nhere on a mission to keep spending at the levels this administration \nhas set. They were sent here to change the culture, to convince the \nadministration that it needs to change its ways.\n  Democrats in Washington seem to think they can wait it out; that if \nthey just agree to freeze current spending levels in place people will \nthink they are listening. Don't they realize that current levels of \nspending are the reason we just had the biggest wave election in a \ngeneration?\n  The senior Senator from New York seems to think that anything short \nof freezing current spending levels is extreme.\n  I will tell you what is extreme: extreme is to insist in the middle \nof a jobs and debt crisis that government has to spend a trillion \ndollars more than we take in every year.\n  That is extreme.\n  Extreme is a view of the world that says government will not live \nwithin its means, even when the American people demand it.\n  Extreme is a view of the world that says the survival of this or that \nprogram is more important than the survival of the American dream \nitself.\n  Extreme is telling our children they may have to do without because \nwe refuse to do with less.\n  So I suggest to my Democratic colleagues that they stop thinking \nabout what they can get away with and start thinking about what is \nactually needed to solve this crisis.\n  I suggest they start listening to the American people who are telling \nus in no uncertain terms that a freeze will not cut it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/16/senate-section/article/S766-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I recently introduced a bill called the \nRegulatory Responsibility for Our Economy Act of 2011--it is S. 358--\nand I would urge my colleagues who would like to, after hearing my \nremarks, to cosponsor this. I realize the bill is a mouthful--the \nRegulatory Responsibility for Our Economy Act--but I think it is \nappropriate.\n  This bill would strengthen and codify President Obama's Executive \norder from January 18. In that Executive order, the President made a \ncommitment to review, to modify, to streamline, to expand or repeal--\nthat is a lot of things, to review, modify, streamline, expand, and \nrepeal--those regulatory actions that are duplicative, unnecessary, \noverly burdensome, or would have significant economic impacts on \nAmericans. So the Regulatory Responsibility for Our Economy Act of 2011 \nwould ensure just that.\n  My legislation would require that all regulations put forth by the \ncurrent and future administrations--regardless of the President--\nconsider the economic burden on American businesses, ensure stakeholder \ninput--i.e., the people who are affected--during the regulatory \nprocess, and promote innovation. Back on January 18, the President \nsigned an Executive order to do precisely that, we thought. It was for \n``improving regulation and regulatory review.'' But the President also \nreleased a factsheet on the intent for his regulatory strategy. It was \nin detail. Per the factsheet, ``In this Executive Order, the President \nrequires Federal agencies to design cost-effective, evidence-based \nregulations that are compatible with economic growth, job creation, and \ncompetitiveness.'' My legislation would ensure that would actually \nhappen.\n  In addition, the President published an op-ed in the Wall Street \nJournal detailing the administration's commitment to reviewing \nregulations. As part of this op-ed, the President stated:\n\n       We have preserved freedom of commerce while applying those \n     rules and regulations necessary to protect the public against \n     threats to our health and safety and to safeguard people in \n     business from abuse.\n\n  But he also noted that--and this is the key:\n\n       Sometimes those rules have gotten out of balance, placing \n     unreasonable burdens on business--burdens that have stifled \n     innovation and had a chilling effect on growth and jobs.\n\n  I must say I absolutely agree with the President. I was extremely \npleased when he came out with the Executive order on January 16. And as \nI travel across my home State, I have heard Kansan after Kansan, \nregardless of the business, regardless of where they are on Main \nStreet, who find themselves weighed down by the burden of too many \nregulations. As a matter of fact, I think if any Member of this Senate \nwould like to get a standing ovation from even a group of five at a \ncoffee shop or at a meeting of any organization that is business-\noriented or just folks, you can talk about the debt, you\n\n[[Page S767]]\n\ncan talk about spending, you can talk about other issues, but the one \nthat really grabs them is this business of overregulation.\n  This has been going on for too many years--too many decades. As a \nmatter of fact, you can come into a meeting, and you will probably get \nthe question--even the distinguished President pro tempore, the Senator \nfrom New York, would get the question, though probably a little nicer \nthan I would get it, and certainly the other Senator from New York, who \nis now leaving the Chamber--the question usually comes as: Pat, what on \nEarth are you doing back there, saddling us with paperwork and \nregulations that are costly, burdensome, and that we don't even know \nabout? All of a sudden, on a Wednesday morning we wake up and we face \nthis regulatory dictate. It is counterproductive, and the cost \noutweighs the benefit. What is going on back there? What are you guys \ndoing?\n  My response: Well, let's stop there for just a minute. I am not a \n``you guy,'' I am an ``us guy.''\n  Clear back in the days when I was in the House of Representatives and \nI had the privilege of serving in that body, we were all trying to do \nsomething about unnecessary and burdensome regulations. So I have had a \nlongstanding concern with the regulatory process, and that is the one \nissue that is a tinderbox issue. It is one where you really get an \nimmediate response, with people saying: Amen. Somebody needs to do \nsomething about that. And they were so pleased with the President when \nhe came out with the Executive order, saying: Hey, I am going to do \nsomething about this.\n  As of January 3, 2011, less than 6 months after the Dodd-Frank act \nwas signed into law, regulators have issued over 1,000 pages of \nregulatory proposals and 360 pages of final rules. Talk about asking \nSenators whether they have read a bill, I know that nobody in the \nSenate has read over the 1,000 pages of regulatory proposals and 360 \npages of final rules on the regulatory reform act. And many more pages \nof regulations--upwards of 5,000--are expected.\n  Regulations such as those put forth by the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, along with the Departments of Labor and Treasury, have \nresulted in the child-only insurance market effectively disappearing in \n20 States because of the regulations. The idea was to provide just the \nopposite but in 20 States today, that is not the case.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency began implementing its greenhouse \ngas regulations on stationary sources of energy that emit 75,000 or \nmore tons of CO2 a year, which, on its surface, aims to only \nregulate those largest emitters, such as powerplants and oil \nrefineries, but it is only a matter of time--it is only a matter of \ntime--before stricter regulations are handed down that will impact \nevery corner of commerce.\n  Let me just say that the EPA--knowing, of course, that Congress said \nno to cap and trade--is trying very hard to go around the Congress to \ntry to put forth these regulations into compliance with the law.\n  Last year, the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyard \nAdministration--and everything has to have an acronym in Washington, \nbut the one for that is called GIPSA--published a proposed rule that \nwould change longstanding rules governing the production and marketing \nof livestock. This is an agriculture thing. This proposed rule goes far \nbeyond what was intended in the last farm bill. In fact, a number of \nitems in the proposed rule were defeated here on the Senate floor, and \nyet they were put in the proposed rule.\n  A number of private economic studies show the loss of gross domestic \nproduct is in excess of $1 billion--much more costly than the $100 \nmillion threshold required for an economic analysis to be completed. \nUnfortunately, an economic analysis is yet to be completed.\n  So I was encouraged, Madam President. I was a happy camper there for \na little bit by President Obama's commitment to a new regulatory \nstrategy. But the devil is in the details, and with staff help, after \nreviewing the Executive order, I must say I was left with some larger \nconcerns. I was upset.\n  The Executive order states:\n\n       In applying these principles, each agency is directed to \n     use the best available techniques to quantify anticipated \n     present and future benefits and costs as accurately as \n     possible.\n\n  Wonderful. We will have a cost-benefit yardstick applied to all of \nthe regulations pouring out of all the agencies in Washington. The \ndistinguished Speaker of the House said the other day that we had \n200,000 more Federal employees in Washington than we did 2 years ago. I \ncan assure you they are not twiddling their thumbs. They are issuing \nregulations, and they tend to be agenda-oriented, not really getting \ndown to sound science or determining the unanticipated effects of their \nregulations.\n\n  Picking up again on what the President said:\n\n       Where appropriate and permitted by law, each agency may \n     consider and discuss qualitatively values that are difficult \n     or impossible to quantify, including equity, human dignity, \n     fairness, and distributive impacts.\n\n  The partridge in the pear tree was left out.\n  Let me read this again.\n\n       Where appropriate and permitted by law, each agency--\n\n  As they go through the regulations to determine which are \ncounterproductive to this economy, costing billions in regard to \nmanufacturing and businesses and harming our economy where it should \nnot be harmed, they say, OK, but, but, but--\n\n       Where appropriate and permitted by law, each agency may \n     consider--\n\n  And this is the part where we ought to really take a look at it--\n\n     values that are difficult or impossible to quantify--\n  How are you going to do that? How are you going to quantify values \nthat are difficult or impossible--\n\n     including equity--\n\n  Everybody is for that--\n\n     human dignity--\n\n  I don't know anyone who is against that--\n\n     fairness, and distributive impacts.\n\n  Now, try to figure that out if you are working in a Federal agency \nand you are trying to issue a regulation. If that isn't a loophole \nlarge enough to drive a truck through, I don't know what is.\n  As the Wall Street Journal captured so eloquently in their response \nto President Obama's editorial, ``These amorphous concepts are not \nmeasurable at all.'' You can't do it. You can't measure them.\n  On the surface, I think this language has the potential to be a very \nlarge loophole. This, coupled with an exception for independent \nagencies such as the FDIC, the SEC, or the EPA, has the potential to \nresult in no changes at all. So we issue an Executive order saying: \nLet's take a tough look at the regulations that are so terribly \ncounterproductive, and we may end up with nothing, more especially \nwithout the independent agencies. Note I said the FDIC. Note I said the \nSEC. Read Dodd-Frank, read financial regulatory reform. Read the reach \ninto the small community banks and what they are going to have to put \nup with and hire a bunch of bad news bears--employees--to figure out \nand tell the rest of the employees how on Earth they are going to \ncomply with these new regulations.\n  And my favorite, the EPA, which had the temerity and the unmitigated \ngall, after this loophole came out, to say: Well, none of our \nregulations even apply. Our regulations are just fine. I got news for \nthe EPA. The chairwoman of the Agriculture Committee, Deborah Stabenow, \nand I have agreed to hold a hearing on this to determine just exactly \nwhere we are, and where we are is not good.\n  My legislation would close the loophole in President Obama's \nExecutive order and would close other existing loopholes, including \nthose that the administration has been using to bypass valuable \nstakeholder input on regulations. Again, there is that word--\n``stakeholder.'' That is a Senate word. Those are the people who are \ngetting smacked right up alongside the face in regard to the \nregulations they do not even know adhere to their business or what they \nare about.\n  The President has also agreed--and here is the key word or phrase:\n\n       Sometimes, those rules have gotten out of balance, placing \n     unreasonable burdens on businesses--burdens that have stifled \n     innovation and have had a chilling effect on growth and jobs.\n\n  The President went on to say, ``At other times, we have failed to \nmeet our\n\n[[Page S768]]\n\nbasic responsibility to protect the public interest leading to \ndisastrous consequences,'' precisely what I am trying to demonstrate \nhere. My legislation would assure a review of these regulations to \nassure fewer burdensome and economically irresponsible regulatory \nactions on struggling businesses in the United States.\n  President Obama's Executive order ``requires the Federal agencies \nensure that regulations protect our safety, our health and environment \nwhile promoting economic growth.'' So does my legislation. ``And it \norders a government-wide review of the rules already on the books to \nremove outdated regulations that stifle job creation and make our \neconomy less competitive.''\n  That is what the President's Executive order does, and so does my \nlegislation.\n  The President said, ``It's a review that will help bring order to \nregulations that have become a patchwork of overlapping rules, the \nresult of tinkering by administrations and legislators of both parties \nand the influence of special interests in Washington over decades.''\n  The President was right. My legislation would do this but would add \nsome teeth to the commitment--sharp teeth--by cutting out the \nloopholes, the very loophole I read. I am not going to read it again. I \ndefy anybody to tell me what it means or how anybody could use that \nkind of language in determining the cost-benefit of any regulation.\n  The President has made it his ``mission to root out regulations that \nconflict,''--and I am quoting here--``that are not worth the cost or \nare just plain dumb.'' That is pretty clear, if the President says \nthese regulations are just plain dumb. I said ``counterproductive.'' \nThat is the Senate word. He said ``dumb.'' That is the Dodge City word \nand I think Dodge City would agree. I think my legislation is something \nthe administration can support. So while the President believes his \nExecutive order ``makes clear, we are seeking more affordable, less \nintrusive means to achieve the same ends--giving careful consideration \nto benefits and costs,'' and that it ``means writing rules with more \ninput from experts, businesses and ordinary citizens,'' there were a \nnumber of loopholes in the Executive order I am happy to address with \nthe administration in my legislation.\n  My bill would keep the President accountable for another promise to \nAmericans, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, the \ndetails of which I am happy to share with my colleagues. I hope we get \na great number of colleagues to help us codify the Executive order, put \nsome teeth in it, make it work, and get at regulatory reform as opposed \nto being disingenuous. I think that is exactly what has happened in \nregard to this, what turned out to be a very noble effort, but the end \nresult had so many loopholes in it as to be completely ineffective.\n  I yield any time I may have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/16/senate-section/article/S768-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 223, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 223) to modernize the air traffic control \n     system, improve the safety, reliability, and availability of \n     transportation by air in the United States, provide \n     modernization of the air traffic control system, reauthorize \n     the Federal Aviation Administration, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Rockefeller (for Wyden) amendment No. 27, to increase the \n     number of test sites in the National Airspace System used for \n     unmanned aerial vehicles and to require one of those test \n     sites to include a significant portion of public lands.\n       Inhofe modified amendment No. 7, to provide for an increase \n     in the number of slots available at Ronald Reagan Washington \n     National Airport.\n       Rockefeller (for Ensign) amendment No. 32, to improve \n     provisions relating to certification and flight standards for \n     military remotely piloted aerial systems in the National \n     Airspace System.\n       McCain amendment No. 4, to repeal the essential air service \n     program.\n       Rockefeller (for Leahy) amendment No. 50, to amend title 1 \n     of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to \n     include nonprofit and volunteer ground and air ambulance crew \n     members and first responders for certain benefits, and to \n     clarify the liability protection for volunteer pilots that \n     fly for public benefit.\n       Reid amendment No. 54, to allow airports that receive \n     airport improvement grants for the purchase of land to lease \n     the land and develop the land in a manner compatible with \n     noise buffering purposes.\n       Udall (NM) modified amendment No. 49, to authorize Dona Ana \n     County, New Mexico, to exchange certain land conveyed to the \n     County for airport purposes.\n       Udall (NM) modified amendment No. 51, to require that all \n     advanced imaging technology used as a primary screening \n     method for passengers be equipped with automatic target \n     recognition software.\n       Paul amendment No. 18, to strike the provisions relating to \n     clarifying a memorandum of understanding between the Federal \n     Aviation Administration and the Occupational Safety and \n     Health Administration.\n       Rockefeller (for Baucus) further modified amendment No. 75, \n     of a perfecting nature.\n       Hutchison modified amendment No. 93 (to modified amendment \n     No. 7), to provide for an increase in the number of slots \n     available at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I wish to catch up the membership \non the floor and off the floor a little bit about where we are. We are \nat midweek for a third week of consideration of the FAA reauthorization \nbill. Last night, Senator Reid filed cloture on this bill. In a perfect \nworld we would have finished this bill already without filing cloture, \nbut we need to finish and that is what cloture motions are for. I will \nsupport cloture, needless to say.\n  Senator Hutchison also filed cloture on an amendment that will bring \nconclusion to a debate on slots at National Airport. I will talk about \nthat issue in more detail later. But I am saying right now slots are \nvery important but they do not need to consume all of the arguments and \nall of the discussion on the floor about this bill. They are a very \nsmall part of the bill--an important part of the bill, recognizing the \nWest has to be served much better than it is being--but it is not the \nentire bill. It is a very small part of the bill.\n  Last night we disposed of two pending amendments by voice vote. I \nbelieve we have made progress to resolve some of the pending \namendments, but votes will be required on several of them and I expect \nwe will have those votes today. Senator Hutchison and I are trying to \nclear a number of other filed amendments. There were at one point 100 \nof them. I hope we can accept a number of them. I have heard from any \nnumber of my colleagues on their amendments and I am trying to be \nhelpful in getting them adopted where they contribute to the bill.\n  I know Senator Hutchison is committed to supporting the bill. We need \nto resolve the issue of slots. She has been working--we have all been \nworking diligently and almost exclusively on that matter, and we will \ndo this with a vote. We will resolve that issue.\n  After that vote we will vote on cloture, which I believe will pass \nand I am extremely hopeful we will reach agreement to get this bill \ndone this week. The farthest possible day and most unhappy thought \nwould be if we had to go through the recess and do it on the day we \ncame back. I think it is far better that we get it done this week. \nThere is no excuse for not doing it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, we now have, I think, a glidepath to \npassing this important legislation. We worked late into the night, \nSenator Rockefeller and I did, to try to accommodate needs, concerns, \namendments of Members. Now we have the cloture motion in play and hope \nwe can come to a real agreement on the Reagan Airport perimeter issue \nso we could even do it before cloture is invoked--but hopefully, if we \nare not\n\n[[Page S769]]\n\nable to come to a complete agreement, we would at least be able to get \ncloture and move on.\n  I hope our Members know we are going to continue to work to address \neveryone's concerns. We have concerns of western Senators and concerns \nof Senators within the Washington, DC metropolitan area. We have small \ncommunity concerns and we have eastern seaboard community concerns. We \nhave been working for years, actually--but months and then weeks to \naddress concerns. We are open to do that. But it is time to wind this \nbill up so we can go to conference with the House with a strong Senate \nposition and do the big picture policy issues that need to be \naddressed.\n  We must have the next generation of air traffic control started. We \nmust have a satellite-based system that is for the whole world--for the \npeople coming into our country and the people using our airspace. We \nneed to have the safety and the consumer protections that are in this \nbill. We need to have a responsible way for people from all over our \ncountry to come into Reagan Washington National Airport while also \nprotecting the people around the area from congestion.\n  We have a lot of concerns. I think this is a good bill and it is \ngetting better every day. I do think we can come up with the right mix \nthat will put our aviation system in the forefront of the world because \nhalf of the air traffic of the world comes into and out of the United \nStates. We certainly need to be the best and that is what this bill \nwill put us on the glidepath to do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         supplemental carriers\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, the supplemental carriers provide a \nvaluable and unique service to our economy as well as our military's \nability to move troops and materiel around the world in a safe and \ntimely manner. Current flight and duty rules for carriers recognize \ndifferences in operations and provide the necessary flexibility for \nsupplemental carriers, given the challenging worldwide environments \nthey operate in such as Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Iraq, and other Middle \nEast destinations.\n  Supplemental carriers have a long track record of safe operations. In \nmore than 15 years, the National Transportation Safety Board, NTSB, has \nnot cited fatigue as a primary cause in any nonscheduled/supplemental \nairline accident while flying under supplemental rules, 14 CFR Part \n121, subpart S. There have been no fatalities attributed to any \naccident where fatigue was even remotely considered a contributing \nfactor.\n  In the months preceding FAA's notice of proposed rulemaking, the \nagency's lack of interest in the operations of nonscheduled carriers \nled many to believe their unique operating procedures and status as \nsmall business entities would be addressed in a separate rulemaking. \nFAA issued its notice of proposed rulemaking, NPRM, to the public on \nSeptember 14, 2010, and it was clear supplemental carriers were, \nindeed, covered by the NPRM, but the impacts of this proposal on \nsupplemental carriers were not taken into consideration. This oversight \nis unprecedented. The FAA collected data from scheduled carriers to \nanalyze their operations but acknowledged in the Regulatory Impact \nAnalysis that it collected no data from NACA's nonscheduled airlines. \nFAA has a legal obligation to examine the impacts of this proposed rule \non all segments of industry, which they failed to do. In the coming \nweeks and months I hope you will join me in encouraging the FAA to \nconsider supplemental carriers flying under subpart S separately in the \nrulemaking proceeding.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I appreciate my colleague's concerns about how \nsupplemental carriers have been treated in the FAA's rulemaking process \ndealing with pilot flight and duty time. As you are aware, modernizing \nthe pilot flight and duty regulations has been one of the highest \npriorities of the FAA as well as many in Congress. In fact, when H.R. \n5900 was signed into law last year by the President, Congress mandated \nthe FAA complete the final rule overhauling these regulations by August \n1 of this year.\n  I agree that all the regulated parties affected by this and other \nrulemakings should be treated fairly. I am willing to work with Senator \nInhofe, Senator Murkowski, and other interested parties to ensure \nsupplemental carriers receive fair and thorough consideration, and that \ntheir industry data be considered, before any new rules for those \ncarriers are promulgated.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for his gracious commitment to insure \nthat these carriers are treated fairly and in accordance with well \nestablished precedent.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Let me catch up a bit on where we are. The Senate \nhas been working on this national slots issue for close to 1 year or it \nmay be 10 years. I don't know. It has been an awfully long time. But we \nhave been unable to achieve a resolution so far on the matter. That is \na problem.\n  When we began consideration of the FAA reauthorization bill, Senator \nHutchison and I decided we should focus on helping consumers. Everybody \nwas talking about helping airliners. We were talking about people. \nAirliners fly around. People have to be able to do it. So we decided to \nfocus on them.\n  So we both believed the growth of Western States must be recognized. \nI come from an Eastern State, sort of. The Presiding Officer comes from \nan Eastern State, totally. But the growth is in the West. They are \nunderserved. That cannot be debated. It is embarrassing how few flights \nthere are back and forth between National and them. The National \nCapital is a fairly important place. People need to go there, either \nfor tourism or for business or whatever, and we need more access to the \nNational Capital to be provided to the citizens from there on a ``both-\nway'' basis.\n  So time is running short for the consideration of the FAA package. \nThis bill is too important to the country to let it languish over this \nissue. It is virtually all we have talked about, and I regret that \nbecause it does not reflect the nature and the priorities of the bill.\n  Unlike the national slot issue, the FAA bill has direct impacts on \nthe whole Nation all the time. It will help our economy now. It will \nhelp our economy in the future with immediate job support and long-term \nimpact on our role in the global marketplace.\n  To move forward on the bill, Senator Hutchison offered a slots \namendment, a national slots amendment, that I feel offers a fair and \nreasonable solution on this issue. Over the past 2\\1/2\\ weeks, she and \nI have worked closely with other Members and their staffs in an effort \nto achieve a compromise on this issue.\n  Many of their needs and ideas have been incorporated into her \namendment. It still may not be perfect, but it represents an attempt to \nfairly balance the competing needs of Members and their constituents \ninside and outside the perimeter. It is fascinating when people have it \nin their minds that something has to happen. They have to have so many \nflights or flights have to go to this city or that city or whatever. \nThen people sort of get attached to airlines. They feel they have to \nrepresent an airline.\n  I sort of thought we were here to represent the people of the States \nfrom which we come but, more importantly, in some sense, the entire \ncountry, particularly on an issue such as this.\n  Her amendment will permit some additional beyond-perimeter flights \nshortly after enactment of the bill. Then this very interesting part \nabout the Department of Transportation, we have introduced that into \nthe bill. It is a very good part of the bill. The Department of \nTransportation, which is neutral, which is professional, which is fully \nengaged in all of this, is required to study the effect of those \nflights over the next year.\n  Some people will say that is kind of a dodge. It is not kind of a \ndodge. Because slots are so controversial, it takes the Department of \nTransportation and their analysis to guide us about whether there is an \noverload at National, whether there is an underload. My own view is \nthere is an underload at National, lots of slots available. But that is \nnot the prevailing view on the part of some. They\n\n[[Page S770]]\n\nfeel we cannot have a single additional flight.\n  So DOT can study that. If they find there is no negative impact, a \nlimited number can be added at the appropriate time or not, depending \non what we want to do.\n  Specifically, the amendment provides network carriers an opportunity \nto swap existing flights they conduct within the perimeter and use them \nfor flights to Western States beyond the perimeter. Seven round-trip \nflights could be converted under this provision.\n  Under this construct a carrier could use flights to large hub \nairports within the perimeter where significant service already is \nprovided. This protects States and small communities within the \nperimeter and limits the number of new flights at the airport as \nrequested by local officials.\n  The amendment also provides five new flight exemptions that would \nonly be distributed to new entrant or limited incumbent carriers. To \nprovide maximum flexibility for the carriers, these could be used for \nnew flights within or beyond the perimeter. All of this is kind of \nopaque, like a puzzle, but it does happen to work.\n  We have had approximately 100 amendments filed to the FAA \nreauthorization bill. Much of the talk is focused on slots at National \nAirport. There are lots of airports, but National Airport has received \nthe bulk of the amendments. I don't resent that or regret it. I just \nwish we could get to the rest of the bill, which I think is probably \ngoing to be entirely acceptable to people because it is a very \nreasonable approach.\n  Only three other amendments have been filed that directly address the \nissue of west coast access to National. The Ensign amendment would \nallow carriers to have unlimited conversions or swaps beyond the \nperimeter. I believe this proposal goes too far and could have a \nsignificant negative impact locally and for small communities serviced \nwithin the perimeter. I do think Senators Ensign and Kyl, with whom I \nhave worked on this issue over the past year, can appreciate this \nposition and will receive opportunities for their constituents through \npassage of our amendment.\n  The Merkley and Wyden and Cantwell-Murray-Merkley-Begich amendments \nare the only other two amendments that have been filed with a focus on \nthe issue of beyond-perimeter flights at National. They would both \nallow for new flight exemptions at the airport that would favor \ndistribution to limited incumbents or new entrants. The Merkley \namendment would provide eight new round-trips for beyond-perimeter \nservice. The Wyden amendment would add 12 new round-trips beyond the \nperimeter and 4 new round-trips within the perimeter for a total of 16 \nnew flights. While the Hutchison amendment may not provide the same \nlevel of opportunity for services to their States that they desire, her \namendment does provide ample room for their constituencies to obtain \nnew service with 5 exemptions rather than 12 beyond perimeter.\n  I believe we must strike an appropriate balance. We have no choice. \nWe can't make everybody happy. Senator Hutchison's and my approach has \nbeen to go down the middle. People who don't want anything more and \npeople who want a lot more, kind of edge them together and go right \ndown the middle. That is all we can do in a bill of this sort where \nemotions run very high.\n  I do believe we must strike an appropriate balance between new \nservice from incumbent carriers and service from limited or new-entrant \ncarriers if we are going to give consumers the greatest options on \nchoice and competition. Consumers are really what this is about. \nAirlines are obviously important. They are going to fly where the \nbusiness is. That makes all of us--the Presiding Officer, for part of \nher State which is not in the New York area--very sensitive to rural \nsituations. West Virginia is entirely rural. It has no city larger than \nslightly over 50,000 people, that being the State capital. Flights in \nand out of that State are very important to me. Most of them are done \nby propeller. Most of them are not particularly comfortable. But they \ndo get one to where one wants to go. Now we have switched to Dulles so \nwe can feed out from Dulles to anywhere in the world. Taking care of \nrural areas is incredibly important to us.\n  Again, the DOT study included in the amendment will also provide \nvaluable insight into the impact of additional flights at National \nAirport on this or any other aspect of it. Under the amendment, if DOT \nfinds that more access is appropriate, it can permit up to four \nadditional flights at National. These would be provided to incumbent \ncarriers to swap service from large hubs within the perimeter, \nresulting in no new air traffic at the airport. Senator Hutchison and I \nwould like to emphasize those words, ``no new flights.'' They have room \nfor flights. A GAO study showed that, really quite a lot of flights. \nBut the prevailing wish is not to have noise and disruption.\n  The fact is, the planes are getting quieter, and they will get much \nmore quieter as they are entered into all markets.\n  In total, as few as 12 or as many as 16 additional beyond-perimeter \nflights could result from the amendment over a 2-year period. If the \nDOT determines the initial 12 flights have had a direct negative impact \non the DC market--I emphasize, we are putting DOT right on the case so \nthey can watch it closely; whatever people might think, they are \nneutral and professional and they do this for a living--it will limit \nthe likelihood of adding additional flights in future FAA \nreauthorizations. That makes sense. Let them be the arbiters of that \nrather than us battling it out here.\n  This type of review is long overdue and will provide far greater \nunderstanding of local needs by any carrier seeking access at National. \nIf DOT finds there is enough room for up to 16 flights, the amendment \nwould seek to balance them among various stakeholders. Eleven of these \nflights would be swaps or conversions of service to incumbent carriers \nalready providing this, resulting, again, in no new traffic at that \nparticular airport--there are other airports in the country; I have to \nkeep telling myself that, but it is hard to recognize that looking at \nthe debate so far--and minimizing the impacts of flights on a local \nbasis generally.\n  Five of the flights would be dedicated to new entrants or limited \nincumbents to receive new exemptions. These could be used for service \nwithin or beyond the perimeter so all communities in the country would \nhave an opportunity to obtain a flight.\n  In closing, I recognize every amendment addressing slots at National \nwill be considered flawed in some corners. That is in the nature of our \nworld. However, I do think it is important that we have votes on these \namendments to determine a Senate position on this issue.\n  I believe the Hutchison amendment is a very reasonable offer. I hope \nit will obtain the support of the majority of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 75, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate resume consideration of the Baucus amendment No. 75, as further \nmodified--this is the amendment for the finance title of the bill we \nare on which was reported out by the Finance Committee last week--\nfurther, that the amendment, as further modified, be agreed to; and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about \ncomments I have heard from both the chairman and the ranking member \nthis morning about the FAA bill.\n  First of all, I wish to thank them for their hard work and diligence \non this legislation. This hasn't just come now, this year; this is \nsomething the chairman and ranking member have been working on for \nseveral years.\n  I had a chance yesterday to talk about the NextGen system and how \nmany jobs are going to be created from high-wage technology that is \ngoing to be used to modernize our transportation system. It is going to \ndeliver flights that are probably 20 percent more on time, it will save \nus probably 5 or 6 percent on fuel, it is going to lower \nCO2, and it is going to improve the experience for \npassengers. So I am all for the FAA underlying bill and I applaud my \ncolleagues for their hard work in trying to make this legislation a \nreality and doing so this week.\n  I have concerns about the proposed Hutchison amendment. I know the \nSenator from Texas indicated she is still talking with people and \nworking with people in an effort to make everyone happy. In this place \nI don't think we make everyone happy, but I thank the Senator for her \nwillingness to at least on the floor say she is trying to make everyone \nhappy, and I think she is probably sincere in her efforts.\n  I have been involved with this issue now for probably 3 or 4 years--\nnot just the FAA bill but the slots issue and air transportation--and \nmy former colleague, Senator Gordon Smith from Oregon, and I were \ninvolved with this issue and several years before that with numerous \nother members of the Commerce Committee. It is probably one of the \nthornier issues the Congress has to deal with, primarily because the \nissue is one that is fused both by issues of economic development \naround airports, as well as transportation interests of the flying \npublic, and probably a little bit of a dose of what Members' own \npersonal experiences and interests are.\n  For me, getting access to the West, to the Nation's capital, is an \nimportant issue. It is not the primary way I come to work every week. I \nactually fly in and out of the other airport in the region and do so--I \ndon't know if I would say happily because, frankly, I think Dulles \nAirport--although I don't know what they have done lately, but they got \nrid of their mobile lounges and now have invested in some transport \nsystem where you probably walk as far on that system as you do on the \nprevious system. There are people smiling on the floor. I think they \nhave already been through it. I think they are saying, Yes, I have done \nthat drill, and what is up at Dulles?\n  Putting that aside, that is the way I fly 80 percent of the time back \nand forth to the Nation's capital. I am pleased to have that flight \nschedule that accommodates me and actually accommodates many \nWashingtonians, because I think there are plenty of my Washingtonians \nwho are coming back to the region to do business on a variety of issues \nin that corridor and see that as an access point as well.\n  The issue, though, is about whether the West has enough access to \nNational Airport. In the past two debates we have had on this issue in \n2000 and 2003, the Congress decided the West did not have enough access \nto National Airport. In both of those instances this body passed \nlegislation opening more slots to the West through a process whereby \nthe Department of Transportation basically decided what were the best \nareas of the West to service, which were the best networks to possibly \nservice those areas, and how to get that traffic from one destination \nto the Nation's capital. In both instances, in 2000 and in 2003, when \nthat very broad directive was given to the Department of \nTransportation, each time six new flight paths were opened to the \nNation's capital, and I think that process worked very well. It worked \nvery well because the debate was not here on the Senate floor about \nwhose service was going to be delivered, but it was given to the \nDepartment of Transportation, the broad outline. In each instance, \nincreasing access from the West to the Nation's capital is about having \nthe flying public gain access to the Nation's capital and it is also \nabout economic interests. That is why I still have concerns about this \nproposal on the table and about the fair access it may not provide to \nmany people in the West.\n  In this particular proposal, unlike the two previous access issues in \n2000 and 2003, in each point six new slots were given and the \nDepartment of Transportation had a fair and open process about it.\n  This particular proposal focuses on the airlines that already service \nthe Nation's Capital, and in this case over 60 percent of the Nation's \nCapital slots are controlled by two specific airlines. This proposal \nwould open those carriers's ability to trade out slots they already \nhave with other cities, thereby giving them access to the West. In \nfact, the proposal of my colleague from Texas, even on those new slots, \nnew incumbent carriers they are saying can give access to the West are \ncarriers that are currently operating even inside the perimeter today. \nIf you think this proposal is about helping access the West, it is \nprimarily about accessing the West by people who already control the \nreal estate at National Airport, which are two carriers.\n  I noticed the Department of Justice looked at this larger issue. That \nis because many of my colleagues who do not want to spend a lot of time \non this--I guess I am glad I am educated on it, but I wish I had time \nto work on other things. The issue is, the national interest or policy \nquestion comes into play when you have access to what are limited \nfootprint destinations, such as National Airport, such as La Guardia. \nThose are times when the U.S. Government has said we want to make sure \nthere is a fair process about this because there is a small footprint \nand, obviously, if somebody controls too much of that footprint, it is \nan issue.\n  In the most recent debate, Delta and US Airways have been trying to \ndo a swap exchange between La Guardia and DCA, and the Department of \nJustice says: Not such a good idea. You already own too much of the \nmarket share. If you want to do this, why don't you divest some of the \nslots you have now. Instead of doing that, the airlines are going to go \ndown a path of continuing to accumulate and dominate in the East.\n  I hope my colleagues will take into consideration that I know the \nchairman and ranking member are trying to work in good faith, both on \nthis issue and to move the bill forward. For this Member who wants to \nsee a healthy transportation network, I am very concerned about the \nexisting incumbents at National Airport continuing to dominate, with 60 \npercent of the market, and perhaps cancelling a lot of flights that \nthey currently have now within this region only to benefit from the \nmore lucrative long-haul flights across the country.\n  I am for a fair process. I think everybody should be able to bid on \nany new flights that are going to be put on the table. The two \nprocesses Congress followed in 2000 and 2003 were closer to what I \nbelieve, personally, is a more fair and open process.\n  I hope we can continue working and dialoging on these issues. I do \nthink they are important. They are probably more important for the long \nrun of what a transportation network system\n\n[[Page S774]]\n\nlooks like in this country, to be sure the consumer interests are taken \ncare of and that there is a fair and competitive price.\n  I know some of the people who have been involved in this debate--\nprobably not on the floor but out in the public--are talking about the \namount of money airlines have invested in these airports, as if somehow \nthat means they own the airports. The facts will show, in both these \ncases, the majority of money poured into the infrastructure at both \nthese facilities is basically taxpayer dollars through bonding \nauthority. It is not as if some airline owns the rights, owns the \nability to control 50 or 60 percent of one of these airports just \nbecause they have paid for airport improvements. We all have been \npaying for airport improvements. As I said, I, personally, think the \nairport improvements made at Dulles are not so much of an improvement. \nI am going to continue with that and continue to fly through that \nparticular airport.\n  I hope my colleagues will keep discussing this issue, and I hope we \ncan get somewhere on it. My concern is that a proposal with conversion \nin it will mean many of my colleagues on the Senate floor will have \ntheir flights canceled to their favorite locations, and basically they \nwill start servicing long-haul across the country with a very big share \nof the existing national market.\n  I hope we can do something that will instigate more competition, more \ndiversity, and something that will help get this legislation passed.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today \nbecause, on Monday, President Obama introduced his new budget. What we \nsaw in that budget is, for the most part, more of the same--more \nspending, more taxes, more borrowing. We see this budget from a \nPresident who doesn't seem to understand the gravity of the Nation's \nfiscal crisis.\n  When we start digging down into the budget the President proposed and \nlook into the Internal Revenue Service component of that budget, what \nwe see is the Internal Revenue Service is starting to focus in and \naudit ObamaCare. There is a glaring difference in the budget this year \nfrom previous years because of the President's new health spending law. \nThe IRS now has unprecedented power over health care in America.\n  In fact, when we take a look at this budget, and specifically the \nInternal Revenue Service's fiscal year 2012 budget request, over 250 \ntimes the Affordable Care Act--known in the budget as the ACA but known \nby people all across the country as ObamaCare--is mentioned. Over 250 \ntimes.\n  To me, the goal of the health care law has been to let people all \nacross this country get the care they need from the doctors they want \nat a price they can afford.\n  As a member of my party, looking at our economy, looking at the \ndeficit, looking at the incredible debt, what I think we need to do is \nmake it cheaper and easier to create private sector jobs in this \ncountry. That is the way we get the economy going again. But when I \nread this budget, and specifically IRS requests, it seems to me it is \nmaking it harder and more expensive to create private sector jobs in \nour country.\n  The people of this country are not taxed too little. The problem is \nthat the government spends too much. When I take a look at this budget, \nthat is exactly what I see being rejected by this administration \nbecause it seems this administration is more interested in taxing, in \nraising taxes, rather than cutting spending.\n  When you take a look at what the IRS says in the budget, it says:\n\n       The implementation of the Affordable Care Act of 2010 \n     presents a major challenge to the Internal Revenue Service.\n\n  This is the IRS talking about the law that was crammed down the \nthroats of the American people in the middle of the night, written \nbehind closed doors. We are all familiar with it. Now it is presenting \na major challenge to the Internal Revenue Service.\n  The Internal Revenue Service goes on to say:\n\n       This law represents the largest set of tax law changes in \n     more than 20 years, with more than 40 provisions that amend \n     the tax laws.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that the budget \ngives the IRS the ability to hire 5,000 new workers. After taking a \nclose look at the IRS's plans, we know they will have to hire over \n1,000 new IRS bureaucrats, Washington bureaucrats, to implement \nObamaCare measures. What are some of those that we are now going to \nhave IRS agents coming and looking into? One is the tanning tax, the \ncomponent that promotes compliance with the new excise tax on tanning \nfacilities. The IRS is requesting another $1.5 million and requesting \n81 more full-time equivalents to go ahead and implement this tanning \ntax. For oversight--they call it ``strengthen oversight of exempt \nhospitals.'' These are tax-exempt hospitals, hospitals that do not pay \ntaxes, but to do an oversight of these hospitals, they want another \n$9.9 million and another 84 full-time employees. For the new health \ncoverage information reporting, they want $34 million and 100 full-time \nemployees. For something I call ObamaCare 101--assisting taxpayers in \nunderstanding the new provisions--the IRS is requesting $22.2 million \nand hiring another 150 full-time equivalents. And then, of course, for \nthe call centers, IRS call centers--so if someone has a question, they \ncan call and ask a question--they want another $15 million because of \nthe complexity of this new health care law that is going to be \ndifficult for people to understand.\n  The American people and small business owners--and those are the job \ncreators of this country--want the IRS to make their lives easier, not \ntougher, not audit their health care choices and health care decisions. \nBut adding hundreds of new jobs and millions of new dollars to the IRS \nis not going to make health care better. It is not going to make care \nmore available for anyone.\n  I am going to continue to come to the floor with a doctor's second \nopinion to fight to repeal and replace this health care law and to do \nit with patient-centered reforms that help the private sector, not the \nIRS, create more jobs.\n  This morning, we had a little event called Wyoming Wednesdays where \npeople from Wyoming who are here come together in Senator Enzi's \noffice, and we have coffee and doughnuts and visit.\n  One of the people here from Wyoming said: I saw a sign that was \nworrisome.\n  I said: What is the sign?\n  He said that this location where they are putting in offices used to \nbe a parking lot. When you are replacing a parking lot with more \noffices for more Washington bureaucrats, that is not a good sign for \nthe rest of America.\n  Here we have the IRS saying they are dealing with a major challenge \nbecause of the health care law. It represents the largest tax law \nchange in more than 20 years. More than 40 provisions are being amended \nin the tax law to go after things. They want this kind of money to \nimplement the tax changes with regard to the indoor tanning services--\n81 new full-time equivalents--and they say what is involved in this. \nThe IRS says there are as many as 25,000 businesses that provide indoor \ntanning services they are now going to tax, including about 10,000 \nbusinesses that offer tanning services along with other services such \nas spas, health clubs, and beauty salons.\n  We are here in the Senate, in Congress, with 9 percent unemployment \nin this country, with people looking for work, and more government jobs \nare being created, and these people are creating government jobs to \nmake it harder on small businesses. It gets right to the crux of it \nright here because the IRS even says these entities, all these tanning \nentities, typically do not have experience filing Federal excise tax \nreturns. So what is the government going to do? Come in, make them file \nclaims and forms they do not have experience with. It is going to be \ncostly; it is\n\n[[Page S775]]\n\ngoing to take time; it is going to increase taxes. That is not a way to \ncreate new jobs.\n  They want 10 million more dollars to strengthen oversight on tax-\nexempt hospitals. These are tax-exempt hospitals. Why are the American \ntaxpayers being asked to pay another $10 million to hire 84 full-time \nequivalents to deal with tax-exempt hospitals? Because, according to \nthe law that was crammed down the throats of the American people, the \nIRS is now required to review at least every 3 years the benefit \nactivities of tax-exempt hospital organizations, which number about \n5,100 in this country. They actually say in the budget request by the \nIRS, as part of the President's budget that was submitted on Monday:\n\n       These are new requirements for tax-exempt hospitals which \n     include a majority of hospitals in the United States.\n\n  We are going to increase taxpayer dollars going for more IRS auditors \nand make it harder and more burdensome on the tax-exempt hospitals in \nterms of paperwork and what they need to do.\n  It goes on and on. That is why the American people are fed up with \nwhat is happening in Washington.\n  Let's talk a little bit about the CLASS Act because there is a whole \ncomponent of the budget wanting 30 staff members added to the health \ndepartment office overseeing implementation of what is called the CLASS \nAct. That stands for community living assistance services and supports.\n  The President's own debt commission--remember, the President \nappointed this commission about a year ago to say: Let's look into the \ndebt. People thought that was a bold move, a bipartisan move, a lot of \npeople coming together to take a look at this debt. For a year, the \nPresident said: We have a debt commission looking into this, so he did \nnot deal with the debt. Now that the debt commission came out with its \nreport in December, the President has mostly ignored it. Yet the debt \ncommission--it was bipartisan, chaired by Erskine Bowles, a former \nChief of Staff of the White House for Bill Clinton, and Al Simpson, a \nformer Senator from my State of Wyoming--came out, took a look at the \nhealth care law, and specifically honed in on this CLASS Act.\n  One of the Members of this Senate, a colleague on the opposite side \nof the aisle, someone who voted for the health care law, called it a \nPonzi scheme that Bernie Madoff would be proud of.\n  The President's budget commission, the bipartisan budget commission, \nlooked at it, and they have significant concerns about the \nsustainability of the program and called for the program to either be \nrepealed or reformed because it is not sustainable. They have raised \nconcerns. People on both sides of the aisle have raised concerns. Yet \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services has, in her budget, money \nfor 30 additional staff members added to the health department offices. \nWhy? To go over the details of this act that people say ought to be \nrepealed because, as it says, the details of the CLASS Act--they want \nto spend $93.5 million informing and educating people about the CLASS \nAct. I can tell them right now it is unsustainable, it is \nirresponsible, and it is something that should be repealed. Yet the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services wants to spend over $93 million \nof taxpayer money to inform and educate the public about this component \nof the health care law that people on both sides of the aisle think \nneeds to go away.\n\n  Finally, as someone who believes this health care law is bad for \npatients, bad for providers--the nurses and doctors who take care of \nthose patients--and bad for the taxpayers--what we saw in the \nPresident's budget that came out Monday, coming out for next year, is \nit is asking for over 1,000 new IRS agents to go ahead and implement \nthe various components and responsibilities that have been put on their \nheads by this health care law. This is only the beginning. The entire \nhealth care law does not really come fully into play until 2014. That \nis when Americans are going to have more IRS agents, more money being \nspent looking into their own personal lives, looking into what kind of \ninsurance they have.\n  Is it acceptable to the government? Is it government approved? That \nis why Senator Graham and I have introduced legislation called the \nState Health Care Choice Act, to let States decide. Let States decide \nif Washington ought to be telling the people in their States that they \nmust buy, that every individual must buy government-approved insurance. \nLet the States make that decision. Let the States opt out if they would \nlike. Let the States decide if all the businesses in their States must \nprovide government-approved insurance to their workers. Let the States \ndecide as to Medicaid, a program for low-income Americans which is \nbeing expanded significantly by cramming 16 million more Americans into \nMedicaid. Governors all across the country in a bipartisan way are \nsaying: Our States cannot afford this.\n  A New York Times story shows Jerry Brown from California and Andrew \nCuomo from New York complaining about the mandates Medicaid is putting \non their States, the additional burdens in terms of taxes and the \nmandates and what it is going to do to the people of the State who are \ntrying to educate their kids and the cost and the pressure on education \ndollars because they are getting shifted to Medicaid, the cost of \ndollars shifted away from public safety, from firefighters, police \nofficers, other public safety officers. As to this health care law, I \nthink people at the State level ought to decide that, no, we don't want \nthis to apply to us.\n  That is why I come today, again as a physician who practiced medicine \nin Wyoming for a quarter of a century, took care of thousands and \nthousands of patients and families, trying to help people get better, \nall in a way that now I think is being taken in the wrong direction by \nthis health care law, and why I think we want to continue to look for \nways to make sure people get the care they want from the doctors they \nneed at a price they can afford. The health care law that was passed by \nthis body fails in all of those respects, and now we see, with the \nPresident's budget, a request for money for another thousand IRS \nagents, not to help people get better, not to help people get the care \nthey need from a doctor they want at a cost they can afford--no, not at \nall--but to audit the health care of the American people.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Effects of the Recession\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise to briefly do three things. No. 1, \nthere are a lot of politicians and pundits and economists who are \nproclaiming all over the country that the recession is over. They have \nsome economic models by which they determine that the recession is \nover. I suggest those pundits and economists and politicians take a \nlook at the booklet we recently produced in my office. It is called \n``Struggling Through the Recession--Letters from Vermont.''\n  We have also received letters from other States, people in other \nStates as well. We sent out a request for people to tell us, as we \nenter the third year of this recession, what is happening in their \nlives. We got, from my small State, over 400 responses. That is a lot \nfrom a small State. We probably received an equal number from around \nthe rest of the country.\n  The problem I had with these letters, some of them are so painful to \nread that it is hard to read more than a few at a time because you get \nsick to your stomach hearing what good and decent and hard-working \npeople are going through.\n  I wish to take a few moments to read a handful of the letters I am \nreceiving from Vermont, in answer to the question: Is the recession \nover?\n  This comes from a young lady from central Vermont. She says:\n\n       I have been fortunate to hold onto my job throughout the \n     past 3 years, especially since I have about $42,000 remaining \n     on my school loans.\n\n  One of the recurring themes we hear from all over Vermont--and I \nsuspect it is true in New Mexico and all over the country--is a lot of \nyoung people are graduating with a heck of a lot of debt. The jobs they \nare getting are not sufficient, in terms of pay, to help them pay off \nthat debt.\n\n[[Page S776]]\n\n  She writes:\n\n       Anyway, what I want to write isn't about me--it's about my \n     boyfriend, a talented mechanical engineer that graduated with \n     about $80,000 in school loans.\n\n  We are telling the young people of this country: Go out and get an \neducation. They are coming out with huge loans, having a hard time \ngetting a job.\n\n       He was laid off in November 2009 and it has not only caused \n     financial hardship, but it has put all of our future plans on \n     hold. He fortunately has temporary employment now after \n     nearly a year of searching, but my qualm is with the high \n     cost of education and how people in their twenties are \n     supposed to move forward with their lives with school debt \n     lingering over them.\n\n  That is a very significant point.\n  Here is another one. This is a young man from Barre, VT, in the \ncentral part of the State.\n\n       In 2002, I received a scholarship to Saint Bonaventure \n     University, the first in my family to attend college. Upon \n     graduation in 2006, I was admitted to the Dickinson School of \n     Law at Penn State University and graduated in 2009 with \n     $150,000 of student debt.\n\n  That is not uncommon.\n\n       In Western New York I could find nothing better than a $10/\n     hour position stuffing envelopes.\n\n  Another example of a young person graduating from college, doing all \nthe right things, and yet ending up with very substantial debt.\n  That is from some of the younger people. Then we got letters from \nmiddle-aged people. This is from a woman from the central part of the \nState.\n\n       My husband lost his job in 2002 and has been self-employed \n     as a carpenter ever since due to the lack of jobs in central \n     Vermont.\n\n  I should tell you the recession has been less disastrous in Vermont \nthan in other parts of the country. These are stories from a State that \nhas not been hit as hard as other States.\n\n       He's had no insurance and we have not saved a cent since \n     2002. We've depleted our savings account paying for property \n     taxes. We've been burning wood to save money heating the \n     house. The cost of fuel for the house and vehicles puts a \n     huge burden on making ends meet. Being self-employed is \n     extremely challenging due to the economic situation.\n\n  Again, she is touching on an issue that millions of people are aware \nof. The price of gas to get to work is going up. The price of home \nheating fuel in States such as Vermont is going up. Wages are low for \nmillions of people. How do they survive in that crisis?\n  We also have stories from older people. This is from a woman named \nBeth, who lives in the northeastern part of our State, a very rural \npart of Vermont. She is 69 years of age. She writes:\n\n       I don't know what kind of a future my grand kids will have. \n     How will they be educated if we can't help them? It is great \n     there are loans out there for education but they are being \n     charged more for the schools than I paid for my house. They \n     will be in debt their whole lives.\n\n  Here is a woman who is worried about her grandchildren. Here is \nanother woman, Ellen, who lives in Rutland County.\n\n       All I can say is I still have a job for all it is worth. I \n     feel making $8.81 an hour at 17 hours per week is ridiculous!\n\n  This woman is 63 years of age.\n\n       I don't bring home enough to help out with the major \n     household expenses I used to pay half on. I'm lucky if my \n     paycheck reaches $130 a week. By the time I pay a few bills \n     gas up and pick up a few needed items I'm lucky if I have any \n     left for spending. I earned less than $8,000 this year. It \n     [is] just about what I made back in the 1970's and lived \n     better.\n\n  So the point here is, A, if folks tell you the recession is over, \nread some of these stories. These stories are available on my Web site: \n``Sanders.Senate.gov.'' These are mostly from Vermont, but I think they \ntouch the same themes that exist all over our country. For millions and \nmillions of people, not only those who are unemployed--those who are \nunderemployed, those who are working full time and not making a living \nwage--trust me, the recession is not over.\n  The reason I ask people to send me these letters is I think it is \nimportant as a Senate to understand we have to address these economic \nissues. When 16 percent of our people are either unemployed or \nunderemployed or have given up looking for work, when millions more are \nworking with inadequate wages, we cannot say we should not be \nvigorously going forward in creating millions and millions of jobs that \nour people desperately need.\n\n\n                            Social Security\n\n  I also want to say a word on Social Security. What I want to say is, \nI get very tired watching the TV or hearing some of my colleagues tell \nme that Social Security is going bankrupt, that Social Security will \nnot be there for our kids or that Social Security is part of the \nserious deficit and national debt problem we face. Let me say a few \nwords on that.\n  No. 1, Social Security has existed in this country for 75 years, and \nit has been an enormous success. We take it for granted. But for 75 \nyears, Social Security has paid out every nickel owed to every eligible \nAmerican in good times and bad. When Wall Street collapsed a few years \nago, millions of Americans lost all or part of their retirement savings \nwhen the stock market crashed. All over America, during the last 10, 20 \nyears, corporations that had promised defined benefit pension plans to \ntheir employees rescinded on that promise. People had worked for years, \nexpecting a pension from a company. That pension never came. Yet during \nall of that period, Social Security has paid out every nickel owed to \nevery eligible American at minimal administrative cost. That is a \npretty good record. Our job now is to make sure Social Security is \nstrong and vibrant 75 years from now and continues to do the excellent \njob it has done in the past 75 years.\n  People say: Social Security is going broke. Social Security is in \ncrisis. A lot of people believe that because they hear it over and \nover, and it is repeated in the media again, again, and again.\n  What are the facts? The facts are that not only is Social Security \nnot going broke, Social Security has a $2.6 trillion surplus--a $2.6 \ntrillion surplus--which, by the way, is going to go up before it goes \ndown.\n  Social Security, according to the Social Security Administration and \nthe Congressional Budget Office, can pay out every nickel owed to every \neligible American for the next 25, 26, 27 years, at which point it will \npay out between 75 and 80 percent of all of the benefits. The challenge \nwe face, therefore, is how, in 25 or 30 years, do we make up that 20 \npercent gap? That is the challenge.\n  So Social Security is strong and will pay out every benefit owed to \nevery eligible American for the next 25 or 30 years. People say: Oh, \nyeah, well, that is just worthless IOUs, that Social Security trust \nfund.\n  Absolutely not true. The U.S. Government, from the day of its \ninception, has paid its debt. Social Security is backed by the faith \nand credit of the United States of America. We have never yet--and I \ncertainly hope we never will--default on our debt.\n  So the first point I want to make is, Social Security is strong. \nSocial Security will pay out benefits for the next 26 years. For people \nto come forward and say we have to privatize Social Security, we have \nto raise the retirement age, we have to lower benefits, is absolutely \nwrong, to my mind. We made a promise to the American people regarding \nSocial Security, and that is a promise we have to keep.\n  In the dialog around Washington, people lump the very serious problem \nof a $1.5 trillion deficit and a $14 trillion national debt with Social \nSecurity. So let's ask a very simple question. How much has Social \nSecurity contributed to our national debt? How much? The answer is, not \none penny--not one penny--because Social Security is not paid out from \nthe U.S. Treasury. Social Security comes from the payroll taxes that \nworkers and employers contribute into the Social Security trust fund. \nThat trust fund today has a $2.6 trillion surplus. So when people say \nwe have a very significant national debt and, therefore, we have to cut \nSocial Security, that is absolutely a wrong thing to say.\n  Let me say, I will do everything I can to protect a program that has \nworked extremely well for the American people.\n  Why are we hearing all of this opposition against Social Security? \nWhere does it come from? It does not come from ordinary people. They \nknow Social Security has been successful, it is worth preserving, worth \nprotecting. By the way, as we all know, Social Security is not just \nthere for the elderly, the retirees; it is there for people with \ndisabilities; it is there for widows and orphans through the survivors \nfund.\n\n[[Page S777]]\n\nWhere is all of this opposition coming from?\n  It is coming from two places.\n  No. 1, it is coming from folks on Wall Street--from Wall Street--who \nare saying: Gee, we could make many billions of dollars if we ended the \nSocial Security system right now and Americans had to invest in \nretirement accounts on Wall Street. And we can make all kinds of \ncommissions doing that work.\n  That is one of the areas, one of the sources of the opposition to \nSocial Security.\n  Second is from many of my very conservative Republican friends. Very \nhonestly, they do not believe government should be playing a role in \nmaking sure elderly people have a secure and dignified retirement. They \ndo not believe much in government. They do not think government should \nbe playing a role in those areas, and they want to get government out \nof those areas.\n  I understand where they are coming from. It is an honest position. I \nstrongly disagree with them. I think in a civilized, democratic society \nwe have to make sure when you get old it has to be guaranteed--\nguaranteed--as it has been for 75 years, that you are going to get the \nhelp you need. I believe government should be playing that role.\n  I would remind you, Mr. President, before Social Security was \ndeveloped in the mid 1930s, 50 percent of the elderly people of our \ncountry at that point lived in poverty. Today, that number is too high, \nbut it is 10 percent--50 percent before Social Security; 10 percent \ntoday. That is a pretty good record.\n  So I would respectfully disagree with my Republican friends who say: \nWell, if people want a retirement account, let them invest in Wall \nStreet, let them do it through the private sector. I do not agree with \nthat. I think Social Security has worked well for 75 years. We have to \nmake sure it works well for another 75 years. I will do everything I \ncan as chairman of the new Defending Social Security Caucus to make \nthat happen.\n\n\n                     The Deficit and National Debt\n\n  The last point I want to make: I want to talk a little bit about the \ndeficit and our national debt.\n  I think it is appropriate for the American people to be reminded \nabout how we got into the very difficult situation we are in right now. \nI have to tell you, I find it a bit amusing that some of the \n``loudest'' deficit hawks in the Congress are precisely the same people \nwho helped drive up the deficit and the national debt--the same people.\n  Let's try to determine how we got into the recession.\n  No. 1, in the midst of a recession, by definition, less money is \ncoming in. That is obviously an important part of why we have the \ndeficit and the national debt we have today. But there are other \nfactors.\n  Mr. President, you will recall that this country, during the Bush \nadministration, began two wars--a war in Afghanistan, a war in Iraq. \nThe war in Iraq is estimated, by the time we take care of the last \nveteran, to run up a tag of about $3 trillion. Does anybody quite \nremember how we paid for those wars? Well, the answer is we did not pay \nfor those wars. Those wars were put on the credit card. President Bush \nsaid: We are going to go to war, but we do not have to worry about how \nwe pay for them.\n\n  The second area: As a result of President Bush's tax policies, which \nhave recently been extended, against my vote, in the Obama \nadministration, we provided many hundreds of billions of dollars in tax \nbreaks to millionaires and billionaires. The wealthiest people in this \ncountry are doing phenomenally well. The effective tax rate for the \nwealthiest people in this country is lower than at any time on record, \nin many cases lower than what working people are paying. Yet we \ndecided, against my vote, to give them hundreds of billions of dollars \nin tax breaks, driving up the deficit.\n  Congress voted, against my vote, to bail out Wall Street--unpaid for, \ndriving up the deficit. Some years ago, Congress, against my vote, \ndecided to pass an insurance company-written Medicare Part D \nprescription drug program--very expensive program, unpaid for.\n  So all of these things are unpaired for. The national debt goes up, \nthe deficit goes up. Then our Republican friends say: Oh, my goodness, \nwe have a very large deficit. What are we going to do? We are going to \nhave to cut back on programs that are important to working people and \nlower income people.\n  I think that is absolutely unacceptable.\n  So the first point I would make is, I regard it as incomprehensible \nthat there are folks who supported hundreds of billions of dollars in \ntax breaks for millionaires and billionaires and then they tell us they \nare concerned about the deficit and the national debt. That is absolute \nhypocrisy.\n  In my view, the Congress should not be about cutting back on programs \nfor low- and moderate-income people after we have given huge tax breaks \nto the wealthiest people in this country.\n  Second of all, I think the time is long overdue that we start ending \na lot of the corporate tax loopholes which now are preventing this \ncountry and this government from getting the revenue we need. Before we \ntalk about major cutbacks for our kids or for the elderly, maybe we \nshould end the absurdity of the tax havens that exist in the Cayman \nIslands and Bermuda, where the wealthiest people in this country and \nlarge corporations are stashing their money away, to the tune of about \n$100 billion a year--$100 billion a year--in taxes that are not being \npaid because of the tax havens that exist.\n  I would also argue it is somewhat absurd we have a situation where \nlast year ExxonMobil paid no Federal income taxes at all and got a $156 \nmillion rebate from the IRS, after earning $19 billion in profits.\n  What I would say is, yes, deficit and national debt are very \nimportant issues. But it is important for us to understand how we got \nto where we are. It is important for us to understand that the top 1 \npercent today earn more income than the bottom 50 percent and have \nenjoyed huge tax breaks. So before we start slashing programs the \nmiddle class and working families of this country need, let's take a \nlook at some of those issues as well.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Amendment No. 93, as Further Modified, to Amendment No. 7, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have a modification of my amendment \nat the desk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike out all after the word ``SEC'' and add the \n     following:\n\n     __.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have had sort of a dustup, I guess \nyou could say, in the Budget Committee yesterday with Mr. Lew from the \nOffice of Management and Budget and a very likable individual, but we \nhad a serious disagreement, a fundamental matter that I do not think \ncan be brushed over and needs to be confronted and settled. There is \nonly one way to settle it, I believe; that is, for Mr. Lew and the \nPresident to cease saying their budget does not add to the debt and \nsomehow changes the trajectory on which we are going.\n  Mr. Lew, on a Sunday morning program, said: ``Our budget will get us, \nover the next several years, to the point where we can look the \nAmerican people in the eye and say we're not adding to the debt \nanymore. . . . ''\n  ``Our budget will get us to the point where we can look the American \npeople in the eye and say we're not adding to the debt anymore; we are \nspending money that we have each year, and then we can work on bringing \ndown our national debt.''\n  That is my goal. I believe that is achievable. But it is clear this \nbudget does not do that.\n  Troubling, additionally, was the President, in his radio address \nSaturday, said the same thing. Then, again yesterday, while we were \nhaving this discussion, presumably at a similar time, the President \nsaid this: ``What my budget does is to put forward some tough choices, \nsome significant spending cuts so that by the middle of this decade \n[2015] our annual spending will match our annual revenues. . . . ''\n\n       Our annual spending will match our annual revenues. We will \n     not be adding more to the national debt.\n\n  That is an unequivocal statement. No matter what, it can have only \none meaning to American citizens who hear it, that his budget calls for \na situation in which our annual spending will match our annual revenues \nand we will not be adding to the national debt.\n  Those of us who have been wrestling with the budget know how hard it \nis. I believe we can achieve that in 10 years, but it is very hard. I \nhave to admit it. I wish it were not. The Presiding Officer is on the \nBudget Committee and he\n\n[[Page S779]]\n\nknows how hard that would be. It would be a heroic effort. I think we \ncan do it. I think the American people are ready to do it. But it is \nnot easy.\n  The President says that is what we are going to do and that is his \nplan. But, sadly, it is not correct. I asked Mr. Lew, was he not \nconcerned and was not this misleading to the American people who heard \nit. He refused to say his statement was misleading.\n  What does the budget do? These are the numbers in his budget, the \ndocument they presented to us, written by the White House, the \nPresident's budget he is required by law to submit to Congress. This is \nwhat happens to the debt. The quote up there again is: ``We will not be \nadding more to the national debt.''\n  We add more under his plan, to the national debt, every single year. \nThe numbers are stunning in size. They are consistent and, \nunfortunately, in the outer years of his 10-year budget, his numbers \nshow the annual debt--annual deficit increasing, not going down. So \nthis is what it amounts to in terms of total debt.\n  His plan, by his own budget that they submitted to us, would add, \nwithout dispute, $13 trillion in new debt, doubling it to $26 trillion. \nIt started out at $13 trillion; in 10 years, it doubles to $26 \ntrillion. How can this possibly be a position in which you will not be \nadding more to the debt? What world are we living in? What kind of \nfantastical accounting situation can occur that we can make such a \nstatement as that?\n  I am going to ask my colleagues in the Senate, any single one of them \nwho can defend this statement, I would like them to come down here and \ndo so. Otherwise we need to call on the President to be honest with the \nAmerican people. We have a serious debt crisis. To waltz out there in a \npress conference yesterday, to send out to speak on his radio program \nSaturday or to have his Budget Director on Sunday, and even at our \ncommittee hearing yesterday, insist that somehow they are not adding to \nthe debt is not a way to begin a dialog about how to confront the \nserious problems this country has. I have to say that.\n  I do not think it is a little bitty matter. I don't think it is \nsubject to gentlemen's disagreement. I don't think it is subject to \nanything other than black and white, yes and no. Is that an accurate \nstatement or not? It is not true. The debt is added to every year. In \nfact, President Bush was criticized for his deficits--and I think \nrightly so. The highest deficit he ever had was $450, $460 billion. The \nlowest deficit in the 10 years, by the President's own budget document \nhe sent to us, is over $600 billion--the lowest. It averages $720 \nbillion a year in added debt. This is why we are on a dangerous course.\n  The essence of what we are talking about is can we get off this wrong \nroad? Can we get on the road to prosperity? Can we get on the road to \nprogress that gets us out of the debt disaster area we are headed \ntoward?\n  Let me read a couple things because this is the real test of the \nbudget. We can argue over the finer details. But the question is, Can \nwe continue at the rate we are going? What I would say about the budget \nis that these numbers, this $13 trillion added debt, is what was being \npredicted before. According to the President, it would have been $14 \ntrillion. He has reduced it to $13 trillion, which is not enough \nchange, if it were to happen. But when the Congressional Budget Office \nindependently scores the President's budget, it is going to show he \ndoesn't have a $1.1 trillion reduction in spending--probably none. \nThere is probably no reduction in the debt.\n  What I am saying is, this budget keeps us on the course we were on. I \ndo not think that can be disputed. It does not alter the basic debt \ntotals each year from what has been projected, and those are the \nnumbers, the debt totals, that are unsustainable.\n  For example, in 2009, President Obama called the current deficit \nspending, on this basic trend, unsustainable--himself--and warned of \nskyrocketing interest rates for consumers if the United States \ncontinues to finance government by borrowing from other countries. This \nis Bloomberg:\n\n       ``We can't keep on just borrowing from China,'' Obama said \n     at a town-hall meeting at Rio Rancho, New Mexico, outside \n     Albuquerque. ``We have to pay interest on that debt, and that \n     means we are mortgaging our children's future. . . .''\n\n  That is correct.\n  Mr. Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, warned in \nJune of last year that ``the federal budget appears to be on an \nunsustainable path.''\n  Mr. Geithner, the Secretary of the Treasury, in February--actually \nFebruary 15--a couple days ago on ABC, said this--this is what the \nSecretary of Treasury said, Mr. Obama's Secretary:\n\n       Our deficits are too high. They are unsustainable, and left \n     unaddressed, these deficits will hurt economic growth and \n     make us weaker as a nation. . . . We have to restore fiscal \n     responsibility and go back to living within our means.\n\n  Peter Orszag, who was President Obama's Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, said that the CBO report--he said this in June \nof last summer:\n\n       . . . concludes that we are on an unsustainable fiscal \n     course. About this, there is no ambiguity.\n\n  We are on an ``unsustainable fiscal course,'' there is no doubt about \nit, said Mr. Orszag last summer.\n  What I would say to you is, the President's budget does not change \nthat direction and we have to change it. We have to be honest with the \nAmerican people that we are not changing it, that the President's plan \nis his plan for the future. He can change the numbers any way he wants \nto. He can change the trajectory we are on. It is a voluntary thing. \nThe numbers he put forth are his numbers, and they are a call for our \ncountry to follow his plan. That is not an acceptable plan. It is not \nan acceptable plan, and we have to change it.\n  Briefly, I will add this. The warnings that are out there--Alan \nGreenspan, our former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said in \nDecember that it is a little better than 50-50, but not much, that we \nwon't have a debt crisis in this country in 2 to 3 years.\n  Moody's, the organization most famous for rating government debt and \nprivate company debt--you know, AAA is the highest rating--Moody's, in \nDecember, sent a warning letter that, unless the United States changes \nits trajectory of debt, our debt could be downgraded from AAA in less \nthan 2 years.\n  The International Monetary Fund has said we have to reduce our \nstructural deficit more than Greece. They have to go to a 9-percent \nimprovement; we have to go to a 12-percent improvement. Only Japan, \nsays the International Monetary Fund, is worse off than we are and has \nto take stronger action.\n  So this budget is no action at all. It is no alteration of the \ntrajectory. It is unacceptable. As Congressman Ryan said, it is debt on \narrival.\n  We cannot pass this budget. It is unthinkable that we would. The \nAmerican people are ready for change. They are supporting Governors and \nmayors around the country who are making tough choices, bringing their \nStates and cities up to speed and being more effective. They are doing \nthat. These cities are not ceasing to exist.\n  We increased discretionary spending, nondefense discretionary \nspending, in the last 2 years under President Obama's leadership and \nthe Democratic majority in both Houses, 24 percent--12 percent a year, \non average. Well, at a 7-percent-a-year increase, the total budget \ndoubled in 10 years. I guess at 12 percent it will probably double in 6 \nor 7 years. This is the trend we are on. We have to come off of that. \nWe are going to have to reduce those numbers because we do not have the \nmoney.\n  But I will tell you, this economy has vibrancy. It is trying to come \nout of this recession. If we create some stability and permanence in \nour rules, eliminate unnecessary regulations, allow our energy prices \nto be competitive and create more American energy and all of the things \nthat make sense to bring down costs and increase productivity, bring \nthis debt under control, we will be surprised how strong we can bounce \nback. But this is not the path to do it. This is the unsustainable path \nthat can lead to danger. The closer we get to it, the more dangerous we \nare.\n  So I believe it is time to change course. Where we are going to go, I \njust cannot say. I am rather stunned that the President's budget--I did \nnot expect a very strong budget, but I expected one that would make a \nlot more progress than this. So I guess we are\n\n[[Page S780]]\n\nall befuddled right now what our choices will be. All of us have to \nwork at it, though, because the future of our country is at stake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, is there a pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The second-degree Hutchison amendment to the \nInhofe amendment is pending.\n  Mr. COBURN. Thank you. Let me confine my remarks for a few minutes to \nhow I see where we are from my perspective. My hope is that I can offer \nsome amendments, at least get them pending, and then discuss with the \nchairman--I just discussed them with the ranking member--the \ndisposition of those. I wonder whether the chairman has any comments on \nthat.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will be objecting to your amendments because you \nobjected to the pending amendments, and there will be no reason to add \nmore unless you lift your objection.\n  Mr. COBURN. I told them I would be happy----\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am very happy to listen to what you have to say.\n  Mr. COBURN. I told Senator Leahy last night that I would be happy to \nlift my objection once my amendments were pending, and we can have a \ndebate on his nongermane amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I think the order has to be reversed.\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, if the chairman will assure me I will have the \nopportunity to, No. 1, debate Senator Leahy's amendment----\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I cannot assure that at this point. We have not \narrived----\n  Mr. COBURN. Then I will continue with my objection.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If you have amendments you wish to offer--I think \nfive--I am constrained to object to them.\n  Mr. COBURN. It is interesting. We have a nongermane amendment that is \noutside the bounds of the Constitution, doing something that is not the \nrole of the Federal Government, that we are going to expand the cost at \na time when we are bankrupt, and five germane amendments that actually \nlower the cost of the airport improvement fund, actually help NextGen \nin terms of money, help preserve the airport trust fund, and we are not \ngoing to be allowed to bring them up? If that is the way we are going \nto operate, then you can count on me, knowing procedure around here, \nthat we will have a very difficult time moving ever to a Leahy \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I came to the floor to discuss what we are trying to \ndo and to be helpful in moving that along. I have now heard that I will \nnot be allowed to offer these amendments or at least bring them up. I \nam going to discuss each one of them, and I will object to any \nunanimous consent moving forward on any area until we have an \nopportunity, as is the Senate tradition, to have a debate and bring up \namendments. If we are not allowed to do that, then I am sure we are \ngoing to start going backward again.\n  Passing an FAA authorization bill, as the chairman and ranking member \nhave tried to do, is a significant priority for Congress. We have a \nsystem of air traffic control that needs to be modernized. We have \nmonies that we are putting forward to do that. We have not had the \noversight, according to the inspector general, that is necessary for \nthose programs.\n  In this bill, we have authorizations for moneys that are not \npriorities for this country at a time that we are facing a $1.6 \ntrillion deficit, we have an unemployment rate in excess of 9 percent, \nand interest rates that are going to rise in the future.\n  My amendments, which I am happy to have voted on and voted down, lead \nus to a path that secures and enhances the airport improvement fund and \nthe trust fund, makes common sense that 99 percent of the American \npeople would agree with, excludes Alaska because it is a totally \ndifferent animal when it comes to the Essential Air Service \nrequirements, and will, in fact, enhance the trust fund. So I am very \nsorry the chairman refuses to allow my amendments to come up, but I \nwill offer them and have him object in total.\n  What has to happen with every program in this country is that \nwasteful spending, low-priority spending, and duplicative spending has \nto be eliminated. Although I think the chairman and ranking member did \na fairly good job on this bill, there are areas where we can eliminate \nwasteful spending, there are areas where we can eliminate duplicative \nspending, and there are areas where we can say: This can't be a \npriority now given the financial fix in which we find ourselves.\n  During our current budget deficit, the revenues coming into the \nairport trust fund are lower than expected, and we have this very real \nneed on NextGen development. Congress has to limit somewhere and make a \npriority next year, and I think they have tried to go in that \ndirection, and these amendments will do such a thing.\n  The first amendment I would like to talk about is the airport \nimprovement Federal cost share reduction amendment. Across this \ncountry, we now have money being spent on low-priority projects in \nairports that have very little traffic or minimal traffic, and we are \nnot spending money on the airports for safety and for the airports in \nwhich we have the vast majority of traffic. We have seen one program in \nparticular where billions of dollars for low-priority projects have \nbeen spent.\n  I would just tell you, if we are ever going to get out of the jam we \nare in, some common sense has to be applied in that we cannot do \neverything everybody wants, and there is going to have to be some \nsacrifice in these areas.\n  The whole goal of this first amendment is to discourage low-priority, \nwasteful aviation projects that would not be funded by increasing the \nnon-Federal cost share to just 25 percent over 3 years. In other words, \nit is 5 percent now, and so it is 95 percent of the government's money, \nand all we do is, over 3 years, move it to where you have to pay 25 \npercent. It is going to discourage a lot of low-priority projects \nbecause the communities or the States have to have a greater \nparticipation.\n  There is no program in the Federal Government that has a grant \nprocess and a funding process where the Federal Government pays 95 \npercent other than this program--not one. So we are encouraging money \nto be wasted on low-priority projects by maintaining 95 percent Federal \nfunding. This gives us 3 years to adjust to 75 percent, which probably \nshould be 50 percent but 75 percent given our fiscal issues.\n  Nonprimary airports could initially have up to 90 percent of their \nairport improvement projects covered by the Federal Government. In \nrecent years, we raised that, under Public Law 108-176, to 95 percent. \nThis is 20 percent higher than the same cost share for other airports \nqualifying for this $4 billion program. It is $4 billion a year.\n  Lest you think I am too critical, let me give you some examples. Two \nflights a day--two flights a day, noncommercial flights, just two \nprivate flights a day--is the average for Kentucky's Williamsburg-\nWhitley County Airport. We spent $11 million there to build an airport \nwith a 5,500-foot lighted runway, a colonial-style terminal, and \nhundreds of acres for growth even though it does not have one airline \npassenger and averages two flights a day. Now, tell me, if you ask the \naverage American: Should we spend $11 million there or should we make \nsure we can take care of the kids who do not have what they need in \nthis country, should we spend $11 million there or not borrow another \n$11 million from the Chinese, should we spend $11 million there or \nshould we, in fact, make sure the airport trust fund has the money to \ndo high-priority projects, such as large airports or NextGen, which one \nwould the average American think we should do?\n  Lest you think I am picking on Kentucky, Halliburton Field in Duncan, \nOK, got $700,000 for a pilot room and a reception room. We are building \nfor private aviation with taxpayer money--a low priority. We are \nbuilding a nice pilot room and a reception room for the private pilots \nwho fly there. Now, tell me how that is a priority in our country \ntoday. That is my own State.\n  We are sending money down a hole because we refuse to make tough \nchoices. All this amendment does is say: Let's move it from 95 percent, \nover 3 years, to 75 percent so we do not get the lower priority \nprojects funded, because we are too generous with what\n\n[[Page S781]]\n\nthe Federal Government contributes. The chairman may not like it, but I \nwill bet you the average American thinks it is a pretty smart thing to \ndo given the state we are in.\n  All bets are off on the politics of this. I have never been \naccustomed to playing the politics of it at all, but there are just as \nmany people on the left who think we ought to cut spending as there are \non the right. America gets it. The only place that does not get it is \nhere. And this does not do anything except enhance what can be done for \nhigher priority issues within our aviation community. That is all it \ndoes. It is a small, simple step. And by rejecting or not allowing an \namendment such as this to come forward, what we are saying is that we \nare going to keep kicking the can down the road; we are not going to \npay attention to the American public. We are going to hide from the \nreality that is coming very soon for this country. We will not have any \nmoney to put into airport improvement programs. We will not have the \nmoney to fund a NextGen program. It will become a low-priority program \nunless we wake up and start doing what the rest of America recognizes \nwe have to do; that is, start living within our means.\n  The next amendment is an amendment that is a bipartisan amendment \nbetween the Senator from Alaska and myself.\n  It is an earmark rescission amendment. All it says is the earmarks \nthat have been out there, that the money hasn't been spent for over 9 \nyears, giving 1 year for the agencies to decide whether they think that \nis so, should be rescinded. It puts $500 million, a half a billion \ndollars at a minimum, back in the public Treasury. Why would we not \nwant to do that? We have $2.6 million sitting in Atlanta that can't be \nspent on anything except the 1996 Olympics. Why wouldn't we take back \nthat $2.6 million? It was earmarked. It didn't get spent. But it is \nsitting out there in a hole. We can reverse that. Estimates are we will \nsave a billion dollars. The conservative estimate at a minimum is $500 \nmillion. Yet we are not going to allow this amendment to be considered? \nIt makes no sense.\n  The next amendment calls on us to sacrifice a little bit. The \nEssential Air Service Program has multiple subsidies where people can \neasily drive 1 hour and 20 minutes and get to a regional airport that \ndoesn't require any subsidies. All this amendment does is move it to \n100 miles from where it is today, which is 70. It moves it to 100 miles \nand says if you are less than 100 miles, you ought not be eligible, \nsometimes to the tune of $4 or $500 per person per flight, to have a \nsubsidized flight when you could drive 70 minutes, 80 minutes, and have \naccess to a ton of flights.\n  Again, it is priority. Is it priority for us to continue to spend \nmoney on a small group of airports, 36, that in no way pay for \nthemselves, that are readily accessible throughout the country to major \nairports, and spend the kind of money we are spending?\n  Another amendment says if you have less than 10 emplanements a day, \nwe ought to think about whether we are subsidizing Essential Air \nService.\n  All these amendments are saying is, will we make the tough decisions. \nWe can't do everything we want to do. Is it nice that we have an \nEssential Air Service Program so some people don't have to drive an \nhour? I guess so. What are we willing to sacrifice to get our house in \norder? These are little bitty amendments that will send a wonderful \nsignal to the American public that we get it, we absolutely get it. And \nbecause we get it, we are going to make choices about priorities. We \nare going to enhance the airport trust fund. We are going to enhance \nthe airport improvement program because we are going to take lower \npriorities off the board, which is exactly what they want us to do. \nThey want us to focus on the big things, the important things, and they \nwant us to cut the spending that is not absolutely necessary.\n  I can tell my colleagues, it is not absolutely necessary that we \nsubsidize some of these smaller airports that are very close to \nregional airports or have less than 10 passengers a day. It is not \nabsolutely essential. Would we ask some Americans to sacrifice? Yes. \nBut do you know what will happen? We will all have to sacrifice before \nwe get through this. The problem is the resistance in this Chamber and \nin this city. We don't want to make the hard choices. It is \ndisappointing that we have not done that. We will have to do that. And \nwe are either going to do it or somebody from the outside is going to \ntell us what we are going to do.\n  Then a fifth amendment--and I know the chairman will be against this \namendment because it is his program that I am trying to eliminate--in \nthe year 2000, we created another program called the Small Community \nAir Services Program. This is an amendment to repeal that. It was \ngeared to help smaller communities enhance their air service in \naddition to Essential Air Service; in other words, make it more \neffective, to try to promote utilization, which is a good idea except \nit is not working. When we see the funds from this program, after the \ngrant is over, do you know what happens? The airlines leave. They don't \nstay. They leave. So we are kind of spending money in a market that \nwon't sustain what we are trying to put there, and then we are putting \nmore money on top of it to try to promote it. When it doesn't work, \nwhat happens? We lose the Essential Air Service anyhow. It has happened \nin Oklahoma.\n  In this day and time that we live, we have to have an FAA bill. We \ncan't continue to not have an FAA bill. Even if my amendments are voted \ndown, considering that they are going to get a vote, I will probably \nsupport this bill. But it should be noted that we haven't gone far \nenough. We haven't made all the tough choices we need to make. I am \nhighly disturbed that we take amendments that are absolutely germane \nand say they can't be offered because a time agreement, even though it \nhas been agreed to, isn't disagreed to yet because the Senator from \nVermont isn't on the floor.\n  I am going to offer the amendment and let the chairman object. Then I \nwill utilize the procedures that are available to me as a Member of the \nSenate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call \nup amendment No. 91.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. There is objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I would say to the Senator from Oklahoma, most of \nthe pending amendments which are now pending have been objected to from \nhis side of the aisle. I don't have any objection to looking at some of \nhis amendments and seeing if we can vote on them. But I can't do that \nright now. I obviously can't give him any kind of consent right now.\n  It is a difficult situation. It is a sort of rolling veto type of \nsituation. If objection is made, we can't have votes on amendments \nwhich are pending. I am willing to look at what he has suggested. As he \ntalked through some of them, they sort of stung pretty hard in my State \nof West Virginia, but I am willing to look at them. But I can't do that \nwithout consent from folks on my side. So for the time being, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chairman. I will go on and allow him to \nobject to further amendments I have so it will be in the Record that I \ndid attempt to offer them.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending amendment and call \nup amendment No. 80.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment and call up amendment No. 81.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 82 and \nset the pending amendment aside.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chairman for his words. I will take him at \nhis word and work with him and allow him to look at some of these. \nThere are only two airports in West Virginia that this would have an \nimpact on. Both of them are less than 75 miles from the regional \nairport. They both have minimal emplanements daily. They are\n\n[[Page S782]]\n\nover 10 but not far over that. The point is, we ought to help who we \ncan help, and it ought to make economic sense. They are not targeted \nbecause there are 36 airports in here, actually, where the average \nAmerican would say, this is nuts to spend the kind of money we are.\n  I thank him for the time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I rise today in order to \nspeak in support of the Essential Air Service Program and explain why \nthe program truly is essential, especially in rural States. In \nNebraska, our two largest airports are separated by only 63 miles in a \nState that covers 77,000 square miles.\n  This means that thousands of Nebraskans are hours away from a large \nor even medium-sized airport requiring them to drive several hours to \ntake a flight.\n  Due to these geographical barriers, many Nebraskans rely on Essential \nAir Service to keep themselves and their communities connected to the \nNation's transportation network.\n  In Nebraska, we have Essential Air Service airports in many \ncommunities including my hometown of McCook, Alliance, Chadron, Grand \nIsland, Kearney, North Platte, and Scottsbluff. Without the EAS \nProgram, you would see the many hours it already takes to get to any \ntype of air service increased significantly for people in rural areas.\n  The cost to travel on one of these EAS flights would become so cost-\nprohibitive that many would not even be able to afford to travel. And, \nquite frankly, there would probably be many cases where EAS airports \nwould struggle to exist.\n  But the EAS Program isn't simply about cutting hours off a driver's \ntime to make a flight. It is also about economic development in rural \nareas and job creation.\n  EAS promotes accessibility and growth in rural communities and in the \nsurrounding rural areas--and I have seen the impact air service can \nhave on a community's ability to attract employers firsthand.\n  When I was Governor of Nebraska, one of the first questions many \ncompanies would ask when they wanted to bring a manufacturing plant or \nwarehouse distribution complex to town would be what is the air service \nsituation in the area.\n  Because of these EAS airports, I could respond that the area provided \nan air service transportation option which gave these communities a job \ncreation recruiting edge. But don't just take my word for it. Listen to \nother Nebraskans who are saying the same things about how important the \nessential air program is to their communities.\n  For example, John Chizek, the mayor in Chadron, NE has said:\n\n       As the Mayor and lifetime resident of Chadron I believe it \n     is essential to continue support of the Essential Air Service \n     Program. As a community we are active in the recruitment of \n     new business. I firmly believe we have a unique atmosphere to \n     offer to businesses looking to move or expand. Our county was \n     recently identified as the poorest in the State and any \n     limitations place on us by reducing EAS support will only \n     hinder our hopes of growth.\n\n  Darwin Skelton, the airport director at Western Nebraska Regional \nAirport, has said:\n\n       Essential Air Service is very important to Western Nebraska \n     Regional Airport and Western Nebraska as a whole, without \n     this funding we would not have commercial air service to our \n     community. We have many businesses in this community that use \n     this airport (i.e. Aurora Loan Service, Vertex, Regional West \n     Medical Center, Twin City Development, just to name a few).\n       When they are told of this plight, I am sure you will be \n     receiving letters of support from many businesses/\n     organizations from around the area . . . small, more rural \n     markets need air service to grow and maintain connections \n     with larger hubs and doing away with Essential Air Service \n     would be saying to rural America that they are not valued as \n     an important part of air service in the United States.\n\n  Kyle Pothoff, public works director for the city of McCook, said:\n\n       Having access to commercial air service is critical to the \n     economic stability of communities like McCook and without \n     this service it would make recruiting new businesses very \n     difficult.\n       A statement that I have recently heard is that economic \n     development does not come by bus or train, it comes by air. \n     This statement could not be more true.\n\n  Finally, Dave Glenn, CEO of Pathology Services in North Platte, said:\n\n       With the economy finally showing signs of improvement, loss \n     of EAS funding for airports like North Platte (LBF) would be \n     disastrous. Pathology Services, P.C. serves 18 hospitals and \n     over 50 clinics in Central and Western Nebraska, Northwest \n     Kansas, and Northeast Colorado. To provide the Medicare \n     required pathologist services, we rely on using our general \n     aviation plane based at the North Platte airport.\n       Our hospital has also recently started a medical helicopter \n     service which helps meet the health care needs of patients. \n     Without EAS funding our business and the health of our \n     citizens would be negatively impacted.\n\n  I am well aware that the Essential Air Service does have its critics \nwho are concerned about providing government funding support to keep \nair service in rural America. Certainly a review of all government \nsupported programs to find efficiencies and ways we can make a program \nrun better and spend less I am always open to. But to simply try and \neliminate the Essential Air Service Program which is a driver of \neconomic activity in my State, as you can clearly see from these \nNebraskans' stories, is the wrong approach. Essential Air Service truly \nis essential to rural Nebraska and rural America and why I oppose any \nefforts to eliminate this important program.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today, with my colleagues, Senator \nCollins, Coburn, and Brown of Massachusetts to discuss an amendment to \nthe S. 223, the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety \nImprovement Act. Currently this bill contains language which adjusts \nfor inflation the personal net worth cap in the Small Business \nAdministration's 8(a) program. This would expand the net worth level \nestablished by the SBA in 1989 from $750,000 to approximately $1.4 \nmillion. Our amendment aims to strike that language from the bill.\n  In March of 2010, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, issued a \nreport detailing extensive fraud within the 8(a) program. The report \nrevealed that 14 ineligible firms received $325 million in sole-source \nand set-aside contracts even though these firms were not eligible for \nthe 8(a) program. As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I take very seriously our committee's \nresponsibility of vigorous oversight and am concerned with efforts to \nexpand the SBA's 8(a) program when these issues have not been fully \nvetted through the regular order in the Small Business Committee. \nMoreover, there has not been a hearing to examine the GAO reports of \nfraud.\n  The SBA's 8(a) program is designed to help socially and economically \ndisadvantaged small businesses gain access to Federal contracting \nopportunities. I support these goals and applaud the Federal Government \nfor consistently meeting the goal for small disadvantaged businesses. \nHowever, I am deeply troubled by the program's current vulnerabilities \nto fraud and abuse which results in legitimate firms being excluded in \nfavor of bad actors who have infiltrated the program. This is not a \npartisan issue. I recently sent a letter along with SBC Chair Mary \nLandrieu to Administrator Mills' where we stated unequivocally that our \nfirst priority in the 112th Congress is to ensure the SBA is taking the \nrequisite steps to purge the contracting programs of any and all fraud \nand abuse.\n  When calculating an individual's net worth, the SBA currently \nexcludes the value of their primary residence and the equity in the \n8(a) company. The language contained in the FAA bill would result in \nallowing potential multimillionaires to be considered economically \ndisadvantaged. Therefore, I wonder about the further effects this \nchange would have on the program. I question whether expanding the net \nworth would result in crowding out of business owners with \nsignificantly lower net worth. Additionally, I worry lower income \nindividuals would be at a disadvantage competing with those with \nsubstantially more resources.\n  In light of all these concerns, I fear the current net worth \nexpansion is\n\n[[Page S783]]\n\nfraught with unintended consequences and ignores the recent reports of \nfraud in the 8(a) program. I urge my colleagues to support the Snowe-\nCollins-Coburn-Brown amendment to strike this language.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest clerk proceeded to call the \nroll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been working through this bill. I \ncongratulate our manager, Senator Rockefeller, who is one of the most \nexperienced people in the Senate and is a good manager. He has worked \nwell with Senator Hutchison, comanager of the bill. We have made \nsignificant progress. We have a few amendments on which we are trying \nto work a way to the end of this. I hope we can work out an agreement \nto complete this legislation maybe as early as tomorrow morning \nsometime. If we can't, the first cloture vote is tomorrow, and we will \nsee what happens after that.\n  Everyone should understand. It is Wednesday. Tomorrow is Thursday. I \nknow a lot of people have arrangements because we have a home work \nperiod the following week. We want to go home, if at all possible, late \ntomorrow night or early Friday morning, but we can't do that if there \nis work left to be done on this bill. I hope we can work something out \nso we can finish tomorrow. It would certainly be doable.\n  We know what we have left. Work on the different issues has been \nextremely difficult and time-consuming, but we have settled most \neverything on the Senate floor, as we are supposed to do.\n  There will be no more rollcall votes tonight. We hope we can move \nforward to complete work on this most important piece of legislation \ntomorrow. This legislation is extremely important for our country.\n  Let's keep in mind, this deals with people. Almost 300,000 jobs will \nbe created or saved with this legislation. I repeat what I have said on \nthe Senate floor once before. McCarran Airport in Las Vegas is the \nsixth busiest airport in the country. The manager of that airport, \nRandy Walker, when asked about this bill last week, said: If it passes, \nwe will finally be able to stop using World War II technology to land \nand have airplanes take off.\n  It is not just McCarran in Las Vegas. At every airport in the country \nit is the same thing, World War II technology. We will be able to have \na passengers' bill of rights. It is a very fine piece of legislation \nthat has been years in the making. We are too close to the end of this \nto walk away. We have to finish this bill. It means jobs, real jobs, \nnot make believe jobs.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/16/senate-section/article/S783-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

LANG\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am proud, for many reasons, that I am a \ngraduate of Swarthmore College. But among those reasons is the fact \nthat as a graduate of Swarthmore, I am in the same company as Eugene \nLang, a 1938 graduate of the college. Few if any of our school's many \ndistinguished graduates have matched Gene Lang's ability and \ndetermination to use his talents in the service of his fellow man.\n  If his resume consisted only of his extraordinarily successful \nbusiness career, Gene would be an admirable figure. As founder of REFAC \nTechnology Development Corporation, in more than a half a century of \nwork, he has helped foster innovation, particularly in manufacturing, \nby helping American inventors and entrepreneurs profit from their \nideas.\n  But what he has done with the earnings from that business is truly \nremarkable.\n  In 1981, Gene paid a visit to P.S. 121, the Harlem elementary school \nhe had attended as a boy. He was going to speak to a group of sixth \ngraders preparing to move on to middle school. Before his speech, he \nspoke with the principal, who told him that three out of every four of \nthe students he would address would never finish high school.\n  To a man who entered college at the age of 14 and had an advanced \nbusiness degree by his 20th birthday, this was unacceptable. And so he \ntold the students that day: Education has allowed me to follow my \ndreams, and it can do the same for you too. He promised each and every \nstudent that day that if they would work hard, stay in school and\n\n[[Page S788]]\n\ngraduate from high school, he would pay their way to college.\n  Gene's promise became the ``I Have a Dream'' Foundation, and it did \nnot just benefit the 61 students he addressed that day. It inspired \nsimilar promises all over the world, more than 200 now, where others \nwho have enjoyed the benefits of education have followed Gene's example \nand invested in bringing those benefits to others. In my own State, the \nKalamazoo Promise, a pledge by a small group of anonymous donors to \ngive every Kalamazoo public school student a chance at a college \neducation, is just one example of the kinds of programs Gene has \ninspired.\n  That is not all. Determined to connect America's universities more \nclosely to the societies they serve, in 2001 he founded Project \nPericles, which provides funding for more than 20 U.S. colleges and \nuniversities to help them include social responsibility and citizenship \nin their curricula. His donations to Swarthmore, Columbia, the New \nSchool University and other institutions have made him one of higher \neducation's most important benefactors. President Clinton honored him \nin 1996 with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n  This weekend Swarthmore will honor Gene with a celebration of his \nlife and work. Fittingly, this won't just be a celebratory dinner. It \nwill also be a search for answers, for solutions on how to solve \nproblems and improve our society. Symposia will focus on the role of \nsocial responsibility in education and on the link between social \nchange and the arts.\n  I want to add my voice to those honoring Eugene Lang this weekend at \nSwarthmore. Thousands of American students have achieved their dreams \nthanks in part to his dedication, persistence and effectiveness. \nSwarthmore pride in Eugene Lang will be on display this weekend. This \nSwarthmorean is proud to call him my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/16/senate-section/article/S788-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING REPRESENTATIVE HOWARD POLLOCK\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Howard Pollock, \nan Alaskan political pioneer. I am saddened to report that \nRepresentative Pollock, a true Alaskan spirit and a greatly respected \npublic servant, passed away at the age of 90 in Coronado, CA, on \nJanuary 9, 2011.\n  Twenty-eight members of Howard's family were by his side during his \nfinal moments. Like all who knew and loved Howard, they will remember \nhim as both a family man and a fighter for Alaska's best interests. He \nis respected by the people of my home State for his dedicated service \nduring territorial days, his leadership in Juneau in the early days of \nAlaska's statehood, and for his continued service in Washington, DC, \nand other parts of the world. Howard recognized and valued Alaska's \nuntilled potential and true grit spirit, and it was that very spirit \nthat drew him north to Alaska as a young man.\n  Howard Pollock was born in Chicago on April 11, 1920. As a boy he \ngrew up in New Orleans, and he won a Mississippi State boxing title in \njunior college. When World War II broke out, he answered his country's \ncall to duty, enlisted as a Navy seaman, and served overseas.\n  On Easter Sunday in 1944, a grenade exploded during a training \nexercise and Howard lost his right forearm. This tragedy would be a \nsetback for most, but it didn't slow Howard down one bit. He continued \nto rise through the ranks and retired in 1946 as a lieutenant \ncommander. This prestigious rank was quite fitting for his \ndistinguished career.\n  After the war Howard and his first wife Maryanne Passmore Pollock \nbegan their trek north to the territory of Alaska on the recently built \nAlaska-Canadian highway. Howard and Maryanne built a cabin and made \ntheir home on 80 wild acres of land south of Anchorage, nothing like \nthe Anchorage we know today.\n  Alaska quickly became Howard's pride and focus. He juggled school and \npolitics and earned a law degree from the University of Houston and a \nmaster's degree from MIT. And it wasn't long before he again answered \nthe call to service. His official entrance into politics began when a \nfriend dared him to run for mayor of Anchorage. Although he lost that \nrace, he would stay involved in the affairs of Alaska--from then on.\n  Howard's dedication and involvement quickly earned him a seat at the \ntable with the other young movers and shakers of those infamous years \nleading up to statehood. Teaming up with a passionate group of \nAlaskans, including a young Ted Stevens, they worked tirelessly to gain \nstatehood and built upon what little infrastructure Alaska had at that \ntime.\n  Howard also held office--both elected and appointed--for a number of \nyears. He was elected to the territorial legislature in 1955 and served \nas a State senator for 5 years. In 1966, he became Alaska's sole \nCongressman, ably serving the Nation's largest State. He served in the \nU.S. House of Representatives until 1970. He would go on to serve as \ndeputy director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nand, following that, served as part of the American delegation to the \nLaw of the Sea Conference. Also, Howard proudly served as the National \nRifle Association president.\n  Despite his demanding public commitments, Howard never forgot how to \nhave fun. After losing his arm in the war, he taught himself how to \nshoot left handed and enjoyed hunting. He loved fishing for marlin and \ntraveling the world. He earned a black belt in Tae Kwon Do at the age \nof 75--the epitome of a man who was ``young at heart.'' If Howard's \nlove of the Last Frontier didn't emulate the pioneer spirit enough \nalready, his hobbies certainly did.\n  Howard Pollock made a difference not only in Alaskan politics, but \nalso in the lives of Alaskans. He helped set a foundation that has \nallowed Alaska to become the greatest State in our Union. Last month, \nthe Pollock family lost a loving father and husband. Alaskans lost a \npioneer and a leader--a man who always fought for them. And our Nation \nlost a dedicated servant who had served with great distinction, first \nin World War II and ultimately in a public career that spanned several \ndecades.\n  On behalf of all Alaskans, I extend my prayers and deepest sympathies \nto Howard's five children, his nine grandchildren, his family and \nfriends, most particularly his companion Marina Goodenough, and all who \nknew and loved him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/16/senate-section/article/S788-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S788-S789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ATTACKS IN HUNGARY AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, as co-chairman of the U.S. Helsinki \nCommission, I wanted to bring to the Senate's attention that next week, \nFebruary 23, will mark a tragic anniversary. Two years ago on that \ndate, assassins gathered outside the home of Robert Csorba. They threw \na Molotov cocktail into the house. Although some family members escaped \nthe blaze, five-year-old Robert Csorba and his father did not: as they \ntried to flee the flames, their attackers riddled them with bullets. \nThe murderers were prepared: if the bomb did not finish them off, their \nguns would. They were prepared to kill men, women, and children.\n  The Csorbas were just two of the victims in a wave of racially \nmotivated attacks against Roma that has roiled Hungary. According to \nthe European Roma Rights Center, between January 2008 and July 2010 \nthere were at least two dozen cases where Molotov cocktails, hand \ngrenades or sniper fire were used. The victims included nine \nfatalities, including two children, and others who were seriously \ninjured.\n  Among them was the 13-year-old daughter of Maria Balogh. Ms. Balogh \nwas murdered when snipers shot into her home in the middle of the night \non August 3, 2009, killing her and leaving her daughter an orphan. Her \ndaughter was also grievously wounded: she was shot in the face, blinded \nin one eye, and maimed for life. It is no wonder that these attacks led \none Romani activist to declare that Roma would need to arm themselves \nor flee, and another asserted that if these attacks continued, Hungary \nwould be headed toward civil war.\n  There are some positive developments. The fatal attacks have stopped. \nHungary's new government has reached out to the victims to provide \nsupport for rebuilding homes that were damaged or destroyed in arson \nattacks.\n\n[[Page S789]]\n\nHungary's new Minister for Social Inclusion, Zolton Balog, has \ndemonstrated a rare and welcome compassion for his Romani fellow \ncitizens.\n  But the wounded and the dead still wait for justice in Hungary. \nAlthough four men have been arrested on suspicion of carrying out the \nserial killings of Roma that occurred in 2008 and 2009, there have been \nno trials and no convictions.\n  The Czech Republic has also seen a dramatic rise in anti-Roma \nrhetoric and violent actions in the past few years. Last October, I \njoined Helsinki Commission cochairman, Alcee Hastings in welcoming the \nlengthy sentences handed down in the Czech Republic to four neo-Nazis \nwho firebombed a Romani home in 2009, an act which left an infant, \nwidely known simply as ``Baby Natalka,'' with second and third degree \nburns over 80 percent of her body and a lifetime of painful \nrehabilitation ahead of her.\n  When that judgment was handed down against the four men who \nfirebombed Baby Natalka, I was heartened. I also said I was watching \nanother Czech case--one that is largely unknown.\n  On November 8, 2008, a roving mob attacked several Roma in the town \nof Havirov. One teenager was so savagely beaten, he was effectively \nleft for dead. For a prolonged period of time afterwards, he was in a \ncoma, and when he regained consciousness, he was unable to talk. \nAlthough he has learned to speak again, he has suffered permanent brain \ndamage. He is paralyzed, was forced to end his studies, and may never \nbe able to work.\n  A decision in the case is expected to be announced in the Ostrava \nregional court at 8:30 a.m. on February 24. Behind the high profile \nmurder cases of Roma that make their way into the news, there is an \neven larger number of cases involving Roma who have been attacked, but \nnot fatally; they do not die but are maimed, disabled, and traumatized \nfor life by the racially motivated violence they have encountered. \nTheir stories are often never told, but each of them stands as a living \nmonument to everyone in their families and everyone in their \ncommunities, testifying to the government's failure to protect them. \nEach of them deserves justice, including Jaroslav Horvath, the teenager \nattacked in Havirov.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/16/senate-section/article/S789-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   REMEMBERING CLARENCE MITCHELL, JR.\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and pay \ntribute to a fellow Marylander and civil rights champion, the late \nClarence Mitchell, Jr., as we approach the 100th anniversary of his \nbirthday. Clarence Mitchell was the chief lobbyist for the National \nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, NAACP, from 1950 to \n1979. He worked alongside the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and \nNAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall to secure rights and opportunities for \nAfrican Americans.\n  Clarence Mitchell had faith. He believed in America's promise and in \nthe democratic process. He believed that the will of the people could \nbecome the law of the land, and he believed that equality could be \nchampioned without bitterness. He dedicated his life to turning the \ndisappointment and anger of the African-American community into \npolitical action. He understood that it was possible to take what was \nunjust and make it just.\n  Clarence Mitchell walked the Halls of Congress, lobbying friends and \nfoes to set the wheels of justice in motion. He was quietly forceful as \nhe worked tirelessly to pass comprehensive civil rights laws, including \nthe 1957 Civil Rights Act, the 1960 Civil Rights Act, the 1964 Civil \nRights Act, the 1965 Civil Rights Act, and the 1968 Fair Housing Act. \nIn fact, his near constant presence in the Senate earned him the \nnickname the ``101st Senator.'' Former Majority Leader Howard Baker \nremarked, ``In those days, Clarence Mitchell was called the 101st \nSenator, but those of us who served here then knew full well that this \nmagnificent lion in the lobby was a great deal more influential than \nmost of us with seats in the Chamber.''\n  Clarence Mitchell's extraordinary achievements have shaped our lives \nand our country to this day. In 1980, President Carter appropriately \nawarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. On the centennial of his \nbirth, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the late Clarence \nMitchell, Jr., and recognize the enormous impact his life's work has \nhad on our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/16/senate-section/article/S789-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SNELL LABORATORY'S 100TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, it is with the greatest pleasure \nthat today I honor Snell Prosthetic & Orthotic Laboratory on their \ncelebration of 100 years in business. Started in Little Rock, Snell \nLaboratory has grown from its earliest years and now has nine offices \nacross the State of Arkansas.\n  Originally called Snell's Limbs and Braces, the company was founded \nby R. W. ``Pop'' Snell in 1911. With a mission and desire to provide \nthe best possible care to his patients, Pop began handcrafting each \ncustom-fitted artificial limb out of rawhide and red willow. Through \nboth World Wars, the business continued to blossom as standards and \npractices evolved from the company's earliest days. Both the fields of \nprosthetics and orthotics have revolutionized since Pop opened his \ndoors 100 years ago, and his company continues to be at the forefront \nof this industry.\n  Frank Snell, a great-nephew of the original founder, continues the \nfamily commitment to restoring the highest mobility and function to \npatients as the company's current president. With his eye on the \nfuture, Frank moved the company to its current Little Rock location in \n1986 and began the expansion across the rest of the State. With more \noffices, Snell Laboratory was able to expand while providing high-\nquality customer service to more Arkansas communities.\n  Snell's commitment to the community extends beyond working in the \noffice. Snell employees frequently donate their time to such worthy \norganizations as Easter Seals Arkansas, the American Diabetes \nAssociation, and the Baptist Health Foundation. Efforts by Snell \nemployees landed the company the 2008 Arkansas Community Foundation \nCorporate Philanthropy Award. As the company continues to evolve, I \nknow it will continue demonstrating a strong commitment to service in \nArkansas both in and out of the office.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating Snell \nProsthetic & Orthotic Laboratory on its 100th anniversary and in \nwishing the company another 100 years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/16/senate-section/article/S789-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S789-S790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING SAUNDERS BROTHERS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as we have heard time and time \nagain, the American manufacturing sector is struggling. Manufacturers \nface a whole host of challenges, from oppressive regulations to \nincreased energy costs to foreign competition. Indeed, it has been \npredicted that China will surpass the United States in 2011 as the \nworld's biggest manufacturing nation in terms of output. In Maine, wood \nproducts manufacturers have been particularly harmed by the effects of \nunfair competition from overseas countries. Indeed, only three American \nfactories still manufacture wooden dowels, which are often used to join \npieces of furniture. When one of those factories that operated in my \nhome State was shuttered last year, a group of Maine investors stepped \nforward to restart operations and provide economic opportunity to the \nregion. Today I wish to recognize that company--Saunders Brothers--and \nthe individuals who made the purchase of the firm.\n  Saunders Brothers was founded in 1900 by siblings Harry and Arthur, \nwho built the small woodworking operation from the ground up, making \nwooden dowels. When the original mill in North Waterford burned down in \n1916, the brothers moved their operation to Westbrook, near Maine's \nlargest city of Portland, and finally settled at the present-day site \nin the western Maine community of Locke Mills, a small village in the \ntown of Greenwood. Its recognizable smokestack is a local landmark, and \nits doors have welcomes hundreds of workers over the years.\n  However, with the calamitous economy, the owners were simply unable \nto\n\n[[Page S790]]\n\nkeep the doors opens, and the facility was forced to close last spring, \nleaving 55 employees without jobs. Yet just a few months later, \ninvestors Louise Jonaitis and Steve LaFreniere purchased the mill for \n$450,000 at a foreclosure auction, and have begun the process of re-\nemploying some of those who lost their jobs. In September, they \nreopened the factory's doors and began operating the rolling pin line, \nwith seven employees. The owners are also looking at ways to make the \nplant more energy efficient as well as examine which products and \nprocesses will make the factory most successful for years to come. For \ninstance, Saunders Brothers also makes a number of other wood products, \nincluding rolling pins sold by companies like Williams Sonoma, in hopes \nof becoming ``the Rolling Pin Capital of New England.''\n  Furthermore, Ms. Jonaitis and Mr. LaFreniere have purchased a number \nof mills across the State during these tough economic times, seeking to \nbring economic prosperity to Maine's struggling mill towns. Mr. \nLaFreniere has noted that ``Our goal is to keep them from being torn \ndown during these hard times so when the economy recovers, they can \nmake a profit and be successful again.'' This unbridled optimism is a \nhallmark of America's entrepreneurial spirit, and I thank them for \ntheir actions.\n  The United States of America is a resilient nation. We know there \nwill always be tough times, but we can never shake the notion that our \nbest days are still ahead of us. That belief is what makes the actions \nof Louise Jonaitis and Steve LaFreniere so laudable. I sincerely wish \neveryone at Saunders Brothers much success as they continue their \nmiraculous recovery in support of the company's motto, ``Let's Get \nMaine Rolling.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/16/senate-section/article/S790-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/16/senate-section/article/S790-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/16/senate-section/article/S790-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:06 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Chiappardi, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhas agreed to the following concurrent resolution:\n\n       H.

On or about December 17, 2008, the Plans \n     adopted a Terrorism Country Divestments Compliance Policy \n     (the ``Policy'') adopting the processes as required by the \n     Arizona Terrorism Country Divestment Act.\n       Pursuant to the Policy, the Plans are required to submit a \n     report (``Report'') that includes a copy of the List and an \n     explanation of any planned or actual divestments made \n     pursuant to its Policy to the Governor of Arizona, President \n     of the Arizona Senate, Speaker of the Arizona House of \n     Representatives, the President of the U.S. Senate and Speaker \n     of the U.S. House of Representatives, the Director of the \n     Department of Administration, the Arizona Treasurer, and the \n     Arizona State Retirement System. See A.R.S. Sec. 35-392(C).\n       With respect to the List prepared by or on behalf of the \n     Plans as of December 15, 2010, there were no companies \n     appearing on the List and therefore, no formal List was \n     prepared. In addition, since no companies appeared on the \n     List divestment is not applicable and no formal Report is \n     enclosed.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n        Crapo, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Risch, Mr. Graham, Mr. Rubio, Mr. \n        Blunt, Mrs.

A bill to reduce the deficit by establishing discretionary \nspending caps for non-security spending; to the Committee on the \nBudget.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are trying to resolve one of the great \nproblems I am sure my colleagues are sensitive to; that is, the \ninfrastructure of this country. Today we have two witnesses next to \neach other, the head of the AFL-CIO and the head of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, to show that liberals, conservatives, labor, and industry all \nfeel this should be at least the second highest priority in America.\n  When I heard the President's budget yesterday and I looked at it, I \nshook my head in disbelief: $8.7 trillion in new spending, $1.6 \ntrillion in new taxes--all these things. I remembered back when I was \ncomplaining in 1996 at this very podium during the Clinton \nadministration. That was his budget. It was $1.5 trillion. Do my \ncolleagues know that the deficit in this President's budget is greater \nthan the entire budget of 1996--to run this whole thing called America. \nIt was a shocker to me. It reminded me about how people talk about \nentitlements and how we are going to have to do something with that.\n  Something we can do right now is something I tried to do last year \nand the House Members are trying to do right now. When the President \ngave his message, he talked about how he was going to freeze nondefense \ndiscretionary spending and everyone applauded, thinking that was a \ngreat austerity program. In reality, he is talking about after he has \nincreased it from 2008 levels to 2010 levels and then freezing in those \nincreases. That is what I find unreasonable.\n  So I am reintroducing S. 360--I have a whole lot of cosponsors--to \nwind back the discretionary spending to 2008 levels and then freeze it \nat 2008 levels.\n  I will just tell you, briefly, what the bill does. It reduces the \nnonsecurity spending to 2008 levels and will hold it there for 5 years \nthrough 2016. After that, spending will be allowed to increase with the \nCPI of inflation between 2017 and 2021. The amount of money saved by \nthis in that period of time would be over $1 trillion.\n  If I can put up the chart. This chart shows what is going to happen \nif we don't do that. The red is what is projected in the President's \nbudget; the blue is what is projected if we are successful in doing \nthis. I am very proud the House of Representatives Republicans in their \nbudget have included my bill I introduced last year and that I am \nreintroducing today as S. 360 as part of their budget. I think it is \nresponsible. We will be looking forward to getting cosponsors.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. Collins:\n  S. 361. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax relief for small businesses, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Americans are resilient. Throughout our \nNation's history, we have stood up to every challenge and we have stood \ntogether. At this moment in history, we face the challenge of \nrecovering from the worst economic recession since the Great \nDepression. Through no fault of their own, too many Americans have lost \ntheir jobs and continue to struggle to find work in this tough economy. \nPutting Americans back to work is the key to economic recovery and must \nbe the No. 1 goal for this Congress.\n  Today, I offer my own seven-point plan to help us reach that goal. \nThis jobs plan recognizes that small businesses are America's job \ncreators and, thus, our efforts must be targeted toward helping small \nbusinesses start up, grow, and prosper.\n  In Maine alone, we have 141,000 small businesses. During the past \ndecade, America's small firms have created about 70 percent of all new \njobs. But far too often Congress directs Federal policies and attention \ntoward those businesses deemed too big to fail. Instead, we must \nredirect our efforts toward those small businesses that are too \nentrepreneurial to ignore.\n  The plan I am introducing today is based on extensive conversations I \nhave had with small business owners and workers throughout the State of \nMaine. It also represents a great deal of hard work by my staff.\n  While each State has its own particular opportunities and challenges, \nthe fundamentals of a jobs-oriented economic recovery are similar \neverywhere. As I illustrate my seven-point plan with examples from my \nhome State of Maine, I believe the Presiding Officer and my colleagues \nwill recognize similarities in their own home States.\n  First, my plan to build a 21st century economy begins with building a \n21st century workforce. America's greatest asset is its people. \nEnsuring that American workers get the education and job training they \nneed to compete in an increasingly global economy must be a top \npriority.\n  My plan amends the Workforce Investment Act to place special emphasis \non job training programs that assist our manufacturing industry. I am \ntired of seeing so many manufacturing jobs leave my State and our \nNation to go overseas. It is important we have a strategy to work with \nmanufacturers, to work with local community colleges and universities \nto develop the manufacturing base curriculum, job training\n\n[[Page S794]]\n\nprograms, and research opportunities to ensure this generation and the \nnext have the education and skills for the jobs of today and tomorrow. \nSome of those manufacturing jobs are gone forever. But others are \ncoming online, and America must lead and Congress must support targeted \nfunding to help provide the resources for this education and training.\n  In addition, we must provide workforce development assistance to \nthose communities harmed as a direct consequence of the closure or \nrealignment of military installations.\n  For example, the State of Maine is expected to lose more than 6,500 \nmilitary and civilian jobs following the decisions made by the Base \nRealignment and Closure Commission in 2005. We are losing the Brunswick \nNaval Air Station in our State. There are many other States, including \nIllinois, Missouri, and New Jersey that are facing similar losses. In \nVirginia, nearly 40,000 jobs will be lost. In such cases where \ndecisions made at the Federal level directly affect local employment, \nwe have a special obligation to make sure displaced workers have the \ntraining and education they need to find new employment in their \ncommunities. After all, these communities have structured their \neconomies to support military operations for decades, in many cases. \nNow that that lynchpin of the local economy is being pulled out, surely \nwe have an obligation to help with the adjustment. My plan would \nredirect Economic Development Administration funds--EDA resources--to \nthose communities most harmed by these decisions.\n  Targeted Federal funds can also be a catalyst for new economic \nopportunities. For example, I worked to secure one-time funding for a \nradiologic technician training program at a Maine community college. \nThis program had broad support from local hospitals and from the \ncollege, but they simply couldn't afford the expensive equipment to get \nthe program under way. With that one-time Federal investment, the \nprogram is now completely self-sustaining, and it produces between 18 \nand 20 graduates a year. Job placement has been 100 percent, with \ngraduates earning starting salaries of about $40,000 a year. I am sure \nsimilar targeted job training success stories can be found in every \nState, and we ought to build on them.\n  We must also fix what has not worked as well as it should. Government \nagencies must provide more efficient and productive services to the \nAmerican people. The Department of Labor, for example, should reduce \npaperwork and redtape associated with Federal job training programs. \nThe Department should identify ways it could cut costs by working more \nclosely with other government entities, such as the Department of \nEducation, and with the private sector. The best programs I have seen \nat community colleges, for example, combine some job training funds \nwith commitments from private employers to hire the graduates and to \nhelp shape those job training programs so we are training people for \nthe jobs that exist or that are going to exist.\n  The second part of my plan would encourage innovation in Maine's \nnatural resource-based economy. Nowhere is there greater potential than \nin energy. I want the United States to lead the world in developing \nrenewable energy technologies, and that is going to require significant \nprivate and public investments to develop this technology and to make \nits deployment affordable. For example, deepwater offshore wind has \nenormous potential to help us meet our Nation's electricity needs, and \nit presents an exciting opportunity to create thousands of much needed, \ngood-paying, and sustainable green jobs. Estimates show that the \ndevelopment of just 5 gigawatts of offshore wind off the coast of \nMaine--and that is just a fraction of the overall potential--could \npower more than 1 million homes, attract $20 billion of investment, and \ncreate more than 15,000 green energy jobs that would be sustained over \n30 years.\n  Deepwater offshore wind is the key transformative technology that \nAmerica needs in order to compete globally. Europe, China, Japan--our \ntechnology competitors--continue to make far larger investments in \noffshore wind R than we do. I am proud of the work of the University \nof Maine and the DeepCwind Consortium private sector investment to \ndeploy loading wind turbines, which would be the first of its kind in \nthe world, placing the United States in a position to lead in deepwater \noffshore wind technology.\n  Federal investments in programs to spur the advancement of deepwater \noffshore wind is an investment in America's future. Federal and State \nseed funding is expected to yield up to $4 billion in private sector \ninvestment over the next 10 years in Maine alone. With these \ninvestments, Maine is well positioned to be a global leader in this \npromising source of alternative energy. We must not lose these jobs to \nChina, as has increasingly occurred with solar technology. Let's not \nlet it happen with deepwater offshore wind technology.\n  We must also do more to promote agricultural exports. I know this is \nan issue of great interest to the Presiding Officer. In Maine, \nblueberries, potatoes, and lobster help create and sustain jobs in our \nState. Every $1 billion in agricultural exports supports 12,000 jobs. \nTherefore, increasing exports of our agricultural products could play \nan important role in reviving our economy. Boosting support for the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Services will help \npromote our homegrown natural products abroad. This effort to increase \nagricultural exports could be paid for by strengthening our effort to \ncurtail wasteful agricultural subsidies, such as payments to very \nwealthy corporate farmers who, frankly, do not need Federal assistance.\n  The corn-based ethanol tax break is another example of an \nextraordinarily expensive subsidy, costing taxpayers some $6 billion \nannually, and which has produced a host of problems from higher grain \nprices to impaired engine performance. We must reevaluate all programs \nthat have not performed as promised and then reallocate their funding \nto job-creation initiatives and to deficit reduction.\n  Third, we simply must do more to encourage job creation and \ninvestment by small business. My plan includes a series of tax reform \nproposals targeted at these engines of job growth. The tax package \nagreed to by Congress and the President in December included a 2-\npercent cut in the employee portion of the payroll tax, but no cut was \nprovided for the employer portion of the payroll tax.\n  With unemployment stuck above 9 percent for 21 consecutive months, we \nmust do more to encourage businesses to hire. When I talk to small \nbusinesses, they tell me this is something we can do that would \ndirectly reduce the cost of hiring and encourage them to bring on more \nworkers. My proposal includes a 2-percent reduction of the employer \nportion of the payroll tax on the first $50,000 of payroll for 1 year. \nThis reduction in the employer portion of the payroll tax is estimated \nto lead to the creation of 1.4 million jobs. This will work.\n  As with the employee-side payroll tax relief we passed in December, \nmy proposal would require the Treasury to reimburse the Social Security \ntrust fund using general revenues. Again, the cost of this payroll tax \nrelief can be offset by eliminating the ethanol and other wasteful \nsubsidies and by implementing budget cuts for discretionary spending.\n  There are other provisions in my bill that are targeted toward small \nbusinesses. For example, section 179 is a provision of the Tax Code \nthat small businesses have found to be very helpful. It allows them to \nimmediately expense equipment purchases rather than depreciate those \npurchases over many years.\n  I also propose making permanent the tax provision allowing \nrestaurants to depreciate equipment over 15 years rather than 39\\1/2\\ \nyears. Think about it. If a restaurant is only renovating once every 40 \nyears, that is not going to be very feasible or attractive to its \npatrons.\n  The plan would also reduce the depreciation periods on commercial and \nresidential buildings to 15 years to encourage investment and jump-\nstart the economy. We did that back in 1981, and it worked.\n  My fourth point is one that some small business owners, I know, would \nput at the very top of the list of what we should do; that is, we need \nto reduce the redtape that ties them in knots. Let me provide an \nillustration.\n  We need to make sure Federal regulations do not impose an unnecessary\n\n[[Page S795]]\n\nburden on job creation. The EPA has proposed a new regulation known as \nthe boiler MACT. This rule, as originally proposed, could cost Maine \nbusinesses $640 million to comply with, despite the fact there are less \ncostly approaches to deal with boiler emissions. It also has Federal \nagencies working at cross-purposes. Here we have the Department of \nEnergy trying to encourage the conversion to biomass boilers at the \nsame time the EPA is putting burdensome new regulations on them.\n  The result in Maine was the Department of Energy awarded one Maine \nhigh school a $300,000 grant to help buy a new wood pellet boiler to \nreduce the school's use of fossil fuels. But because EPA's proposed \nregulations would have greatly increased the cost of that boiler, the \nschool board ended up turning down the grant. This is an example of \nwhere the right hand did not know what the left was doing.\n  My point is that Federal agencies should take into account the impact \non small businesses and job growth before imposing new rules. Thus, my \nplan contains several provisions to help reduce onerous regulations and \ncut redtape.\n  First, it requires Federal agencies to analyze the indirect costs of \nregulations, such as the impact on job creation, the cost of energy, \nand consumer prices.\n  Second, it obligates Federal agencies to comply with public notice \nand comment requirements and prohibits them from circumventing these \nrequirements by issuing unofficial rules as ``guidance documents.''\n  Third, it creates a mechanism to protect small businesses from \nonerous penalties the very first time they fail to comply with a \npaperwork requirement as long as no harm comes from that failure. If it \nis an honest, first-time mistake that causes no harm, why do we want to \nslap that small business with a heavy fine? That does not make sense.\n  The fifth point in my plan is aimed at our transportation policies. \nGetting raw materials to the factory or farm and finished products to \nmarket quickly, efficiently, and safely must be a priority. But the \ninconsistent and inequitable Federal policy on truck weight limits on \ninterstate highways provides a telling example of where we are doing \nthe opposite. The consequences are particularly acute in Maine.\n  I have spoken on this issue many times, so I am going to briefly \ndescribe it. Maine's businesses and trucking firms are currently at a \ncompetitive disadvantage because Federal law prohibits the heaviest \ntrucks from using Federal interstates and instead diverts them to \ndowntown streets and secondary roads. This means, for example, that \nnearly 260 miles of nonturnpike interstates that are the major economic \ncorridors in my State are off-limits. Yet these same trucks are \npermitted on many Federal interstates in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, \nparts of New York State, and neighboring provinces in Canada. That \nmakes Maine and Vermont an island of noncompetitiveness. It just does \nnot make sense. The heaviest trucks belong on the roads built for them.\n  In 2009, I authored a law to establish a 1-year pilot project to \nallow trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds to travel on Maine's Federal \ninterstates. This project was an enormous success. It helped to \npreserve and create jobs because it allowed our businesses to be more \nefficient. It lowered fuel costs. It resulted in fewer carbon \nemissions, and it made our roads safer. Working with Senator Leahy, I \nam trying to make this permanent.\n  Point No. 6: We must invest in America's future. Research and \ndevelopment investment is critical to the breakthroughs we need to keep \nour economy competitive and to create good-paying jobs. The R tax \ncredit provides an important incentive, but it needs to be updated so \nmore companies can benefit from it. And there needs to be more \ncertainty. Just having that tax credit from year to year discourages \nthe kind of long-range planning and investment companies need. My plan \nincludes a 5-year extension of the R tax credit. That is likely to \nhappen, but by doing it year by year we create all these disincentives \nfor investment.\n  Finally, the seventh point in my plan would help expand opportunities \nfor small businesses and farmers to do business with the Federal \nGovernment. We need to help our small businesses, our farmers tap into \nmarkets they have not previously explored. As the former head of the \nNew England Small Business Administration, I know how essential this \ndrive for new markets is for job creation and for our economy.\n  One approach we are going to take is my Washington and State offices \nare going to redouble their efforts to help small businesses reach the \nFederal Government because the Federal Government is the largest \nconsumer of goods and services in our country. I know that disturbs a \nlot of Americans right now, and it shows the size of the Federal \nGovernment. The fact is, the Federal Government purchased more than \n$535 billion worth of goods and services in this past fiscal year. Some \n23 percent of that spending is directed to small businesses, and last \nyear the value of Federal contracts to small businesses in my State \nalone was more than $250 million. If we can expand the opportunity for \nsmall businesses to do business with the Federal Government, that is a \nbrandnew market for their products and services.\n  Last year, along with my colleague, Senator Snowe, and in conjunction \nwith the Department of Defense Northeast Regional Council and the Maine \nProcurement Technical Assistance Center, I sponsored a small business \nmatchmaker conference that brought together government agencies and \nprime contractors with our small business community to match up the \npurchasing needs with goods and services. It was a 3-day conference in \nsouth Portland. It was a tremendous success. We had about 385 small \nbusiness owners and representatives from 135 government agencies and \nprime contractors looking to subcontract work meet face to face, sit \ndown, exchange ideas.\n  Let me give an example of a successful connection that was made. A \nrepresentative of a $2 billion aerospace company sat across the table \nfrom the owner of a 40-employee Maine machine shop with experience in \nvery high quality, high-end custom work. That first meeting led to a \nsignificant business relationship that continues to grow.\n  I note that at our conference in south Portland, our total number of \nregistrants was 597 people, and that just shows how eager our small \nbusinesses are to expand their customer base.\n  One great benefit of the matchmaker approach is instead of a small \nbusiness working for weeks or even months to try to find the right \nperson in the vast government bureaucracy or the right prime \ncontractor, our entrepreneurs merely need to sit down across the table \nwith them. It is direct, effective, and efficient.\n  But, obviously, it is not easy to do business with Uncle Sam. The \nrules and regulations are often strict, cumbersome, and unfamiliar. \nThat is where our offices can help.\n  My plan also calls for Congress to work harder to open the Federal \nmarketplace beyond the Washington beltway to entrepreneurs in every \nState. That will benefit our job creators and the American taxpayer \nbecause there will be more competition.\n  The struggling economy has challenged our Nation's entrepreneurial \nspirit, but that spirit remains strong in Maine, in your State of New \nYork, Madam President, and across the Nation. We will recover from this \ndeep recession, but the recovery depends on the right policies in \nWashington to encourage the innovative and bold job creators of \nAmerica. That means helping our small businesses start up, grow, \nprosper, sustain, and create good jobs.\n  My seven-point jobs plan offers a straightforward path forward for \nCongress to lead rather than impede job creation at this critical \njuncture in our history and in our recovery.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Small Business &\n\n\n                                     Entrepreneurship Council,\n\n                                    Oakton, VA, February 16, 2011.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The Small Business & Entrepreneurship \n     Council (SBE Council) and its members across the nation \n     appreciate and support your proposed ``Seven Point Plan for \n     Growing Jobs Act.''\n       As you are aware, entrepreneurs, small businesses and the \n     overall economy have been suffering due to uncertainty and \n     rising\n\n[[Page S796]]\n\n     costs when it comes to federal tax and regulatory measures. \n     Your legislation's sections on small business tax relief and \n     regulatory reform thankfully would provide some relief and \n     clarity.\n       For example, making permanent the expanded expensing levels \n     for capital expenditures made by small businesses would be a \n     plus for investment, creating jobs, and boosting incomes.\n       In addition, the repeal of the 1099 reporting requirements \n     included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act--\n     i.e., that businesses must issue 1099 forms to all vendors \n     for goods purchased exceeding $600--would remove a big, \n     looming paperwork burden for the small business community.\n       In addition, the measures to improve upon the federal \n     government's regulatory process are most welcome, including \n     the requirement that agencies submit a cost-benefit analysis \n     for each significant regulation, that this process be open \n     and more transparent to the public, and that small businesses \n     be given opportunities to seek waivers of penalties for \n     first-time, non-harmful paperwork violations.\n       These are positive tax and regulatory reforms that will \n     help small businesses in their ongoing struggles to deal with \n     the otherwise mounting burdens from government.\n       Thank you for your leadership Senator Collins. SBE Council \n     looks forward to working with you to ensure this important \n     legislation is advanced into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Karen Kerrigan,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 16, 2011.\n     Senator Susan Collins,\n      Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Federation \n     of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's leading small \n     business organization, I am writing in support of the Seven \n     Point Plan for Growing Jobs Act. Your bill would help to \n     support a small business recovery by addressing two of their \n     most important problems--taxes and regulations.\n       Small businesses account for about two-thirds of the net \n     new jobs created, but they continue to struggle. The most \n     recent monthly NFIB Small Business Economic Trends (SBET) \n     Survey, found that small business confidence was up slightly, \n     but still below prerecession levels and not improving fast \n     enough to support meaningful job creation. While sales \n     continues to be the number one problem facing small business, \n     second and third in the survey are taxes and regulations.\n       The Seven Point Plan for Growing Jobs Act provides both \n     short-term and long-term tax relief for small business. \n     First, the bill would build on last year's payroll tax cut \n     for employees by providing an equal reduction in the portion \n     of the payroll tax paid by employers. Payroll tax relief will \n     help to reduce the cost of hiring, making it less expensive \n     for small businesses to retain and add new workers.\n       Over the last few years, capital expenditures have been at \n     or near an all-time low in the SBET survey. To address this, \n     the bill includes permanent investment incentives that will \n     help small businesses cover the cost of new investments as \n     they recover from the recession. Specifically, the bill would \n     make permanent the increased and expanded section 179 \n     expensing provision and shorter depreciation periods for \n     business properties such as restaurants and retail spaces, as \n     well as commercial buildings.\n       The proposal would also repeal the expanded 1099 reporting \n     requirements included in the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act (PPACA), reducing the tax-filing burden \n     on small businesses. Based on an NFIB Small Business Survey, \n     tax paperwork is already the most expensive paperwork burden \n     placed on small business by the federal government and the \n     new 1099 requirements would increase this cost dramatically.\n       The Seven Point Plan for Jobs Act also provides important \n     regulatory reforms for small businesses. It allows for a \n     reduction or waiver of penalties on small businesses the \n     first time the business makes a non-harmful mistake on \n     paperwork. Because the paperwork burden often falls on the \n     small business owner--and because small businesses do not \n     have dedicated compliance staff--this relief for innocent \n     mistakes is most welcome.\n       The bill also provides agencies the ability to better \n     analyze both direct and indirect costs and benefits, which \n     will give the public more accurate information on the \n     economic impact of proposed rulemakings. In addition, the \n     bill requires agencies to treat guidance documents for \n     significant rules as the enforceable standards they are. With \n     this measure, small businesses and the public will have a \n     greater input on these important documents.\n       Again, thank you for introducing this important \n     legislation, which will help small business and support a \n     meaningful economic recovery and job creation. We look \n     forward to working with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Susan Eckerly,\n                             Senior Vice President, Public Policy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 372. A bill the ability of terrorists, spies, criminals, and other \nmalicious actors to compromise, disrupt, damage, and destroy computer \nnetworks, critical infrastructure, and key resources, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the Internet has had a profound impact on \nthe daily lives of millions of Americans by enhancing communications, \ncommerce, education and socialization between and among persons \nregardless of their location. Internationally, we have seen the \ntransformative power of the Internet in places like Egypt. A free and \nopen Internet gives strength and a voice to people worldwide and should \nbe protected from censorship and other forms of suppression. But the \nInternet and those who engage in communications and commerce across \ncyberspace must be safe--protected from predators like criminals, \nterrorists and spies who wish to exploit or compromise information and \nsystems connected to the Internet. Our Nation is vulnerable to such \nattacks, but working together, in partnership with the private sector, \nwe can find a balance that keeps information flowing freely while \nkeeping us all safe from harm.\n  I have been focusing on cybersecurity issues for quite some time. \nMore than a year ago, as the former chairman of the Terrorism and \nHomeland Security Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, I chaired a \nSubcommittee hearing titled ``Cybersecurity: Preventing Terrorist \nAttacks and Protecting Privacy in Cyberspace.'' The hearing included \nwitnesses from key federal agencies responsible for cybersecurity, as \nwell as representatives of the private sector. We reviewed governmental \nand private sector efforts to prevent a terrorist cyber attack that \ncould cripple large sectors of our government, economy, and essential \nservices.\n  The cybersecurity expertise that I have developed has convinced me \nthat the Government and the private sector can and should work together \nto protect the American people in cyberspace. As a result, I am \nreintroducing the Cybersecurity and Internet Safety Standards Act, \nCISSA. This bill, which is cosponsored by Senator Whitehouse, will \nrequire the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the \nAttorney General, the Secretary of Commerce, and the Director of \nNational Intelligence, to conduct an analysis to determine the costs \nand benefits of requiring internet service providers and others to \ndevelop and enforce minimum voluntary or mandatory cybersecurity and \nInternet safety standards. Under this bill, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity will be required to report to Congress within one year with \nspecific recommendations. Cybersecurity must be a top priority. This \nbill will help secure our nation's digital future by keeping the \nAmerican people and our cyber infrastructure safe without hampering the \nfreedoms inherently found in an open and accessible Internet.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 372\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cybersecurity and Internet \n     Safety Standards Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Computers.--Except as otherwise specifically provided, \n     the term ``computers'' means computers and other devices that \n     connect to the Internet.\n       (2) Providers.--The term ``providers'' means Internet \n     service providers, communications service providers, \n     electronic messaging providers, electronic mail providers, \n     and other persons who provide a service or capability to \n     enable computers to connect to the Internet.\n       (3) Secretary.--Except as otherwise specifically provided, \n     the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) While the Internet has had a profound impact on the \n     daily lives of the people of the United States by enhancing \n     communications, commerce, education, and socialization \n     between and among persons regardless of their location, \n     computers may be used, exploited, and compromised by \n     terrorists, criminals, spies, and other malicious actors, \n     and, therefore, computers pose a risk to computer networks, \n     critical infrastructure, and\n\n[[Page S797]]\n\n     key resources in the United States. Indeed, users of \n     computers are generally unaware that their computers may be \n     used, exploited, and compromised by others with spam, \n     viruses, and other malicious software and agents.\n       (2) Since computer networks, critical infrastructure, and \n     key resources of the United States are at risk of being \n     compromised, disrupted, damaged, or destroyed by terrorists, \n     criminals, spies, and other malicious actors who use \n     computers, cybersecurity and Internet safety is an urgent \n     homeland security issue that needs to be addressed by \n     providers, technology companies, and persons who use \n     computers.\n       (3) The Government and the private sector need to work \n     together to develop and enforce minimum voluntary or \n     mandatory cybersecurity and Internet safety standards for \n     users of computers to prevent terrorists, criminals, spies, \n     and other malicious actors from compromising, disrupting, \n     damaging, or destroying the computer networks, critical \n     infrastructure, and key resources of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 4. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Analysis.--The Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of \n     Commerce, and the Director of National Intelligence, shall \n     conduct an analysis to determine the costs and benefits of \n     requiring providers to develop and enforce voluntary or \n     mandatory minimum cybersecurity and Internet safety standards \n     for users of computers to prevent terrorists, criminals, \n     spies, and other malicious actors from compromising, \n     disrupting, damaging, or destroying computer networks, \n     critical infrastructure, and key resources.\n       (b) Factors.--In conducting the analysis required by \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider--\n       (1) all relevant factors, including the effect that the \n     development and enforcement of minimum voluntary or mandatory \n     cybersecurity and Internet safety standards may have on \n     homeland security, the global economy, innovation, individual \n     liberty, and privacy; and\n       (2) any legal impediments that may exist to the \n     implementation of such standards.\n\n     SEC. 5. CONSULTATION.\n\n       In conducting the analysis required by section 4, the \n     Secretary shall consult with the Attorney General, the \n     Secretary of Commerce, the Director of National Intelligence, \n     the Federal Communications Commission, and relevant \n     stakeholders in the Government and the private sector, \n     including the academic community, groups, or other \n     institutions, that have scientific and technical expertise \n     related to standards for computer networks, critical \n     infrastructure, or key resources.\n\n     SEC. 6. REPORT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress a final report on the \n     results of the analysis required by section 4. Such report \n     shall include the consensus recommendations, if any, for \n     minimum voluntary or mandatory cybersecurity and Internet \n     safety standards that should be developed and enforced for \n     users of computers to prevent terrorists, criminals, spies, \n     and other malicious actors from compromising, disrupting, \n     damaging, or destroying computer networks, critical \n     infrastructure, and key resources.\n       (b) Appropriate Committees of Congress.--In this section, \n     the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means--\n       (1) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n     the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, \n     and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee on \n     Homeland Security, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the \n     Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of \n     Representatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Inouye, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 373. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nprohibit the marketing of authorized generic drugs; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, \nSenators Shaheen, Leahy, Inouye, Stabenow, and Schumer, to reintroduce \nan important piece of legislation, the Fair Prescription Drug \nCompetition Act. Our legislation eliminates one of the most prominent \nloopholes that brand name drug companies use to limit consumer access \nto lower-cost generic drugs; it ends the marketing of so-called \n``authorized generic'' drugs during the 180-day exclusivity period that \nCongress designed to provide specific incentives to true generics to \nenter the market.\n  An authorized generic drug is a brand name prescription drug produced \nby the same brand manufacturer on the same manufacturing lines, yet \nrepackaged as a generic. Some argue that authorized generic drugs are \ncheaper than brand name drugs and, therefore, benefit consumers. \nHowever, authorized generics only serve to reduce generic competition, \nextend brand monopolies, and lead to higher health care costs for \nconsumers over the long-term.\n  After up to 20 years of holding a patent for a brand name drug--the \nbrand-name manufacturer--which has already been handsomely rewarded for \nits investment--doesn't want to let go of its profits. So, it \nrepackages the drug and refers to it as a generic in order to extend \nits market share, while cutting in half the financial incentive for an \nindependent generic to enter the marketplace. This is a huge problem \nand one that is becoming even more prevalent as patents on some of the \nbest-selling brand name pharmaceuticals expire.\n  In 1984, Congress passed the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nRestoration Act, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to provide consumers \ngreater access to lower-cost generic drugs. The intent of this law was \nto improve generic competition, while preserving the ability of brand \nname manufacturers to discover and market new and innovative products. \nSpecifically, the Hatch-Waxman Act provided for a 180-day marketing \nexclusivity period for the first generic firm that successfully \nchallenges a brand-name patent under the Abbreviated New Drug \nApplication, ANDA, process--thereby providing a crucial incentive for \ngeneric drug companies to enter the market and make prescription drugs \nmore affordable for consumers.\n  Filing a patent challenge is expensive and requires enormous up-front \ncosts for the generic company. Yet, the 180-day exclusivity incentive \nto launch a patent challenge is being widely undermined by authorized \ngenerics. According to one account, since 2004, ``authorized generic \nversions have appeared for nearly all drugs with expiring U.S. \npatents.'' And, because authorized generics are still allowed, an \nindependent generic can get all the way to the end of a patent \nchallenge--even winning in court--but still lose the anticipated reward \nof 180-day market exclusivity because the brand-name company can, and \ndoes, launch an authorized generic. The fact that the brand-name \ncompany can launch an authorized generic even if it loses a patent \nchallenge to a generic company gives it an incentive to pursue multiple \nadditional patents on dubious grounds, just for the sake of extending \nits market share. The fact remains that brand-name firms regularly \nintroduce authorized generics on the eve of generic competition, \nfurther extending their hold on the market and chilling competition \nfrom independent generic drugs.\n  Every American agrees on the need to reduce health care costs. Today, \ngeneric medications comprise 69 percent of all prescriptions in this \ncountry, yet only 16 percent of all dollars spent on prescriptions. \nFurthermore, in 2007, the average retail price of a generic \nprescription drug was $34.34, compared to the $119.51 average retail \nprice of a brand name prescription drug. In fact, generic drugs save \nconsumers an estimated $8 billion to $10 billion a year at retail \npharmacies. For working families, these savings can make a huge \ndifference, particularly during difficult economic times.\n  Passage of the Fair Prescription Drug Competition Act would \nrevitalize and protect the true intent of the 180-day marketing \nexclusivity period created in the Hatch-Waxman Act. This bill does just \nthat by eliminating the authorized generics loophole, protecting the \nintegrity of the 180-day exclusivity period, and improving consumer \naccess to lower-cost generic drugs.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this timely and important piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/16/senate-section/article/S797-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S797-S798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 55--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR DESIGNATION OF A ``WELCOME \n                      HOME VIETNAM VETERANS DAY''\n\n  Mr. BURR (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Boozman, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nIsakson, and Mr. Johanns) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs:\n\n[[Page S798]]\n\n                               S. Res. 55\n\n       Whereas the Vietnam War was fought in the Republic of South \n     Vietnam from 1961 to 1975, and involved North Vietnamese \n     regular forces and Viet Cong guerrilla forces in armed \n     conflict with United States Armed Forces and the Army of the \n     Republic of Vietnam;\n       Whereas the United States Armed Forces became involved in \n     Vietnam because the United States Government wanted to \n     provide direct military support to the Government of South \n     Vietnam to defend itself against the growing Communist threat \n     from North Vietnam;\n       Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces began \n     serving in an advisory role to the Government of the Republic \n     of South Vietnam in 1961;\n       Whereas, as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin incidents on \n     August 2 and 4, 1964, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Gulf \n     of Tonkin Resolution (Public Law 88-408), on August 7, 1964, \n     which provided the authority to the President of the United \n     States to prosecute the war against North Vietnam;\n       Whereas, in 1965, United States Armed Forces ground combat \n     units arrived in Vietnam;\n       Whereas, by the end of 1965, there were 80,000 United \n     States troops in Vietnam, and by 1969, a peak of \n     approximately 543,000 troops was reached;\n       Whereas, on January 27, 1973, the Treaty of Paris was \n     signed, which required the release of all United States \n     prisoners-of-war held in North Vietnam and the withdrawal of \n     all United States Armed Forces from South Vietnam;\n       Whereas, on March 30, 1973, the United States Armed Forces \n     completed the withdrawal of combat units and combat support \n     units from South Vietnam;\n       Whereas, on April 30, 1975, North Vietnamese regular forces \n     captured Saigon, the capitol of South Vietnam, effectively \n     placing South Vietnam under Communist control;\n       Whereas more than 58,000 members of the United States Armed \n     Forces lost their lives in Vietnam and more than 300,000 \n     members of the Armed Forces were wounded;\n       Whereas, in 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was \n     dedicated in the District of Columbia to commemorate those \n     members of the United States Armed Forces who died or were \n     declared missing-in-action in Vietnam;\n       Whereas the Vietnam War was an extremely divisive issue \n     among the people of the United States and a conflict that \n     caused a generation of veterans to wait too long for the \n     United States public to acknowledge and honor the efforts and \n     services of such veterans;\n       Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces who \n     served bravely and faithfully for the United States during \n     the Vietnam War were often wrongly criticized for the policy \n     decisions made by 4 presidential administrations in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the establishment of a ``Welcome Home Vietnam \n     Veterans Day'' would be an appropriate way to honor those \n     members of the United States Armed Forces who served in South \n     Vietnam and throughout Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War;

Con. Res. 6\n\n       Whereas the National Association for the Advancement of \n     Colored People (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``NAACP''), originally known as the National Negro Committee, \n     was founded in New York City on February 12, 1909, the \n     centennial of the date on which President Abraham Lincoln was \n     born, by a multiracial group of activists who met in a \n     national conference to discuss the civil and political rights \n     of African-Americans;\n       Whereas the NAACP was founded by a distinguished group of \n     leaders in the struggle for civil and political liberty, \n     including Ida Wells-Barnett, W.E.B. DuBois, Henry Moscowitz, \n     Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, and William \n     English Walling;\n       Whereas the NAACP is the oldest and largest civil rights \n     organization in the United States;\n       Whereas the NAACP National Headquarters is located in \n     Baltimore, Maryland;\n       Whereas the mission of the NAACP is to ensure the \n     political, educational, social, and economic equality of \n     rights of all people and to eliminate racial hatred and \n     racial discrimination;\n       Whereas the NAACP is committed to achieving its goals \n     through nonviolence;\n       Whereas the NAACP advances its mission through reliance on \n     the press, the petition, the ballot, and the courts;\n       Whereas the NAACP has been persistent in the use of legal \n     and moral persuasion, even in the face of overt and violent \n     racial hostility;\n       Whereas the NAACP has used political pressure, marches, \n     demonstrations, and effective lobbying to serve as the voice, \n     as well as the shield, for minorities in the United States;\n       Whereas after years of fighting segregation in public \n     schools, the NAACP, under the leadership of Special Counsel \n     Thurgood Marshall, won one of its greatest legal victories in \n     the decision issued by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of \n     Education (347 U.S. 483 (1954));\n       Whereas in 1955, NAACP member Rosa Parks was arrested and \n     fined for refusing to give up her seat on a segregated bus in \n     Montgomery, Alabama, an act of courage that would serve as \n     the catalyst for the largest grassroots civil rights movement \n     in the history of the United States;\n       Whereas the NAACP was prominent in lobbying for the passage \n     of--\n       (1) the Civil Rights Act of 1957 (Public Law 85-315; 71 \n     Stat. 634);\n       (2) the Civil Rights Act of 1960 (Public Law 86-449; 74 \n     Stat. 86);\n       (3) the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Public Law 88-352; 78 \n     Stat. 241);\n       (4) the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973 et seq.);\n       (5) the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, \n     Cesar E. Chavez, Barbara C. Jordan, William C. Velasquez, and \n     Dr. Hector P. Garcia Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and \n     Amendments Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-246; 120 Stat. 577); \n     and\n       (6) the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.);\n       Whereas in 2005, the NAACP launched the Disaster Relief \n     Fund to help hurricane survivors rebuild their lives in the \n     States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and \n     Alabama;\n       Whereas in the 110th Congress, the NAACP was prominent in \n     lobbying for the passage of H. Res. 826, the resolved clause \n     of which expresses that--\n       (1) the hanging of nooses is a horrible act when used for \n     the purpose of intimidation;\n       (2) under certain circumstances, the hanging of nooses can \n     be criminal; and\n       (3) the hanging of nooses should be investigated thoroughly \n     by Federal authorities, and any criminal violations should be \n     vigorously prosecuted;\n       Whereas in 2008, the NAACP vigorously supported the passage \n     of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007 \n     (28 U.S.C. 509 note), a law that puts additional Federal \n     resources into solving the heinous crimes that occurred \n     during the early days of the civil rights struggle that \n     remain unsolved and brings those who perpetrated those crimes \n     to justice;\n       Whereas the NAACP has helped usher in the new millennium by \n     charting a bold\n\n[[Page S800]]\n\n     course, beginning with the appointment of the youngest \n     President and Chief Executive Officer in the history of the \n     organization, Benjamin Todd Jealous, and its youngest female \n     Board Chair, Roslyn M. Brock;\n       Whereas under the leadership of Benjamin Todd Jealous and \n     Roslyn M. Brock, the NAACP has outlined a strategic plan to \n     confront 21st century challenges in the critical areas of \n     health, education, housing, criminal justice, and the \n     environment;\n       Whereas on July 16, 2009, the NAACP celebrated its \n     centennial anniversary in New York City, highlighting an \n     extraordinary century of ``Bold Dreams, Big Victories'' with \n     a historic address from the first African-American President \n     of the United States, Barack Obama; and\n       Whereas as an advocate for sentencing reform, the NAACP \n     applauded the enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 \n     (Public Law 111-220; 124 Stat. 2372), a landmark piece of \n     legislation that reduces the quantity of crack cocaine that \n     triggers a mandatory minimum sentence for a Federal \n     conviction of crack cocaine distribution from 100 times that \n     of people convicted of distributing the drug in powdered form \n     to 18 times that sentence: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the 102nd anniversary of the historic \n     founding of the National Association for the Advancement of \n     Colored People; and\n       (2) commends the National Association for the Advancement \n     of Colored People on the occasion of its anniversary for its \n     work to ensure the political, educational, social, and \n     economic equality of all people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/16/senate-section/article/S800-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 95.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto S. Con. Res. 6.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 6) commending the \n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on \n     the occasion of its 102nd anniversary.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss this concurrent \nresolution that honors the National Association for the Advancement of \nColored People, NAACP, on the occasion of its 102nd anniversary. I \nthank Senators Grassley, Leahy, and others for joining me in submitting \nthis bipartisan resolution and would like to note that this resolution \nis particularly timely not only because the NAACP just celebrated its \n102nd anniversary, but also because we are celebrating Black History \nMonth.\n  The NAACP was created amidst great adversity. In 1905, a group of \nAfrican American civil rights activists came together to discuss \nprominent issues that they and many others faced in our Nation. Among \nthose discussed issues was disenfranchisement. Despite passage of the \n15th amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1870, African Americans \nthroughout the country were denied their right to one of the \nfundamental methods of civic engagement: the right to vote. In many \ncircumstances Jim Crow State laws. These discussions were held on the \nCanadian side of the Niagara Falls because hotels across America \nremained segregated. On February 12, 1909, the centennial of President \nAbraham Lincoln's birth, distinguished leaders in the struggle for \ncivil and political liberty, which included W.E.B. DuBois, Ida Wells-\nBarnett, Henry Moscowitz, Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, \nand William English Walling, created the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People. It is now the oldest and largest civil \nrights organization in the United States.\n  Its national headquarters is located in my home city of Baltimore, \nMD, and its mission is one that I hold dear; that is, to ensure the \npolitical, educational, social, and economic equality of the rights of \nall persons and to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination.\n  Over the years, the NAACP has advanced its mission of racial equality \nand has achieved concrete goals to that effect by nonviolent means \nthrough sheer moral force and legal persuasion. The NAACP initially \nfocused on ending the use of lynching, bringing equality into the job \nmarket, and ensuring voting rights for all. Many of the significant \nlegal victories came under the leadership of Charles Houston and his \nprotege and fellow Marylander, Thurgood Marshall. Houston is remembered \nfor stating, ``[A] lawyer is either a social engineer or a parasite on \nsociety.''\n  The duo of Houston and Marshall successfully argued Murray v. \nMaryland, 1936, which resulted in the desegregation of the University \nof Maryland's Law School and in 1938 Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada \nthe Supreme Court ordered the admission of a Black student to the Law \nSchool at the University of Missouri. When Thurgood Marshall served as \nthe NAACP's special counsel, the organization continued to fight for \nequality in cases such as Smith v. Allwright, 1944, where Marshall \nchallenged ``White primaries,'' which prevented African Americans from \nvoting in several Southern States. In Morgan v. Virginia, 1946, the \nSupreme Court struck down a State law that enforced segregation on \nbuses and trains that were interstate carriers. In Shelley v Kraemer, \n1948, the NAACP won a battle to end the enforcement of racially \nrestrictive housing covenants, which denied access for African \nAmericans to homes in what was considered White neighborhoods.\n  In 1950, the NAACP provided the legal resources to contest both Texas \nand Oklahoma laws allowing segregated graduate schools in Sweatt v. \nPainter, 1950, and McLaurin v. Oklahoma, 1950. Marshall and the team of \nlawyers argued and won unanimous decisions in the U.S. Supreme Court, \nstating the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment required \nthose States to admit African-American students to their respective \ngraduate and professional schools. These court rulings supported and \nled to the landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, 1954, \nwhich ended racial segregation in our public schools. Marshall went on \nto become the Nation's first African-American Solicitor General, and \nthen the Nation's first African-American Supreme Court Justice.\n  Additionally, the NAACP has worked tirelessly to win passage of \nimportant legislation that protects the fundamental rights of all \nAmericans. This legislation includes the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the \nVoting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act. More recently, the \nNAACP played an integral role in ensuring passage of important \ncontemporary civil rights bills that I was proud to cosponsor, \nincluding the Civil Rights Act of 2008, the Matthew Shepard and James \nByrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, and the landmark Fair Sentencing \nAct, which reduced the gross racial disparity inherent in our \nsentencing laws for crack cocaine.\n  One of America's greatest strengths is its rich diversity. From Rosa \nParks and the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Marylanders \nHarriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass and Thurgood Marshall, strong \nAfrican-American men and women have become role models for our Nation \nand others around the world who struggle for freedom. During the month \nof February, we all should take a moment to reflect upon the \nachievements and sacrifices of the African-American community--\nachievements that might not have been possible without the hard work \nand tireless effort of the NAACP. It also is a time to rededicate \nourselves to the ideals enshrined in the U.S. Constitution--the ideals \nof equality, freedom and justice--and making sure they are protected \nfor future generations. Because in the words of the late Senator Ted \nKennedy: ``Civil rights is the unfinished business of the Nation.''\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the concurrent resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, there be no intervening action or debate, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 6) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n[[Page S804]]\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 6\n\n       Whereas the National Association for the Advancement of \n     Colored People (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``NAACP''), originally known as the National Negro Committee, \n     was founded in New York City on February 12, 1909, the \n     centennial of the date on which President Abraham Lincoln was \n     born, by a multiracial group of activists who met in a \n     national conference to discuss the civil and political rights \n     of African-Americans;\n       Whereas the NAACP was founded by a distinguished group of \n     leaders in the struggle for civil and political liberty, \n     including Ida Wells-Barnett, W.E.B. DuBois, Henry Moscowitz, \n     Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, and William \n     English Walling;\n       Whereas the NAACP is the oldest and largest civil rights \n     organization in the United States;\n       Whereas the NAACP National Headquarters is located in \n     Baltimore, Maryland;\n       Whereas the mission of the NAACP is to ensure the \n     political, educational, social, and economic equality of \n     rights of all people and to eliminate racial hatred and \n     racial discrimination;\n       Whereas the NAACP is committed to achieving its goals \n     through nonviolence;\n       Whereas the NAACP advances its mission through reliance on \n     the press, the petition, the ballot, and the courts;\n       Whereas the NAACP has been persistent in the use of legal \n     and moral persuasion, even in the face of overt and violent \n     racial hostility;\n       Whereas the NAACP has used political pressure, marches, \n     demonstrations, and effective lobbying to serve as the voice, \n     as well as the shield, for minorities in the United States;\n       Whereas after years of fighting segregation in public \n     schools, the NAACP, under the leadership of Special Counsel \n     Thurgood Marshall, won one of its greatest legal victories in \n     the decision issued by the Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of \n     Education (347 U.S. 483 (1954));\n       Whereas in 1955, NAACP member Rosa Parks was arrested and \n     fined for refusing to give up her seat on a segregated bus in \n     Montgomery, Alabama, an act of courage that would serve as \n     the catalyst for the largest grassroots civil rights movement \n     in the history of the United States;\n       Whereas the NAACP was prominent in lobbying for the passage \n     of--\n       (1) the Civil Rights Act of 1957 (Public Law 85-315; 71 \n     Stat. 634);\n       (2) the Civil Rights Act of 1960 (Public Law 86-449; 74 \n     Stat. 86);\n       (3) the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Public Law 88-352; 78 \n     Stat. 241);\n       (4) the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 1973 et seq.);\n       (5) the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, Coretta Scott King, \n     Cesar E. Chavez, Barbara C. Jordan, William C. Velasquez, and \n     Dr. Hector P. Garcia Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and \n     Amendments Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-246; 120 Stat. 577); \n     and\n       (6) the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.);\n       Whereas in 2005, the NAACP launched the Disaster Relief \n     Fund to help hurricane survivors rebuild their lives in the \n     States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and \n     Alabama;\n       Whereas in the 110th Congress, the NAACP was prominent in \n     lobbying for the passage of H. Res. 826, the resolved clause \n     of which expresses that--\n       (1) the hanging of nooses is a horrible act when used for \n     the purpose of intimidation;\n       (2) under certain circumstances, the hanging of nooses can \n     be criminal; and\n       (3) the hanging of nooses should be investigated thoroughly \n     by Federal authorities, and any criminal violations should be \n     vigorously prosecuted;\n       Whereas in 2008, the NAACP vigorously supported the passage \n     of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007 \n     (28 U.S.C. 509 note), a law that puts additional Federal \n     resources into solving the heinous crimes that occurred \n     during the early days of the civil rights struggle that \n     remain unsolved and brings those who perpetrated those crimes \n     to justice;\n       Whereas the NAACP has helped usher in the new millennium by \n     charting a bold course, beginning with the appointment of the \n     youngest President and Chief Executive Officer in the history \n     of the organization, Benjamin Todd Jealous, and its youngest \n     female Board Chair, Roslyn M. Brock;\n       Whereas under the leadership of Benjamin Todd Jealous and \n     Roslyn M. Brock, the NAACP has outlined a strategic plan to \n     confront 21st century challenges in the critical areas of \n     health, education, housing, criminal justice, and the \n     environment;\n       Whereas on July 16, 2009, the NAACP celebrated its \n     centennial anniversary in New York City, highlighting an \n     extraordinary century of ``Bold Dreams, Big Victories'' with \n     a historic address from the first African-American President \n     of the United States, Barack Obama; and\n       Whereas as an advocate for sentencing reform, the NAACP \n     applauded the enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 \n     (Public Law 111-220; 124 Stat. 2372), a landmark piece of \n     legislation that reduces the quantity of crack cocaine that \n     triggers a mandatory minimum sentence for a Federal \n     conviction of crack cocaine distribution from 100 times that \n     of people convicted of distributing the drug in powdered form \n     to 18 times that sentence: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the 102nd anniversary of the historic \n     founding of the National Association for the Advancement of \n     Colored People; and\n       (2) commends the National Association for the Advancement \n     of Colored People on the occasion of its anniversary for its \n     work to ensure the political, educational, social, and \n     economic equality of all people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/16/senate-section/article/S804-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
