Madam President, yesterday my friend the Republican leader \nticked off a list of bills on which he believes Democrats and \nRepublicans can agree. I couldn't help but notice that the VOW to Hire \nHeroes legislation that would give tax cuts to companies to hire out-\nof-work and disabled veterans wasn't on that list he ticked off.\n\n[[Page S7164]]\n\n  The bill I just referred to, the VOW to Hire Heroes legislation, \nought to be free of even a whiff of controversy. House Republicans \nalready voted for the major components of that bill--a plan to give \nolder veterans access to job training so they can keep up with the \nrapidly changing workplace and to help young veterans transition from \nActive-Duty service to the civilian workplace.\n  The bill wouldn't add a dime to the deficit, so there should be no \nobjection there. It is paid for with a noncontroversial extension of an \nexisting fee on VA-backed mortgages. It is a version of the same bill \nfor which House Republicans already voted. Republicans have voted for \ntax credits for companies that hire out-of-work and disabled veterans \nin the past, so that can't be the holdup. We will pass this important \nlegislation as an amendment to a bill sent over from the House to \nrepeal a 3 percent withholding provision from government contractors. \nRepublicans have been chomping at the bit to pass this measure, so the \nHouse vehicle for VOW to Hire Heroes is not the source of their radio \nsilence, I am sure.\n  There are no procedural or philosophical hurdles to passing this \nbill. But don't take my word for it, Madam President. Jeff Miller, the \nRepublican chairman of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, said this \nabout this bipartisan legislation yesterday:\n\n       Today, we are putting aside politics and putting America's \n     veterans first. This is how the process should work. The VOW \n     Act, which passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan \n     support, provides the framework for this legislation and gets \n     to the root of many of the employment problems our veterans \n     face.\n\n  With nearly a quarter of a million Iraq and Afghanistan veterans \nunemployed, this legislation can't come a moment too soon. Yet Senate \nRepublicans remain curiously silent on this legislation.\n  It is inconceivable that my Republican colleagues perceive this \nlegislation to be unnecessary, but it also seemed unthinkable that \nRepublicans would unanimously oppose legislation to create hundreds of \nthousands of jobs for teachers, firefighters, and construction workers.\n  Here is what is at stake. The number of unemployed post-9/11 veterans \nhas gone up by 30,000 in the last year alone. Nearly 250,000 men and \nwomen who volunteered to fight overseas for the flag and the privileges \nand freedoms it represents can't find a job here at home. That number \nwill only grow as the two wars draw to a close. One in five young \nveterans--veterans under age 25--is unemployed. On any given night, at \nleast 75,000 veterans, including 2,500 in Nevada, sleep on the streets. \nThey are homeless. We should all be able to agree that even 1 night is \ntoo many for our Nation's heroes to pass without a roof over their \nhead. Young veterans are more than twice as likely as their peers to be \nhomeless and four times as likely to live in poverty. During tough \neconomic times, when some young people join the military for a way to \nescape the cycle of poverty, this statistic is shocking and \ndisheartening.\n  I call on the minority leader and the rest of my Republican \ncolleagues to break their silence. Where do they stand on the VOW to \nHire Heroes Act? I ask my Republican colleagues, do you believe we \nshould lend a hand to those who defend our freedom? Of course. Or do \nyou think this Nation's responsibility to its veterans ends the day \nthey take off that uniform?\n  Andrew Carnegie once said that the older he got, the less mind he \npaid to what men say. ``I just watch what they do,'' he said. So I \nremind my Republican friends that the men and women of the U.S. Armed \nForces--those who wear the uniform today and those who wore it once--\nare watching what my Republican colleagues do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/08/senate-section/article/S7164-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, it has now been 2 months since the \nPresident came before Congress and outlined his plan for tackling the \njobs crisis--a plan that can best be described as a rehash of the same \nfailed policies of the past few years disguised as a bipartisan \noverture, a political strategy masquerading as a serious legislative \nproposal. The President put this plan together knowing the Republicans \nwould oppose it. In other words, it was actually designed to fail, as \nthe White House aides have readily admitted to reporters for weeks. \nThis was not, I repeat, a serious effort to do something about jobs and \nthe economy. It was a serious effort to help the President's reelection \ncampaign by making Republicans in Congress look intransigent.\n  So what I have been saying for the past few weeks is let's put the \npolitical games aside. We will have time for the election next year. \nThe American people want us to do something about jobs right now.\n  Well, it appears the message may be finally breaking through. I was \njust listening to my friend the majority leader talking about the \nmeasure before us--something we support and look forward to passing. It \nhas been championed by Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts as \nsomething that would help contractors who do business with the \ngovernment. I was also glad to see that the Veterans bill, which \ncontains many provisions supported by Republicans, will be the first \namendment. So maybe we are making some progress. This is just the kind \nof thing we have been calling for, just the kind of thing we should be \ndoing a lot more of around here because there is a lot we can agree on \nwhen it comes to jobs legislation, and that is where the focus should \nactually be.\n  While the President has been out on bus tours, Republicans in the \nHouse have been debating and passing bipartisan legislation aimed at \nmaking it easier for businesses across the country to grow and to \ncreate jobs. Over the past 2 weeks, I have highlighted some of their \ngood work.\n  Yesterday, I mentioned in particular a bill the House passed just \nlast week called the Small Company Capital Formation Act, H.R. 1070, a \nbill that received 421 votes, including 183 Democratic votes. Only 1 \nperson of the entire 435-Member House of Representatives voted against \nthe bill--just 1. And President Obama endorsed the idea contained in \nthis bill in his jobs speech a couple of months ago. The question is, \nWhy in the world wouldn't the Democratic majority take it up and pass \nit right here in the Senate? If Democrats are more interested in \npassing legislation that helps put Americans back to work than they are \nin raising taxes, they should at least work with us to pass the bills \nthe President himself has endorsed.\n  This morning, I want to say again how pleased I am we will be taking \nup Senator Brown's 3 percent withholding bill to help ease the burden \non government contractors and that we will have a vote on and hopefully \ndebate the Veterans bill. I would like to call on the Democratic \nmajority in the Senate to keep it up by taking up H.R. 1070 or its \nbipartisan Senate companion bill, S. 1544, sponsored by Senators Toomey \nand Tester.\n  Take up this legislation that has already passed the House with the \nsupport of almost everybody over there and show the American people \nthat you care more about creating jobs than creating campaign slogans. \nLet's not make the bills we will be voting on today the exception but \nthe rule around here. Why don't we just keep it up?\n  Right now, small, growing businesses aren't expanding their \nbusinesses through a public offering because they simply can't afford \nthe high cost of the government paperwork they are required to manage. \nInstead of going out there and raising money to grow and hire, they are \nholding back. They are not expanding. And if they are not expanding, \nthey are not hiring. This bill would remove some of that burden from \nsmaller businesses and help them gain access to new capital that they \ncan invest in their businesses and their employees.\n  Yesterday, I mentioned the CEO of a pharmaceutical company in \nPennsylvania who says that he has a promising new drug for treating \nchronic kidney disease actually in the pipeline but that he can't take \nit to the next level because of all the regulatory costs his company is \ntoo small to afford right\n\n[[Page S7165]]\n\nnow. We should be removing barriers for smaller companies such as his. \nNearly 200 House Democrats agree with that, and so does President \nObama. As I said yesterday, this bill is about as bipartisan as it \ngets. The only thing standing in the way of passing it in the Senate is \nthe Democrats who schedule legislation around here, and the only reason \nthey could have for blocking it is that it steps on their campaign \nstrategy.\n  I think that is a mistake. I think the American people can see \nRepublicans in the House passing all these bipartisan bills aimed at \nspurring job creation, and they wonder why Senate Democrats won't \nactually take them up.\n  This should be easy. They have already done the hard work of finding \njobs bills that we know can pass both Chambers and that the President \nwould probably sign. Let's take up the bipartisan companion bill of \nSenators Toomey and Tester to the House bill--their bill is S. 1544--\nand let's pass it, and then let's send it to the President for his \nsignature so it can become law.\n  If you are for creating jobs, you should be for this bill. As the AP \nput it last month:\n\n       Companies use the cash they raise to grow--and that means \n     hiring people . . . and at a time when 14 million Americans \n     are looking for work and the unemployment rate has been stuck \n     near 9 percent for two years, the last thing the economy \n     needs is for one engine of hiring to stall.\n\n  A recent report by NASDAQ of companies that went public from 2001 to \n2009 found that those companies increased their collective workforce by \n70 percent after making the initial public offering--a 70-percent \nincrease in employment after making an initial public offering.\n  What this bill does is enable more companies to take that leap and \nstart hiring once they have. This is the kind of thing we should be \ndoing more of in the Senate. Let's put the partisan bills aside and \nlet's focus on bipartisan legislation. Instead, why don't we shoot for \nsuccess.\n\n\n                       Detaining Enemy Combatants\n\n  Last week, the White House announced that Prime Minister Nouri al-\nMaliki of Iraq will be meeting with the President here on December 12. \nThis meeting comes at an important time, as our own military forces \nwill be drawing down their presence within Iraq, and the future of our \nbilateral security relationship remains very uncertain. But our \nwithdrawal from Iraq raises another important matter I hope the \nPresident will raise with Prime Minister Maliki and which highlights \nsome of the difficulties that will result from the military drawdown \nthere, and eventually in Afghanistan, as well, both of these drawdowns \nthe President has ordered. What I am referring to is the law of war \ndetention.\n  In July of this year, Senate Republicans wrote to Secretary of \nDefense Panetta concerning the custody of Ali Mussa Daqduq, the senior \nHezbollah operative currently in our joint custody in Iraq. Daqduq is \nin joint custody in Iraq between the United States and the Iraqi \nGovernment.\n  In 2005, Daqduq was directed by senior Hezbollah leaders to travel to \nIran, where he trained Iraqi extremists in the use of explosively \nformed penetrators, mortars, and other terrorist tactics. Among other \nthings, Daqduq is suspected of orchestrating a kidnapping in Karbala, \nIraq, 4 years ago that resulted in the murder of five U.S. military \npersonnel. It is a safe bet that if Daqduq is transferred to Iraqi \ncontrol, he will return to the fight against the United States. \nPresident Obama should insist in his meeting with Prime Minister Maliki \nthat U.S. forces retain custody of Daqduq and transport him to the \ndetention facility at Guantanamo Bay.\n  The detention of Daqduq touches on three important issues in the \nongoing war on terror. First, with the withdrawal of our military \npresence from Iraq, the United States will lose the ability to detain \nenemy combatants such as Daqduq in Iraq. Current plans are for the U.S. \nmilitary to have completed our transition to the security forces of \nAfghanistan by the end of 2014, and we should expect that we will lose \nthe ability to detain enemy combatants there as well. Our military \ncommanders in Afghanistan should therefore anticipate losing the \nability to detain enemy combatants by that date. As we saw in the \ncapture of Abdul Warsame, the Somali terrorist accused of providing \nmateriel support to al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and Al Shaabab \nand detained on a U.S. Navy ship at sea, there remains a strong \nlikelihood that our military and intelligence community will need a \nsecure detention facility to house these foreign fighters. The issue \nis, what are you going to do with them.\n  Rather than being kept in military custody overseas, Warsame was \nflown to the United States and placed in the civilian system. But the \nlogical place for long-term or indefinite detention of foreign fighters \nsuch as Warsame is not on a ship at sea or in our private prison system \nbut rather, as I have said many times before, at the secure detention \nfacility at Guantanamo.\n  Second, it is worth noting that the Obama administration has tied its \nown hands in the matter of indefinite detention of enemy combatants. \nThe administration's plan to buy a prison in Illinois for conversion to \na military detention facility makes clear that the President does not \noppose law of war detention. He is fine with bringing foreign fighters \ninto the United States and indefinitely detaining them in military \nfacilities inside our borders, and yet he opposes detaining them \nindefinitely at the military facility in Guantanamo, where they will \nbenefit from humane treatment but they won't enjoy the legal rights of \ndetainees who are brought here, including the possibility of release \ninto the United States.\n  Third, the Executive orders signed by the President in January in \n2009 were issued with an eye toward fulfilling candidate Obama's \ncampaign promises, rather than after conducting a serious review of \nsound counterterrorism policy. Now, 3 years after taking office, the \nPresident has had enough firsthand experience dealing with terrorism to \nknow that many of the terrorists held at Guantanamo can't be sent back \nto places such as Yemen, where they are likely to return to the fight. \nBut the President's own Executive orders have denied our military \ncommanders and our intelligence community the certainty they need when \nthey capture, detain, and interrogate terrorist suspects. His early \nExecutive orders, for instance, ended the CIA's detention program and \ndirected the closing of Guantanamo. The order to close Guantanamo makes \nlittle sense.\n  It is not Republicans who are tying the President's hands in \nprosecuting the war on terror. He did that himself with the \nshortsighted Executive orders he signed during his first days in \noffice. As our country withdraws from Iraq and transitions further \nresponsibilities to the Afghan security forces in Afghanistan, we will \nneed a place to send foreign fighters such as Warsame and Daqduq. That \nplace is the military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.\n  In his discussions with Prime Minister Maliki, the President should, \nof course, discuss the role the U.S. military will play in Iraq after \nthe end of this year and how our two countries can work together to \npreserve the gains made through the sacrifice of so many brave \nAmericans, and to combat Iranian influence. But in addition to these \nimportant matters, the President should also insist that the Prime \nMinister retain custody of Daqduq and send him to Guantanamo as soon as \npossible.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/08/senate-section/article/S7165-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RESERVATION OF LEADERSHIP TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I listened carefully to the statement \nmade\n\n[[Page S7166]]\n\nby the minority leader, Senator McConnell, the Republican leader. His \nlast statement was about the military drawdown in Iraq.\n  There were some of us on the Senate floor who were here 10 years ago \nwhen the vote was taken on the invasion of Iraq, and 23 of us voted \nno--1 Republican and 22 Democrats--because we felt the focus of \nAmerican military power and energy should be to avenge what happened on \n9/11 by focusing our resources on the great men and women in uniform in \nAfghanistan and al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. President Bush and his \nsupporters believed otherwise. They called for a war in another \ncountry, in Iraq, a country which was not implicated in any way with \nwhat happened on 9/11. Twenty-three of us thought that was a mistake.\n  Well, here we are almost 10 years later. We have spent $1 trillion in \nIraq, we have lost over 4,400 of our brave men and women who served in \nuniform, and now we have a leadership in Iraq which is suspect. Maliki, \nthe leader, has shown in the past to be close to the Iranians--not our \nfriends and not the friends of Western values. I am unhappy with that \noutcome. But when you deal with democracy or some form of it, the \npeople of a country choose their leaders. That is the reality.\n  President Bush, before he left office, negotiated a timetable to \nbring American troops home from Iraq, and the timetable called for that \nto happen by the end of this year. What President Obama did when he \ncame into office was to take this planned withdrawal of American troops \nby President Bush and implement it. There came a question at the end \nwhether all of the troops would leave or some would stay. What \nPresident Obama tried to negotiate was a guarantee that if American \ntroops stayed in Iraq, they would not be charged and tried in Iraqi \ncourts; that they would be subject to punishment for wrongdoing but it \nwould be under the premise, as it would in most cases, that it would be \ndone under American military law. Mr. Maliki and the Iraqis said no, \nand the President said we are not going to leave our men and women in \nuniform in Iraq subject to a government and courts that may not treat \nthem justly or fairly.\n  I think the President made the right decision. I think if he had made \nthe other decision and said, Leave them there and let the Iraqi \nprosecutors do what they wish, we would have heard speeches on the \nfloor from the other side about what an outrage it is to put American \nsoldiers in harm's way, in jeopardy of an Iraqi military justice system \nor justice system that may be unfair and unjust. The President said, \nno, our troops will come home.\n  Now comes the criticism from the Republican side of the aisle that we \nare leaving under a timetable established by President George W. Bush, \nleaving because President Obama could not get a guarantee of fair \ntreatment of American soldiers if they stayed. What else would a \nPresident do?\n  Then the argument is made, well, the problem we have is that we may \nreach a point where some of the people accused of terrorism now being \nheld in Iraq--we are not certain what is going to happen with them now. \nThat is a good question, and I don't know the answer to it. But Senator \nMcConnell--he is consistent--believes we should not ever consider \nbringing such a foreign person accused of terrorism into America's \njudicial and court system. He argues that since this is a war and these \nare terrorists involved in the war, these people should all be directed \nto military courts in the United States, military tribunals. We have \nhad that argument on the floor. In fact, we had the debate when we had \nthe vote, when Senator Ayotte offered it 1 or 2 weeks ago.\n  The majority sentiment in the Senate reflects a reality, and here is \nthe reality: Since 9/11, 2001, more than 230 terrorists have been \nsuccessfully prosecuted in the article III criminal courts of America. \nSo even those who are foreign born, such as the most recent one, the \nUnderwear Bomber--do you remember the story? He was on a plane headed \nto Detroit, tried to detonate a bomb, his clothes caught on fire, they \nput out the fire and arrested him. He pled guilty a few weeks ago in \nAmerica's criminal courts. He was prosecuted by the Department of \nJustice, investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and pled \nguilty. He wasn't the first. In fact, since 9/11 more than 300 accused \nterrorists have been successfully prosecuted in our courts, the same \ncourts Senator McConnell questions whether they could adequately \nprotect America. Three hundred times accused terrorists have gone to \njail. How many have been prosecuted in military tribunals in that same \nperiod of time? Three. Three. Three hundred to three, if you are \nkeeping score.\n  What I say is this or any other President should have the power to \nmake the right decision as to where someone should be prosecuted. If it \nis in our court system, so be it. There is ample evidence that the FBI \nand our prosecutors are up to that task. If it is in the military \ntribunal, so be it. Let the President make that decision.\n  Senator McConnell sees it otherwise, and he believes it is a mistake \nto go to our criminal courts. I would ask him, if he believes that, to \nexplain the score 300 to 3 over the last 10 years.\n  One last point. This notion that we cannot safely incarcerate \nconvicted terrorists in American prisons has been proven wrong 300 \ntimes since 9/11. These men have been sent to American prisons all \naround the United States, including Marion, IL, where we house \nconvicted terrorists. I have been to southern Illinois recently, and \npeople are not running screaming in the streets because four or five \npeople convicted of terrorism are sitting in the Marion Federal \npenitentiary. Our people who work there will take care of those folks, \nand the folks who live around that community have no fear.\n  I might add that Senator McConnell is mistaken in referring to the \nThomson prison. Let me say a brief word about something that means a \nlot to me. Ten years ago, my State built a prison in Thomson, IL, and \nthen didn't have enough money to open it. It has been sitting there \nlargely empty for a decade. Now the State of Illinois is prepared to \nsell it to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. The Federal Bureau of Prisons \nnegotiated a good price--good for the State of Illinois and good for \nus--and saves us about $35 million over building a new prison. So we \nget a pretty good deal as Federal taxpayers and Illinois gets sold a \n10-year-old prison it is not using. That is pretty good and creates a \nlot of local jobs.\n  This has the support not only of myself but the Republican Senator \nfrom Illinois, Mr. Mark Kirk, and Republican Congressmen who represent \nthis area. We all support this issue. The notion that Guantanamo \ndetainees are coming to Thomson is a dead issue. The President proposed \nit initially. I had no objection to it, but it was clear the political \nsentiment on Capitol Hill opposed it. I accepted that, I accepted \npolitical defeat, if you will, on this issue, and said: So be it. No \nGuantanamo detainees can ever go to the Thomson prison if that is what \nit takes to close the deal.\n  The President agreed to it. Attorney General Eric Holder sent a \nletter upholding it. Senator Kirk, who felt very strongly about this, \nacknowledged that this letter made it clear this administration was not \ngoing to transfer those prisoners to Thomson. Here it comes back on the \nSenate floor today.\n  I can just say to my friend Senator McConnell I hope he will sit down \nwith Senator Kirk who will explain this is no longer an issue. I am not \nfighting this issue, the President is not fighting it, there will be no \nGuantanamo detainees at Thomson. Let's do something right for our \nBureau of Prisons and right, I hope, for my home State of Illinois.\n\n\n                          Veterans Employment\n\n  On a separate issue, we are going to consider a Veterans bill today \non veterans unemployment, and we will vote on it soon, in the next day \nor two. It is a bipartisan bill, and it should be. It is a bill that is \nbased on President Obama's jobs bill, which said in addition to all the \nother unemployed in America, we should give special help to our \nreturning veterans.\n  I remember the President's speech at the joint session of Congress. \nMembers on the Republican side did not jump up and applaud very often, \nbut they sure did when the President said we ought to help our \nveterans: They fought for America; they should not have to come back \nhome and fight for a job. Let's give them a helping hand. Everyone \nstood up and applauded, as they should have.\n  This bill provides incentives for people to hire unemployed \nveterans--we\n\n[[Page S7167]]\n\nestimate there are about 240,000 of these veterans--and the tax credits \nand all the other counseling and assistance is paid for in the bill. It \nappears now that this bill--inspired by President Obama's jobs bill and \nadded to it, I might add, the work of the Senate Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee under Senator Patty Murray--is likely to pass on a bipartisan \nbasis, and it should, in time for Veterans Day.\n  Let me add another point, if I can. I want to help these 240,000 \nveterans and all veterans go to work. That is something we have a duty \nto do, a solemn moral duty to see happen. But don't forget there are 14 \nmillion unemployed Americans. President Obama's bill goes beyond \nveterans and says there are many other people needing a helping hand. \nHelp the veterans first--OK, I am for that; I sign up--but keep on the \ntopic, keep on the subject of putting America back to work.\n  Unfortunately, now, on three separate occasions we have called up \nPresident Obama's jobs bill on the Senate floor, and we could not get \none single Republican Senator to vote for it--not one. Their reason is \nvery clear, and they are very explicit about it. President Obama pays \nfor his jobs bill by imposing a surtax on those making over $1 million \na year. In other words, if someone is making more than $20,000 a week \nin income in America, they are going to pay a little more--it is about \n5 percent--for the money earned over $1 million. The Republicans have \ncome to the floor and said clearly: No deal. We will not agree to any \njobs bill that imposes any new tax burden on the wealthiest people in \nAmerica.\n  That is their position. They are very open about that position.\n  Who disagrees with that? Virtually everyone in this country. An \noverwhelming majority of Democrats and Independents and a majority of \nRepublicans and tea party members say it is not unfair to ask the \nwealthiest to pay a little more in taxes to get the American economy \nworking again and to get people back to work. That is what the \nPresident proposes.\n  As we pass this Veterans bill this week, remember it started in the \nPresident's jobs bill. It is now bipartisan, as it should be, and we \nshould not stop here. We need to continue the effort. Last week we \ntried to put money into rebuilding America, infrastructure across \nAmerica--roads, highways, airports, mass transit. We could not get a \nsingle Republican to support us--not one. A week before that we said: \nLet's try to focus on teachers, policemen, and firefighters who are \nlosing their jobs. Let's try to make sure they do not lose as many as \nmight happen if we do not act. We could not get a single Republican to \nsupport that either.\n  They will not support any provision in the President's jobs bill that \nadds one penny in new taxes to a millionaire in America. That is their \nstandard. That is what they are using.\n  The Veterans bill does not do that, so they said they will go along \nwith it. But it begs the question: If we are serious about dealing with \nthis recession and putting people back to work, let's not stop with the \nveterans of America. Let's start with the veterans of America, and \nlet's do the right thing by them and the rest of this country. A \npayroll tax cut for working Americans struggling paycheck to paycheck \nso they have more money, more money to get by, makes sense. They will \nspend that money--they will need to--on the necessities of life and the \npurchase of goods and services that will create more jobs; second, tax \ncredits to hire those unemployed; third, make certain we invest in \ninfrastructure, not only what I mentioned, roads and highways, but \nschool buildings and community colleges. Also, make sure we do our best \nfor the policemen, firefighters, and teachers who are facing layoffs \nall across America.\n  Those ought to be priorities. They are the President's priorities. \nThey should be our priorities in the Senate. The President has strong \nbipartisan support for what he is setting out to do. The sad reality is \nwe have little or no support when it comes to votes in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise in opposition to S.J. Res. 6. \nThis resolution would basically roll back the FCC's compromise over \nwhat we have all been debating: net neutrality. This is a subject area \nI have more than a passing interest in. It is a subject I had the good \nfortune to be involved in during the practice of my business for over \n20 years before I got involved full time in politics and public \nservice.\n  I, and I know the Presiding Officer and probably all of us in this \nbody, recognize that the power of telecommunications and the power of \nthe Internet to transform people's lives has been remarkable. Demand \nfor Internet use is growing dramatically. Today, nearly 2 billion \npeople use the Internet. By 2015--and that is a mere 4 years from now--\nthat number is expected to reach 2.7 billion.\n  That is pretty significant: 2.7 billion people using the Internet out \nof a total worldwide population of 7 billion folks. We are rapidly \nhitting the point where nearly half the world will use the Internet in \none form or another to communicate, to effect commerce, to socially \ninteract. This is a tool. Making sure this tool, this network, this \ntechnology, this transformative field truly remains open, free, and \navailable to all and is not unduly hindered by government regulation is \nsomething we all aspire to. Yet even as we see this tremendous growth \nin the Internet, we see constraints--constraints put on by spectrum \nresources and access to high-speed broadband. Mobile app providers seem \nto be multiplying exponentially day by day. There are already over \n600,000 applications or ``apps'' for the iPhone. Android--a more recent \nentrant into the market--now has over 500,000 ``apps.''\n  One of the most incredible things is that the United States lays \nclaim to inventing the Internet which was developed by government \nresearch linking a whole series of computer networks back in the late \n1980s and into the early 1990s. While the United States has been at the \nforefront of Internet development, unfortunately due to broadband \nconstraints and spectrum constraints, the United States, which used to \nbe a leader, is no longer in that leadership role. For example, homes \nin South Korea have greater access to faster, more advanced wireless \nnetworks and broadband than we do.\n  So the question in the resolution we are debating is: How do we make \nsure we continue to grow access to broadband? How do we make sure the \nInternet, with all its wonderful new applications, is available in the \nmost open and technology-neutral way?\n  The FCC has wrestled with this issue for some time, and the FCC is \nthe appropriate place to be wrestling with this issue. Last December, \nthe FCC came out with an order--an order that reached some level of \ncompromise between a series of very strong competing interests. By no \nmeans do I believe the FCC December 2010 order is perfect. But it does \nrepresent a dramatic step forward in that a majority of the players, \ncandidly, in the industry have reached some accommodation.\n  I do not believe this order in itself is a sufficient answer. I do \nbelieve we in Congress are going to need, at some point, to come back \nand review the Telecommunications Act of 1996. While that offered great \npromise--and I was someone who was still in the private sector at that \nmoment in time, someone who thought we were going to see true \ninterconnection opportunities for truly local competitive access in \nterms of telephone services--that did not come to pass. As a matter of \nfact, I have a number of companies that went down the tubes that I \ninvested in that assumed that 1996 Act would open those kinds of \nactivities. It did not come to pass.\n\n[[Page S7168]]\n\n  But having Congress revisit the 1996 Telecommunications Act is not \nwhat is being debated today. What is being debated is whether we go \nahead and allow the FCC's compromise proposition to move forward or \nwhether we introduce further politics into this issue when we ought not \nlet politics stand in the way of technology and innovation moving \nforward.\n  I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who feel \notherwise. They think the FCC's compromise order puts too much \ngovernment regulation on innovation. I must respectfully disagree. If \nwe were talking about too much government regulation of innovation, I \nwould be strongly standing with those colleagues saying that is not \nwhat we ought to be doing.\n  What we are doing, as we debate this so-called net neutrality issue, \nis talking about the rights and responsibilities of network owners and \noperators to manage the Internet and, quite honestly, to allow them to \nrun successful businesses in a free and open way.\n  We are also talking about the rights of consumers to have access to \nlawful content on the Internet without any prejudice. Without having \nthat network provider choose one content provider over another in terms \nof who gets first dibs, first access to their network.\n  This issue has been debated on and off not just this year but for a \nnumber of years. In many ways, the current history on this issue goes \nback to 2005, when both the Federal Communications Commission and the \nSupreme Court determined separately that broadband services should be \nreclassified as information services under the 1996 Telecommunications \nAct instead of as telecommunications services.\n  For those who do not live within the rather esoteric world of telecom \nregulations, what does this mean in plain English? Information services \nhave always had a lighter touch of regulation than have \ntelecommunications services.\n  Think about the original regulation of telecommunications services \ngoing back almost to the 1934 act, when we had, in effect, one \ntelecommunications provider. It was Ma Bell. We could pick our phone of \nany type, as long as it was black, and everybody paid the same access \nfee. When we had that kind of monopolistic situation telecommunications \nhad to be regulated in a more appropriate way to make sure the \nconsumers were protected.\n  As we saw the evolution of telecom services and the breakup of Ma \nBell and a move to multiple providers, telecom services still have \nrequired a slightly heavier hand of regulation than for information \nservices.\n  Back in 2005, the Supreme Court and the FCC said that because we have \nthis brand new area of broadband--an area that in 2005 we did not fully \nrealize the potential of, frankly, even in 2011, I am not sure we fully \nrealize the potential--we are going to view this as information \nservices and, consequently, have less regulation. That should be viewed \nas a good sign.\n  Contrary to what some in this debate say, there has never been a time \nwhen the management of the Internet or the telecommunications \nnetworks--which make up, in effect, the backbone of our Internet \nsystem--has not been regulated. Again, as I mentioned earlier, \nnetworks--whether they are passing voice, data, now video or others--\nall have had some form of regulation going back to the \nTelecommunications Act of 1934.\n  The question we are asked here today is: What kind of rules do we \nwant to have as a society to make sure everyone can have free and \nunfettered access to the Internet and to lawful content in a way that \nis not biased or prejudiced by the telecommunications provider in the \nbackground?\n\n  To me, that means Internet service providers have the right to manage \nthe networks as best they can. That means network providers have to \nhave the ability to manage some level of traffic so they can generate \nenough revenues to continue to build out their networks, particularly \nso rural communities can have access to these services.\n  I know the Acting President pro tempore knows of parts of northern \nNew Hampshire where there are still areas that do not have full high-\nspeed broadband Internet access. I know in my State of Virginia there \nare parts of Southside and southwest that do not have access to full \nhigh-speed broadband connections.\n  While broadband connectivity does not guarantee economic success, it \nis a prerequisite for any community in the 21st century if they are \neven going to get looked at as a possible location for new jobs. So we \nhave to make sure all communities get access to broadband. That means \nwe have to allow the network providers at least enough of a rate of \nreturn to give them the incentive to build out their networks.\n  But it also means that while they have to be able to manage their \nnetworks, these Internet service providers, cannot discriminate against \ncontent providers' access to networks. It does not mean a network \nprovider ought to be able to say: I like this content more than that \ntype of content, particularly if the network provider happens to own \nthat content and somehow moves it to the front of the line. That goes \nagainst the grain of everything that has been about providing \ntelecommunications in this country since the 1934 Act.\n  If this was a simple matter, the industry, the FCC, and others would \nnot have been wrestling with it as dramatically as they have over the \nlast 5 or 6 years. The fact is, network management is increasingly \ncomplicated. So complicated that sometimes it is hard to tell exactly \nwhat is going on behind the scenes.\n  As a former telecommunications executive and somebody who spent 20 \nyears being involved in helping to try to build out at least part of \nthe wireless network in this country--but as somebody who also is at \nthis point falling behind on all the current technological \ninnovations--I would like to comment I was very current circa 1999, \nwhich puts me a bit behind in 2011. While behind, I do recognize and \nunderstand that network management in 2011 is extraordinarily \nchallenging.\n  New technologies that allow for prioritization of network traffic, \ndeep packet inspection, and the increasing use of metered services and \nusage-based pricing--all these factors, combined with an effort to make \nsure we are technology neutral in how we get this high-speed broadband \ninformation--whether it is wired, wireless, satellites or otherwise. \nThis all makes these issues extraordinarily difficult for policymakers \nto wrestle with.\n  It was in that vein that the FCC conducted a 2-year process to \naddress concerns about maintaining competitively neutral access to the \nInternet. So in December of 2010, the FCC adopted an Open Internet \nOrder which is expected to be implemented on November 20th of this \nyear, 2011. As I said at the outset, the order they put forward is not \nperfect. There are many in the industry who have a partial bone to pick \nwith various technical components. But the fact is I give Chairman \nGenachowski great credit for managing to thread the needle in way that \nwhile no one is totally happy, no one is totally unhappy. The issue of \nnet neutrality has been dealt with by the order and we can move on to \nthe next step of the debate. That is, we can turn to making sure we \nactually complete the buildout of broadband networks, particularly to \nthe rural communities around America.\n  What does the FCC order do? It basically sets three basic rules for \nhow network owners, ISPs, must handle Internet traffic.\n  First, it offers greater transparency about fixed and mobile network \nmanagement practices to both consumers and content providers. This is \nterribly important. Without that transparency, without that knowledge, \nto see what we are getting as a consumer--or if you are a content \nprovider, making sure your traffic is not being bumped out of line by \nsome large network operator--is terribly important.\n  Second, it prevents fixed and mobile network providers from blocking \ntraffic generated by competitors to varying degrees. What does this \nmean? It means if you are a network manager, if you are a network \nprovider--and many network providers are now starting to also own \ncontent as well--you have to make sure that competitors are treated \nfairly. If you are a competitor in terms of being a content provider, \nyou want to be sure the network you may be putting your traffic on that \nhas its own set of content is not allowing its network-owned content to \nget priority, to get an unfair advantage.\n\n[[Page S7169]]\n\n  If the networks are going to be open and accessible, neutral networks \nthat we have all come to expect from our telecommunications networks in \nthe past, we have to make sure there is no bias.\n  The second part of the FCC order tries to make sure these fixed and \nmobile network providers aren't able to block traffic and give their \nown content priority.\n  Third, it prohibits fixed broadband providers from unreasonable, \ndiscriminatory practices. Again, this is about content, but it also \ntries to get at that issue of how do we deal with those folks who have \nhuge amounts of content that can clog the network. We have to make sure \nthat we have open access, but we cannot have people overwhelm the \nnetwork with their particular content without the ability to price that \ninto the network provider's basic service offerings.\n  I know many of my colleagues' eyes are starting to glaze. I even see \nsome of the pages' eyes are starting to glaze as we dive into some of \nthe intricacies of telecommunications practices. But at the end of the \nday, what the FCC did in 2010 will be implemented later this month--\nunless the Senate rejects it and throws all the work out the window and \nsays let's go back to square one. I think would actually do great harm \nto the progress made and provide even greater uncertainty to one of the \nfastest growing areas of our economy, telecommunications and broadband.\n  If we reject this S.J. Res. 6, which I hope we will, and allow this \ncompromise that the FCC worked out to move forward, I believe it will \nallow the kind of broadband growth, the kind of Internet growth we have \nall come to expect. And it will help create new jobs in this country.\n  A couple final points. The wireless issues are a particularly \nchallenging policy area still to be addressed. Wireless is a newer \ntechnology. The FCC decided in the Order to adopt a lighter hand of \nregulation rather than the more strict, full telecommunications \nregulation of the 1996 Act. This is because of the tremendous growth in \nthe nascent area of mobile services. As of December 2010, 26 percent of \nU.S. households were wireless only, compared to about 8 percent of the \nhouseholds 5 years ago. The point here is a dramatic one. I think about \nmy kids who, as they start to move into their own homes or even into \ncollege, don't even have a phone in their apartment at college. They \nrely entirely on wireless. We have to make sure we can continue to \nbuild out these wireless networks in the most robust way possible. I \nthink the FCC basically got it right by not putting any more heavy-\nhanded regulation on wireless.\n  In closing, the real issue is how do we ensure that consumers and \ncontent providers are treated fairly. The Internet was designed as an \nopen medium, where every service and Web site had an opportunity to \ngain a following and to be successful. This philosophy allows bloggers \nto compete with mainstream media and entrepreneurs across all sectors \nto compete globally. Small and medium businesses that rely heavily on \nWeb technologies grow and export two times as much as businesses that \ndon't, according to McKinsey.\n  Some have argued that neither the Congress nor the FCC should do \nanything in this area because there isn't a widespread problem \ncurrently. It is important to remember that the reason the Internet has \nbeen so successful has been the fact that no one has been able to \ncontrol it--no network provider alone, no content provider alone. I \nhope that never changes.\n  I do believe the FCC Order should be allowed to be implemented. It \nhelps set minimum rules of the road that will allow Internet growth, \nbroadband growth, mobile growth, all areas where the United States can \nregain the lead and continue to create jobs and advance prosperity.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/08/senate-section/article/S7169-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7169-S7170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Specialist Sarina Butcher\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, we are considering some veterans \nlegislation this week. I rise to recognize the men and women who have \nselflessly served our Nation as part of the Armed Forces.\n  Veterans Day is approaching. It is one way to remind ourselves of the \nsacrifices so many have made and continue to make for our country.\n  We pay tribute to individuals such as SPC Sarina Butcher. For the \npast 18 months, she served with valor and distinction in Afghanistan as \nan automated logistical specialist with the Army National Guard. She \nearned awards, including the National Defense Service Medal, Army \nService Ribbon, and the Oklahoma Good Conduct Medal. She dreamed of \nbecoming a nurse, joining the Guard to help her along that path to \nsupport her 2-year-old daughter.\n  Last week, at 19 years old, Specialist Butcher paid the ultimate \nsacrifice. Specialist Butcher was the first female Oklahoma National \nGuard soldier to be killed during wartime and the youngest Guard member \nto die in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. I spoke to her mother, a \nresident of El Dorado, AR, and she stressed how her daughter loved \nserving our Nation. All our prayers are with this family.\n\n\n                         Corporal David Bixler\n\n  I also wish to recognize CPL David Bixler of Harrison, AR. I recently \nhad the chance to meet David, one of five servicemembers chosen by the \nUSO for bravery and sacrifice. While on foot patrol in Afghanistan, \nCorporal Bixler stepped on an explosive device while saving the lives \nof his team members. The explosion resulted in the loss of both his \nlegs. He was awarded the Silver Star for his actions. I was moved by \nhis unwavering strength and courage. I spoke with his young daughter, \nand it was easy to see the pride she has for her father.\n\n  These two heroes, Sarina and David, are part of a long list of \nArkansans throughout our State's history who answered the call to \nserve. Their resolve--that same dedication and love of country that \nbrought down Osama bin Laden--was passed down through generations \nbefore them. They join the ranks of 2LT John Alexander of Helena, the \nsecond African-American graduate from West Point; BG William Darby of \nFort Smith, the first commander of the U.S. Army Rangers; and Captain \nMaurice Britt of Carlisle, the first to receive the military's three \nhighest medals for bravery for a single conflict.\n  Arkansans serving in the military have never wavered when their \ncountry called. Whether Active, Guard or Reserves, they have \nparticipated in our current efforts abroad and countless previous ones. \nThese efforts continue to this day. For example, the Arkansas National \nGuard's Agriculture Development Team works with the farmers and \nherdsmen of southern Afghanistan. The 77th Theater Aviation Brigade \nworked in Iraq with command and control assets in the south. Little \nRock Air Force Base continues to support tactical mobility operations \naround the globe while training our future airlifters.\n  Today, our country is facing many challenges, from rising \nunemployment among veterans to ever-tightening budgets. We should not \nlet our current financial difficulties take away the support we owe \nthose who serve. When looking for DOD savings, we must keep in mind \nthat when these individuals joined the service, both sides made a \ncommitment. We must honor these commitments.\n  When looking for ways to save, we should put our focus on improving \nprocesses and capitalize on efficiencies where we can. For example, I \nrecently introduced the Veterans Relief Act, designed to reduce the \nbacklog at the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims. I will continue to \nlook for similar ways to streamline processes, improve efficiencies, \nand honor the obligations of those who have served.\n  Today, I look at veterans and say: Thank you. Thank you for your \nservice, thank you for your sacrifice, and thank you for your \ndedication to our country. It is impossible for me to articulate the \nscale of my gratitude, and I will continue to support measures that \nhonor the veterans of yesterday, today, and tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S7170]]\n\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in St. Louis this fall, we had much \nthat was special and different. We had the rally squirrel that ran \nthrough one of the playoff games. We had the saying ``happy flight,'' \nand ``happy flight'' became synonymous with a team that was chocking up \nimprobable victories night after night, day after day.\n  I am going to term this speech a ``happy speech.'' I have had to give \na number of speeches on the floor of the Senate since I have been \nblessed enough to be given this opportunity to serve my State. \nSometimes I come to the floor angry. Sometimes I come to the floor \nfrustrated or upset. Sometimes I come with a passion for a piece of \npolicy that I think is essential in terms of our government operating \nthe way we would want it to operate. Today, I just come happy. I just \ncome happy with the notion that our team provided the kinds of thrills \nthat baseball yearns for in this country--especially at these moments \nwhen many families are faced with long days and tough decisions as they \ntry to right the ship as we travel through a very difficult economy.\n  The 2011 World Series was an unlikely one for our Cardinals. It \nwasn't supposed to happen. Bookies made a lot of money off the World \nSeries this year because the Cardinals weren't supposed to be in it. \nThe Cardinals were 10\\1/2\\ games out with 30 days to go. In fact, the \nCardinals secured their wild card berth on the last day of the season \nat the eleventh hour. As a wild card team, they weren't supposed to do \nwell. They weren't supposed to defeat Philadelphia. That just wasn't \ngoing to happen. Philadelphia has one of the top three payrolls in \nbaseball, right? That wasn't going to happen.\n  Well, it did. We won against Philadelphia and then took on the mighty \nBrewers, the winner of our division, and, of course, we won that also. \nThen it was on to the Texas Rangers, who were supposed to win this year \nbecause they had won last year, and we weren't supposed to be able to \ncompete with the depth and breadth of the Texas lineup. Well, as \neveryone now knows, that is not how the story ended.\n  This was a special World Series. It was a unique World Series. It was \ncompetitive. It was fun. And I was lucky enough to be at some of the \ngames. In fact, I was at game 3 when Albert Pujols put on a show for \nthe world. He showed everyone why he is the best player in baseball--\nthree towering home runs in one World Series game. All of a sudden his \nname was being used in the same sentence as Lou Gehrig.\n  It was a special night to watch the Cardinals pound the Rangers in \nArlington, TX, but the Rangers came back the next night to win and the \nnext night after that. So the Cardinals returned to St. Louis once \nagain with their backs against the wall. Once again, everyone assumed \nit was over because all the Rangers had to do was win one game. And \nthat is when game 6 occurred. I was fortunate enough to be at game 6, \nand I am saving my ticket stub for generations to come. People in St. \nLouis are going to claim they were at game 6, so I am going to save the \nproof. None of us will ever forget game 6.\n  At our eleventh hour, trying to win our 11th world championship, in \nthe year 2011, our hometown guy--right from St. Louis, graduated from \nLafayette High School--walked to the plate in the 11th inning, after \nthe Cardinals twice, with two outs and two strikes, saved the game by \ngetting a hit--twice; not once but twice--so there we were in the \nbottom of the 11th with the score tied, and our hometown guy, at the \neleventh hour, in the 11th inning, in the year 2011, cracked the bat, \nand that ball sailed out for a home run, and suddenly we had secured \nthe most improbable and exciting victory in World Series history. Now, \nmaybe that is hyperbole, but, honestly, I don't think so. Find someone \nwho watched that game who knows baseball, and they will tell you that \nwas among one of the very best World Series games in the history of \nAmerican baseball. And what a history that is. With that one crack of \nthe bat, Cardinal Nation became Cardinal World, and all of the world \nstood in amazement as we cheered like crazy for our Cardinals.\n  What did this team do this year? We had a masterful manager whom we \nwill miss very much. We had David Freese, our hometown guy, who rose to \nthe occasion when we needed him. We had Albert Pujols. We had Carp, who \nwas amazing as a pitcher. We had a bullpen that rose to the occasion \nwhen necessary, after they had been maligned through most of the \nseason. We had Yadi, we had Craig, and we had so many of our players \nwho did what had to be done when it had to be done to deliver a World \nSeries championship to a city that loves them more than we love the \narch and more than we love our beer.\n\n[[Page S7171]]\n\n  For years now, young people will hear over and over that old cliche \nabout refusing to quit. You can never give up. And I have to tell you \nthe truth, it is a cliche I have used with my kids when they were \nmoping around and grumbling: Oh my life is horrible. You say to them: \nYou can't quit. You can't give up. Well, this team is going to allow \nparents in St. Louis and beyond for many years to say: See. See what \nhappens when you don't give up. See what happens when you refuse to \nquit. You can win a championship if you just refuse to die. And that is \nexactly what our Cardinals did.\n  On behalf of Cardinal Nation and thousands of people around this \ncountry who were proud of what St. Louis represented--a fall classic \nwith our classic Cardinals bringing home the victory for a city that \nloves them--God bless them all. And God bless the fans who understand \nit is okay to cheer for a sac fly, who understand baseball better than \nmost fans around the country. They will now wait anxiously for spring \ntraining so we can begin once again our love affair with the St. Louis \nCardinals.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Wallach, of New York, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nFederal Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is 15 minutes \nof debate equally divided and controlled between the Senator from \nVermont and the Senator from Iowa, or their designees.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for pressing \nforward to secure a vote on another of the 25 judicial nominees ready \nfor Senate consideration. I am disappointed that the Senate Republican \nleadership would only agree to vote on 1 of the 25 judicial nominees \nready and waiting for final Senate action. All 25 of the nominees are \nqualified and have the support of their home state Senators, Republican \nand Democratic. Twenty-one of these judicial nominations were \nunanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee. Senate Democrats are \nprepared to have votes on all these important nominations. I know of no \ngood reason why the Republican leadership is refusing to proceed on 24 \nof the 25 nominations stalled before the Senate. At a time when the \nvacancy rate on Federal courts throughout the country remains near 10 \npercent, the delay in taking up and confirming these consensus judicial \nnominees is inexcusable.\n  I know that Senator Reid is especially pleased that the Senate has \nthe opportunity for a final vote on the nomination of Judge Evan \nWallach to fill a vacancy on the Federal Circuit. Judge Wallach is an \nexperienced jurist with a distinguished record who has been serving on \nthe U.S. Court of International Trade. He received the highest possible \nrating from the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary, unanimously ``well qualified.''\n  I am delighted that Judge Wallach's nomination has not been delayed \nas long as others. This nomination was reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee on October 6. There is no good reason why all judicial \nnominations are not considered within a month of being reported, \nespecially the consensus nominees reported unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee. It is my hope that this timeline can be an example and set \nthe standard for action on other nominations, as well. When the Senate \napproved the nomination of Judge Zipps of Arizona less than 1 month \nafter it was reported by the committee, we showed that there is no need \nfor additional delay. These needless delays perpetuate vacancies and \ndeny the American people the judges needed in our courts to provide \njustice.\n  What is disappointing is that the Senate Republican leadership has \nyet to agree to votes on the long-pending nominations of Judge Chris \nDroney of Connecticut to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the \nSecond Circuit, Morgan Christen to fill one of several judicial \nemergency vacancies on the Ninth Circuit, or Judge Adalberto Jordan to \nfill a judicial emergency vacancy on the Eleventh Circuit. The Droney \nnomination has been stalled for 3\\1/2\\ months despite there being no \nopposition. The Christen nomination has been pending a month longer \nthan Judge Wallach's and was also reported unanimously. Judge Jordan's \nnomination is approaching 1 month on the Senate Executive Calendar \ndespite his being a consensus nominee supported by both his Democratic \nand Republican home State Senators. Also pending is the nomination of \nStephanie Thacker to fill a vacancy on the Fourth Circuit. All of these \nconsensus circuit court nominations should be considered and approved \nwithout further delay. In addition, the Senate should give \nconsideration to Caitlin Halligan's nomination. Her nomination to the \nDC Circuit was approved by the committee in March.\n  Judge Wallach is only the seventh of President Obama's circuit court \nnominations the Senate has considered this year, compared to 12 at this \npoint in President Bush's third year. We are not doing nearly as well \ndespite five additional circuit court nominations on the Senate \nCalendar awaiting a vote. By this point in the third year of President \nBush's administration, the Senate had confirmed 29 of his circuit court \nnominees. By comparison, the Senate has confirmed only 22 of President \nObama's circuit court nominees. By this point in the Bush \nadministration, vacancies had been reduced to 42. By comparison, today \nthey stand at 83. By this point in President Bush's first 3 years, the \nSenate had confirmed 167 of his Federal circuit and district court \nnominees. So far in the 3 years of the Obama administration, that total \nis only 115.\n  During President Bush's first 4 years, the Senate confirmed a total \nof 205 Federal circuit and district court judges. As of today, we would \nneed another 90 confirmations over the next 12 months to match that \ntotal. That means a faster confirmation rate for the next 12 months \nthan in any 12 months of the Obama administration to date. That would \nrequire Senate Republicans to abandon their delaying tactics. I hope \nthey will. This is an area where the Senate must come together to \naddress the serious judicial vacancies crisis on Federal courts around \nthe country that has persisted for well over 2 years. We can and must \ndo better for the millions of Americans being made to suffer by these \nunnecessary Senate delays.\n  More than half of all Americans--over 162 million--live in districts \nor circuits that have a judicial vacancy that could be filled today if \nSenate Republicans just agreed to vote on the nominations now pending \non the Senate calendar. As many as 24 States are served by Federal \ncourts with vacancies that would be filled by these nominations. \nMillions of Americans across the country are harmed by delays in \noverburdened courts. The Republican leadership should explain why they \nwill not consent to vote on the qualified, consensus candidates \nnominated to fill these extended judicial vacancies.\n  Senator Grassley and I have worked together to ensure that each of \nthe 25 nominations on the Senate Calendar was fully considered by the \nJudiciary\n\n[[Page S7172]]\n\nCommittee after a thorough but fair process, including completing our \nextensive questionnaire and questioning at a hearing. This White House \nhas worked with the home state Senators, Republicans and Democrats, and \neach of the judicial nominees being delayed from a Senate vote is \nsupported by both home State Senators. The FBI has conducted a thorough \nbackground review of each nominee. The ABA's Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary has conducted a peer review of their professional \nqualifications. When the nominations are then reported unanimously by \nthe Judiciary Committee, there is no reason for months and months of \nfurther delay before they can start serving the American people.\n  No resort to percentages of nominees ``processed'' or ``positive \naction'' by the committee can excuse the lack of real progress by the \nSenate. In the past, we were able to confirm consensus nominees more \npromptly, often within days of being reported to the full Senate. They \nwere not forced to languish for months. The American people should not \nhave to wait weeks and months for the Senate to fulfill its \nconstitutional duty and ensure the ability of our Federal courts to \nprovide justice to Americans around the country.\n  The American people need functioning Federal courts with judges, not \nvacancies. Though it is within the Senate's power to take significant \nsteps to address this problem, refusal by Senate Republicans to consent \nto vote on consensus judicial nominations has kept judicial vacancies \nhigh for years. The number of judicial vacancies has been near or above \n90 for over 2\\1/2\\ years. A recent report by the nonpartisan \nCongressional Research Service found that these delays have resulted in \nthe longest period of historically high vacancy rates on Federal \ndistrict courts in the last 35 years. These needless delays do nothing \nto help solve this serious problem and are damaging to the Federal \ncourts and the American people who depend on them.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate will confirm Judge Evan \nJonathan Wallach to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Federal Circuit. \nWith this vote, we will have confirmed 54 article III judicial nominees \nduring this Congress, and 18 in just over a month. In only eight \nsessions of Congress in the past 30 years has the Senate confirmed more \njudicial nominees.\n  Our progress extends beyond the Senate floor and into the Judiciary \nCommittee, where 88 percent of President Obama's judicial nominees have \nhad their hearing. That is compared to only 76 percent of President \nBush's nominees at a comparable point in his Presidency, in the 108th \nCongress. To date, 72 percent of the judicial nominations made by \nPresident Obama have been confirmed. Overall, we have made real \nprogress on 85 percent of the judicial nominees submitted this \nCongress.\n  Furthermore, these nominees have been processed in a very fair \nmanner. Circuit nominees have had a hearing within 66 days after \nnomination, on average. President Bush's nominees were forced to wait \n247 days. The same can be said of President Obama's district court \nnominees, who had their hearings, on average, in just 79 days. \nPresident Bush's district court nominees waited 120 days, on average, \nfor a hearing.\n  President Obama's circuit and district nominees have been reported \nfaster than those of President Bush--in fact, almost 35 percent faster. \nI would hope that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would \nacknowledge this cooperation, and they sometimes do. But it is \nimportant to remind everyone that our duty as U.S. Senators is not to \nrubberstamp the President's nominees. We must carefully examine the \nrecords and qualifications of each nominee before us to determine if \nthey are fit to serve the public for lifetime positions. I don't \nbelieve my constituents would expect any less.\n  The fact that we are here, confirming the 54th article III judicial \nnominee, shows we have been performing our due diligence. However, we \nwill continue to hold quality confirmed over quantity confirmed.\n  I would like to say a few words about Judge Wallach.\n  Judge Wallach presently serves as a judge of the U.S. Court of \nInternational Trade. He was appointed to that court by President \nClinton in 1995, following confirmation by the Senate.\n  I would note that the Federal Circuit, the court to which Judge \nWallach is nominated, is the appellate court for the Court of \nInternational Trade. In addition to international trade, the court \nhears cases on patents, trademarks, government contracts, certain money \nclaims against the U.S. Government, veterans' benefits, and public \nsafety officers' benefits claims. Of particular interest to me, this \ncourt has exclusive jurisdiction over cases related to Federal \npersonnel matters. That includes exclusive jurisdiction over appeals \nfrom the Merit Systems Protection Board, MSPB, which hears \nwhistleblower cases under the Whistleblower Protection Act.\n  Evan Wallach received a bachelor of arts from the University of \nArizona in 1973, his juris doctorate from University of California \nBoalt Hall School of Law in 1976, and his bachelor of laws from the \nUniversity of Cambridge in 1981.\n  Judge Wallach began his legal career as an associate attorney with \nLionel Sawyer & Collins where he eventually made partner. Over time, \nthe emphasis of his practice became media law. He also defended libel \nactions and represented newspapers on day to day issues, including \nemployee grievances, collection actions, and copyright protection.\n  While he remained with Lionel Sawyer & Collins, he took several \nleaves of absences. From 1987 to 1988, Judge Wallach worked as a \ngeneral counsel and public policy adviser to Senator Harry Reid. He \nalso served as a judge advocate for the Nevada Army National Guard from \n1989 to 1995. In 1991, Judge Wallach was called up to active duty to \nserve as an attorney in the Office of the Judge Advocate General of the \nArmy-International Affairs Division during the first gulf war.\n  The American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary has rated Judge Wallach with a unanimous ``Well Qualified'' \nrating.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Judge Evan Wallach has been my friend for a \nvery long time.\n  I have known him since he was a lawyer in Nevada. He worked at Lionel \nSawyer & Collins for almost 2 decades.\n  He is a good man and a good jurist, and I believe he is a wonderful \nnominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n  He is also a scholar. Judge Wallach graduated from the University of \nArizona and then got his law degree from UC Berkeley. But one law \ndegree wasn't enough, so he went on to get another degree at the \nrenowned University of Cambridge Law School in England.\n  Now he passes on that great wealth of knowledge to others. Since \n1997, he has served as an adjunct law professor, teaching the law of \nwar and other courses at Brooklyn Law School, New York Law School and \nseveral other worthy institutions.\n  Judge Wallach is also a patriot with a long history of serving his \ncountry in our armed forces.\n  He and his two older brothers volunteered to serve in Vietnam, and \nJudge Wallach was awarded the Bronze Star.\n  But his service to his country didn't end there. My friend served in \nthe Nevada Army National Guard from 1989 until 1995 as an attorney-\nadvisor.\n  During the Gulf War, in 1991, he took a leave of absence from his law \npractice--where he was a partner--to serve as an active-duty attorney-\nadvisor. He served in the Office of the Judge Advocate General of the \nArmy at the Pentagon.\n  He has also served as a Circuit Court judge in the 2nd, 3rd and 9th \nCircuits, and as a District Court judge in Nevada, New York and the \nDistrict of Columbia. He even heard a patent case in Nevada and he \nwrote hundreds of opinions as a judge for the U.S. Court of \nInternational Trade.\n  Judge Evan Wallach served his country bravely at war. I know he will \nserve it well once again as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Federal Circuit.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof\n\n[[Page S7173]]\n\nEvan Jonathan Wallach, of New York, to be United States Circuit Judge \nfor the Federal Circuit?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  Iran\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise to talk about two entirely different \nsubjects; first, on the subject of Iran, the subject of a critical \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency report that will be issued likely \ntomorrow.\n  Credible press reports on the United Nations document tell us an \nimportant thing. Remember, it was the IAEA that urged caution with \nregard to the weapons of mass destruction program in Iraq. The record \nshows that the IAEA was largely correct on its determination there. \nBased on that credibility, we should listen to the IAEA and what they \nsay in this groundbreaking report.\n  Their report makes six very important conclusions according to \ncredible press reports: No. 1, the Islamic Republic of Iran has used \nmilitary people to procure dual-use nuclear material; No. 2, they have \ndeveloped an undeclared nuclear material production line separate from \ntheir commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; No. 3, \nthey have now acquired outside international information on the \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons; No. 4, they have begun work on an \nindigenous design for a nuclear weapon; and, No. 5, they are already \nsubstantially in excess of the 3-percent enrichment for uranium-235 \nnecessary to run a nuclear reactor as they originally claimed.\n  The sixth conclusion, though, appears to be the most important. The \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency concludes they may have also begun \nwork on a new payload for their Shahab-3 missile. This is a missile \nthat largely comes from North Korea called the No Dong and is able to \nhit U.S. bases in the Persian Gulf and our allies in Israel. According \nto the reports on this U.N. document, it says the Shahab-3 payload has \nthe correct mass for a nuclear weapon; it has a generator aboard the \nwarhead that would be necessary to initiate a nuclear detonation; it is \ndesigned for an airburst to make that detonation most effective; the \nweapon has multiple detonators in it--I think this is a key conclusion \nbecause a conventional munition only requires one detonator, but a \nnuclear weapon requires multiple detonators; and this has it--it does \nnot issue any submunitions, all the warhead is contained in one \ncritical mass; and the Iranians have now prepared a 400-meter test \nshaft likely for a nuclear test shot.\n  If this is not a smoking gun, I do not know what is. I do not know \nwhat the word for ``smoking gun'' in Farsi is, but clearly the United \nNations, not known for speaking clearly on many topics, is now telling \nus one clear thing: the Islamic Republic of Iran is designing and \nmoving toward building nuclear weapons.\n  If we look at their record, we will see the Islamic Republic of Iran \nhas transferred nearly every one of its advanced munitions it currently \nowns to terrorist organizations, including antishipping cruise \nmissiles, which the Iranians transferred to Hezbollah.\n  We have also known several dangerous--actually, dangerously weird--\nthings going on in the Islamic Republic of Iran, such as sentencing an \nIranian actress to 90 lashes for appearing in an Australian film simply \non the crime of not having her head covered--luckily, because the \nInternational Campaign for Human Rights in Iran called attention to \nthis, apparently that sentence may be in abeyance--or credible reports \nthis weekend that the Islamic Republic of Iran, under President \nAhmadinejad, has arrested 70 fashion designers for anti-Islamic \nactivity.\n  What we know for a fact is that the Islamic Republic of Iran has been \na state sponsor of terror, as certified by Presidents Carter, Reagan, \nBush, Clinton, Bush 2, and President Obama under Secretary of State \nClinton. We know they are the leading paymasters for Hezbollah and \nHamas.\n  What we can see clearly from this report is that this year, or likely \nthe year after, they will have nuclear weapons. I think it is quite \nlikely they would then transfer those nuclear weapons directly to \nHezbollah and Hamas. This is something we cannot allow to happen, which \nis why action in the Senate and in the executive branch should occur on \ncollapsing the Central Bank of Iran. We already have 92 Senators who \nhave agreed, even in these partisan times, to collapse the Central Bank \nof Iran. Ninety-two Senators have signed on to the Kirk-Schumer letter \nto call for this action. This action was also just recommended in an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan fashion in the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee under the leadership of Congressman Berman to recommend this \nalso in the House. I think the administration--that has leaked several \ntimes to the New York Times that they have this under consideration--\nshould move in this direction.\n  For those countries that substantially purchase oil from the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, we should work with our Saudi allies to make sure \ntheir needs are met so we can go ahead and collapse the Central Bank of \nIran and the Iranian currency, especially in the wake of this report.\n  Remember, this is the government that, according to Attorney General\n\n[[Page S7174]]\n\nEric Holder, led a plot to blow up a Georgetown restaurant, possibly \ninvolving the death of many Americans, including, they described, \nSenators, in an effort to kill the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the \nUnited States. This is singularly irresponsible activity and one that \nnow, coupled with this IAEA report on nuclear weapons, should not be \ntolerated.\n\n\n                       Protecting Privacy Rights\n\n  Mr. President, I also rise to speak about another topic; which is \nthat today the Supreme Court has agreed to hear oral arguments on the \ncase of United States v. Jones. The case concerns our rights to privacy \nas American citizens. As an American, I believe our government is the \ngreatest government for the potential of every human being and the \ndignity of that human being. Under our Constitution, we had the first \nof any major government in the world to begin to protect that right of \nprivacy, even against the government. It is enshrined in the fourth \namendment to the Constitution.\n  As the Founding Fathers defined it, I think our 18th century fourth \namendment privacy rights--which are covered, including our house and \nour place of business--are well defined and well protected under our \nlaw.\n  The question is this: What about our rights to privacy in the 21st \ncentury? What about the mobile device we carry, the tablet computer, \nthe GPS in our car, and the various other computer devices we have? Do \nwe have a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to this data or \ncan the government access this data and decide they can find out where \nwe have been, whom we have been with, and how long we have been there \nwithout a warrant?\n  Given the fact that the Supreme Court has just taken up oral \narguments in this case, I think it is important for the Senate to back \nthe Wyden-Kirk GPS Act. This is an act that basically says we should \nprotect our rights of privacy in the 21st century as well as the 18th, \n19th, and 20th centuries, that we should not only be secure in our \nhouse and our papers, but we should be secure in our GPS data as well; \nthat if the government seeks to find out where we have been and whom we \nhave been with, at least it needs a warrant--our right as an American \ncitizen protected in that privacy before having access to that \ninformation.\n  I hope we consider this legislation as early as next year because I \nthink we rise to our greatest potential in the Senate when we update \nour rights as Americans, to protect them not just in the 20th century \nbut in the 21st century.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              IAEA REPORT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today the International Atomic Energy \nAgency has issued its latest report on the nuclear weapons development \nprogram of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n  This latest IAEA report is the clearest warning about a potentially \ncatastrophic threat to the United States since the Hart-Rudman \nCommission in January of 2001 predicted a major terrorist attack on our \nhomeland, which, of course, occurred about 9 months later.\n  The IAEA's message today is similarly stark. The extremist terrorist \nregime that rules Iran is actively working to possess nuclear weapons, \nand the time to stop them is running out. The Obama administration \ndeserves credit for rallying the international community to put \nunprecedented diplomatic and economic pressure on the Iranian regime. \nBut the sad fact is nothing the United States and our international \npartners have done has changed Iran's egregious, threatening, and in \nmany cases murderous behavior, its pursuit of nuclear weapons, its \nsponsorship of terrorism, its infiltration of neighboring countries, \nits responsibility for training and equipping terrorists and extremists \nwho have killed literally hundreds of American citizens in Iraq and \nthroughout the Middle East or its repression of its own people.\n  On the contrary, in all of these areas, notwithstanding the \nincreasing international diplomatic and economic pressure on the regime \nin Iran, that regime's behavior has only grown more emboldened and more \nreckless.\n  I know some have argued that the United States and our international \npartners can live with a nuclear Iran and that we can contain it. But \nthe recent discovery of an Iranian terrorist plot, which was to be \ncarried out on U.S. soil, killing the Saudi Ambassador here, targeting \nMembers of Congress, and perhaps eventually the Israeli Ambassador and \nEmbassy provide the clearest possible evidence of why we cannot hope to \ncontain a regime as fanatical, expansionist, and brutal as the one that \nnow rules Iran, particularly when it has the fearsome club of nuclear \nweapons capacity.\n\n  If the Iranian regime acquires a nuclear weapons capability, it will \nbe because the world, including us, allowed that to happen. It is still \nwithin our power to stop it. But it will require, in my opinion, more \nthan further incremental pressure--which is to say more of what we have \nalready been doing, which clearly has not changed the behavior of the \nregime in Tehran.\n  It is time for the United States and our international partners to \nundertake what I would call nonincremental measures against the Iranian \nregime, and among those I would include tough sanctions on its central \nbank. It is also time for Congress to pass the new and tougher Iran \nsanctions legislation, which is in the Banking Committee and which over \nthree-fourths of the Senate, in a very strong bipartisan statement, has \ncosponsored. There is no reason we cannot pass that bill before the end \nof this calendar year.\n  Finally, it is time for the United States and our international \npartners to move beyond the formulation that has grown routine--and I \nam afraid ultimately hollow--which is that ``all options are on the \ntable'' when it comes to Iran's nuclear weapons development program and \nits terrorist actions. It is time for an unequivocal declaration--all \nthe more so in response to the IAEA report today--that we will stop \nIran from acquiring nuclear weapons capability, we and our \ninternational partners--by peaceful means, if we possibly can, but with \nmilitary force if we absolutely must.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Energy Production\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, several weeks ago, on September 28 of this \nyear, I joined three of my Senate colleagues--Senators Shelby, Cornyn, \nand Hutchison--in requesting from the Obama administration and its \nInterior Department a detailed plan about what their new 5-year energy \nlease plan was going to be, as well as their plans for moving forward \nwith scheduled leasing. We finally got some of the answers to that \ntoday as the administration released its new 5-year oil and gas lease \nplan. I guess that is the good news--we finally got our questions \nanswered. There is a lot more bad news, unfortunately, which is what \nthose answers are.\n  It is deeply disappointing that we are not moving forward in a far \nmore aggressive and positive way in developing our own domestic energy \nresources. As I said, today Secretary Salazar introduced President \nObama's plan for the next 5 years of energy production, specifically on \nthe Outer Continental Shelf. For those Members in the Senate and for \nothers who are not as familiar with energy production on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, this is basically the 5-year strategy for us as a \nnation in terms of oil and gas production domestically--what we are \ngoing to do in these next 5 years to produce more of our own energy.\n  The opportunity was enormous. As you remember, a few years ago, in \n2008, there was a bipartisan agreement to lift the decades-long ban on \nnew offshore drilling and to open new areas off the Atlantic coast, off \nthe Pacific Coast, and off the Arctic coast. Those\n\n[[Page S7175]]\n\nopportunities were enormous. This map illustrates what the \nopportunities were given that 2008 lifting of the moratorium.\n  Previously, this had been off limits, this had been off limits--much \nof this had been off limits. But in 2008, on a bipartisan basis, \nCongress--even a Democratic Congress--heard the cry of the American \npeople and said we need to develop more domestic energy resources, so \nwe opened all of these possibilities.\n  Unfortunately, President Obama chose not to take advantage of those \nopportunities because this map represents his new 5-year plan announced \ntoday--the entire Atlantic coast, off limits; the entire Pacific Coast, \noff limits; much of the Alaska coast, off limits; the western gulf of \nMexico, where there has traditionally been significant activity, of \ncourse, is still there, but even the eastern gulf has been withdrawn \nunder related Federal law until 2022. That is deeply disappointing.\n  Put another way, in the previous 5-year lease plan, there were about \n30 sale areas that were outlined to have lease sales, 30 specific areas \naround our Outer Continental Shelf. That was the previous 5-year plan. \nThat plan existed when President Obama took office. One of the first \nthings he did in the energy area, with his Secretary of Interior Ken \nSalazar was to throw that plan out the window almost immediately. This \nwas well before the BP disaster. It was not in reaction to that \ndisaster or anything else specific; they just threw that 5-year lease \nplan out the window. In this new 5-year lease plan--their first in the \nObama administration, which they are announcing today--instead of 30 \ndifferent areas, there are about 15. So they moved backward, cutting in \nhalf the number of lease sales that were planned in the 5-year plan.\n  Put another way, instead of having about six lease sales per year, \nthere are only going to be three. As any fourth grader can tell you, \ndoing that simple math, that is moving backward by a lot. That is going \nfrom about 30 lease sales to half that number--15. That is going from \nabout six a year to half that number--three.\n  Our energy needs are not moving backward. Our desire and need for \nincreased energy independence is not moving backward. Yet our effort \nand our ability to access our own domestic oil and gas on our own Outer \nContinental Shelf under this Obama plan is doing exactly that--it is \nmoving backward.\n  Let me put it a different way. The Outer Continental Shelf of the \nUnited States is about 1.76 billion acres, almost 2 billion acres. But \nof all that vast expanse, only 38 million acres are actually leased. \nThat is 2.16 percent of our entire Outer Continental Shelf. This new 5-\nyear plan increases that a tiny amount at the margin. It keeps it under \n3 percent. With a vast, energy-rich Outer Continental Shelf, we are \nstill 3 percent or under of what we could access under this new plan.\n  Again, we are moving backward from the previous 5-year plan that \nPresident Obama threw out quickly upon taking office. That is deeply \ndisappointing. If I am disappointed, I know there are some folks who \nare even more disappointed, including our colleagues in Virginia. Some \nselect production and lease-sale activity off the Virginia coast was \nplanned in the previous 5-year plan. That is out the window. As you can \nsee, nothing can go on off the Atlantic. Also, four geologic basins off \nsouthern California and one geologic basin off northern California were \nin the previous 5-year plan. That is out the window. That is barred. \nThere is nothing that can happen off the Pacific coast. Even in Alaska, \nthe North Aleutian Basin and the Cook Inlet were in the previous 5-year \nplan. That is zeroed out. That is out the window. That is not in this \nnew 5-year plan.\n  My basic question on this disappointing announcement is simple: How \ndoes excluding all of these areas and how does cutting back the \nprevious 5-year plan to half that amount best meet our national energy \nneeds? It seems to me it is clear it does not. In fact, it eliminates \nincredible job and revenue opportunities as well as our ability to \nincrease energy independence, to produce more domestic energy, all of \nwhich we desperately need to do.\n  As the National Ocean Industries Association puts it:\n\n       A 5-year plan for the Outer Continental Shelf is the most \n     important and defining action an administration takes in \n     providing new oil and gas resources for building economic \n     prosperity in this country.\n\n  They are right. It is the single most defining action with regard to \nOuter Continental Shelf energy production.\n  So with this action today, what is President Obama saying? What is \nhis Interior Secretary saying? He is saying we are moving backward. He \nis saying we are going to do about half of what we were going to do in \nthe previous 5-year plan which he canceled immediately upon taking \noffice. That is very disappointing. It is disappointing for our energy \npicture. It is disappointing in terms of our need to lessen our \nreliance on foreign sources. It is also sadly disappointing in terms of \nthe job picture because every lease sale that happens is thousands upon \nthousands of great American jobs to help build the economy and help \nto get us back out of this horrible recession.\n\n  Finally, it is even deeply disappointing with regard to our challenge \nof lowering the deficit and debt. You know what. With energy \nproduction, the more we do, the more revenue we bring into the Federal \nTreasury to lower deficit and debt. In fact, after the Federal income \ntax, this is the single biggest category of Federal revenue into the \nFederal Treasury--royalties on domestic energy production.\n  So it is domestic energy, it is great American jobs, and it is \nlowering the deficit and debt with more revenue. President Obama today \nhas said no to all of that. He has taken an enormous step backward. He \nhas said, compared to the previous 5-year plan, that we are only doing \nhalf. He said that we are shutting off the Atlantic coast, we are \nshutting off the Pacific coast, and much of the coast off Alaska.\n  Today, I have written Secretary Salazar and expressed these concerns. \nI have asked the Secretary if they will reconsider this step backward \nbecause our country cannot afford it. We cannot afford it in energy \nterms. We cannot afford it in jobs terms. We cannot afford it in \nrevenue terms when we need more revenue to lower deficit and debt. I \nwill be following up aggressively on that letter, trying to understand \nthe rationale behind this step backward and trying to get the Obama \nadministration to reconsider.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n\n\n                             Jobs Creation\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. This last Sunday I was watching an ABC morning news show, \nand Christiane Amanpour was interviewing the Speaker of the House, John \nBoehner of Ohio. Speaker Boehner was asked a number of questions. The \none he clearly wanted to focus on is what he called the Republican jobs \nprogram. He handed to Ms. Amanpour a laminated card which he said was \nthe Republican jobs program that had passed the House of \nRepresentatives and was dying in the Senate. It has never been called \nfor passage. It struck me as odd because I missed that during the \ncourse of this last year that there was a Republican jobs program, and \nI was a little bit worried because we are looking for every opportunity \nwe can to create jobs.\n  So I came back and said to my staff, can you get a copy of this \nlaminated card? I want to see what is written on it. They produced the \ncard for me, and I took a look at it. As a result, I would have to say \nthe Republican view on how to create jobs and move the economy forward \nis considerably different than my own and considerably different than \nthe views of most Americans. What Republicans have proposed doing is \neliminating rules and regulations. They believe that is what is holding \nback the growth of the American economy. One of the areas they \nparticularly focused on is known as the Dodd-Frank bill, the Wall \nStreet reform bill.\n  Some of us are not suffering from political amnesia. We can recall \nwhat\n\n[[Page S7176]]\n\nhappened just a few years ago all across America when at the end of the \nBush administration we faced some of the worst choices I have ever \nheard when we were presented an opportunity by the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, and the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. \nPaulson, to literally bail out the Wall Street banks and major \ninstitutions to the tune of almost $800 billion from the mistakes they \nhad made. So we were given an ultimatum: If we didn't do it, we could \nsee a collapse of our American economy and the global economy. \nReluctantly, many of us voted for that, believing that we had no \nchoice. What we did was to send billions of dollars to banks on Wall \nStreet that had made serious mistakes, creating credit default swaps \nand derivatives, creating offices in London that could skirt the \nAmerican laws and, literally, hanging the American economy out to dry. \nThe net result of that, of course, is that people suffered all across \nAmerica. Individuals lost their savings and their retirements. Families \nwere facing hardship when they were laid off and faced unemployment. \nBusinesses closed and restructured and downsized. The whole economy \nsuffered because of what was clearly wrongdoing on the part of our \nfinancial communities. As a result of that, President Obama said, We \nneed to change the rules and laws in America so there will be adequate \noversight so that we never get in this mess again.\n\n  The first amendment on the Dodd-Frank bill in the Senate was offered \nby Senator Boxer of California, which said this is the end of too big \nto fail. We are never walking down this path again. So we put the \nfinancial institutions and corporations of America on notice that we \nwere not going to bail them out in the future, should they make another \ncolossal mistake, at the expense of workers and families and businesses \nacross America.\n  Then we went through the entire regulatory law as it related to Wall \nStreet, including the stock exchanges and all of the exchanges across \nAmerica, and said, What do we need to do to make certain there is \ntransparency, to make certain the banks that were overleveraged and \nloaning far more than they should are in a position where they are \nfiscally sound, financially sound, and how do we put cops on the beat \non Wall Street through the Securities and Exchange Commission and the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission to guard against this ever \noccurring again? We offered that as Wall Street reform, with the \nsupport of President Obama, but with the support of only three \nRepublican Senators: Senators Brown, Snowe, and Collins. The majority \nof Republican Senators and Congressmen would not support us in this \neffort. We passed it anyway. The President signed it. It is now being \nimplemented, moving forward and, I think, long overdue.\n  It turns out that is one of the first things the Republicans now want \nto eliminate in their effort to build the American economy. I can tell \nmy colleagues we would be building the American economy on a foundation \nof sand if we did that. If we ignored the experience we had a few years \nago when we were forced into this bailout situation, sending billions \nto the biggest bankers in America, and having them turn around and \ndeclare bonuses for their top officers and employees--if we ignore that \nreality and that history and say we were going to follow the Republican \nlead and eliminate this oversight of Wall Street, it would invite \nanother economic disaster. Yet, that is one of the House Republican \nplans for rebuilding the American economy.\n  The financial crisis of 2008 wiped out 8 million jobs in America. \nTwenty-four million Americans today are still suffering--unemployed or \nunderemployed. Millions of families have lost their homes. A report in \nthe Chicago newspapers this morning was stunning and troubling. Almost \n50 percent of the homes in our region in Chicago are under water. What \nit means is families have borrowed more in their mortgages than their \nhome is currently valued. That is a troubling development, but it is a \nreality. It reflects what happened when the overanxious and \noverinflated real estate market got out of hand. We don't want that to \nhappen again. If we are going to avoid it, we have to have appropriate \noversight and regulation.\n  Many families have seen their home values plummet, not just in \nChicago but nationwide. Their retirement savings have been cut in half \nover the last 4 years. In Illinois and across America, solid, well-run \ncompanies, many in business for decades, have been shaken to the core \nfor the lack of credit and the lack of customers.\n  So what do our Republican colleagues offer as a solution? What is the \nRepublican jobs plan? Incredibly, they have responded to America's \neconomic crisis not by rethinking their deregulation dogma, but by \ndoubling down. Let me explain.\n  In addition to repealing Wall Street reform, Republicans are trying \nto change the most basic protections we have in America for clean air \nand pure drinking water. Think about this: The Republican majority in \nthe House has voted 168 times this year--168 times--to undercut clean \nair and clean water laws and to block efforts to limit global warming, \nprotect public health, protect the public lands we have been left by \nprevious generations, and guard against things such as future \noilspills. They voted 168 times just this year, and they are not \nfinished.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have attached more than \n50 anti-environmental policy riders so far to spending bills for next \nyear. They are unrelenting. I won't go into all of the environmental \nand public health protections the Republicans are trying to block. Let \nme focus on two. Republicans have used the Senate's expedited \nprocedures to place bills blocking these two new rules directly on the \nSenate calendar rather than going through the regular order.\n  It is their right to do that. They are saying, in effect, we don't \nhave time for the normal rules. We don't have time to hear from \nscientists or the American people. We need to bury these rules right \nnow.\n  The first rule they want to delay is the boiler MACT rule. It is an \nacronym that stands for maximum achievable controlled technology. The \nboiler MACT rule would reduce the amount of mercury, dioxins, acid \ngases, and other toxic pollutants that can be emitted by large \nindustrial boilers and solid waste incinerators. Is that the key to \nbuilding jobs in America, large industrial boilers spewing more toxic \nchemicals into the air, solid waste incinerators burning without the \nregulations to protect the people who happen to live downwind? These \nchemicals can cause cancer, heart, lung, and kidney disease, damage to \neyes and skin, impair brain development in children and babies, and \nlearning ability, and they can kill people. That is a fact.\n  The other new clean air rule in the crosshairs from the Republicans \nis the so-called cross-State air pollution rule. It would require \nsignificant reductions in two toxic chemicals--sulfur dioxide and \nnitrogen oxide--released by electric powerplants. These chemicals not \nonly cause sickness and death, they can spread hundreds of miles \ndownwind and across State lines.\n\n  Many States can't develop new jobs and industries because they have \nreached their air pollution limits under national clean air standards, \nnot because of what they are doing in their States, but rather for the \nwind that is blowing from other States with pollution. It puts them \nover the limit for emissions that travel from old coal-burning \npowerplants in other States. That is not right, and it is not fair.\n  The cross-State air pollution rule would set new limits on sulfur \ndioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions and establish an emissions cap-\nand-trade system for 31 Eastern States and the District of Columbia. It \nis a reasonable, market-based solution to a serious public health \nthreat. The Republicans would abolish it.\n  Both the boiler MACT rule and the cross-State air pollution rule \nreplace rules that were developed by the EPA as far back as the Bush \nadministration--rules that were stricken by the DC Circuit Court. In \nboth cases, the court ordered the EPA to come up with a new rule. House \nRepublicans have already passed a bill to delay these new air pollution \nquality standards for at least 15 months, and here in the Senate, they \nwould delay them for up to 5 years. As for the cross-State air \npollution rule, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has introduced a \nresolution of disapproval to kill it altogether so there will be no \nstandard, so if a person happens to live downwind from a polluting \npowerplant and that person's\n\n[[Page S7177]]\n\nState is trying to do its best to clean up its act, it is to no avail. \nThe air pollution quality will be so bad in that State because of the \nneighboring State that people will face serious problems and \nrestrictions in their own development.\n  The House has taken an even more radical approach. They voted almost \nentirely along party lines, passing a Republican bill called the TRAIN \nAct, that would delay indefinitely the cross-State air pollution rule, \nand another lifesaving rule, the mercury and air toxics standard. The \nTRAIN Act would also overturn the legal requirement that EPA's public \nhealth rules be based on the best advice of scientists, not the demands \nof politicians or their donors. It is the most serious attack on the \nClean Air Act since the law was passed 40 years ago under Republican \nPresident Richard M. Nixon.\n  President Obama has already said he is going to veto any bills that \nwould delay the new clean air rules. Our Republican colleagues know \nthey don't have the votes to override his veto, so once again they are \nforcing the Senate to debate measures they know have no chance--zero \nchance--of becoming law.\n  And that is the Republican jobs plan.\n  Republicans say Federal agencies should analyze the cost of business \nof every new regulation, whether it is meant to protect against Wall \nStreet recklessness, offshore oil disasters, lead-based toys, or killer \ncantaloupes. If a regulation hurts the corporate bottom line, the \nRepublicans argue it shouldn't be passed.\n  I have a counterproposal for my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. Any politician who proposes deregulating an industry ought to be \nrequired to tell the public how much money deregulation would cost, how \nmany jobs might be lost, how many lives may be cut short, how many \nchildren and other members of our families may end up in the hospital, \nand how much of our Nation's natural treasures may be scarred or \ndestroyed. Let's have an honest assessment on both sides of the ledger.\n  When I travel across my State, much like in the Presiding Officer's \nState, we have big cities and small towns. I go to schools and talk to \nkids, and usually they have the common questions--do you have a \nlimousine, how much money do you make--things that kids ask. So I ask \nquestions back to them. One question I have started asking in every \nschool is the following: How many of you know someone who is suffering \nfrom asthma? Without fail, more than half the hands will go up. In \nMount Sterling, IL, a small farm town down in Brown County in downstate \nIllinois, half the hands went up. I guarantee that in every classroom \nin the city of Chicago, more than half of the hands will go up. Asthma \nhas become an epidemic in America and is related to many things, \nincluding the quality of the air we breathe. On the South Side of \nChicago, it is hard to find a child who doesn't suffer from asthma.\n  In 2007, the cost of asthma-related hospitalizations in Illinois \ntotaled $280 million. The average stay costs $15,000 for an asthma \ncase, and nearly 60 percent of those hospital costs were paid for by \ntaxpayers through Medicaid and Medicare. Air pollution makes asthma \nworse. If we reduce air pollution we can reduce asthma attacks, asthma-\nrelated deaths, and save taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year \njust for the cost of treating that single disease. That is something we \nnever hear when the disciples of deregulation start preaching.\n  Here are some other facts we won't hear about deregulation from the \nderegulation devotees. The new boiler MACT rule will create jobs, not \neliminate them. It would prevent between 2,500 and 6,500 premature \ndeaths each year, and it would save between $22 billion and $54 billion \na year in health care costs.\n  The cross-State air pollution rule, which they would also abolish, \nwould also net thousands of new jobs, prevent 400,000 cases of \naggravated asthma and 34,000 premature deaths each year, and save $280 \nbillion in health care costs. In my State alone, the cross-State rule \nwill save 1,500 lives a year and provide enough public health benefits \nto save our State $12 billion. Twelve billion dollars in Illinois--that \nis more than Illinois spent on health, hospitals, and highways combined \nin the year 2009.\n  Deregulation is a costly gamble even for businesses that are \nderegulated. During the last administration, oil companies were allowed \nto self-regulate under the Bush administration. How did that work in \nthe Gulf of Mexico with British Petroleum? The gulf oilspill is the \nworst industrial environmental disaster in U.S. history. \nCongratulations, self-regulators.\n  Local businesses suffered $4 billion to $12 billion in lost income \nbecause of self-regulation by a major oil company. BP alone is likely \nto spend $40 billion in claims, fines, and other expenses from this \nhistoric, awful spill.\n  Those who push for deregulation tell us environmental rules are job \nkillers and nothing but a burden on businesses and consumers. They are \nwrong. Regulations that are well designed are, to borrow a phrase from \nour Republican friends, job creators. They can spur innovation and \ncreate new products, new jobs, even whole new industries. A study \npublished by the Political Economy Research Institute at the University \nof Massachusetts-Amherst estimates that new air pollution rules for \nelectric powerplants ``will provide long-term economic benefits across \nmuch of the United States in the form of highly skilled, well-paid jobs \nthrough infrastructure investment.''\n  Specifically, researchers found that clean air investments could \ncreate 1.5 million new jobs in 2015 right here at home. Let me bring \nthis story closer to home. Recently I made a trip in Illinois to a new \ncoal-fired plant. It is a plant that is amazing. It is called the \nPrairie State Energy Campus and it is owned by a number of electric \ncooperatives. It has a $1 billion investment in the clean use of coal \nto produce electricity. They took a look at the law, and instead of \nhiring lawyers to fight it, they hired engineers to comply with it.\n\n  The plant is up and running. It is a marvel to behold. Right across \nfrom this plant is a coal mine, and the coal that is drawn from that \nmine goes into this plant and meets all the specifications required \ntoday by the EPA. The people who are running this plant are not whining \nand crying and begging for relief. They rolled up their sleeves and \nbuilt a plant much cleaner than anything that existed in the United \nStates, and they are proving it can be profitable.\n  I wish my Republican friends would come to the Prairie State Energy \nCampus. They should see and know that 4,000 union jobs were created for \nthe construction of this plant, and they expect to have 500 permanent \nlocal jobs to boost the Illinois economy by $785 million a year with \nour own local coal.\n  The campus includes two generators that will produce 1,600 megawatts \nof clean, low-cost energy for more than 2.5 million customers in the \nMidwest. It is going to go online by the end of this year.\n  By using the latest technology, the plant's carbon dioxide emissions \nwill be 15 percent lower than what is typically discharged from U.S. \ncoal-fired powerplants.\n  In addition, the plant is going to save an estimated 200,000 tons of \ncarbon dioxide each year by using coal from an adjacent mine instead of \nmining it in some other place and shipping it to the site of the power \ngeneration.\n  One hundred-sixty coal miners are working in the adjacent mine. I \nwent there. It was not my first visit to a coal mine, but it is always \nan eye-opener to go in and see how they mine coal today. Two weeks ago, \nPrairie State announced plans to hire even more miners.\n  In Illinois, incidentally, coal miners make a pretty decent wage, \n$65,000 a year. So these are good jobs, right here in America, mining \ncoal to be used in a clean coal plant. It can be done. The Republicans \nought to acknowledge it can be done, and new jobs are being created in \nthe process, while we are reducing air pollution.\n  In a recent survey, two out of three Americans say they support new \nclean air rules and oppose what the Republicans are trying to do in the \nname of job creation. Nearly 90 percent of all Americans--nearly 60 \npercent of Republicans and conservatives, I might add--said Congress \nshould not prevent the EPA from enforcing the new rules. I wish my \nRepublican friends, who are so dead set on eliminating these standards \nfor air and water pollution, would listen to the people across America \nwho want cleaner air and purer drinking water and are willing to see \nreasonable regulations to reach those goals.\n  The push to kill the new clean air rules is not coming from the \nAmerican\n\n[[Page S7178]]\n\npeople. It is part of a huge power grab. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nand Republicans in Congress have launched an unprecedented \nantiregulation campaign. The Chamber is reportedly spending millions of \ndollars to push the message that regulations are job killers. Their \ngoal is to roll back existing environmental, health, financial, and \nother regulatory protections and to block any new protections. They are \nusing the American jobs crisis to try to push through an agenda that \nwill increase our deficit, actually take away jobs in America, and \ncause thousands of Americans to get sick and some to die.\n  Just cut taxes on millionaires and billionaires and get rid of \ngovernment regulation and, they believe, we can get the economy humming \nagain. That is their credo. If that were true, the last administration \nwould have been the most prosperous in our history because that is the \nmessage and philosophy and agenda that guided the Bush administration. \nInstead, in the words of the Wall Street Journal--not exactly a \nDemocratic publication--George Bush's administration produced ``the \nworst jobs record on record.''\n  We have tried this. It does not work. We have seen this movie. We \nknow how it ends. This notion of protecting millionaires from any taxes \nand repealing any laws related to the regulation of our economy did not \nwork under the Bush administration and should not be tried again.\n  The reason 2 million Americans are out of work has nothing to do with \nexcessive financial or environmental regulation. If anything, our \neconomy is hurting because we do not have the appropriate regulation in \nplace now to avoid the excesses of the past.\n  To say we cannot create jobs without allowing dangerous levels of \ntoxic chemicals into our air and water is an absolutely false choice. \nWe have to find an approach that protects the health of American \nfamilies and balances the needs of business and is based on the reality \nof science.\n  For 40 years, Democrats and Republicans used to work together on this \nagenda. We need to do it again. In the meantime, if our Republican \ncolleagues want to create good middle-class jobs here at home, let's \npass the President's American Jobs Act. This will not only create jobs, \nit will fund infrastructure and road repairs. It will cut payroll taxes \nfor working families, saving the average family about $1,500 a year, \nand extend badly needed unemployment benefits for those out of work. It \nwill keep hundreds of thousands of teachers in the classroom and cops \nand firefighters on the job in our neighborhoods and communities.\n  That is the way to create good jobs. America does not need dirty \nwater and dirty air to create good-paying jobs. I hope the Republican \nagenda, even if it is laminated on a card passed out by Speaker John \nBoehner, will realize we can do better in this country by not \ncompromising our public health and the great Nation in which we live.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Veterans Support\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I would like to take a moment to honor \nand thank those who have earned the noble title of ``veteran.''\n  The 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month marked the end of \nWorld War I. Since then, this date has been celebrated first as \nArmistice Day and now as Veterans Day, but no matter what we call it, \nit serves the purpose of honoring our Nation's heroes--those who have \nserved in the military, our veterans.\n  As the son of a World War II veteran who served as a waist gunner on \nB-17s, I grew up in a family with values rooted in military tradition. \nMy father remained in the military until he retired from the Air Force \nas a master sergeant after 20 years of service. At an early age, my \nbrother, my sister, and I were taught about the sacrifices our men and \nwomen in uniform make. Growing up in this environment gave us an \nunderstanding of the unique challenges military families face--an \nunderstanding that guides my efforts today.\n  My mom would continually remind me of my responsibility as a public \nservant to keep our promises to those who served our Nation in uniform. \nUp until her recent passing, one of the first questions she would ask \nwhenever I saw her would inevitably be: What have you done for veterans \nlately?\n  I was always able to answer that question with a clean conscience \nwhile serving in the House and now in the Senate. Despite how divided \nwe can be on other issues, Democrats and Republicans come together--\nmore often than not--to pass policies that will enhance the quality of \nlife for both our veterans and their families.\n  Today, in the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, we are working to \nsecure the benefits our veterans deserve and improve existing benefits \nto meet the needs of more than 23 million American veterans, including \n257,000 who call Arkansas home.\n  It is most important for all of us to remember the reason we are \nworking to improve veterans' benefits: the men and women of our Armed \nForces and their families. Through their selfless sacrifice, we are \nprotected from our enemies. They make the United States a safer place \nto live. They have heard our Nation's call and met the challenge with \ntheir service. It is now up to us to ensure our veterans have access to \nall the opportunities our great Nation has to offer.\n  Taking care of our veterans is the responsibility of every American.\n  It is important that we all continue to serve our veterans and \nreflect on those who served in conflicts around the globe, as well as \nthose who are serving today in support of the war on terror in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Let's also reflect on the sacrifices of those who have \ngiven their last full measure of devotion.\n  In September I came to the Senate floor to honor the lives of five \nArkansans who were killed in action this year. Last week, sadly, we \nlost a sixth member from Arkansas this year, SPC Sarina N. Butcher, who \nfollowed in the footsteps of her grandfather and brother and joined the \nmilitary in April 2010. As a member of the Oklahoma National Guard, she \nserved as an automated logistical specialist, but her ultimate goal was \nto become a nurse.\n  At the tender age of 19, this Crossett, AR, native and mother to a \nbeautiful little girl was killed in an IED explosion in Afghanistan on \nNovember 1. We are grateful for her service and her sacrifice. We are \nforever indebted to her and to every American who has worn the uniform \nand sacrificed their own safety and security for that of the American \npeople.\n  Every day the men and women of our Armed Forces stand in defense of \nour Nation and our cherished way of life. They do so regardless of \ncosts, fully aware they may be called to pay the ultimate price for \ntheir country.\n  This week, communities across the country gather to express our \nundying gratitude for those who have worn our Nation's uniform. Let's \nalways honor the service of those who have served and those on the \nfront lines as we address the important challenges facing the Nation.\n  To all of our veterans and their families, I say thank you on behalf \nof a grateful nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                             Postal Service\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, there are two issues I would like to \ntouch upon this afternoon which I think are significantly important to \nthe people of our country.\n  On Sunday, 2 days ago, I held a town meeting in Montpelier, VT, on \nthe issue of saving the Postal Service. Frankly, I was stunned by the \nnumber of people who came. As you know, Vermont is not the largest \nState in the Nation, and yet we had about 350 people crowding into the \ncafeteria at Montpelier High School to say very clearly that they do \nnot want to see the Postal Service dismembered. They do not want to see \npolicies develop that will create a death spiral for the post offices \nof America.\n  We heard a lot of testimony from many people, and the bottom line is \nthat everybody in that room thought it\n\n[[Page S7179]]\n\nwas terribly wrong that in the midst of a recession the post office is \ntalking about cutting 120,000 good-paying jobs in our country. It \ndidn't make sense to anybody in that room.\n  I find it ironic that at a moment when, appropriately enough--and I \nstrongly support the effort--we are talking about creating jobs for \nveterans who are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan, with high \nunemployment rates, many of the people who work in the post office are, \nin fact, veterans. On one hand, we are trying to create jobs for \nveterans; on the other hand, if the Postal Service does what it wants, \nwe may end up losing 120,000 jobs, including many veterans.\n  I wanted to touch on some of the important issues that I think we \nhave to deal with regarding the Postal Service. I want to just go over \na letter that Senators Leahy, Gillibrand, Wyden, and myself sent to the \nchairpeople and ranking members of the Committee on Homeland Security \nand the subcommittee as well; that is, Senators Lieberman, Collins, \nCarper, and Scott Brown. These are the points we made in the letter. \nThese are points that will be incorporated into legislation that I will \nbe introducing this week--legislation that I think is commonsense \nlegislation, legislation that will help us create a business model so \nthe Postal Service can be successful, legislation that will save \n120,000 jobs.\n  This is what we wrote in the letter to the Homeland Security \nCommittee. A lot of people don't know this. They say correctly that the \nPostal Service is having problems because we are in a digital age, and \nfirst class mail is going down because people are e-mailing. That is \ntrue.\n  Second, we are in the midst of a recession and many businesses are \nfacing problems. But the most important financial problems facing the \npost office today are not those issues; they are the issues of \naccounting approaches that have done great disservice to the Postal \nService.\n  The U.S. Postal Service uniquely has been forced to prefund 75 years' \nworth of future retiree health benefits in just 10 years. There is no \nother agency of government that comes close to that onerous \nrequirement, nor do we believe there are any companies in the private \nsector that have been asked to do that. We are asking the Postal \nService to come up with a huge amount of money and put it into a fund \nin a way that no other agency of government--and we think no other \nprivate company--has been forced to do.\n  This mandate costs the Postal Service between $5.4 billion and $5.8 \nbillion per year, and it accounts for 100 percent of the Postal \nService's $20 billion debt. Without that onerous requirement, the USPS \nwould still have significant borrowing authority with the U.S. Treasury \nto ride out the tough economic times we are seeing in the recession.\n  Furthermore, it is not only future retiree health benefits they are \nbeing asked to come up with and fund, but the USPS needs to recoup the \noverpayments it has made to the CSRS and FERS, the Federal retirement \nsystem. According to studies by the Hay Group and the Segal Company, \nUSPS has overpaid the CSRS by between $50 billion and $75 billion. If \nwe look at those two issues, if we can deal with those issues and treat \nthe Postal Service fairly, we will have gone a very long way toward \naddressing the immediate financial crisis the Postal Service is facing.\n  Second, what we want to be very careful about as we develop business \nmodels for the future is to not start cutting, cutting, cutting, and \ncreating a Postal Service that will no longer have customer support and \nlay the groundwork for literally a death spiral and the destruction and \ndemise of the Postal Service in years to come.\n  I come from a rural State. Post Offices are extremely important to \nthe people of small towns above and beyond getting mail. They become, \nin a sense, in some ways, the identifying feature of a small town. It \nis where people come together and talk. It is very important, in my \nmind, that we not start cutting pell-mell hundreds and hundreds of \nsmall post offices in rural America. I think the legislation we will be \noffering this week addresses that problem in a sensible and reasonable \nway.\n\n  Second of all, the Postal Service can never be competitive if when \nyou drop a letter into a postal box it takes 5 days for that letter to \nget to its destination. One of the ideas that the Postal Service is \ntalking about is making very significant cuts in what they call \nprocessing centers. That is where the mail is gathered and forwarded. \nIf we cut those centers--in my State, we have two that are on the line, \nEssex Junction and Wright River Junction. If we cut those and other \nprocessing centers all over the country, what will happen is that when \nwe drop that letter into a mailbox, it could take up to 5 days for that \nletter to reach its destination. When we have that poor service, people \nare simply going to stop using the post office, and that continues the \ndeath spiral. People are not going to want to use the service.\n  Thirdly, and in the same vein, the Postal Service is now talking \nabout cutting Saturday delivery. Again, that means there are a whole \nlot of folks who get prescription drugs on Saturday, and a whole lot of \npeople who get a magazine or newspapers on Saturday--if we cut that \nback, people are going to say: No, I don't want to deal with the post \noffice anymore. It is not worth it.\n  So it seems to me the choice we have is to do what the Postal Service \nis now talking about; that is, cut and eliminate rural post offices, \nend Saturday mail delivery, cut and eliminate significant numbers of \nprocessing centers, which will slow down the delivery of mail--that is \none approach--and lay off, by the way, some 120,000 American workers, \nincluding many veterans. That is a very bad idea.\n  The other approach is to come up with a business model that \nrecognizes that we are in the 21st century; that the post office has to \nevolve and change and give the post office the freedom to compete in a \nway that addresses the needs of its customers. I will give an example.\n  The Presiding Officer comes from a rural State, as I do. A lot of \npeople in our States want to get fishing licenses or hunting licenses. \nIf they walked into a post office in rural New Hampshire or rural \nVermont and said: Hey, can I fill out an application to get a fishing \nor hunting license, the post office would say they we don't do that, \nthey are not permitted to do that.\n  If an individual literally wants to walk into a post office--and \npostmasters tell me this happens every day--and say: I have a letter, \nand I want it notarized, they may be a notary public, but they are not \nallowed by law to notarize that.\n  The issue of the digital revolution is obviously impacting post \noffices not only in the United States but around the world. Other \ncountries are looking at these challenges in a way that we are not. I \nwill give one more example.\n  For a lot of reasons--legal and otherwise--there are people who would \nlike to see a document delivered to somebody in writing and not simply \nin e-mail. There are post offices now in other countries where one can \nsend an e-mail, say, from Vermont to California, it gets printed, and \non the same day that document gets delivered to a business or a home. \nThe post office in America is not allowed to do that. So by law our \npost office is restricted from entering the 21st century.\n  If somebody walks into a post office now and says they want to print \nup 10 copies of a document, so where is the copying machine, the \npostmaster would say they don't have one, that they are not allowed to \nhave a copy machine.\n  There are a lot of ideas out there that people are talking about as \nto how the Postal Service can address the needs of customers in the \n21st century.\n  Last, but not least, on this issue, one of the people at the town \nmeeting on Sunday got up and said: I want to say this. In our town, we \nknow our letter carrier very well. Our letter carrier noticed that mail \nremained in the mail box of an elderly person, and the mailman got on \nthe phone and called the police department because he suspected that \nsomething was wrong.\n  It turns out that something was wrong and that person's life was \nsaved. I expect that happens all over this country. We have hundreds of \nthousands of letter carriers who know people, interact with people. \nThey do play and can more so play an important role in providing \nservices.\n  Bottom line, Madam President, I think it is a bad idea in the midst \nof a\n\n[[Page S7180]]\n\nrecession to slash 120,000 jobs, including jobs of many of our \nveterans. Second, I do believe if we use our brains and entrepreneurial \nspirit, we can create a post office that is very relevant and can be \nprofitable in the 21st century.\n  We will be introducing legislation addressing all of these issues, \nand I hope very much that my colleagues will cosponsor that \nlegislation.\n\n\n                              Tax Fairness\n\n  Madam President, there is another issue I want to talk about, and \nthat is the work of the supercommittee. This country has a \nrecordbreaking deficit. It has a $14-plus trillion national debt, and I \nthink all of the American people--or virtually all--want to see the \nsupercommittee come up with a proposal which makes sense and which \nhelps us address our deficit crisis. My suggestion to the \nsupercommittee is that they, in fact, can do that by simply doing what \nthe American people want them to do.\n  I have heard some of the ideas out there, where members of the \nsupercommittee are talking about cutting Social Security, which has not \ncontributed one nickel to our deficit and has a $2\\1/2\\ trillion \nsurplus, and another idea being that we have to cut Medicare and \nMedicaid. Well, we have 50 million people without any health insurance. \nI don't think it is a brilliant idea to throw more and more people off \nhealth insurance. So I think those are bad ideas, and every single poll \nI have seen tells me the American people agree those are dumb ideas.\n  Meanwhile, I have seen and talked to a whole lot of people who are \nasking me this question: How is it, when the wealthiest people in this \ncountry are becoming much wealthier, when the effective tax rates of \nthe top 2 percent are the lowest in decades, that we are not asking \nthose people who are doing phenomenally well to start paying their fair \nshare of taxes?\n  This is not just a progressive idea and it is not just a Democratic \nidea. The polls suggest that all across the political spectrum, the \nAmerican people are saying: Yes, it is right and appropriate that the \nwealthiest people in this country start paying their fair share of \ntaxes.\n  I will just mention an ABC News-Washington Post October 5, 2011, poll \nreflecting that 75 percent of Independents support raising taxes on \nmillionaires. In that same poll, 57 percent of Republicans support \nraising taxes on millionaires. In that same poll, 55 percent of tea \nparty supporters--supposedly the extreme rightwing who want to abolish \nSocial Security and Medicare and Medicaid, which turns out not to be \nthe case at all--agree with raising taxes on millionaires. According to \na June 2011 Washington Post poll, 72 percent of Americans support \nraising taxes on incomes over $250,000.\n  So I think we know what the American people want. They do not want, \nin poll after poll, to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid \nbecause they know how vitally important those programs are to the well-\nbeing of tens of millions of Americans. For example, according to a \nFebruary 2011 NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll, 77 percent of \nAmericans are opposed to cutting Social Security to reduce the deficit.\n  So where are we as a country? We are pretty united. We are in \nagreement. What the American people are saying is that the rich are \ngetting richer, their effective real tax rates have gone down, and they \nhave to pay more in taxes to help us through deficit reduction and to \ncreate jobs.\n  The American people also understand there are huge corporate \nloopholes out there, with oil companies making money hand over fist and \ngetting huge tax breaks and Wall Street getting huge tax breaks. We \nlose $100 billion a year because large companies and the wealthy put \ntheir money into tax havens in the Cayman Islands, in Bermuda, and in \nPanama. The people of this country know that is wrong.\n  I hope very much that the supercommittee will do nothing more than \nlisten to the American people. That is all. If they do that, they will \ndo the right thing. They will not suggest that we cut Social Security, \nMedicare, and Medicaid, but they will suggest that the wealthiest \npeople in this country start paying their fair share of taxes. They \nwill recommend that we do away with these outrageous loopholes large \nprofitable corporations enjoy. If they do that, we will, in fact, come \nup with an agreement that will help us reduce the deficit, and we will \nwin the support of Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Human Rights in Russia\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, I have come to the floor on a number of \noccasions to voice my concern about the deteriorating rule of law and \nthe lack of respect for human rights in Russia, primarily highlighting \nthe cases of Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev.\n  The fact that Khodorkovsky and Lebedev remain in jail is deplorable. \nBut I rise to speak about another case, in which a man who opposed the \ngovernment not only went to jail but died there. I choose my words \ncarefully this afternoon, knowing that they will be disturbing to many \nand that a number of people within the Russian Government will take \ngreat offense. But I want everyone within the sound of my voice to know \nthat I am choosing my words carefully.\n  Sergei Magnitsky was a lawyer and a partner with an American-owned \nlaw firm based in Moscow. He was married, with two children. His \nclients included the Hermitage Fund, which is the largest foreign \nportfolio investor in Russia.\n  Through Sergei Magnitsky's investigative work on behalf of Hermitage, \nit was discovered that Russian Interior Ministry officers, tax \nofficials, and organized criminals worked together to steal $230 \nmillion in public funds, orchestrating the largest tax rebate fraud in \nRussian history. As Magnitsky would come to find out, this group had \nfraudulently reregistered three investment companies of the Hermitage \nFund and embezzled from the Russian Treasury all of the profits, taxes, \nthat these companies had paid, and did so under the guise of a tax \nrefund.\n  In October of 2008, Magnitsky voluntarily gave sworn testimony \nagainst officials from the Interior Ministry, against Russian tax \ndepartments, and the private criminals who he found had perpetrated the \nfraud. A month later, Interior Ministry officers came to his Moscow \napartment, arrested him in front of his wife and two children, and \nthrew him in pretrial detention.\n  At the same time, the Russian Federal Security Service claimed there \nwas evidence that Magnitsky had applied for a U.K. visa and that he was \nconsidered a flight risk. The Russian courts used this to prolong the \nterm of his detention without a trial to 12 months. I should note that \nthe British Embassy in Moscow has confirmed that Mr. Magnitsky had not \napplied for a U.K. visa since the year 2002, and so the pretrial \ndetention was based on a fabrication.\n  Once in custody, Magnitsky was pressured and tortured by officials, \nhoping he would withdraw his testimony, and asking him to falsely \nincriminate himself and his client. They placed Mr. Magnitsky in an \novercrowded cell with no heat, no window panes, no toilet, and kept \nlights on all night in order to deprive him of sleep. Each time he \nrefused to withdraw his testimony against the officials, his conditions \nworsened--as did his health. He lost 40 pounds and developed severe \npancreatitis and gallstones.\n  On July 25, 2009, 1 week before a planned operation by detention \ncenter doctors, Mr. Magnitsky was transferred to a maximum security \ndetention center with no medical facilities. He spent the next 4 months \nof his life without any medical care. All of his requests for medical \nexamination and surgery were denied by the Russian Government \nofficials.\n  The Interior Ministry officials managing Magnitsky's detention \nrefused\n\n[[Page S7181]]\n\nfamily visits as ``inexpedient to the investigation.'' From the time of \nhis arrest, Magnitsky saw his wife only once. He never saw his children \nagain after his arrest.\n  During his 358 days in detention, Mr. Magnitsky wrote more than 450 \npetitions requesting medical attention and challenging his cruel \ntreatment, the denial of legal remedies, and protesting his being taken \nhostage by the very Interior Ministry officials he had testified \nagainst. Every petition filed was either ignored or rejected by Russian \nauthorities.\n  On November 13, 2009, Sergei Magnitsky's condition worsened \ndramatically. Doctors saw him on November 16, when he was transferred \nto a Moscow detention center that had medical facilities. Instead of \nbeing delivered to the detention center hospital and actually treated \nimmediately, Mr. Magnitsky was placed in an isolation cell, reportedly \nhandcuffed, beaten, and he died in that cell.\n  On the day following Mr. Magnitsky's death, detention center \nofficials informed his lawyers that he had died from a rupture of his \nabdominal membrane and toxic shock. That same day, although detention \ncenter facilities had said abdominal membrane and toxic shock, the \nofficial cause of his death was changed to heart failure. Indeed.\n  Two requests by his family for an independent autopsy were rejected \nby Russian authorities. A week after Mr. Magnitsky's death, senior \nRussian Interior Officials publicly claimed that Magnitsky was not sick \nat all in detention. Seven months after his death, Interior Ministry \nofficials claimed they were not aware of Magnitsky's complaints and \nrequests for medical assistance. Ten months after his death, the \nRussian state investigative committee claimed that Magnitsky was not \npressured and tortured but died naturally of heart disease. His death, \nthe committee claimed, was ``nobody's fault.'' Nearly 2 years after \nMagnitsky's death, not a single person has been prosecuted for his \nfalse arrest, for his torture, for his murder in custody, or for the \n$230 million theft he exposed.\n\n  Some may question the facts I have outlined today. Are they in \ndispute? I would point out that on November 23, 2009, 1 week after Mr. \nMagnitsky's death, the chair of President Medvedev's Human Rights \nCouncil publicly raised Magnitsky's death with President Medvedev. The \nfollowing day, President Medvedev ordered the General Prosecutor and \nthe Justice Minister of Russia to investigate the death. The \ninvestigation was limited and did not result in any criminal \nprosecutions.\n  However, on December 28, 2009, the Moscow Public Oversight \nCommission, an independent watchdog mandated under Russian law to \nmonitor human rights abuses in Moscow prisons and detention centers, \nissued its conclusions on the Magnitsky case. The report stated that in \ndetention, Magnitsky had been subjected to torturous conditions, \nphysical and psychological pressure, and was denied medical care. \nMoreover, the members of this courageous Commission concluded that his \nright to life had been violated by the Russian State--by the Russian \nState. These conclusions were sent to the Russian General Prosecutor's \nOffice, the Russian State Investigative Committee, the Russian Ministry \nof Justice, the Presidential Administration, and the Federal \nPenitentiary Service. None of the government agencies responded to any \nof the report's conclusions.\n  Then, on July 5, 2011--this year--the Russian President's Human \nRights Council issued its independent expert findings on the Magnitsky \ncase. The report found the following: that Mr. Magnitsky was arrested \non trumped-up charges in breach of Russian law and the European Human \nRights Convention; that his prosecution was unlawful; that he was \nsystematically denied medical care; that he was beaten in custody, \nwhich was a proximate cause of his death; that his medical records were \nfalsified; and that there is an ongoing coverup and resistance by all \ngovernment bodies to investigate. Thank heaven for the intrepid members \nof the Russian President's Human Rights Council.\n  While little has been done inside Russia regarding that case, action \nhas been taken here in the United States. In May 2011, I joined Senator \nBen Cardin in introducing the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law \nAccountability Act. The bill extends the application of visa and \neconomic sanctions to officials in the Magnitsky case and in other \ncases of gross human rights abuses. The legislation currently has 23 \nsponsors, and I urge all of my colleagues to consider joining us on \nthis bill. Join us on this bill today.\n  On September 16, 2011, 15 leading human rights activists and \nrepresentatives of the Russian civil society issued an open letter \nurgently calling on this Congress to pass this legislation. The letter \nstates:\n\n       Sergei Magnitsky has become a victim of the inhumane \n     Russian justice system. Many Russian citizens are unlawfully \n     deprived of liberty due to the travesties of this system. The \n     impunity of those who have fabricated the case against \n     Magnitsky and have persecuted him opens the door for other \n     officials who enrich themselves with stolen property and \n     target political opponents of the re-\n     gime. . . .\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n       The consistent application of international pressure on \n     corrupt members of the ruling establishment would \n     significantly support our civil society and those honest \n     individuals inside the Russian power structures who are \n     trying to revamp and reform the existing government \n     institutions.\n\n  The letter concludes:\n\n       We urge you--\n\n  They urge us, the Members of Congress--\n\n     to adopt the ``Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability \n     Act of 2011'' without any delay.\n\n  We in the Senate should be standing in support of the principled, \nfearless Russian citizens who have the courage to expose these corrupt \nabuses, to expose the brutality and thuggery of their own Russian \nGovernment.\n  I urge President Obama and I urge Secretary Clinton to make human \nrights and rule of law in Russia a central part of our efforts to reset \nbilateral relations. Without commitment to these basic principles, our \nefforts to find common ground on other issues of mutual concern will \ncontinue to be undermined.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Cross-State Air Pollution Rule\n\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I rise to discuss S.J. Res. 27, a \nresolution of disapproval of the cross-State air pollution rule. I \nappreciate my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, for bringing his \nconcerns forward through this resolution. However, this is an issue I \nhave been extensively involved in as New Hampshire's former attorney \ngeneral, and I believe this resolution is misguided. This issue \nrequires a balanced approach, and when looking at environmental \nregulations, we must review each on a case-by-case basis. In that vein, \nI cannot support this resolution.\n  The cross-State air pollution rule is designed to control emissions \nof air pollution that cause air quality problems in downwind States--\nand New Hampshire is a downwind State--and is estimated to reduce \npowerplant sulfur dioxide emissions by 73 percent and emissions from \nnitrogen oxides by 54 percent from 2005 levels.\n  It is important to note that similar pollution standards have been in \nplace for 6 years--first implemented by the Bush administration in \n2005--and many utilities have already taken steps to comply with the \nrule.\n  The rule encourages the use of the best technology available so \ndownwind States such as New Hampshire will be able to achieve national \nclean air standards. Without this rule in place, New Hampshire will be \nunable to achieve national clean air standards due to air pollution \nthat is outside the State's regulatory control and comes from other \nStates.\n  In New Hampshire, we have a long, bipartisan tradition of working to \nadvance commonsense, balanced environmental protections. That is the \nperspective from which I approach this\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\nresolution. From my time as the State's attorney general, I understand \nwell that New Hampshire is one of several downwind States in what is \ninfamously known as ``America's tailpipe.'' For far too long, air \npollution generated by Midwestern coal-fired powerplants has been \nallowed to flow into the jetstream unabated and to settle in New \nEngland, leading to diminished air quality in my home State of New \nHampshire.\n  As attorney general, I worked to protect Granite State residents and \nour environment from air pollutants generated by Midwest coal-fired \npowerplants. The reality is that air pollution does not stop at State \nborders, and New Hampshire should not be the tailpipe for pollutants \nfrom out-of-State powerplants. It is a matter of common sense to ensure \nthat one State's emissions of pollutants do not unduly harm another \nState's air quality.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the resolution of disapproval.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to express support for the pending \nlegislation on a critical issue that addresses the burdensome cost of \ncompliance with the Tax Code. H.R. 674 is modeled after bipartisan \nlegislation Senator Brown and I introduced earlier this year to repeal \nthe 3 percent withholding on government contractors that was enacted in \n2005.\n  I thank Senator Brown for his steadfast and persistent leadership on \nthis issue as well as Senators Ayotte, Barrasso, Blunt, Burr, \nChambliss, Inhofe, Johanns, Boozman, and Risch who are also cosponsors \nof the legislation.\n  The 3 percent withholding provision mandates that Federal, State, and \nlocal governments withhold 3 percent of their payments to private \ncontractors, including Medicare provider payments, farm payments, \ndefense contracts and certain grants.\n  According to the National Federation of Independent Business, ``the 3 \npercent withholding provision puts both an administrative burden on all \nparties involved and a strain on the daily operating cash flow of the \nbusinesses entering into these contracts.'' This provision would deduct \n3 percent from those payments and send the cash to the IRS for what can \nbe considered a downpayment on taxes. The following year, absent any \noutstanding tax liability, the contractors, or doctors in the case of \nMedicare, would then get the payment rebated to them. This forces \nlegitimate small businesses who pay their taxes in a timely manner to \nloan the government 3 percent of a total contract.\n  The American Medical Association supports repealing the 3 percent \nwithholding because it is an additional tax on physicians who already \nare facing a 29.5 percent cut in Medicare payments on January 1 of next \nyear. According to the AMA Physician Practice Information Survey, 78 \npercent of office-based physicians in the United States are in \npractices of nine physicians and under, with the majority of those \nphysicians being in either solo practice or in practices of between two \nand four physicians. Withholding 3 percent of Medicare payments for \nservices furnished by physician practices will create a difficult cash \nflow problem for physician practices as small businesses.\n  This is another example of good intentions having unintended \nconsequences and originated as a result of very legitimate efforts to \naddress the tax gap--the difference between what is owed in taxes and \nthe amount that the IRS is able to collect.\n  At first glance, it may seem reasonable to withhold a portion of \npayments to contractors, until they pay taxes on the earnings. However, \nthe problem with this approach is that it assumes that contractors will \nnot pay their taxes and, regrettably, small businesses suffer as a \nresult of this faulty assumption.\n  Because this mandate withholds 3 percent of payments to contractors, \nit is a serious problem for small businesses for whom such a \nwithholding from cash-flow would make bidding on contracts cost \nprohibitive. As such, this mandate threatens to stifle the economy at a \ntime when we cannot afford any unnecessary obstacles in the road to \nrecovery.\n  Everyone agrees that Americans should pay their taxes in full and \nnone of us supports tax cheats, yet there are already extensive \npenalties including monetary and even criminal for tax delinquency. The \nunfortunate fact is that the 3 percent withholding provision will cost \nfar more to implement than will be collected in tax revenue.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, I remain \ncommitted to exploring alternative means to ensure government \ncontractors are indeed paying their taxes in full while working to \nmitigate the costs of compliance. On November 1, the Senate passed the \nAgriculture appropriations bill which included a provision prohibiting \nagencies from awarding contracts to companies with unpaid Federal \ntaxes.\n  Additionally, that legislation barred any contract over $5 million \nfrom being awarded if a company cannot certify it has paid its taxes in \nthe last 3 years. Unfortunately, the Obama administration has \ncriticized this provision as having ``unintended consequences'' and \nthat the bill as written would hurt contracting decisions. I believe \nthe legislation should have gone even further and forced all \ncontractors to certify that their taxes are up to date. The bottom line \nis the Federal Government should not be contracting with those who fail \nto meet their tax obligations and it is imperative this administration \ndevelop a coordinated process to not only punish fraudulent contractors \nbut ensure tax compliance before contracts are awarded.\n  That said, our country is in no place to stifle already anemic \neconomic recovery and disappointing job growth numbers that have \nplagued the Nation for 3 years now. According to data released Friday \nby Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate remains \npersistently high at 9 percent.\n  About 45 percent of the unemployed have been out of work for at least \n6 months--a level previously unseen in the six decades since World War \nII. At a time when 14 million Americans are still unemployed, and have \nbeen so for the longest period since record keeping began in 1948, our \ngovernment should be taking every possible step to ease the burden on \njob creators. We need to offer the American people solutions that help \ngrow jobs, not provisions that prevent it.\n  Compliance with this law will impose billions of dollars of cost on \nboth the public and private sectors, with a disproportionate impact on \nsmall businesses. These compliance costs will far exceed projected tax \ncollections.\n  For instance, just one Federal agency, the Department of Defense, \nestimated that it would cost over $17 billion in the first 5 years to \ncomply, and the revenue estimate in 2005 projected that only $6.977 \nbillion would be collected over a 10 year window.\n  Even if that DOD estimate is inflated, as some charge, the \nCongressional Budget Office projects costs of $12 billion just to \nimplement this provision at the Federal level. There are similar costs \nimposed across all of the Nation's State and local governments, making \nthis provision simply an unfunded mandate on State and local \ngovernments. This is a case of spending a dollar to collect a dime, \nwhich is counterproductive for addressing the Nation's deficits.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business, I have \nheard from many businesses across the country that the 3 percent \nwithholding amount will exceed their profit on a given contract and \nwill prevent them from being able to make payroll, forcing them to \nborrow from banks just to pay their employees.\n  This is not the way to encourage jobs and business growth but rather \nthe way to stifle it. This 3 percent withholding provision would \nincrease the tax and regulatory burdens on our businesses--precisely \nthe wrong policy potion for these troubled times.\n  Given the record deficits and budgetary crisis in this country, it is \nimperative that the Congress find funds to offset the repeal provision. \nThe President and the House of Representatives both agreed that a \nproper way to pay for repeal would be to retract a poorly drafted \nprovision from the new health care law--a provision that would have \nadded people who do not meet the income requirements on to the already-\nstrained Medicaid Program which provides health care to the indigent.\n  As a strong supporter of Medicaid, I know it is important to keep the \nprogram narrowly targeted at those populations most in need, and if \ndoing so in\n\n[[Page S7183]]\n\nthis case allows us to repeal the damaging 3 percent withholding rule, \nthen so much the better.\n  At a time when the American people are extremely frustrated with the \npartisan gridlock and Congress' inability to pass meaningful \nlegislation, this bipartisan bill would provide small businesses with \nmuch needed certainty and relief.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

LEDFORD STEPHENS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nrespectable Kentucky veteran, Mr. Ledford ``Led'' Stephens. Ledford, \nwho recently celebrated his 90th birthday, still remembers vividly the \ntime he spent serving overseas in Europe during World War II.\n  Led grew up across the creek from Lower Cal Hill Cemetery in Pine \nKnot, KY. When he was 18 years old, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. After \npassing two physicals, Led was allowed to spend 2 weeks at home before \nhe boarded a train at Stearns station to Fort Thomas. There he received \nhis clothes and was then shipped to Fort Wheeler, GA, for basic \ntraining. After completing basic training, Led spent a short time at \nCamp New Jersey where he received his ``impregnated clothes,'' which \nwere outfits that protected soldiers from gas--this was a clear \nindicator that he would eventually be shipped overseas.\n  A short time later, Led remembers boarding a ship in New York that \nsailed for 14 days and nights before finally reaching Casablanca, North \nAfrica. After arriving, Led and his group were placed with the 3rd \nDivision and sent to assist in the Invasion of Sicily. Led was assigned \nto the position of 30-caliber machine gunner on his team.\n  ``From there, I went on to the Invasion of Italy. We went in there on \na beach and fought our way up,'' Led recalls. ``I met a fellow from \nFrazer, Kentucky, and we both promised that we\n\n[[Page S7184]]\n\nwould find each other's people back home if anything happened to either \nof us. It ended up that he was killed . . . I tried to find his people \nwhen I came back home, but I never could find them.''\n  The toil of war eventually took a toll on Led as well. During a \nbattle, ``a shell went off close to me, and it did something to my \nears,'' Led says. ``My face was numb . . . they loaded me into an \nambulance and took me to the 106 Hospital in Naples, Italy.'' After \nthat, Led spent time recovering in a rest camp and was taken out of \ncombat and was assigned to a port battalion where he loaded and \nunloaded supplies.\n  After the war, Led received many medals and ribbons, including the \nBronze Star for his service. Once he returned home to Kentucky, Led \nbegan a career as a coal-truck driver--he is also an ordained minister \nin his spare time. Around his 70th birthday, Led fell in love with Lois \nNeal, a girl he had known from his childhood. The two have been married \nnow for over 18 years and reside happily together in their home in Pine \nKnot, KY.\n  I would like to ask that my Senate colleagues join me in thanking Mr. \nLedford ``Led'' Stephens for his patriotism and selflessness. I commend \nLedford for his service and accomplishments throughout his life--he is \na true inspiration to Kentuckians everywhere. The McCreary County Voice \nin Whitley City, KY, recently published an article highlighting \nLedford's honorable life and service. I ask unanimous consent that the \nfull article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the McCreary County Voice, Aug. 11, 2011]\n\n                         Memories of a Soldier\n\n                           (By Eugenia Jones)\n\n       As a youngster, growing up across the creek from Lower Cal \n     Hill Cemetery, Ledford ``Led'' Stephens never dreamed that he \n     would someday travel to distant lands to serve his country. \n     The American war veteran, who just recently celebrated his \n     90th birthday, has vivid memories of his time spent in World \n     War II.\n       He recalls, ``When I was 18, I registered for the Army. \n     Next thing I knew, I got a call to go in and get two \n     physicals. I passed the first physical they gave me at \n     Stearns, and then I had to go all the way to Cincinnati for \n     the second one. When I was there in Cincinnati, they told us \n     to say, `Home' if we wanted to go back home for fourteen \n     days. Me and a buddy wanted to go back home for two weeks. \n     After we got those days at home, I caught a train at the \n     station at Stearns to go back to the Army. There were many \n     people at the station, and they were crying as we headed off \n     for the war. I ended up at Fort Thomas where they issued my \n     clothes. I went on to Fort Wheeler, Georgia, for basic \n     training and then to Camp New Jersey. A buddy of mine from \n     home was there with me. He had his guitar, and one night, he \n     started picking a song about going back home. All at once, he \n     told me that he wanted to go home, but I told him that they \n     would kill us if we took off. They issued us our impregnated \n     clothes there. Those types of clothes protect the soldiers \n     from gas. We just knew that being issued those clothes meant \n     that we were going overseas for sure.''\n       The hunch about going overseas was correct, and Stephens \n     can still remember leaving the U.S. ``From New Jersey, I went \n     to New York where we loaded a ship and sailed for fourteen \n     days and nights. We ended up in Casablanca, North Africa. We \n     spent a couple of weeks there and were put in the 3rd \n     Division. Right about that same time, there was a surrender, \n     and I thought we might get to go home. Instead, we ended up \n     in the Invasion of Sicily. I was the first scout in the town \n     of Messina, Sicily, and, from there, I went on to the \n     Invasion of Italy. We went in there on a beach and fought our \n     way up. I met a fellow from Frazer, Kentucky, and we both \n     promised that we would find each other's people back home if \n     anything happened to either of us. It ended up that he was \n     killed. I was a 30-caliber machine gunner, and he was an \n     assistant with another gunner. That is how he was killed. I \n     tried to find his people when I came back home, but I never \n     could find them.''\n       The war eventually took a physical toll on Stephens. He \n     explains, ``The Germans came in shelling us. A shell went off \n     close to me, and it did something to my ears. My face was \n     numb. They wanted me to wait to go to the hospital until the \n     36th Division could relieve us. When I did go to the medics, \n     they were in a long hospital tent. A fellow looked at me and \n     loaded me into an ambulance. They took me to the 106 Hospital \n     in Naples, Italy. After that, I went to a rest camp and some \n     other hospitals. I ended up being taken out of combat and was \n     assigned to a port battalion where I loaded and unloaded \n     supplies.''\n       Stephens did have some fun times while he was overseas. His \n     face lights up with a grin as he tells about the two girls he \n     met while in Europe. ``While I was there in Italy, I was sent \n     to a rest camp. I could go to town whenever I wanted. Me and \n     a buddy met two girls in town one day. We went for a ride \n     with them, and I started seeing the girl named Connie quite \n     regularly. I went for a time without seeing her and decided I \n     would go to her house and find her. I went up the stairs and \n     knocked on the door, and an old woman came to the door. She \n     spoke English and said, ``Stephens, come in!'' The old woman \n     was Connie's mom. She and Connie were glad to see me. When we \n     shipped out, Connie wanted to go. I went back later to see \n     her, and, this time, there she was! She was locked in the \n     arms of a sailor! Of course, that was the end of our \n     friendship!''\n       ``I met Esther when I was in France. When I first saw her, \n     she was crocheting, and she spoke English. Her sister's name \n     was Julie, and I told my buddy about Julie. The Germans had \n     taken their parents. One day, me and my buddy went and \n     visited. Julie's boyfriend came while we were there. Julie \n     was dating a boy named Scott from Tennessee. She was seeing \n     Scott and my buddy both at the same time. When I left France, \n     I told Esther that someday I would be back for her. When I \n     got back to the States, I planned to go back overseas, but \n     Mrs. Harmon of the draft board thought I should wait awhile. \n     I had already been overseas for thirty months and ten days. I \n     ended up never going back overseas, and I never saw Esther \n     again.''\n       After returning to the States, Stephens, the recipient of \n     many medals and ribbons, including the Bronze Star, spent his \n     life working as a coal-truck driver and, for a few years, he \n     worked in Indiana. At the age of 62, he began working for the \n     Forest Service where he remained for more than three years. \n     Stephens also was an ordained minister.\n       In his golden years, when he was about 70, Stephens fell in \n     love with Lois Neal. Lois, who, for many years, owned and \n     operated a grocery store at the top of Davis Hill in Pine \n     Knot, recalls, ``When Led started coming to the store, he \n     came regularly!'' ``Led'' adds with a chuckle, ``I enjoyed \n     helping her in the store. It sure wasn't the store that I was \n     after. It was Lois! I had my eye on her, and, then, she sent \n     me some roses! We had known each other when we were growing \n     up. Before I went overseas, I remember taking her for a ride \n     in a Model A. I was singing, I'm Sitting on Top of the World' \n     when we went for that ride.'' The two have now been married \n     for 18 years.\n       When ``Led'' finishes telling the stories about his days in \n     WW II, it is easy to see that this man who traveled the world \n     serving his country as a young man is now happy to be \n     ``sitting on top of the world'' with his lovely wife Lois at \n     their home in Pine Knot, Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/08/senate-section/article/S7184-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7184-S7185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              VETERANS DAY\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an important \nholiday we will recognize later this week. Veterans Day is a time we \nhave set aside to pause and remember the veterans who have sacrificed \nso much for our country. We honor them for their courage and dedication \nin helping secure our freedom. It is without saying that we are all \nindebted to these men and women and we celebrate them and their \nselfless service on behalf of every American.\n  Last month the celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month came to a \nclose, but as Veterans Day nears, I believe that it is timely and \nfitting to call attention to the contributions of the American Latinos \nwho have served in every major war of the United States and continue to \nbe an invaluable part of America's military.\n  Approximately 1.3 million of America's current 22.7 million veterans \nare of Hispanic origin. In Colorado, each of these veterans deserves \nour recognition and continued support. Due to the sacrifice of so many \nfrom our state, such as Medal of Honor recipient Joe P. Martinez, who \nwas laid to rest in 1943 in Ault, CO, our country has been made \nstronger.\n  Other veterans, such as Albert Gonzales, a Colorado Springs resident \nwho currently serves as the national commander of the American G.I. \nForum and was recently appointed by President Obama as a member of the \nNational Selective Service Appeal Board, demonstrate the ongoing \ncommitments of Colorado's veterans. Albert represents another example \nof the thousands of exemplary Coloradan Hispanic veterans.\n  In Colorado, paying tribute to the State's Hispanic veterans is a \nstrong part of our effort to support all veterans. In the small \nsoutheastern Colorado agricultural town of Avondale, which has come to \ncall itself the ``Pueblito of Heroes,'' it has become an annual \ntradition to recognize the many veterans who have served from this \nsmall community. Just this year, they honored long-time resident \nEutimio Sandoval who received a Bronze Star,\n\n[[Page S7185]]\n\nKorean Service Medal, Japan Service Medal and a 50th anniversary medal \nfor his service.\n  Many humble men and women who have served in our military are \ncelebrated in communities across Colorado, and I wish to join them to \nexpress my appreciation and highlight the contributions of \nservicemembers of all backgrounds that make up the larger family of \nveterans who have given so much.\n  This November 11, I encourage everyone to take the time to thank a \nveteran and servicemember for his or her involvement in protecting \nAmerica and the principles for which we stand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/08/senate-section/article/S7185-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT THOMAS R. GDOVIN\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, on this week of Veteran's Day, I rise \ntoday to recognize SGT Thomas R. Gdovin, of Cleveland, OH, for the \nexceptional bravery he displayed in combat on March 8, 1968, in Vietnam \nwhile assigned to the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division. Earlier \ntoday I presented the Silver Star, one of our Nation's highest honors \nfor gallantry in military service, to former SGT Thomas Gdovin here in \nWashington, DC.\n  SGT Thomas R. Gdovin enlisted into the U.S. Army on July 5, 1966, and \nserved in the 101st Airborne Division. Today, during a ceremony over 40 \nyears in the making, he received the Silver Star for his bravery during \nthe Vietnam war when he risked his own life to save a wounded soldier \nduring combat. I was honored to have Mr. Dan Phillips, the soldier \nrescued, attend the ceremony alongside Mr. Gdovin's family and friends \nin celebration of this well deserved honor.\n  I am honored to read the Silver Star Citation detailing Sergeant \nGdovin's brave actions into the Record.\n\n       The President of the United States of America, authorized \n     by Act of Congress, 9 July 1918, has awarded the Silver Star \n     to: Sergeant Thomas R. Gdovin, 502d Infantry Regiment, 2d \n     Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile) For Gallantry: \n     in action on 8 March 1968, while serving as Squad Leader with \n     1st Platoon, Company D, 1st Battalion, 502d Infantry \n     Regiment, 2d Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile) in \n     support of operations in the Republic of Vietnam. Sergeant \n     Gdovin's squad became the company's lead element during an \n     attack on enemy forces when they received intense automatic \n     weapons and rocket fire. The lead Soldier in the formation \n     was severely wounded and was unable to move in an area open \n     to enemy fire. Sergeant Gdovin placed the squad into \n     defensive positions and suppressed enemy fire. He then left \n     the defensive position and with complete disregard for his \n     own personal safety and advanced across open terrain toward \n     the wounded soldier, exposing himself to intense enemy fire. \n     Sergeant Gdovin then reached the wounded soldier and under \n     continued fire, brought him back to safety of the squad's \n     position, where we was further evacuated. Sergeant Gdovin's \n     actions are in keeping with the finest traditions of military \n     service and reflect great credit upon himself, the 101st \n     Airborne Division (Airmobile) and the United States Army.\n\n  This is truly an exceptional story and I was honored to play a small \nrole in recognizing Sergeant Gdovin. This ceremony was an opportunity \nto say thank you to all veterans. We can never forget that they gave \ntheir time, risked their health, and even placed their lives on the \nline. This not only means honoring their sacrifices, but also honoring \nour promises and commitments to them as well. Let us ensure that we \nhonor and remember all our veterans, not just this week but throughout \nthe days and years to come. Their commitment to this Nation is a \nshining example to all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/08/senate-section/article/S7185-2", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, you have heard me speak many times \nabout the importance of agriculture to my home State. It is a critical \nindustry in Kansas and forms the backbone of our economy. Within the \nfield of agriculture are many dedicated and talented leaders who serve \nand have served Kansans with distinction. I have had the privilege to \nknow and work with many of them over the years, but there is one in \nparticular I would like to highlight today. Edie Dahlsten currently \nserves as the vice president of the Kansas Farm Bureau. For nearly a \ndecade, Edie has served in this role with distinction and this November \nshe will retire at the end of her term.\n  The Farm Bureau is truly a grassroots organization that begins with a \nsingle farmer, who joins together with his neighbors to form an \norganization that represents their way of life. Edie and Larry Dahlsten \nhave been engaged in every aspect of that organization, beginning with \ntheir service on the McPherson County Farm Bureau Board near their home \nin central Kansas.\n  Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, for Edie and Larry, farming is more than \njust a way to make a living it is a way of life. Together they make a \ngreat team, and their commitment to the Farm Bureau and the values it \nrepresents is widely known. Edie and Larry's leadership and service \ntogether began more than 20 years ago when they served on the State \nYoung Farmers and Ranchers Committee. As an Outstanding Young Farm \nFamily, they have represented their fellow producers on numerous \ncommittees over the years to advocate on behalf of producers at the \nlocal, State, and national level.\n  Edie's leadership and advocacy began with humble beginnings on the \nsoil of a\n\n[[Page S7186]]\n\nrural Kansas farm.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nemployment and reemployment rights for certain individuals ordered to \nfull-time National Guard duty, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I join with my friend from New York to \ndiscuss the needs of our National Guard. We are introducing two \nimportant pieces of legislation today that I believe will help address \nthose needs.\n  I have always been a strong supporter of our brave men and women of \nthe Missouri National Guard, who contribute greatly to the safety and \nsecurity of our country. Those who serve or who have served deserve \nAmerica's deepest respect and must receive the resources they need when \nthey come home.\n  Since the events of September 11, 2001, the men and women of the \nMissouri National Guard have answered the call of our Nation by \nvolunteering to go into harm's way. Many of our soldiers and airmen in \nthe National Guard have been deployed numerous times, working and \ntraining side by side with our active duty members. As you can imagine, \nmultiple deployments take a toll on both our guardsmen and women and \ntheir families.\n  The Missouri National Guard is an emergency response force for \ndisasters readiness and relief. They have responded to a wide range of \nState and national emergencies including flooding, tornadoes and even \nhurricanes on the Gulf Coast. During the historic floods this summer, \nthe Missouri Guard had more than 600 guardsmen serving 14 counties \nacross Missouri to assist with flood relief. After the devastating \ntornado in Joplin, MO, the 1-138 Infantry Regiment helped to remove \ndebris and assisted in gathering and provided information for those \nseeking local, State and Federal resources. Members of 1139 Military \nPolice Battalion helped to aid law enforcement officers with traffic \ncontrol and security.\n  As part of their Federal mission, from 2008-2009 our Missouri \nNational Guard deployed more than 1,000 citizen-soldiers to Kosovo, and \nin 2009 we deployed 2,352 soldiers and 1,670 Airmen to support overseas \ncontingency operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Currently 1,101 \nMissouri Guardsmen are deployed. After serving admirably in their \ntours, our Guardsmen and women return home, yet they do not always \nreceive the resources they need to provide for themselves and their \nfamilies. The National Guard Outreach Act of 2011, introduced by \nSenator Gillibrand, will help to correct this deficiency.\n  The active Army health plans only cover service men and women for 6 \nmonths after they have returned from their deployments. For many, this \ntime period is spent simply adjusting back to civilian life. Studies \nshow the real stress of combat and separation from one's family takes \nits toll on our service members and their loved ones for up to two \nyears after they return home. Over the past several years, Congress has \nextended the coverage for returning National Guard soldiers with money \nfrom Overseas Contingency Operations funding, better known around here \nas supplementals. Since this funding is being normalized, I believe \nit's important that we continue to provide for the needs of our \nreturning citizen-soldiers.\n  The National Guard Outreach Act of 2011 would help to provide those \nreturning home with secure health services, marriage and financial \ncounseling, substance abuse treatment and other services necessary to \naid in a smooth transition for those returning home from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Undiagnosed illnesses, left untreated, have long-lasting \nsocial, emotional and financial impacts long after service members are \nreintegrated into a community. Many Guardsmen and women today lack \nhealth insurance and go without health care as well as behavioral \nhealth care. I thank Senator Gillibrand for introducing this \nlegislation and for working with me on the bill.\n  I am also introducing the National Guard Employment Protection Act of \n2011 to amend the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights \nAct of 1994, USERRA, to authorize the Secretary of Defense to include\n\n[[Page S7192]]\n\nFull Time National Guard Duty for possible exemption from the USERRA 5-\nyear limit on service. These exemptions cover service during a time of \nwar or national emergency, support of missions where others have been \nordered to duty under an involuntary call-up authority, and for other \ncritical missions or requirements.\n  Usually, certain types of active duty service are exempted from the \nfive-year reemployment limit under USERRA. However, the needs of today \nhave left our Guardsmen and women performing duties which are not \ncovered under the USERRA, forcing Guard units to return to duty much \nsooner than usual. This, in turn, keeps service members away for longer \nperiods of time, often beyond the 5-year limit. When National Guardsmen \nand women are working side by side with their Active Duty counterparts \nsupporting critical active duty missions, they should not be forced to \ndecide between keeping their civilian jobs and supporting critical \nnational security missions.\n  At no time in America's history has the National Guard played such a \ncritical role in the defense and security of our homeland, both as \npartners with our active forces and allies on the continuing War on \nTerror and as a critical component of homeland emergency preparedness \nand disaster response. We must make sure all of our Nation's heroes can \nfulfill their missions without worrying about supporting their families \nwhen returning home.\n  As a Nation, we must honor our men and women in uniform, providing \nthem with the resources they need, both in combat and when they return \nhome to their families and civilian lives. This is why I am proud to \nplay a lead role in supporting the National Guard Employment Protection \nAct of 2011 and the National Guard Outreach Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Carper, and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 1826. A bill to provide for the availability of self-employment \nassistance to individuals receiving extended compensation or emergency \nunemployment compensation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Senator \nCarper and Senator Casey to introduce the Startup Technical Assistance \nfor Reemployment Training and Unemployment Prevention Act of 2011, or \nthe STARTUP Act. This bill would allow unemployed Americans to use the \nunemployment insurance, UI, system to create jobs for themselves and \nfor others.\n  In too many cases, the current unemployment assistance programs allow \nthe experience and expertise of America's unemployed workers to sit on \nthe sidelines. The STARTUP Act promotes an alternative approach that \ngives the unemployed the ability to start their own businesses and get \nin the game, self-employment assistance, SEA.\n  In Oregon, we have got this program up and running and think other \nstates should be encouraged to do the same. By failing to take \nadvantage of self-employment assistance, we are missing an opportunity \nto not only help currently unemployed workers but also to help our \neconomy grow and create more jobs. I know this program works, its \nrecord in Oregon is strong and can be found in letters and testimony \nfrom individuals who have used the program.\n  Take, for example, software developers Adam Lowry and Michael \nRichardson who joined the ranks of the unemployed when the tech startup \nthey worked at went under in 2009. With little capital, they turned to \nOregon's self-employment assistance program which allowed them to draw \nunemployment benefits while they and two friends launched the mobile \nsoftware development company Urban Airship, which is now one of the \nbest-known technology startups to emerge in Oregon in recent years. \nJust yesterday, Urban Airship announced $15.1 million in strategic \ninvestment from Salesforce.com and Verizon, among others. Last week an \nadditional acquisition brought the company's total payroll to 51 \nemployees and an additional 22 open positions. At the root of Urban \nAirship's success are four entrepreneurial-minded individuals and a \njump start from self-employment assistance.\n  Expanding self-employment assistance is a creative way to use the \ncurrent unemployment insurance structure to create new businesses and \nadditional jobs beyond that of the immediate beneficiary. We often talk \nabout the benefits of small businesses in this country, yet our \nunemployment insurance programs actually prevent aspiring entrepreneurs \nfrom putting their ideas to work. Under the unemployment insurance \nsystems in most states, if you stop looking for a job or you turn down \na job, you lose your unemployment benefit even if you are working to \nstart your own business. States with active self-employment assistance \nprograms, like Oregon, allow a small percent of the unemployed to focus \nfull time on starting their own business while drawing down their \nunemployment benefits in the form of self-employment assistance. Anyone \nwho has started a new business knows that getting it off the ground is \na full time job in and of itself, and allowing would-be UI recipients \nto focus full-time on their new business vastly increases their \nlikelihood of success. Rather than rely on others to create jobs for \nthem, self-employment assistance allows determined entrepreneurs to \ncreate jobs for themselves and others.\n  The President's proposal in the American Jobs Act is a step in the \nright direction; it allows states to quickly enter into an agreement \nwith the Department of Labor and allow the long-term unemployed, those \non extended unemployment compensation, to draw down their UI benefits \nin the form of self-employment assistance. However, this does little to \nencourage states to make self-employment assistance a part of their \npermanent strategy. We must be more far-sighted. We ought to provide \nstates with a little assistance so that they can start self-employment \nprograms of their own, not just for periods of extended unemployment \ncompensation.\n  I want to be clear: this is no giveaway. In order to get this \nbenefit, unemployed workers have to meet the same wage and hour \nrequirements as they would to receive UI and they must prove they have \na viable business plan. The beneficiaries of self-employment assistance \nreally have something to offer, they have solid work experience and \nsolid ideas; and put into action, that combination can snowball into a \nsuccessful business with multiple employees.\n  There are 2.5 million micro businesses in the U.S., representing 88 \npercent of all businesses. They generate $2.4 trillion in receipts, \naccount for 17 percent of GDP, and employ more than 13 million people. \nIf one out of every three of these businesses hired just one additional \nemployee, the U.S. economy would achieve full employment. Expanding \nself-employment assistance helps us get there.\n  A study by the Department of Labor found that self-employment \nparticipants were 19 times more likely than eligible non-participants \nto be self-employed at some point after being unemployed. Moreover, \nthey were four times more likely to obtain employment of any kind. The \naverage cost to create each of those jobs is $3,350. According to \nestimates from Princeton economist and former Federal Reserve Board \nVice Chairman Alan Blinder, it takes about $93,000 worth of garden-\nvariety fiscal stimulus to create an average job. It is not hard to see \nthat job creation through SEA is an incredible bargain.\n  This program has been creating jobs and businesses in Oregon for \nnearly two decades. Earlier this year, Pat Sanderlin, who coordinates \nOregon's program, conducted an informal ``census'' of enrollees since \n2004. He found that 77 percent of businesses started by SEA \nbeneficiaries are still up and running. According to Mr. Sanderlin, the \ncompanies' combined annual payroll totals $7,888,210.\n  Despite widespread support for self-employment and entrepreneurial \nprograms, only a handful of states offer SEA, and those that do take \nadvantage of it typically administer benefits to a small share of the \nunemployed. Only about 2,400 Oregonians have used the program since its \ninception in 1995. Though states currently have the option of taking \nadvantage of self-employment assistance, the administrative costs to \nstart a new program often prevent them from doing so. Because Federal \nlaw prevents self-employment benefits from being paid out while an \nindividual is in a period of extended unemployment, the long-term \nunemployed cannot take advantage of the program.\n\n[[Page S7193]]\n\n  The STARTUP Act encourages states to utilize self-employment \nassistance by: allowing the long-term unemployed who remain eligible \nfor regular or extended unemployment benefits to draw down those \nbenefits in the form of self-employment assistance; providing technical \nassistance and model language from the Department of Labor for states \nthat create new self-employment programs; and providing financial \nassistance to aid states in establishing, implementing, improving and/\nor administering self-employment programs.\n  Self-employment benefits can serve as a guaranteed source of startup \ncapital for businesses. And unlike traditional unemployment insurance, \nworkers who successfully exit this program by starting their own \nbusiness can create more new jobs as business expands. When \nunemployment is high and workers face extended periods of joblessness, \nthis is exactly the type of program we should embrace.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation to expand self-\nemployment assistance programs so that more unemployed workers have an \nopportunity to create jobs for themselves and for others.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1828. A bill to increase small business lending, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, once again, too many of our Nation's small \nbusinesses are facing difficulty in gaining access to capital. That is \nwhy today I am introducing the Increasing Small Business Lending Act to \nincrease access to capital for our Nation's small businesses to help \nthem sustain and build their businesses, create jobs and expand our \neconomy.\n  In October 2008, markets froze. Credit lines were cut. A lending gap \nwas created in the market. Even Small Business Administration \nguaranteed loans, that help reduce risk for lenders, were stalled. \nCongress stepped up and enacted temporary measures to help fill the \ngaps in small business lending, saving nearly 90,000 small businesses.\n  One such business is LazerCraze in North Andover, Massachusetts that \nreceived an SBA loan to expand to a second location and purchase state-\nof-the-art equipment that allowed them to hire an additional 37 full \ntime employees.\n  SBA, administrator Karen Mills has said that the previous temporary \nchanges to the SBA loan programs were a success, ``In short, it worked. \nWe engineered a turnaround in SBA lending even though conventional \ncredit was, and still is to some extent, very tight. Taxpayers got a \nbig bang for the buck. With just over a billion dollars in total \nsubsidy, we supported about $42 billion in lending. In fact, SBA had \nits highest-ever weekly loan volume the week before Christmas when we \nsupported nearly 2 billion dollars in lending, 10 billion total last \nquarter. Here is the headline: overall, that is nearly 90,000 small \nbusinesses that are not surviving this recession, but growing and \ncreating jobs.\n  Unfortunately, the temporary small business loan provisions ran out \nof funding in January 2011, ahead of the authorization which expired in \nMarch 2011. Since then, small business lending has declined, making it \nmore difficult for small businesses to create jobs and for our economy \nto emerge from our economic downturn.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is similar to the Small \nBusiness Lending Market Stabilization Act, which I introduced in 2008 \nthat was included in both the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of \n2009, P.L. 111-5, and extended in the Small Business jobs Act, P.L. \n111-240. The Increasing Small Business Lending, Act will eliminate for \none year the fees for 7(a) and 504 Small Business Administration loans \nand increase SBA loan guarantee of 90 percent, policies that were \nstarted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act and \nextended in the Small Business Jobs Act.\n  According to the SBA, total small business loans outstanding, loans \nunder $1 million, actually declined during the first half of 2011 after \nthe temporary provisions ended. Loans outstanding to small businesses \nat the end of the second quarter totaled only $607 billion, which is \nthe slowest since the economic downturn began in 2008.\n  We can't afford to have our economic progress reversed by a decline \nin access to capital for small businesses. Since the increased \nguarantee and reduced fees have expired, our economic recovery could be \nimpeded if we don't act to continue the policies that we know work. By \nextending key provisions to bolster access to capital, small businesses \nwill have the assurance and support they need to put their innovative \nideas into practice and get more Americans back to work.\n  My legislation will complement the existing Small Business Lending \nFund that encourages lending to small businesses through smaller \ncommunity banks. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and I \nask all Senators to support job growth and small businesses by \nsupporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Begich, Mr. \n        Franken, Mr. Reed, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Sanders. and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 1829. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to empower the \nStates to set the maximum annual percentage rates applicable to \nconsumer credit transactions, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I was here last week in this Chamber \nto discuss a variety of areas in which the American people are not \ngetting a straight deal compared to special interests and folks who \nhave a lot of power for themselves and their industries in Washington. \nIn that speech I proposed a number of concrete steps we could take to \nhelp restore the balance of power in our Nation between ordinary \nAmericans on the one hand and the giant corporations and special \ninterests that give themselves special deals and privileges that the \nAmerican people do not share on the other hand.\n  Today I am here to introduce legislation to take one of those steps; \nthat is, to protect ordinary consumers from runaway interest rates on \ncredit cards from Wall Street banks. This is something that has gone \nunchecked for far too long. In the last Congress we passed two pieces \nof banking legislation. We passed the Credit Card Act, which ended some \nof the worst tricks and traps hidden in credit card contracts, and we \npassed the Dodd-Frank Act, which restructured our system of financial \nregulation and created a new agency to protect consumers from hazardous \nmortgages and credit cards.\n  Regrettably, one particularly bad practice was not addressed in \neither of those two pieces of legislation: the runaway credit card \ninterest rates with which families are too often burdened. I will add \nit is not just families. I went through Olneyville in Providence about \n2 weeks ago and spoke to a small business owner who was having tough \ntimes. His bank had pulled his line of credit, so he was having to fund \nhis business off his credit card, and they had bumped up his credit \ncard rate to--you guessed it--30 percent.\n  The Empowering States' Right to Protect Consumers Act, which I am \nintroducing today, would pick up where the Credit Card Act and Dodd-\nFrank left off by restoring to our 50 sovereign States the power which \nthey have properly had through the vast bulk of the history of this \nRepublic to protect their home State consumers with limits on credit \ncard and other loan interest rates. This is not a new power to States. \nThis is not a new principle or idea. This is the restoration of a \nhistoric States right which was just eliminated a few decades ago.\n  When you and I were growing up, a credit card offer with a 20-percent \nor 30-percent interest rate might be something to bring to the \nattention of law enforcement. Such interest rates were illegal under \nmost State laws. Today, in contrast, credit card companies routinely \ncharge rates of 30 percent or more. We may not know, going through our \ncredit card agreement, that is where we are going to end up. They may \nhave a teaser rate up front that is a lower rate. But make one of those \nmistakes in that 20-page-long contract that is full of tricks and \ntraps, and, pow, there we are at 30 percent.\n  What happened between our childhood when a 30-percent interest rate \nwas something to bring to the attention of law enforcement, and now, \nwhen ordinary families are bedeviled\n\n[[Page S7194]]\n\nwith 30 percent interest rates on their credit cards? Before 1978--\nwhich is for the first 202 years of the American Republic--each State \nhad the ability to enforce usury laws, interest rate limits to protect \ntheir citizens. Our economy grew and flourished during those two \ncenturies, and lenders profited while complying with the laws in effect \nwhere they operated.\n  Then came 1978 and a seemingly uneventful Supreme Court case. It was \nlittle noticed at the time. It was decided in Marquette National Bank \nof Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corporation. The Supreme Court \nhad to decide what State's law to apply when the bank was domiciled in \none State but the customer lived in a different State.\n  The Court looked at the word ``located'' in the National Bank Act of \n1863, and it decided it meant the location of the bank and not the \nlocation of the customer. They did not get it right away, but it did \nnot take long before some big banks spotted the opportunity. They could \navoid interest rate restrictions by reorganizing as national banks and \nmoving to States that had weak interest rate protections and \ncomparatively weak consumer protections. The proverbial race to the \nbottom followed as a small handful of States eliminated interest rate \ncaps and degraded consumer protection in order to attract lucrative \ncredit card business and related tax revenue to their States.\n  That is why the credit card divisions of major banks are based in \njust a few States and why consumers in other States are often denied \nprotection from outrageous interest rates and fees, even though those \noutrageous interest rates and fees are against the law of the \nconsumer's home State.\n  My bill would reinstate the historic longstanding powers of States to \nset interest rate caps that protect their own citizens.\n  Let me be clear about what this bill would not do. It would not \nprescribe or recommend any interest rate caps nor would it impose any \nother lending limitations. It is pure States rights. It would restore \nto the States the power they enjoyed for over 200 years from the \nfounding of the Republic: the power to say enough, the power to say \nthat 30 percent or 50 percent or whatever the State deems appropriate \nshould be the limit on interest charged to their people.\n  The current system is not only unfair to consumers, it is unfair to \nour local lenders and retailers who continue to be bound by the laws of \nthe State in which they are located. This is a special privilege for \nbig national banks that can move their offices to whatever State will \ngive them the best deal in terms of lousy consumer protection and \nunlimited interest rates. A small local lender has to play by the rules \nof fair interest rates. Gigantic credit card companies can avoid having \nany rules at all. We need to level the playing field to eliminate this \nunfair and lucrative advantage for Wall Street banks against our local \ncredit unions and other small lenders.\n\n  When we pass this bill, States can dust off or reenact their usury \nstatutes--most of which still limit interest rates to 18 percent or \nless--and once again begin protecting their consumers from excessive \ninterest rates. This is the historic norm in our constitutional \nRepublic. It is the 30-percent and over interest rates that are the \nrecent anomaly that are the historic peculiarity. We should go back to \nthe historic States rights norm, the way the Founding Fathers saw \nthings under the doctrine of federalism and close this modern \nbureaucratic loophole that allows big Wall Street banks a special deal \nto gouge our constituents.\n  As I close, I thank Senators Levin, Durbin, Begich, Franken, Reed of \nRhode Island--most significantly my senior Senator--Sanders, and \nMerkley for their cosponsorship of this bill. In the past, similar \nlegislation has garnered bipartisan support. It did so as an amendment \nto Dodd-Frank, and I hope my Republican colleagues will consider giving \nthis bill a close look and join with us. This is purely an issue of \nrestoring the balance of power to the States and to the people of those \nStates as voters--federalism, something I know many Republicans support \nin other contexts.\n  I ask all of my colleagues for their consideration and support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/11/08/senate-section/article/S7194-1", "month": "11", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 315--COMMENDING THE ST.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care \n     liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for \n     resolving claims of health care liability and compensating \n     injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of \n     information among health care professionals which impedes \n     efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this title is to \n     implement reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health \n     care liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. 3203.

Such \n     sanction shall be sufficient to deter repetition of such \n     conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated, \n     and to compensate the party or parties injured by such \n     conduct.\n\n     SEC. 3205. COMPENSATING PATIENT INJURY.\n\n       (a) Unlimited Amount of Damages for Actual Economic Losses \n     in Health Care Lawsuits.--In any health care lawsuit, nothing \n     in this Act shall limit the recovery by a claimant of the \n     full amount of the available economic damages, \n     notwithstanding the limitation contained in subsection (b).\n       (b) Additional Noneconomic Damages.--\n       (1) Health care providers.--In any health care lawsuit \n     where final judgment is rendered against a health care \n     provider, the amount of noneconomic damages recovered from \n     the provider, if otherwise available under applicable Federal \n     or State law, may be as much as $250,000, regardless of the \n     number of parties other than a health care institution \n     against whom the action is brought or the number of separate \n     claims or actions brought with respect to the same \n     occurrence.\n       (2) Health care institutions.--\n       (A) Single institution.--In any health care lawsuit where \n     final judgment is rendered against a single health care \n     institution, the amount of noneconomic damages recovered from \n     the institution, if otherwise available under applicable \n     Federal or State law, may be as much as $250,000, regardless \n     of the number of parties against whom the action is brought \n     or the number of separate claims or actions brought with \n     respect to the same occurrence.\n       (B) Multiple institutions.--In any health care lawsuit \n     where final judgment is rendered against more than one health \n     care institution, the amount of noneconomic damages recovered \n     from each institution, if otherwise available under \n     applicable Federal or State law, may be as much as $250,000, \n     regardless of the number of parties against whom the action \n     is brought or the number of separate claims or actions \n     brought with respect to the same occurrence, except that the \n     total amount recovered from all such institutions in such \n     lawsuit shall not exceed $500,000.\n       (c) No Discount of Award for Noneconomic Damages.--In any \n     health care lawsuit--\n       (1) an award for future noneconomic damages shall not be \n     discounted to present value;\n       (2) the jury shall not be informed about the maximum award \n     for noneconomic damages under subsection (b);\n       (3) an award for noneconomic damages in excess of the \n     limitations provided for in subsection (b) shall be reduced \n     either before the entry of judgment, or by amendment of the \n     judgment after entry of judgment, and such reduction shall be \n     made before accounting for any other reduction in damages \n     required by law; and\n       (4) if separate awards are rendered for past and future \n     noneconomic damages and the combined awards exceed the \n     limitations described in subsection (b), the future \n     noneconomic damages shall be reduced first.\n       (d) Fair Share Rule.--In any health care lawsuit, each \n     party shall be liable for that party's several share of any \n     damages only and not for the share of any other person. Each \n     party shall be liable only for the amount of damages \n     allocated to such party in direct proportion to such party's \n     percentage of responsibility.

A court may allow a claimant to file an amended \n     pleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the \n     claimant and after a finding by the court, upon review of \n     supporting and opposing affidavits or after a hearing, after \n     weighing the evidence, that the claimant has established by a \n     substantial probability that the claimant will prevail on the \n     claim for punitive damages.\n       (3) Separate proceeding.--At the request of any party in a \n     health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a \n     separate proceeding--\n       (A) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \n     amount of such award; and\n       (B) the amount of punitive damages following a \n     determination of punitive liability.\n     If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only \n     to the claim for punitive damages, as determined by \n     applicable State law, shall be inadmissible in any proceeding \n     to determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded.\n       (4) Limitation where no compensatory damages are awarded.--\n     In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory \n     damages is rendered against a person, no punitive damages may \n     be awarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit against \n     such person.\n       (b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) Factors considered.--In determining the amount of \n     punitive damages under this section, the trier of fact shall \n     consider only the following:\n       (A) the severity of the harm caused by the conduct of such \n     party;\n       (B) the duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by \n     such party;\n       (C) the profitability of the conduct to such party;\n       (D) the number of products sold or medical procedures \n     rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by such party, \n     of the kind causing the harm complained of by the claimant;\n       (E) any criminal penalties imposed on such party, as a \n     result of the conduct complained of by the claimant; and\n       (F) the amount of any civil fines assessed against such \n     party as a result of the conduct complained of by the \n     claimant.\n       (2) Maximum award.--The amount of punitive damages awarded \n     in a health care lawsuit may not exceed an amount equal to \n     two times the amount of economic damages awarded in the \n     lawsuit or $250,000, whichever is greater. The jury shall not \n     be informed of the limitation under the preceding sentence.\n       (c) Liability of Health Care Providers.--\n       (1) In general.--A health care provider who prescribes, or \n     who dispenses pursuant to a prescription, a drug, biological \n     product, or medical device approved by the Food and Drug \n     Administration, for an approved indication of the drug, \n     biological product, or medical device, shall not be named as \n     a party to a product liability lawsuit invoking such drug, \n     biological product, or medical device and shall not be liable \n     to a claimant in a class action lawsuit against the \n     manufacturer, distributor, or product seller of such drug, \n     biological product, or medical device.\n       (2) Medical product.--The term ``medical product'' means a \n     drug or device intended for humans.

AUTHORIZATION OF PAYMENT OF FUTURE DAMAGES TO \n                   CLAIMANTS IN HEALTH CARE LAWSUITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--In any health care lawsuit, if an award of \n     future damages, without reduction to present value, equaling \n     or exceeding $50,000 is made against a party with sufficient \n     insurance or other assets to fund a periodic payment of such \n     a judgment, the court shall, at the request of any party, \n     enter a judgment ordering that the future damages be paid by \n     periodic payments in accordance with the Uniform Periodic \n     Payment of Judgments Act promulgated by the National \n     Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.\n       (b) Applicability.--This section applies to all actions \n     which have not been first set for trial or retrial before the \n     effective date of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3210. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.\n\n       (a) General Vaccine Injury.--\n       (1) In general.--To the extent that title XXI of the Public \n     Health Service Act establishes a Federal rule of law \n     applicable to a civil action brought for a vaccine-related \n     injury or death--\n       (A) this Act shall not affect the application of the rule \n     of law to such an action; and\n       (B) any rule of law prescribed by this Act in conflict with \n     a rule of law of such title XXI shall not apply to such \n     action.\n       (2) Exception.--If there is an aspect of a civil action \n     brought for a vaccine-related injury or death to which a \n     Federal rule of law under title XXI of the Public Health \n     Service Act does not apply, then this Act or otherwise \n     applicable law (as determined under this Act) will apply to \n     such aspect of such action.\n       (b) Smallpox Vaccine Injury.--\n       (1) In general.--To the extent that part C of title II of \n     the Public Health Service Act establishes a Federal rule of \n     law applicable to a civil action brought for a smallpox \n     vaccine-related injury or death--\n       (A) this Act shall not affect the application of the rule \n     of law to such an action; and\n       (B) any rule of law prescribed by this Act in conflict with \n     a rule of law of such part C shall not apply to such action.\n       (2) Exception.--If there is an aspect of a civil action \n     brought for a smallpox vaccine-related injury or death to \n     which a Federal rule of law under part C of title II of the \n     Public Health Service Act does not apply, then this Act or \n     otherwise applicable law (as determined under this Act) will \n     apply to such aspect of such action.\n       (c) Other Federal Law.--Except as provided in this section, \n     nothing in this Act shall be deemed to affect any defense \n     available, or any limitation on liability that applies to, a \n     defendant in a health care lawsuit or action under any other \n     provision of Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 3211.

The provisions governing \n     health care lawsuits set forth in this Act supersede chapter \n     171 of title 28, United States Code, to the extent that such \n     chapter--\n       (1) provides for a greater amount of damages or contingent \n     fees, a longer period in which a health care lawsuit may be \n     commenced, or a reduced applicability or scope of periodic \n     payment of future damages, than provided in this Act; or\n       (2) prohibits the introduction of evidence regarding \n     collateral source benefits.\n       (b) Preemption of Certain State Laws.--No provision of this \n     Act shall be construed to preempt any State law (whether \n     effective before, on, or after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act) that specifies a particular monetary amount of \n     compensatory or punitive damages (or the total amount of \n     damages) that may be awarded in a health care lawsuit, \n     regardless of whether such monetary amount is greater or \n     lesser than is provided for under this Act, notwithstanding \n     section 5(a).\n       (c) Protection of State's Rights and Other Laws.--\n       (1) In general.--Any issue that is not governed by a \n     provision of law established by or under this Act (including \n     the State standards of negligence) shall be governed by \n     otherwise applicable Federal or State law.\n       (2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to--\n       (A) preempt or supersede any Federal or State law that \n     imposes greater procedural or substantive protections (such \n     as a shorter statute of limitations) for a health care \n     provider or health care institution from liability, loss, or \n     damages than those provided by this Act;\n       (B) preempt or supercede any State law that permits and \n     provides for the enforcement of any arbitration agreement \n     related to a health care liability claim whether enacted \n     prior to or after the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (C) create a cause of action that is not otherwise \n     available under Federal or State law; or\n       (D) affect the scope of preemption of any other Federal \n     law.\n\n     SEC. 3212. APPLICABILITY; EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title shall apply to any health care lawsuit brought \n     in a Federal or State court, or subject to an alternative \n     dispute resolution system, that is initiated on or after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, except that any health \n     care lawsuit arising from an injury occurring prior to the \n     date of enactment of this title shall be governed by the \n     applicable statute of limitations provisions in effect at the \n     time the injury occurred.\n\n                  TITLE III--FINANCIAL TAKEOVER REPEAL\n\n     SEC. 3301.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as ``REINS Act''.\n\n     SEC. 3402. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n\n[[Page S7209]]\n\n       (1) Section 1 of article I of the United States \n     Constitution grants all legislative powers to Congress.\n       (2) Over time, Congress has excessively delegated its \n     constitutional charge while failing to conduct appropriate \n     oversight and retain accountability for the content of the \n     laws it passes.\n       (3) By requiring a vote in Congress, this Act will result \n     in more carefully drafted and detailed legislation, an \n     improved regulatory process, and a legislative branch that is \n     truly accountable to the people of the United States for the \n     laws imposed upon them.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to increase \n     accountability for and transparency in the Federal regulatory \n     process.\n\n     SEC. 3403.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Freedom from Restrictive \n     Excessive Executive Demands and Onerous Mandates Act of \n     2011''.\n\n     SEC. 3602. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n     to the recovery of the economy of the United States.\n       (2) Regulations designed for application to large-scale \n     entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses and \n     other small entities, sometimes inhibiting the ability of \n     small entities to create new jobs.\n       (3) Uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements \n     in many instances have imposed on small businesses and other \n     small entities unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome \n     demands, including legal, accounting, and consulting costs, \n     thereby threatening the viability of small entities and the \n     ability of small entities to compete and create new jobs in a \n     global marketplace.\n       (4) Since 1980, Federal agencies have been required to \n     recognize and take account of the differences in the scale \n     and resources of regulated entities, but in many instances \n     have failed to do so.\n       (5) In 2009, there were nearly 70,000 pages in the Federal \n     Register, and, according to research by the Office of \n     Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, the annual \n     cost of Federal regulations totals $1,750,000,000,000. Small \n     firms bear a disproportionate burden, paying approximately 36 \n     percent more per employee than larger firms in annual \n     regulatory compliance costs.\n       (6) All agencies in the Federal Government should fully \n     consider the costs, including indirect economic impacts and \n     the potential for job loss, of proposed rules, periodically \n     review existing regulations to determine their impact on \n     small entities, and repeal regulations that are unnecessarily \n     duplicative or have outlived their stated purpose.\n       (7) It is the intention of Congress to amend chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code, to ensure that all impacts, \n     including foreseeable indirect effects, of proposed and final \n     rules are considered by agencies during the rulemaking \n     process and that the agencies assess a full range of \n     alternatives that will limit adverse economic consequences, \n     enhance economic benefits, and fully address potential job \n     loss.\n\n     SEC. 3603. INCLUDING INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT IN SMALL ENTITY \n                   ANALYSES.\n\n       Section 601 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) the term `economic impact' means, with respect to a \n     proposed or final rule--\n       ``(A) the economic effects on small entities directly \n     regulated by the rule; and\n       ``(B) the reasonably foreseeable economic effects of the \n     rule on small entities that--\n       ``(i) purchase products or services from, sell products or \n     services to, or otherwise conduct business with entities \n     directly regulated by the rule;\n       ``(ii) are directly regulated by other governmental \n     entities as a result of the rule; or\n       ``(iii) are not directly regulated by the agency as a \n     result of the rule but are otherwise subject to other agency \n     regulations as a result of the rule.''.\n\n     SEC. 3604.

Effective regulatory programs provide \n     important benefits to the public, including protecting the \n     environment, worker safety, and human health. Regulations \n     also impose significant costs on individuals, employers, \n     State, local, and tribal governments, diverting resources \n     from other important priorities.\n       (2) Better regulatory analysis and review should improve \n     the quality of agency decisions, increasing the benefits and \n     reducing unwarranted costs of regulation.\n       (3) Disclosure and scrutiny of key information underlying \n     agency decisions should make Government more accountable to \n     the public it serves.\n\n     SEC. 3703.
