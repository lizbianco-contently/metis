The bill will \nbe placed on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we are in the midst of a defining debate on the budget \nof the United States. All of us understand we have a debt threat \nlooming over this country that is as significant as anything we have \nfaced in many years. Democratic members of the Senate Budget Committee \nhave worked for weeks to devise a blueprint we think has merit and that \ndeserves to be a part of the debate. Today, I am here to outline the \nkey elements of that budget blueprint.\n  First of all, I think it is critically important we all understand we \nare as a Nation borrowing 40 cents of every $1 we spend. That is not a \nsustainable circumstance. Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, has indicated that our national debt is our biggest \nnational security threat. This is the top military man in our country \nsaying the debt threat is the most serious national security threat.\n  Why does he say that? Here are the facts: The debt of the United \nStates--the gross debt--all the debt we owe is now approaching 100 \npercent of our gross domestic product, which is the highest level it \nhas been since after World War II. This chart shows a threshold of 90 \npercent and a gross debt of 90 percent. Why did we draw that line on \nthis chart? Because the best\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\nevidence we have tells us when we cross the 90-percent threshold on the \ngross debt of any nation, we are in the danger zone, we are in the red \nzone.\n  The distinguished economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff wrote \na book called ``Growth in a Time of Debt.'' Here is their conclusion:\n\n       We examined the experience of 44 countries spanning up to \n     two centuries of data on central government debt, inflation \n     and growth. Our main finding is that across both advanced \n     countries and emerging markets, high debt to GDP levels (90 \n     percent and above) are associated with notably lower growth \n     outcomes.\n\n  This is a key fact all our colleagues need to know. When our gross \ndebt goes over 90 percent of our gross domestic product, our future \neconomic prospects are diminished. That means fewer jobs created, less \neconomic opportunity--a nation that is at risk. That is where we are.\n  Look at what the Congressional Budget Office says is where we are \nheaded. On the current trajectory, we are headed for a debt that will \ngo to 200 percent of the gross domestic product of the country. This is \nnot the gross debt; this is the publicly held debt, which is smaller \nthan the gross debt. So this chart now looks at the publicly held debt \nand says it is headed for 200 percent of GDP. We cannot stay on this \ncourse. It is critically important we change direction.\n  For every 1 percentage point increase in interest we pay, $1.3 \ntrillion is added to the debt. For those who say don't worry about the \ndebt limit, let's remind them what will occur if the United States \nrefuses to pay the bills it has already incurred, which is the interest \nrates will go up. Those who have loaned us money, if we renege on our \ncommitments to pay them, will then insist on higher interest rates--all \nborrowers will insist on higher interest rates--and for every 1-percent \nincrease in the interest rate, we will pay $1.3 trillion more on our \ndebt. So those who think that somehow, by not extending the debt limit, \nwe are going to help on the debt--no. The opposite is true. The debt \nwill increase and increase dramatically.\n  Here are the hard facts with respect to the relationship between \nspending and revenue over the last 60 years in this country. The red \nline is the spending line. The green line is the revenue line. What \nthis shows very clearly is that spending is the highest it has been as \na share of GDP in 60 years. Yes, we have a spending problem. But it is \nnot exclusively a spending problem, as some assert on this floor, \nbecause revenue as a share of GDP is the lowest it has been in 60 \nyears. To deny that essential fact is to deny the significant elements \nof a compromise that are required to solve this problem.\n  Spending is the highest it has been in 60 years as a share of our \nnational income. Revenue is the lowest it has been in 60 years as a \nshare of our national income. Both have to be addressed if we are going \nto solve this problem.\n\n  For those who say: Well, it is not a revenue problem, oh, yes, it is.\n  This is an article that appeared Sunday, May 1, in the Washington \nPost: ``On the way to a surplus, a $12 trillion U.S. detour.''\n  Remember, in 2001, we were told we were on the way to paying off the \ndebt of the United States. This article by Lori Montgomery in the \nWashington Post on May 1 indicated the fundamental reasons that instead \nof paying off the debt, we have a debt that is mushrooming. This one \nparagraph says it all:\n\n       The biggest culprit, by far, has been an erosion of tax \n     revenue triggered largely by two recessions and multiple \n     rounds of tax cuts. Together, the economy and the tax bills \n     enacted under former President George W. Bush, and to a \n     lesser extent by President Obama, wiped out $6.3 trillion in \n     anticipated revenue. That's nearly half of the $12.7 trillion \n     swing from projected surpluses to real debt. Federal tax \n     collections now stand at their lowest level as a percentage \n     of the economy in 60 years.\n\n  That is the point I just made.\n  So when Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee approached this \nproblem, we looked at it in historical perspective. How did we get into \nthis problem? Half of it is on the revenue side. So we chose to deal \nwith a solution that deals on both sides of the ledger. Yes, we need to \ncut spending; absolutely, that must be done. But we also cut so-called \ntax expenditures that are just spending by another name--loopholes, \nexclusions, deductions, tax preferences, abusive tax shelters, and tax \nhavens that are hemorrhaging revenue that rightfully belongs in the \nTreasury--people avoiding what they legitimately owe to the United \nStates by engaging in abusive tax shelters and tax havens that is \ncosting us substantial revenue. We will get into the specifics of that.\n  The House Republicans chose a different path. They only want to focus \non half the problem. They only want to focus on the spending side of \nthe equation. They don't want to touch the revenue side of the \nequation. I believe that denies reality. That runs away from the hard \nreality of how we got into this situation. Again, we got here by, yes, \nspending that is higher than it has been in 60 years as a share of \nnational income but also revenue that is lower than it has been at any \ntime in 60 years. If we are truthful with ourselves, we are going to \nhave to deal with both sides of this equation.\n  The plan Senate Democrats on the Budget Committee have agreed on \nlooks at a budget framework that includes roughly the same amount of \ndeficit reduction as the House Republican plan. In fact, we have \nsomewhat more deficit reduction than did they. They have a plan that \nwas $3.9 trillion of deficit reduction. Our plan is $4 trillion. The \nactual difference is about $50 billion, but because of rounding, it \nturns out they are at $3.9 trillion, we are at $4 trillion. The actual \ndifference is about $50 billion more in deficit reduction in the plan \nworked by Senate Democrats on the Budget Committee.\n\n  So this is what happens to deficits as a share of GDP under the \nframework we are offering. As you can see, this year the deficit is 9.3 \npercent of gross domestic product. We bring it down very steadily until \nwe get down to 1.3 percent in the 10th year--a lower deficit in dollar \nterms, a lower deficit as a share of GDP than the House Republican \nplan. Let me repeat that. The Senate Democrats on the Budget \nCommittee--our plan reduces the deficit by the 10th year by more than \nthe Republicans in total, and in the 10th year we have a lower deficit \nin dollar terms and a lower deficit as a share of GDP.\n  As shown on this chart, this is what happens to the debt itself. The \ngross debt, as you can see, peaks out at 100 percent in 2011, and then \nwe bring it down gradually but steadily to about 98 percent by 2021. \nThe key is, instead of having the debt line going up, up, and away, \nburying this country under a mountain of debt, we stabilize the debt \nand begin to bring it down--something that every serious economist has \nsaid is absolutely essential.\n  In terms of spending, I indicated that current spending is the \nhighest it has been as a share of GDP in 60 years. Our plan takes that \ndown from 24 percent of GDP to 23 percent and then freezes it at 22 \npercent of GDP for the rest of this decade.\n  Now, some will say: There go the Democrats again. They are spending \ntoo much money. I would say to them: If we could get the spending down \nto the levels that were obtained during the Reagan administration, \nwould that be acceptable? Because that is exactly what we do. Under the \nplan of Senate Budget Committee Democrats, we get spending to the exact \nsame level that pertained during the administration of Ronald Reagan. \nDuring Ronald Reagan's 8 years, spending averaged 22.1 percent of GDP. \nThat is precisely what our spending equals in the budget framework I \nhave outlined here today. We include every part of the Federal budget, \nincluding the defense budget. Just as the fiscal commission did, just \nas every other bipartisan deficit reduction plan has included, we \nlooked to defense spending for savings because no part of the budget \ncan be off the table in terms of a deficit reduction plan.\n  I would say separately, Social Security we deal with separately \nbecause Social Security need not be, should not be part of a deficit \nreduction plan. Savings on Social Security ought to be for the purpose \nof extending the solvency of Social Security. But in terms of those \nparts of spending that are considered on budget, defense has to be \nincluded in any savings. Why do I say that? Well, look what has \nhappened since 1997. Spending on defense and war has gone from $254 \nbillion a year to $688 billion a year. It is a key reason spending has \nexploded.\n  Before the fiscal commission, some of the best defense analysts in \nthe country came before us and told us that 51\n\n[[Page S4463]]\n\npercent of all Federal employees are at the Department of Defense--51 \npercent of all Federal employees are at the Department of Defense--and \nthat does not count the contractors.\n  I asked these analysts: Well, how many contractors are there?\n  Their response was: Senator, we can't tell you.\n  I said: Is that a matter of security? Is that a matter of clearances?\n  They said: No, Senator. We don't know.\n  I said: Well, what is the range? About how many contractors are there \nworking at the Department of Defense?\n  The answer was: Senator, 1 million to 9 million. Between 1 million \nand 9 million. We can't tell you which is right.\n  We have a serious problem of contractors working for the Department \nof Defense and the Department of Defense cannot even tell you how many \ncontractors they have working for them. We have a problem.\n  The previous Secretary of Defense, Secretary Gates, said this:\n\n       . . . the budget of the Pentagon almost doubled during the \n     last decade.\n\n  And he is right about that. Our chart shows that.\n\n       But our capabilities didn't particularly expand. A lot of \n     that money went into infrastructure and overhead and, \n     frankly, I think a culture that had an open checkbook.\n\n  ``A lot of that money went into infrastructure and overhead''--\noverhead--``and, frankly . . . a culture that had an open checkbook.'' \nWe cannot afford an open checkbook anywhere. We have to go after waste, \nfraud, and abuse in every department. We have to go after \ninfrastructure spending that really does not contribute to improving \nour defense. We have to go after overhead, overhead costs that have \nreally run amok.\n  Chairman Ryan of the House said this about defense:\n\n       There are a lot of savings you can get in defense. There's \n     a lot of waste over there, for sure.\n\n  Yet, when they came with their plan, they continued the path of \nincreasing defense spending year over year without any discipline. This \nis the plan they outlined--from $529 billion a year headed for $667 \nbillion a year, and that does not count the war funding.\n  In our plan, we have done what the fiscal commission called for. We \nhave achieved the same savings out of security as the fiscal commission \ndid--$886 billion out of the security category. Now, that includes \ndefense. Obviously, defense is most of security, but in the \n``security'' category also falls homeland security, and also included \nis veteran spending. Veteran spending, by the way, is one place we do \nnot cut a nickel. The veterans deserve to have the promise we have made \nto them kept, and under our budget, every dollar that has been promised \nto veterans will go to them. That does not mean we cannot save money \nout of the security side. The fiscal commission--which, by the way, is \nthe only bipartisan plan that has come from anywhere: five Democrats, \nfive Republicans, one Independent--endorsed a plan with $886 billion of \nsavings over 10 years out of the security category. The budget by \nSenate Budget Committee Democrats adopts that finding.\n  The budget that Senate Budget Committee Democrats are advancing also \nhas governmentwide savings. We freeze the pay of Members of Congress \nfor 3 years. We freeze the legislative branch and White House budgets \nfor 3 years. We freeze civilian pay for 2 years. That has already been \nadopted, but we include that in our budget. We reduce the Federal \nvehicle fleet by 20 percent because, frankly, in our investigations we \nfind in this area there has been an explosion of vehicles in the \nFederal fleet, and I think all of us have seen it with our own eyes. \nThis is something that has to be taken on. We reduce travel costs of \nFederal agencies by 20 percent. We reduce Federal printing costs by $1 \nbillion by 2015. We reduce the number of contractors, which we have \npreviously described.\n  The House Republican plan on revenue is really almost impossible to \nbelieve. In a circumstance in which we have record debt, in a \ncircumstance in which the revenue of this country is the lowest it has \nbeen in 60 years, what is part of their answer? Cut taxes some more, \nand cut them for the very wealthiest among us, cut them another $1 \ntrillion for those who are the most fortunate among us. I am not making \nthis up. This is the House Republican plan: Take a circumstance in \nwhich we have record debt, the lowest revenue we have had in 60 years, \nand cut taxes for the very wealthiest among us by another $1 trillion \nby extending the top rate cuts, by a $5 million estate tax exemption. \nThey actually cut revenues $4.2 trillion below the CBO baseline. Let me \nrepeat that. They actually cut revenue in their plan $4.2 trillion \nbelow the Congressional Budget Office baseline. That is inexplicable.\n  Maybe we can start to understand it when we look at what a former \nReagan economic adviser said about the House Republican plan. Mr. \nBartlett said this:\n\n       Distributionally, the Ryan plan----\n\n  The House Republican plan----\n\n     is a monstrosity. The rich would receive huge tax cuts while \n     the social safety net would be shredded to pay for them. Even \n     as an opening bid to begin budget negotiations with the \n     Democrats, the Ryan plan cannot be taken seriously. It is \n     less of a wish list than a fairy tale utterly disconnected \n     from the real world, backed up by make-believe numbers and \n     unreasonable assumptions. Ryan's plan isn't even an act of \n     courage; it's just pandering to the Tea Party. A real act of \n     courage would have been for him to admit, as all serious \n     budget analysts know, that revenues will have to rise well \n     above 19 percent of [gross domestic product] to stabilize the \n     debt.\n\n  Revenue today is 14.8 percent of GDP--again, the lowest it has been \nin 60 years. If we look at the last five times the budget has been \nbalanced in the last 50 years, here is what we see: Revenues had to be \nclose to 20 percent of GDP. They were 19.7 percent in 1969, 19.9 \npercent in 1998, 19.8 percent in 1999, 20.6 percent in the year 2000, \nand 19.5 percent in 2001. That is the last five times the budget has \nbeen balanced. Each of those times, revenue was close to 20 percent of \nGDP. Now it is 14.8 percent of GDP. Anyone who seriously argues that \nyou can solve this problem just on the spending side of the equation is \nnot being serious.\n  The budget framework we offer today has revenues at 19.5 percent of \nGDP--almost equivalent to what it was during the Clinton years, when we \nhad balanced budgets and, in fact, stopped using Social Security money \nto pay other bills. During the Clinton years, revenue averaged 19.4 \npercent of GDP. Under our plan, it averages 19.5 percent. So revenue is \nclearly not out of line compared to the other times we balanced the \nbudget and, in fact, during the Clinton years when we had the longest \neconomic expansion in this Nation's history.\n  For our colleagues who say, oh, you can't touch revenue or you will \nkill the economy, you will kill job creation--really? How about the \nhistoric record? The historic record shows very clearly that during the \nClinton years, when you had revenue at the same level as we have in \nthis plan, you had the longest economic expansion in this Nation's \nhistory--39 quarters; 32 of those quarters during the Clinton years--\nthe longest uninterrupted period of economic growth in this Nation's \nhistory, and you had revenue at the same level we are talking about in \nthis plan. Facts are stubborn things. A previous President said that. \nHe was right. The fact is, we had the longest period of uninterrupted \ngrowth in our economy during a period in which revenue was at the level \nwe are proposing in this budget. That is a fact.\n  Mr. President, the proposals in the budget framework also seek to \nbring us transparency. We have tax reform that simplifies the Tax Code, \nscales back tax loopholes, protects the middle class, improves \nprogressivity and fairness of the code, promotes economic growth and \nU.S. competitiveness--because we lower the corporate rate from 35 \npercent to 29 percent to make America more competitive, and we pay for \nit by closing corporate loopholes. We also address the tax gap, \noffshore tax havens, and abusive tax shelters, and ensure that \ncorporations pay their fair share.\n  The specifics of our revenue proposal are as follows: The tax cuts--\nthe so-called Bush-era tax cuts--are extended for singles earning up to \n$500,000 a year and for couples earning up to $1 million a year. So 99 \npercent of the American people will see no rate increase--none; 99 \npercent of the American people will see no rate increase. One percent \nwill, and it will be those who are sufficiently fortunate to be earning \nover $1\n\n[[Page S4464]]\n\nmillion a year--the top 1 percent in this country. We ask them to go \nback to rates of the Clinton era, when the top rate was 39.6 percent, \ncapital gains were 20 percent. Those are the rates that pertain--when \nwe had the longest economic expansion in our Nation's history.\n  For those who say it is a job killer, they have to explain how that \ncan be since history shows something quite different from their claim.\n  We also provide for alternative minimum tax relief. That costs $1.5 \ntrillion. That is not a tax increase. We are lowering taxes that would \nbe imposed by the alternative minimum tax, which is increasingly \ngobbling up middle-class taxpayers. We are preventing that from \nhappening. It costs $1.5 trillion to fix. So we are replacing that \nrevenue with other revenue. I don't consider that a tax increase. That \nis merely substituting revenue for revenue that we are subtracting to \nprevent middle-class people from being caught up in the alternative \nminimum tax.\n  We also reform the estate tax, going back to the 2009 levels which \nare $3.5 million a person and $7 million a couple. That means well over \n99.5 percent of estates would be completely exempt. That is a fair \nplan.\n  We also assume net $2 trillion of additional funds from closing tax \nloopholes, cutting tax subsidies, promoting tax fairness. That is over \n10 years.\n  We assume tax preferences for individuals are reduced 9 to 17 \npercent, depending on the amount of offshore tax havens and abusive tax \nshelters that are closed.\n  We assume, as I indicated earlier, that the corporate rate is lowered \nto 29 percent, offset by reducing corporate tax expenditures and \nclosing corporate tax loopholes--specific policies to be determined by \nthe Finance Committee, as they always are.\n  Mr. President, when I indicate there is a range for reducing tax \nexpenditures from 9 to 17 percent, depending on how much savings we get \nout of offshore tax havens, here is the math. Over the next 10 years, \nthe tax preferences--or expenditures, as they are sometimes called--\nwill cost the Treasury $14 trillion. Let me repeat that. The loopholes, \nthe exclusions, the preferences in the Tax Code will cost the Treasury \n$14 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  On top of that, offshore tax havens and abusive tax shelters will \ncost the Treasury another $1.4 trillion. That is according to estimates \nbased on data from the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. So if \nwe recover nothing from tax havens, to reach our revenue numbers we \nwould have to reduce tax expenditures 17 percent. On the other hand, if \nwe recover 80 percent of tax haven losses and tax shelter losses, the \nreduction in tax expenditures would only have to be 9 percent--17 \npercent reduction in tax expenditures if we get no savings from tax \nhavens and tax shelters, and a 9-percent reduction in tax expenditures \nif we recover 80 percent of the losses from tax havens and tax \nshelters.\n  Probably, the realistic expectation ought to be somewhere in between \nthose extremes.\n  If the CBO scored the proposal by Senate Budget Committee Democrats, \nthey would not say there is any tax increase here at all. Let me repeat \nthat. If the Congressional Budget Office scored this proposal by Senate \nBudget Committee Democrats, they would say there is a $765 billion tax \ncut over 10 years. How can that be? How can I be saying there is $2 \ntrillion of additional revenue over 10 years, and the Congressional \nBudget Office would say--if they evaluated this plan by Budget \nCommittee Democrats--they would say it is a $765 billion tax cut? The \nreason is simple.\n  In our plan we extend all of the middle-class tax cuts. In addition, \nwe actually broaden the middle-class tax cuts so that nobody is \naffected by a rate increase unless they are a couple earning over $1 \nmillion a year. We also provide the alternative minimum tax relief to \nprevent millions of middle-class people from being affected by that \nlaw.\n  As I indicated earlier, that costs $1.5 trillion over the next 10 \nyears to shield middle-class taxpayers from that.\n  Third, we provide estate tax reform at the 2009 levels so that well \nover 99 percent of estates are completely shielded or exempt.\n  Again, when our Republican colleagues say--and some of them do--you \ncan't have a higher tax rate, even on those earning over $1 million, it \nwill kill the economy--really? How about looking at the facts. How \nabout looking at the historic record. How about being informed by what \nhas actually happened before because when we look at history, we find \nquite a different answer than our friends on the other side are \nproviding.\n  What we find is that the last time the top rate for those earning $1 \nmillion was 39.6 percent, we experienced the longest period of \nuninterrupted economic growth in U.S. history. That is a fact. We had \n39 quarters of economic growth from 1991 to 2000. For 32 of those \nquarters, Bill Clinton was President, and we had a top rate of 39.6 \npercent on those couples earning over $1 million a year.\n  Our friends on the other side say: You will kill jobs. Do you know \nwhat is fascinating? I remember this debate back when we passed deficit \nreduction under President Clinton. Our friends on the other side said \nthe same thing then. I remember, I was seated here listening to the \nthen-Republican leader claim that if we passed the Clinton plan to get \nthe deficit down and balance the budget, we would crater the economy. \nThose were the exact words our friends on the other side used at that \ntime--that if we raised rates on the wealthiest among us, it would \ncrater the economy.\n  What happened? Not only did we not crater the economy, we had the \nlongest period of economic expansion in our Nation's history, and 24 \nmillion jobs were created--the best record ever. That is the fact. That \nis what really happened--not some fairy tale about what happens if we \nget the country back on track, if we move toward balancing the budget, \ntoward getting the debt down, because that is in fact what happened \nduring the Clinton years.\n  Yes, we had the highest rate of 39.6 percent on those earning over $1 \nmillion. But it didn't crater the economy--no. The economy grew. We had \nthe longest economic expansion in this Nation's history, and 24 million \njobs were created during that period, the best record ever.\n  Let's look again at history. The last five times economic growth was \nabove 4 percent in this country, the top tax rate was 39.6 percent on \nthose earning over $1 million. Facts. Facts are stubborn things. In \n1994, the top rate was 39.6 percent and the growth rate was 4.1 \npercent. In 1997, the top rate was 39.6 percent and economic growth was \n4.5 percent. In 1998, we had 4.4 percent economic growth. In 1999, it \nwas 4.8 percent. In 2000, we had 4.1 percent economic growth--the \nstrongest economic growth, going back decades, in every year. The top \nrate on people earning over $1 million was 39.6 percent, which is \nprecisely what we are proposing in this plan.\n  Mr. President, I think it is undisputed by serious economists, of \nwhatever philosophical stripe, that these tax expenditures have to be \nreined in. We are spending $1.1 trillion a year on tax expenditures. \nSome of the most conservative economists in the country have said that \nis just spending by a different name. Here is Martin Feldstein, \nprofessor of economics at Harvard, Chairman of the Council of Economic \nAdvisers under President Reagan. He has written a column called ``The \nTax Expenditure Solution for Our National Debt.'' He said this:\n\n       Cutting tax expenditures is really the best way to reduce \n     government spending. . . .\n\n  It is called revenue, but it is really spending.\n\n       Eliminating tax expenditures does not increase marginal tax \n     rates or reduce the reward for saving, investment or risk-\n     taking. It would also increase overall economic efficiency by \n     removing incentives that distort private spending decisions. \n     And eliminating or consolidating the large number of \n     overlapping tax-based subsidies would also greatly simplify \n     tax filing. In short, cutting tax expenditures is not at all \n     like other ways of raising revenue.\n\n  This is from the head of the economic advisers under President \nReagan, saying we ought to cut tax expenditures. That is exactly what \nthe Senate Democratic budget plan does. We cut tax expenditures 9 to 17 \npercent, depending on how much we are able to save from closing off \nthese offshore tax havens and the abusive tax shelters.\n  If we get no savings from tax havens and tax shelters, then we would \nhave to reduce tax expenditures 17 percent. If we are able to reduce \ntax havens and\n\n[[Page S4465]]\n\nthe other loopholes, offshore loopholes--the abusive tax shelters--by \n80 percent, then we would be able to reduce tax expenditures by 9 \npercent.\n  Just like Martin Feldstein who said we ought to have after tax \nexpenditures, also Alan Greenspan, former Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, said this:\n\n       I think that Republicans are out to identify a very \n     significant amount of so-called tax expenditures, which in \n     fact are misclassified. They are expenditures, they are \n     outlays, and many are subsidies, and subsidies are not the \n     type of thing that you want for an efficient market system. \n     There are a lot of them.\n\n  Mr. President, that is what we are proposing. Let's go after these \nsubsidies, these preferences, these exclusions. While we are at it, \nlet's go after offshore tax havens, abusive tax shelters. Let's shut \nthem down.\n  If there is any doubt about where this money is going, here it is: \n26.5 percent of tax expenditures go to the top 1 percent in this \ncountry; 26.5 percent of all tax expenditures go to the top 1 percent. \nSo when we are saying we may have to reduce tax expenditures 17 \npercent, we could do it all just with the top 1 percent. That is where \nthe benefit is going.\n  Let me show you in another way. The top 1 percent, in dollar terms--\nthe value, on average, of tax expenditures for those who are in the top \n1 percent in this country, earning an average of $1.1 million a year, \nthey get, on average, a benefit every year from tax expenditures of \nover $205,000. For those who are in the middle quintile, those earning \n$39,000 a year, their average benefit is $3,000. You can see that the \ntop 1 percent have a benefit from tax expenditures that is 66 times \nwhat people in the middle get. It is not unfair to go to those who have \nhad the greatest benefit from the national economy over the last two \ndecades and say to them: We need you to help a little bit more to get \nout of this debt rut we are in. And you know what, that is not unfair \nbecause they have had the greatest benefit over the last 15 years.\n\n  Here is something that I think shows it conclusively. This is the \neffective tax rate for the 400 wealthiest taxpayers in America. In \n1992, it was about 27 percent. In 1995, the tax rate for the wealthiest \n400 was 30 percent--29.9, to be exact. Look what has happened since \n1995. The effective tax rate for the wealthiest 400 taxpayers in \nAmerica has gone down to 16.6 percent. They have had their tax rates \ncut almost in half. Has anybody else had their taxes cut in half? I \ndon't think so. The people who have had their taxes cut in half are the \nwealthiest among us. So it is not unreasonable to go back to them and \nsay: Hey, wait a minute. We have to go back to what the tax rates were \nhere--not back to an effective rate of 30 percent but a top rate that \nwe had in the Clinton years when we had the largest economic and \nlongest economic expansion in our Nation's history. That seems \nreasonable.\n  We also know it is not just on the individual side but on the \ncorporate side as well. This is a little five-story building in the \nCayman Islands. Now, 18,857 companies say they are doing business out \nof this little building. Anybody believe that? Anybody believe 18,857 \ncompanies are doing business out of this little 5-story building down \nin the Cayman Islands? I would say that is the most efficient building \nin the world. Imagine, a little 5-story building, and 18,857 companies \nsay they are doing business out of there. They have maybe 100 employees \nin that building. Those are the most efficient people in the entire \nworld. Unbelievable what they are doing.\n  You know what, they are not doing business; they are doing monkey \nbusiness because what they are doing is cheating all the rest of us who \npay what we owe. Why are they down in the Cayman Islands, those 18,857 \ncompanies, calling that little building home? Because there are no \ntaxes down in the Cayman Islands, and they are showing their profits in \nsubsidiaries they say are operating out of that little building so they \ncan avoid paying the taxes the vast majority of us pay right here in \nthe United States. That is outrageous. That is unfair. Our Republican \nfriends say: Oh, you can't touch that; it is a tax increase if you do. \nReally? That is a tax increase? I don't think so.\n  Offshore tax haven abuse is proliferating. If anybody doubts it, go \nGoogle offshore tax havens and see what happens. See what happens if \nyou Google offshore tax havens. The experts here on the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations have said this:\n\n       Experts have estimated that the total loss to the Treasury \n     from offshore tax evasion alone approaches $100 billion per \n     year, including $40 billion to $70 billion from individuals \n     and another $30 billion from corporations engaging in \n     offshore tax evasion. Abusive tax shelters add tens of \n     billions of dollars more.\n\n  The Democrats on the Budget Committee said: We have had it. We are \ngoing after those people. We are going to insist they pay their fair \nshare just as the vast majority of Americans already do. So we are \nsaying: We are coming after you. If you have a tax haven down in the \nCayman Islands, we are coming after you. If you have an abusive tax \nshelter, we are coming after you because it is not fair to all the rest \nof us who are paying what we owe.\n  There are critical priorities that shouldn't be cut. One is \neducation. Education is the foundation for future economic strength.\n\n       An educated population is a key source of economic growth. \n     . . . Broad access to education was, by and large, a major \n     factor in the United States' economic dominance in the 20th \n     Century and in the creation of a broad middle class. Indeed, \n     the American Dream of upward mobility both within and across \n     generations has been tied to access to education.\n\n  This is a quote from Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence \nKatz in ``The Future of Inequality: The Other Reason Education Matters \nSo Much.''\n  When we see what our friends on the other side are doing, they are \ncutting education 15 percent. We don't believe that is the right \npriority for the country. Yes, overall spending has to be cut. We do \ncut spending--almost $2 trillion in the Democratic blueprint, almost $2 \ntrillion--but not education.\n  Another key priority is energy. We all know what has happened to gas \nprices. They have soared from $1.81 in December of 2008 to over $3.50 a \ngallon by July 4. I just paid $3.77. We all know what is happening to \ngas prices. Many of us believe a key priority is to reduce our \ndependence on foreign energy. House Republicans have a different idea. \nThey cut the programs to reduce our dependence on foreign energy by 57 \npercent. We reject that proposal. We don't think it is in the national \ninterest.\n  Infrastructure--roads, bridges, airports, rail. Here is what the U.S. \nChamber of Commerce has said about infrastructure spending:\n\n       If we don't change course over the next five years, the \n     economy could forgo as much as $336 billion in lost economic \n     growth as transportation networks continue to deteriorate. I \n     am well aware of the fiscal constraints facing this Congress \n     and the nation. But we must avoid cutting off our nose to \n     spite our face. Without proper investment and attention to \n     our infrastructure, the United States' economic stability, \n     potential for job growth, global competitiveness, and quality \n     of life are all at risk.\n\n  That is a quote from Thomas Donohue, the president and CEO of the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  Republicans in the House weren't listening because they propose \ncutting transportation funding in their budget by 30 percent. We reject \nthat cut as well. It does not make sense to cut education, to cut \ninfrastructure. It does not make sense. It will only weaken our \nposition.\n  On health care, the House Republican plan ends Medicare as we know \nit. It replaces it with a voucher system, block grants Medicaid, and \nshifts costs on seniors, children, the disabled, and individual States. \nIt ends the countercyclical nature of Medicaid, and it defunds health \ncare reform, increasing the number of uninsured by at least 34 million \npeople in this country. The House Republicans have said their plan \nsaves Medicare. I don't think so. I think it kills Medicare. Why do I \nsay that? Because under traditional Medicare now, the beneficiary pays \n25 percent. Someone who is eligible for Medicare pays 25 percent of the \nbill. Under the House Republican plan, they would pay 68 percent of the \nbill. That just stands things on their head. Instead of people having \nMedicare as a social safety net when they get to their senior years, \nthey would have it pulled out from under them.\n  We have rejected the House GOP approach and would remind our \ncolleagues that we have had large health\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\ncare savings that were already enacted last year in health care reform. \nThe Congressional Budget Office says that will save in the second 10 \nyears $1.3 trillion. So, yes, everything has to be on the table, but we \njust took a big run at getting our health care costs back in line--$1.3 \ntrillion in deficit savings, according to CBO.\n  In conclusion, the overview of the budget framework we are offering \nour colleagues for their consideration provides $4 trillion in deficit \nreduction over 10 years. It is actually $5 trillion if measured on the \nsame basis as the fiscal commission. We have adopted what we think is a \nmore plausible baseline in light of things that have happened over this \nyear. It stabilizes the debt by 2014 and cuts the deficit to 2\\1/2\\ \npercent of GDP by 2015 and 1.3 percent by 2021. We have tax reform that \nsimplifies the code. This closes loopholes and goes after offshore tax \nhavens and abusive tax shelters and restores fairness. We reject the \nHouse GOP plan to end Medicare as we know it. We protect education, \nenergy, and infrastructure investments. And we have a balanced deficit \nand debt reduction plan, cutting spending by about $2 trillion and \nproviding additional revenue by about $2 trillion.\n  Let me conclude as I began by saying that our revenue plan would be \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office as being a $765 billion tax \ncut because we are replacing revenue lost by extending other tax cuts. \nWe are extending all the middle-class tax cuts and expanding middle-\nclass tax cuts up to those earning $1 million a year. And we are fixing \nthe alternative minimum tax. That costs $1.5 trillion over 10 years. I \ndon't consider that a tax increase at all because you are reducing \nrevenue that would otherwise come into the Treasury under the \nalternative minimum tax--which I think almost all of us think is \nunfair--and replacing it with revenue by reducing tax expenditures. \nEven the most conservative economists in the country say that needs to \nbe done.\n  That is the blueprint the Senate Budget Committee Democrats are \nlaying before our colleagues. We are under no illusions. We know this \nis a year in which the normal process is not being followed. We \nunderstand there are leadership negotiations at the highest level, so \nwe understand this is not going to be dealt with in the normal course \nof doing business. We understand there is leadership negotiation, but \nwe believe there are some ideas in this package that deserve \nconsideration as those negotiations go forward.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their courtesy and their \npatience, and I look forward to this continuing debate as we take on \nthe debt threat that looms over our Nation.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                         Passage of Dodd-Frank\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I commend the Budget Committee chairman \non his contribution to this debate and his contribution to our country. \nI enjoy listening to his remarks and appreciate many of the ideas he \nhas offered today.\n  I rise to talk about an anniversary today--no, it is not my \nanniversary or his but the anniversary of Dodd-Frank, which passed a \nyear ago today.\n  This morning at a press conference, Barney Frank, then-chairman of \nthe House Banking Committee and the Frank portion of the Dodd-Frank \nlegislation, gave a speech before the National Press Club. In it he \nmade some comments that are very important, and I wanted to share my \nagreement and support for some of the things Chairman Frank said.\n\n  I did not vote for Dodd-Frank when it passed 1 year ago, but I did, \nalong with Senator Hagan and Senator Landrieu, offer an amendment which \nwas adopted by the Senate and ultimately agreed to by the House in the \nconference committee. It was an amendment known as QRM, qualifying \nresidential mortgage, an amendment to carve out an exemption from risk \nretention for a well-underwritten mortgage loan.\n  The Dodd-Frank bill, as many in this room will remember, originally \ncalled for a total 5-percent risk retention on every residential \nmortgage made, which would have eliminated many people from making any \nresidential mortgages at all. Ranking Member Frank today in his \ncomments said: Well, we had a 100-risk retention prior to 1994.\n  He is right. That is when savings and loans made loans, and that is \nwhen the Federal Government insured the others, and savings and loans \nhad preferential interest rate treatment so they could make \npreferential payments to people to save in their institution versus the \nbank. But the Federal Government took away the one-quarter percent \ndifferential that savings and loans had and the banks became \ncompetitive with savings and loans for short-term and long-term \ndeposits of savings and all the savings money flowed to the banks that \noffered other products. So savings and loans went out of business. When \nthey did, there was no residential mortgage money, at least no \nconventional money, available in America.\n  So what happened? The securitized market began. Freddie and Fannie \nbegan to play a significant role in providing conventional residential \nmortgage money. Until the collapse, which began in 2006 and culminated \nin 2009 and we still are suffering from today--until that collapse, \nsecuritization was a very reasonable and safe way of raising capital \nfor mortgages.\n  What happened in the mortgage collapse was not a failure of equity or \nskin in the game by the borrower; it was the collapse of underwriting. \nMortgage lenders got into loosey-goosey underwriting--subprime credit. \nThey made loans to people who were higher risk in order to price it at \na higher rate, and they blurred qualifying requirements to where, all \nof a sudden, if you walked in and fogged up a mirror with your breath, \nyou could probably get a mortgage loan and they could probably \nsecuritize it.\n  Dodd-Frank was designed to see to it that didn't happen again, and I \ncommend them for it. But as government often does, sometimes it goes \ntoo far when the pendulum swings back the other way.\n  Thus is the dilemma we are in today, as the rule being proposed by \nthe FDIC, the Federal Reserve, Comptroller of the Currency on the QRM \nrule is going to require, in addition to quality underwriting, a \nminimum 20-percent downpayment.\n  For years in this country we have had 90 percent and 95 percent \nconventional financing or, in terms of FHA, 3.5 percent downpayment and \nVA none at all. There have been various varieties of downpayments that \nhave been allowed based on the loan and its insurance. But with this \nrule of requiring risk retention on any loan with a downpayment of less \nthan 20 percent, except for an FHA or VA loan, it is going to literally \ndestroy what is left of the residential housing market because it will \nextract what is probably 40 to 45, maybe 50 percent, of the current \nmarket today.\n  Senator Landrieu, Senator Hagan, and myself in QRM proposed that \npeople have a qualifying ratio of debt to income that is sufficient to \namortize the debt, a third-party verification they have a job, a credit \nscore that indicates they are willing to pay their payments, an \nappraisal that indicates the house is worth what they are paying for, \nand a downpayment with mortgage insurance required if the downpayment \nwas less than 20 percent.\n  Today, I wish to quote Ranking Member Frank. When talking about risk \nretention, he said: I am troubled because there is an assault now on \nrisk retention--Barney Frank--adding that even though he believes the \n20 percent requirement in the QRM rule being circulated is too high. \nWhen asked further what would be a good downpayment, he said at least 4 \nor 5, something above FHA.\n  I wish to commend the ranking member because he is precisely right. \nAlthough he in his original intent with Dodd-Frank did not want to \nbifurcate residential qualifying mortgages by some having risk \nretention and some not, he recognized the importance of doing some of \nthat bifurcation and having some exception to risk retention. They \nwould have realized that anyway, if you recognize they exempted Freddie \nMac, Fannie Mae, and FHA from the requirements of Dodd-Frank and left \nthem solely on the conventional market.\n  So I wish to thank Congressman Frank today for his comments as they\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\nrelated to QRM and his identifying the downpayment requirement \ncurrently being circulated is entirely too high. It is entirely too \nhigh, and it is very important that we get the final rule, which will \nbe published on August 1, to have a reasonable downpayment of 5 percent \nor more, rather than 20 percent or more. Five percent or more will \nensure there is skin in the game; and with the other qualifying and \nunderwriting provisions in QRM, it will ensure that quality residential \nmortgages are being made.\n  I am not one to offer advice often to the President. He is the \nPresident. He can do as he wishes. But today in Politico there is an \narticle about the President is now returning to revisit the residential \nhousing market because he understands employment is not coming back \nuntil housing comes back; he understands the American dream is, for \nsome people, now the American nightmare; and he understands what has \nbeen done so far has not been working.\n  I wish to suggest to the President that if he thinks what is \nhappening now is a nightmare, you just wait until this QRM rule that is \nbeing circulated now actually goes into effect. Without it being \nchanged and a continued requirement of a 20-percent downpayment, you \nwill have a further lack of demand in the housing market, which already \nis almost at least anemic, if not feeble, because most Americans who \nwant to buy a home can afford 5 percent or maybe 10 percent down, but \nthey can't afford 20, and that is middle America. If you pull them out \nof what is already an anemic housing market, you would have no housing \nmarket at all.\n  So as this Dodd-Frank rule is being circulated in the next 2\\1/2\\ to \n3 weeks before it is finalized, I hope we can all keep up the drumbeat \nfor the regulators to be reasonable in their approach--understand risk \nretention is important but also understand home ownership is important \nand understand we had a collapse that was not downpayment related. We \nhad a collapse that was underwriting related.\n  So if you have strong underwriting and minimal skin in the game of at \nleast 5 percent, you have a qualified residential mortgage that does \nnot have to have risk retention; therefore, you will have enough \ncapital raised in the mortgage markets to fund a housing demand which \nhopefully is going to continue to grow.\n  In the absence of securitization, in the absence of an exemption of \nrisk retention for a qualified residential mortgage, there will be no \nhousing market in the United States of America.\n  FHA is already under so much stress and duress, it is awful and it is \nfrightful. The Veterans' Administration is a privileged loan for those \nwho have served and made the ultimate sacrifice for our country, and \nthey deserve it. Freddie and Fannie are exempted because we have them \nin conservatorship. But they are not going to be a source of money for \nlong. Something will have to replace them, a new entity, probably \nsomething with securitization. But if the QRM rule being circulated now \ndoes, in fact, go into place as it is written, with a minimum 20-\npercent downpayment, it will be the last nail in the coffin of the \nAmerican housing market. The unintended consequence of reaching too far \nto react to the terrible crisis which we had will put the death knell \nof the housing market squarely on the shoulders of this Congress, this \nadministration, and these regulators who are currently carrying out \nthose rules.\n  I wish to commend Ranking Member Frank on his comments today, his \nrecognition that the QRM rule being circulated asks too much, \nrecognizing that a 5-percent or greater downpayment is a reasonable \napproach and recognizing that underwriting is the important key to see \nto it that we have a housing market.\n  I commend the gentleman from Massachusetts. I thank him for adding \nthat comment today to the National Press Club. I hope the regulators, \nthe FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the \nTreasury heard it too. If they didn't hear it and they remain silent \nand continue with 20 percent, they will be doing exactly the opposite \nof what the President of the United States stated he wants to do; that \nis, bring the housing market back in America.\n  I yield back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, before I talk about the budget, I wish to \ncommend the Senator from Georgia.\n  As someone who has been in the real estate business for many years, \nsuch as the Senator from Georgia, he is absolutely right. If homeowners \nare stuck with a 20-percent minimum, the odds are it will crush the \nhousing market. I can tell you this personally because I am helping my \nmother do the paperwork now for her home. If she was required to put 20 \npercent down, she would not be buying that home today. We hope to close \non the home in the next 45 days. We are fortunate she is able to do \nthat, but 20 percent would take her right out of the market, unable to \nbuy the home she wants to retire in.\n  So I say to the Senator from Georgia, I hope more people hear it in \nthe administration, because if they don't hear that, as we know with \nthe housing market, it is a critical component of our ability to pull \nourselves out of the recession. I thank the Senator for making those \ncomments and noting that.\n  I know Senator Conrad was down here earlier, the chair of the Budget \nCommittee, to talk about the budget framework. I first wish to say \nthanks to Chairman Conrad. Here is someone who has been on the Budget \nCommittee for 25 years, since 1986, and has been chairman for many of \nthose years, an unbelievable capacity and understanding of the budget \nand what needs to be done. He understands it. He clearly recognizes we \nhave to have a balanced approach.\n  For months, yourself, Mr. President, and myself, sitting on the \nBudget Committee, along with the chairman on the Democratic side, have \nbeen working to try to figure out how do we craft a balanced approach. \nHow do we ensure that at the end of the day, we recognize we have to \nhave a budget that continues to help grow our economy, creates fairness \nin the system, and makes sure we take the responsibility of creating a \nmore accountable and financially responsible budget, not only for this \nyear but for the years out, and dealing with a comprehensive approach \nto dealing with the deficit?\n  This is not an easy task, to say the least. I can say, standing here, \nand I know, Mr. President, as a member of the Budget Committee also, \nnone of those meetings were easy in the discussion, if I could say \nthat--robust debates, robust controversy in some of the issues we \ntalked about but also a lot of ideas. But what is in front of us?\n  No one can match the chairman's approach of how to address an issue \nsuch as this as he lays out slide after slide the impacts, from the \nmacro to the micro, of this budget and what it will mean. But it is \nclear the budget proposal he has laid out, the framework, as he calls \nit, by the Democratic majority of the Budget Committee is $4 trillion \nin cuts for deficit reduction and is achieved in a very fair and \nbalanced way, without putting the burden on the backs of seniors, \nworking families, and small business. This is a balanced approach. The \ndeficit-cutting mechanisms are drawn half from savings and half from \nrevenues. Revenues mean closing loopholes.\n  His photo there, which as we sit here and present to the President \nour positions is hard for people in the balconies to see, but it is of \nan amazing five-story building. It is not a very attractive building, \njust a small five-story building in a tax haven that grants thousands \nand thousands of businesses a shelter from their fair share of paying \ntheir taxes.\n  The idea of this revenue component of the proposal we put forth is \nclosing loopholes, closing down tax avoidance schemes that rely on \nabusive tax shelters, and, yes, cutting tax subsidies, ending the \npractice of giving the wealthiest of the wealthy tax subsidies they \nsimply do not need. It is about promoting fairness.\n  As we dealt with this budget, a $4 trillion reduction--a number that \nthe bipartisan commission hit as their target, one we hear out there \nnow in the press a lot but one we felt was a reasonable approach. It is \nmore than the House budget that was proposed. The House budget included \nsavings only on the spending side and actually worsened the outlook on \nthe revenue side\n\n[[Page S4468]]\n\nthat we simply do not believe is good enough.\n  The budget is about fairness, about ensuring that we have a system \nthat is balanced but also investing in the right areas so we have long-\nterm and continued growth. We do not give more tax breaks to \ncorporations and the rich and then put the burden on the backs of \nseniors, poor kids, working families, disabled. It is unacceptable to \nput the burden on our most vulnerable population. The budget is truly a \nmoral document. It defines where we are going to go, what we are going \nto do, and how we are going to look in the next 10 years or 20 years as \na country.\n  When I was mayor of Anchorage in 2003, when I got elected, I had a \nbudget around $215 million, with about a $33 million hole in it--pretty \nsignificant in the sense of proportions. We had to deal with spending \nand reducing it. We had to create a fairness in the revenue, but we \nalso had to invest. But we also knew the document and the work we were \ndoing in the budget would define where our community went, not just in \nthe year we were doing it but in the next several years down the road.\n  I was very pleased. When I got elected to the Senate, it was, I \nthink, Business Week and others that rated the city that I was mayor \nof, Anchorage, as probably the most likely city in the country to \nrecover from the recession the fastest. As a matter of fact, Forbes has \nlisted it, not only last year but this year, I think, No. 3 this year \nas the city of job growth because there was a foundation laid. We had \nto make some tough decisions, and I remember as mayor they were no fun. \nI remember the role of the Presiding Officer in the community he \nrepresented. There are tough decisions we have to make, but you have to \nmake them.\n  I can still remember one headline that as we were trying to figure \nout what do with our library system that wasn't run as well as it could \nbe, I still remember this headline to this day: ``Begich Lays Off 21 \nLibrarians,'' which is not a very good headline, to say the least.\n  But what did we do? We reexamined it, reinvested, increased our \npartnerships with the private sector today, and the library system is \nmore robust than ever before, with new branch libraries serving more \nkids than ever before, better facilities, new equipment, new \ntechnology. It is more robust than it has been in decades because we \nhad to make some tough decisions for the long term.\n  That is where we are today, especially after the disappointing news \nwe had this last week with regard to the job market, when the \neconomists thought we were going to have 120,000 new jobs and we ended \nup with just 18,000, unemployment rising to 9.2 percent.\n  As I said, this plan protects critical investment that will help us \nbuild the future of our economy here. It invests, as mentioned by the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Chairman Conrad, in education, \nenergy--which is, of course, for my State critical--and infrastructure, \ncore infrastructure.\n  I use my experience as a mayor. In my short term as mayor of \nAnchorage, we built more roads than all the mayors combined in the \nprevious 20 years. We built more vertical construction--fire stations, \nconvention center, museums, and other facilities that helped water, \nsewer, power, new generation of gas turbines--all that because when you \nbuild that infrastructure, the private sector will attach to it, will \nbe attracted to it and will build off of that.\n  This budget that is being presented by the majority on the Budget \nCommittee keeps our investments in education, energy, infrastructure, \nwhich in turn will ensure that we continue to move back into the realm \nof being more competitive on the worldwide market.\n  We have all heard the budget proposal lays out some ideas on tax \nreform--not just a little bit here and a little bit there, but fairly \nsignificant. When we talk about our corporate rate in this budget \nproposal by the majority in the Budget Committee, it brings it down to \nabout 29 percent. It is not where I would like it, but it is better \nthan where it is today. It gets us more competitive on the world \nmarket.\n  A group of us also have introduced legislation in advance of this \nbudget proposal, the Wyden-Coats-Begich Bipartisan Tax Fairness and \nSimplification Act. The legislation provides real tax reform for our \nvery outdated system. It plays off of exactly what the majority laid \nout, a budget proposal that talks about tax reform to create certainty \nfor our business community for long-term investments, and we take it \none more step. Not only do we look at the corporate component, we look \nat the individuals.\n  Can you imagine, as an individual right now we deal with six \ndifferent rate structures. If we can reduce it to three, which our bill \ndoes, and you could do your tax return on one page--can you imagine the \namount of time, effort, and money individuals will save? We take the \nbudget proposal that the committee I sit on and the Presiding Officer \nsits on one step further. Not only do we focus on stability and \ncertainty for the business community, which is critical for long-term \ninvestments they need to make to ensure all those trillions they have \nliterally locked up in their cash accounts because they are not sure \nwhere we are headed as a country, we create the certainty, but we also \nensure the individual has a compressed rate, a more fair system, and \nsimplified, which we think is important.\n  Tax reform is an integral part of the conversation on deficit \nreduction. I am pleased Senator Conrad's proposal also provides some of \nthe same tax reform principles I mentioned. As I mentioned, it not only \ndeals with the rate structure but, as he detailed, very aggressively \nclosing shelters and loopholes, and not just for one industry over \nanother industry, which has been some of the debate, it is for fairness \nof all. We look at it all because we want everyone to be treated \nfairly.\n  Let me talk about a couple of more pieces in the majority's budget \nfrom the Budget Committee. Chairman Conrad went through it in great \ndetail but I want to emphasize this point. The AMT, the middle-class \ntax cuts--what does this mean? What does this mean for the average \nperson here?\n  Right now, 4.3 million taxpayers are affected by the AMT, which is a \nsmall tax provision that many years ago was set in place to get the \nrichest of the richest. But it was never indexed, never inflation \nadjusted, so it has grown. There are 4.3 million taxpayers we have \naffected today. If we do not fix this tax problem, it will increase to \n31 million people who will have additional taxes to pay.\n  What are we doing? We are putting on the AMT patch to fix this \nproblem so 30-plus million people will not have this additional tax \nburden. We think it is right. We think it is the right approach. It \ngoes to the people who need it the most.\n  In addition, this framework that was laid out today, for singles \nearning $500,000 and couples earning $1 million or more, they will not \nreceive the same tax relief as everyone below them will receive. The \ntax relief will be focused on families who earn $1 million or less. Why \nis that important? Because not only are they families, but almost 98 \npercent of all small business earn $1 million or less pretax. So we \nprotect the backbone of my State. I can tell you as a small \nbusinessperson, the Presiding Officer knows that as someone who worked \nin a small business and it grew to a larger business, it is the \nbackbone. It is what makes the difference in hiring people. Every day \nwhen people see their revenue stream start to increase, small \nbusinesses start hiring people. They need those employees.\n  But this proposal is not only for the individual, and then also the \nlarger corporation bringing in that corporate rate, but it protects \nalmost all the small businesses in this country--and, of course, being \nvery biased--and in my State.\n  What does that mean? That means when you calculate it all in real \ndollars, and you heard the numbers, when you think about the tax \nreductions, the tax savings for middle-class Americans and small \nbusiness, it is well over $1 trillion between the AMT and preserving \nthe tax relief for families earning under $1 million. It is \nsignificant. That is money that small businesses will reinvest into \ntheir businesses, employing other small businesses to do the work. It \nis families who will have more disposable income to put into the \neconomy which means more purchases from businesses which means more \nhiring and this has a constant ripple effect.\n\n[[Page S4469]]\n\n  When you talk to business owners, and I have--I spent a lot of time \nwith them as a small businessperson and a Senator now, meeting with \nbusiness folks on a regular basis--over and over again they tell me put \nthe money in the hands of the consumer. Then the consumers will spend \nthat money and improve the economy because, as they spend money, we \nwill hire more employees and buy more product. It goes on and on.\n  There is a difference between what we are trying to do in the sense \nof the value, who receives the benefit of a comprehensive budget \nproposal, a budget proposal that the majority in the Budget Committee \nhas worked on for the last 2 or 3 months, at least, and before that \ntrying to figure out the right approach. It is a balanced approach. It \nfocuses, as I said, on dealing with budget reductions, accountability, \nensuring that where there is waste we go after it aggressively. Where \npeople are taking advantage of the system at the cost of the everyday \nperson, we go after that. But we don't forget that we have to invest in \nthe core issues of education, energy, and infrastructure, so we \ncontinue to grow this economy.\n  We must have a balanced approach in this process. I know on the other \nside they will argue over and over, first let's do spending and then we \nwill deal with other things. You have to do it all together. I am \ntelling you this as a person who ran a city for almost six years, ran \nbusinesses for many years: you cannot do it on one piece of the \nequation. It is a three-pronged attack. Some of the folks I know around \nhere after years of service have gotten a little amnesia as to how it \nwill occur. We can blame individuals, blame certain Presidents, certain \nmajorities, but we are where we are and we have to deal with this.\n  It is not going to be fun. It will be uncomfortable. It will make us \nhave to dig deep into what is right for the long-term health of this \ncountry and what we need to do to ensure America becomes what it used \nto be--a stronger country economically than it is today where we are in \nthe lead when comes to innovation and we are in the lead when it comes \nto developing new technologies to lead this world in its economic \ngrowth.\n  We cannot do it in this process of I am only going to do one thing \nand one thing only. That does not work. It has to be a broad, sweeping \napproach.\n  We are not going to forget in this process that we are not going to \nthrow people overboard who have helped build this country. When you \nthink of our seniors, the generation that built our country to where it \nis, ensuring that people such as myself, the Presiding Officer, and \nothers have an incredible opportunity, thinking about where they need \nto be, this budget plan keeps Social Security off the table.\n  We recognize there are issues and we have to deal with it in its \nsustainability and we recognize that, but it is not a driver. It has \nnot contributed 1 penny to this deficit. We need to treat Social \nSecurity in a way that ensures sustainability in the long term and \nthere are simple solutions to that that I know we can get to.\n  We also ensure that Medicare is taken care of, that benefits are not \nreduced. Also, as the chairman said so eloquently earlier, we have to \nensure that our veterans are protected, those who serve now in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and all around the world, and served before. We owe a great \ndeal to veterans. In some cases before I got here I know there was a \nlot of debate in the Veterans' Committee on which I sit. We have been \nworking to be very sure they get the benefits they deserve. We need to \nmake sure we fund them. When we send them to war and they become \nveterans after their service, we have an obligation, an obligation that \nshould not be sliced and diced because we want to make political \nstatements on the budget cutting process. They need to be protected.\n  As I said, this budget does good things. It is a fair approach. It \nmay not be perfect in all senses. I can tell you there are things I \ndon't like in it that are going to impact groups that are concerned \nabout how we approach this, but we are all in this together. We need to \nmake the approach the right way. But those who are so hardened now who \nsay it is only going to be about spending cuts--which, let me make it \nvery clear, I think the Budget Committee, the majority on the Budget \nCommittee, is not afraid of dealing with the budget cuts. We have done \nthat--$2 trillion of budget cuts. We have to get used to it when we are \nhere in the Senate, not Bs or Ms, they are Ts, $2 trillion of budget \ncuts. We also balance it getting rid of loopholes and tax shelters in a \nfair and balanced way so everyone pays their fair share, but we also \nmake sure we invest in the future.\n  If we are shortsighted around this place, we will pay for it next \nyear and the year after that and the year after that. This is truly I \nthink the right approach that goes after ensuring the middle class are \nnot the people carrying the burden as they have been doing for the last \nseveral years--especially in the last 2 years, clearly--and that \neveryone participates. But we also make sure investment is done the \nright way.\n  The chairman laid out in great detail all that is in the framework. \nWe think it is an important piece to lay down, that Democrats have been \nworking on. We have been working every hour, every day. Even when we \nare back in our home States, trying to talk to constituents, we are \ntalking about the budget. The Presiding Officer tells me stories. Every \nnight he heads home and he meets with constituents to try to find out \nwhat the right approach is here. We bring all that information right \nhere in this body. We did it in the majority in the Budget Committee. I \nknow I put up a Web site request asking Alaskans what it is they want \nto cut. What do they want to save or have as revenues? Like good \nAlaskans, they were not bashful. They were very adamant about what they \nwanted and what they did not want and where we should cut and where we \nshould not cut. I have taken all that in, and I have used that as part \nof my debate and discussion with the majority of the Budget Committee \nto figure out what the right approach is. I think this is the right \napproach. I think some might call it a big deal. In the Senate, this is \nthe big deal. We are in the big place. This is where big deals happen. \nThis is where it all has to happen. It is where we drive the economy in \nthe sense of our certainty and our policies. If we cannot have a strong \ndeficit reduction budget, we are not going to create the certainty the \nbusiness community needs to invest, which will, in turn, employ more \npeople and create a better economy for us here and obviously will have \nan impact around the world.\n\n  I want to say thank you for an opportunity to say a few words, again, \ncommending the chairman, who was here earlier, for all of his work. It \nis a tough call. I will end on this comment, the story I told you about \nthe librarians and the headline I had to have. That was in my first 6 \nmonths in office when I was mayor. Mr. President, 2\\1/2\\ years later, I \nwon reelection with one of the largest margins in the city's history. \nSo I would say this to anybody who is trying to figure out if they are \ngoing to win their primary, win their general election: Put that all \naside. That is what I did when I was mayor. I had to make some tough \ncalls. Did I know if I would win reelection? No. I didn't know. I knew \nI did the right thing because it was the city I lived in. It was the \nState I grew up in. It was important for us to make the right decision, \nwhich at the end of the day is usually the right political decision. \nThat is what this body has to do. It is not fun because people face \nprimaries. They face general elections. Some will win, some will lose. \nBut if we are true public servants, truly it doesn't matter if we are \nsitting in this room or outside there; we are always public servants. \nWe have to do what is right in this critical time for this country and \nin the global perspective. If we don't do the right deficit plan, it \nwill ripple through this country and it will ripple through this world \nin the wrong direction.\n  Thank you for the opportunity. Thank you for the chance to say a few \nwords, but also I implore my colleagues on the other side to think \nabout today's opportunities for the generations in the future and not \nabout today's elections. And I mean on both sides of the aisle. It is \nabout the moment of what people do for this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak until I finish my remarks.\n\n[[Page S4470]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in recent days I have spoken several times \non the matter of tax expenditures. I am going to address this subject \nagain today. It is a timely topic. Everyone is talking about our out-\nof-control deficits and debt. There are divergent opinions on how best \nto deal with our Nation's increasingly perilous fiscal situation, but \nthere is one thing everyone seems to agree on: Both the deficit and the \ndebt are unsustainable. If we keep going down this fiscal path, the \nUnited States will face a crisis similar to that in Greece and sooner \nrather than later. The numbers could not be clearer. Federal spending \nas a share of our economy is trending at a pace 15 percent to 20 \npercent greater than its historical average of 20.6 percent of GDP. If \nwe leave in place this year's level of taxation, including the marginal \nrate of relief between the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and patch the \nalternative minimum tax, or AMT, the Federal tax take will equal or \nexceed its historic share of the economy.\n  Liberals suggest the deficit and debt can only be resolved with a \nsignificant tax increase. This is either deliberately misleading or \nsadly delusional. They are either selling snake oil to the American \npeople or they refuse to come to grips with reality. Sticking their \nheads in the sand is not an option. As you can see, here are Federal \ntaxes and spending as a percentage of GDP. The red line happens to be \nthe spending line. And as you can see, we are way up here in the Obama \n2012 budget. The blue line happens to be the average between 1960 and \n2009. As you can see, it is way down here. Our spending is out of \ncontrol. The markets and the American people understand the nature of \nour crisis. Nondefense discretionary spending is at historic levels and \nour entitlement programs are headed for bankruptcy.\n  When former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi responded to the utter \nfailure of President Obama and congressional Democrats to come up with \na Medicare reform plan, she responded, ``We have a plan. It's called \nMedicare.'' That attitude is the recipe for bankrupting the Nation, a \nbankruptcy that will take our seniors down with it. The left might \nprefer to ignore reality, but here is the undeniable truth: Our Nation \nfaces a spending crisis that tax increases cannot fix. I wish the media \nwould get this. They are so enamored with the idea of a grand bargain \non deficit reduction, a little spending reduction here, a little tax \nincrease there, that they miss the fundamental point. The problem is \nspending, as you can easily see by this red line. It is way out of \nwhack, and going back to the dry well of raising taxes on the rich is \nnot going to work.\n  The fact that Democrats in the Senate have not put forward a budget \nin over 800 days is neglecting one of the core constitutional \nresponsibilities, and it is all the evidence we need that they are \nafraid of the bill coming due on all of their spending. They understand \ntheir hard left base will not accept structural changes to our biggest \nspending programs under any circumstances. But they also understand \nthat the American people will not stomach for a minute the tax \nincreases that will be necessary in the absence of such reforms. This \nis a difficult position to be in, so rather than deal with the facts, \nthey traffic in obfuscation. This morning I heard the ranking \nDemocratic member on the House Budget Committee following the \nPresident's lead and suggesting that removing some tax breaks for \nenergy companies would fix our deficit crisis. Getting rid of those tax \nbreaks would raise $21 billion over the next 10 years. Yet this fiscal \nyear alone, in 2011, we will have a projected budget deficit of $1.5 \ntrillion to $1.6 trillion. So where is the rest of our money going to \ncome from?\n  Last week I came under fire for stating what I thought to be a \nrelatively noncontroversial fact. Here is what I said:\n\n       In 2009, 51 percent of Americans had zero or negative \n     income tax liability.\n\n  Here is what that means. In 2009 only 49 percent--a minority of all \nhouseholds in this country--49 percent of tax units shouldered 100 \npercent of the Nation's tax burden. And 51 percent of the tax units--a \nmajority of all tax units in this country--either owed nothing to the \nIRS or, better yet, got money back from the IRS in excess of their tax \nliability. Mr. President, 23 million of them got refundable tax \ncredits, much more than they pay in employment taxes, which are Social \nSecurity. By the way, as they pay into Social Security, they only pay a \nthird of what they will ultimately draw out according to the actuaries, \nbut they are not paying income taxes. This should be no less \ncontroversial than saying the Sun rises in the east. This is not \nconjecture. It is a demonstrable fact, yet apparently touched a nerve. \nBecause last week after raising this issue on the Senate floor, MSNBC \nand the liberal blogosphere, presumably armed with the talking points \nfrom the Senate Democratic war room, went ballistic, suggesting that I \nwanted to balance the budget by raising taxes on the poor. I am not \nsurprised, but this completely misses my point, and the point is this: \nNo matter what these Democrats tell you, the wealthy and middle class \nare already shouldering around 100 percent of the Nation's tax burden \nand 51 percent pay absolutely nothing in income taxes. Furthermore, \nbecause of this perverse distribution of Federal income taxes, there is \nno way to fix our deficit hole and pay down the debt by increasing \ntaxes on the so-called rich.\n  Here is the bottom line. All of the ``let's talk about taxes on the \nrich'' and closing loopholes and going after corporate tax breaks is \nmeant to divert attention from the sad fact that the President's out-\nof-control spending puts Democrats in a position of having to raise \ntaxes big time on the middle class since they are going to balance the \nbudget without structural reforms to our largest spending programs. Tax \nincreases on the wealthy will not get our Nation to fiscal balance. \nEven if we let the Bush tax breaks expire from the top income bracket, \nthe total amount raised over 10 years would be $615 billion. That is \nover 10 years. Yet our deficit this year alone is $1.5 trillion to $1.6 \ntrillion. This is why the issue of tax expenditures is critical. So \neverybody knows, I made it clear, I thought, in my last remarks that I \ndon't want to tax the truly poor, those who would help themselves if \nthey could. I do not want to tax them. But you can't tell me that 51 \npercent of all households are the truly poor. I don't want to tax them \neither, to be honest with you, but it is apparent we are going to have \nto find a better way of broadening the base of the tax system. \nDemocrats talk about tax expenditures as though they were the holy \ngrail of deficit reduction. Just close these loopholes and happy days \nare here again. The public is being misled in this type of debate, but \ndon't take my word for it. Today the Associated Press had a story with \nthe following lines:\n\n       SPIN METER: Obama, Dems skirt issue on tax hikes.\n\n  This is what the body of the article has to say:\n\n       Proposals under consideration include raising taxes on \n     small business owners and potentially low- and middle-income \n     families.\n\n  You won't hear about that from President Obama. Instead, the \nPresident focuses on the very rich and speaks euphemistically. Here are \na few of the phrases the President has used of late of what amounts to \nraising taxes for some:\n\n       What we need to do is to have a balanced approach where \n     everything is on the table.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       We need to take on spending in the tax code. The tax cuts I \n     am proposing we get rid of are tax breaks for millionaires \n     and billionaires, tax breaks for oil companies, hedge fund \n     managers and corporate jet owners. You can't reduce the \n     deficit to the levels it needs to be reduced without having \n     some revenue in the mix.\n\n  All those are quotes by the President. They are doing their best to \nhide their intentions, but the writing is on the wall. Democrats are \nangling for historic tax increases on the middle class, and the way \nthey want to accomplish this is by reducing or eliminating tax \nexpenditures. Cutting back tax expenditures is a convenient way for \nDemocrats to tax middle-class tax-paying families without having to say \nthey are raising their tax rates. As I noted last week, this is what we \nwere talking about when Democrats discussed tax expenditures. They are \ntalking about your pension. They are talking about your Medicare. They \nare talking about your ability to purchase a home or save for \nretirement or give to your church or put away money for your\n\n[[Page S4471]]\n\nchildren's education. This is exactly what we are talking about. That \nis where the money is. It is not in bonus depreciation for corporate \njets, and it is not in tax benefits for energy companies.\n  When Democrats talk about tax expenditures and tax loopholes as a way \nto bring down the deficit and debt, they are putting a bull's-eye on \nthe backs of middle-class American families. We heard a lot this \nmorning about Republicans walking away from the President's grand \nbargain on deficit reduction. Well, I know that the people of Utah \napplaud Speaker Boehner for not signing on to this bogus deal. This \nmorning the President's allies in the media were asking why Republicans \nwalked away from this deal. With the President willing to put \nentitlement spending on the table, why aren't Republicans willing to \nput taxes on the table? It is worth noting that the President and his \nDemocratic allies steadfastly refuse any structural changes to \nentitlement spending.\n  Second, for Democrats, putting taxes on the table and tax \nexpenditures means tax increases on the middle class, and that is a \nnonstarter. This issue of tax expenditures is confusing and demands \ngreater clarity. As ranking member of the Finance Committee, it is my \nresponsibility to correct the record on what the curtailment or \nelimination of tax expenditures would mean for taxpayers and families.\n  If you listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle, you would \nthink tax expenditures are ``spending through the Tax Code.'' You would \nthink they are mostly loopholes in the tax law designed by and for \nspecial interests such as ethanol blenders. Another mantra you will \nhear too often uncritically reviewed by many in the media is that tax \nexpenditures disproportionately benefit wealthy taxpayers.\n  A few days ago I talked about what tax expenditures are and what tax \nexpenditures are not. They are not spending. You can find the text of \nthat speech from July 6 on the Finance Committee Web site. They are \nnot, in the main, loopholes for special interests. The other day, I \ntalked about the major features of family financial planning that would \nbe upended if tax expenditures were curtailed. I referred to employee \npension plans such as 401(k) accounts. I also mentioned charitable \ngifts and home ownership. If my friends on the other side are \nsuccessful in cutting back tax expenditures, American families, \nworkers, and investors can expect the cost of all of these activities \nto rise. If the cost rises, as a nation, we will be poorer because we \nwill have less retirement savings, fewer charitable contributions and \nmore expensive homeowners. You can find the text of that speech last \nThursday on the committee Web site as well.\n  Today I am going to consider the oft-repeated line that tax \nexpenditures disproportionally benefit the wealthy taxpayers.\n  For purposes of this discussion only, I will adopt the President's \ndefinition of rich; that is, singles with adjusted gross incomes over \n$200,000 per year and married couples with incomes over $250,000 per \nyear. I wish to be clear that I do not lump all of these folks in with \nBill Gates, Jr., LeBron James, Warren Buffett, or Gilligan's Island \nresident millionaire Thurston Howell, III. Here is good old Thurston \nwho was the millionaire on Gilligan's Island. I am using the \nPresident's definition of rich because most of my friends on the other \nside use it. They also claim tax expenditures reside disproportionately \nwith rich taxpayers.\n  The Democrats' rhetoric on expenditures does not jibe with the \nreality of our Tax Code. The data is clear. Tax expenditures tend to \nskew toward taxpayers below the President's definition of the rich. If \nmy friends on the other side examine the data, they will find their \nassertion about who benefits from tax expenditures does not square with \nthe facts. They will find their assertion that tax expenditures \ndisproportionately benefit the wealthy falls flat on its face.\n  In much of the coverage of tax expenditures, it has been taken as an \narticle of faith that they disproportionately benefit wealthy \ntaxpayers. Similar assertions have come from the White House and \ncongressional Democrats. The one exception is my friend, the ranking \nDemocrat on the Ways and Means Committee, Sander Levin. Congressman \nLevin has cautioned against treating tax expenditures as rich persons' \ntax benefits. His position is well founded. The source for this \nassertion, that tax expenditures are tax benefits for the rich, is a \nTax Notes article dated May 3, 2011.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Tax Policy Center, May 5, 2011]\n\n                  Who Benefits From Tax Expenditures?\n\n                         (By Roberton Williams)\n\n       The federal income tax is replete with tax expenditures, \n     provisions that grant special benefits to selected taxpayers \n     or for selected activities. Exclusions and deductions reduce \n     taxable income, preferential rates cut the tax on specific \n     types of income, and tax credits are subtracted directly from \n     tax liability.\n       The various kinds of tax expenditures reduce taxpayers' \n     individual income tax liability differently throughout the \n     income distribution (see graph). More than 90 percent of the \n     tax savings from preferential tax rates on long-term capital \n     gains and qualified dividends go to taxpayers in the top \n     quintile (or fifth) of the income distribution, and nearly \n     half the benefits go to people in the top one-tenth of 1 \n     percent. The top quintile gets about three-fourths of the \n     savings from itemized deductions and more than 60 percent of \n     the benefits of exclusions of selected sources of income such \n     as employer health insurance contributions. High-income \n     households receive relatively larger benefits from special \n     rates, deductions, and exclusions, because they have \n     relatively more income from certain tax-favored sources \n     (capital gains, dividends, tax-exempt interest) and because \n     under our graduated income tax, exclusions and deductions are \n     worth more to taxpayers in higher rate brackets.\n       In sharp contrast, most of the value of tax credits goes to \n     households in the bottom four quintiles. Nearly 80 percent of \n     nonrefundable credits and more than 95 percent of refundable \n     credits benefit those households. Many credits phase out for \n     high-income taxpayers, limiting their value, but they are a \n     major reason why nearly half of all tax units pay no federal \n     income tax. Nearly one-third of all refundable credits go to \n     the poorest one-fifth of all households and often result in \n     net payments from the government.\n       Overall, tax expenditures give more benefits to high-income \n     households relative to income but are roughly proportional to \n     tax liabilities. The top quintile collects 55 percent of all \n     income, pays 67 percent of all taxes, and gets nearly 65 \n     percent of the value of tax expenditures. Middle-income \n     households earn slightly more than 40 percent of all income, \n     pay one-third of taxes, and get one-third of tax benefits. \n     The poorest quintile of households receives slightly less \n     than 4 percent of both income and benefits from tax \n     expenditures but pays only 0.5 percent of federal taxes, \n     largely because refundable credits offset almost all their \n     tax liabilities.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. The article is written by Roberton Williams of the Tax \nPolicy Center or TPC. TPC is a tax policy think tank that is the \nproduct of two center-left think tanks. The article presents \nconclusions from a TPC distribution analysis of tax expenditures.\n  The analysis concludes that about two-thirds of tax expenditures \nbenefit the top quintile of households in the study. Viewers on C-SPAN \nmay wonder what a quintile is. It refers to one-fifth of the given \npopulation. The TPC analysis is, therefore, measuring the top one-fifth \nof the population.\n  According to that study, where does that top one-fifth of the \npopulation begin? It begins at $123,000 of household income. It should \nbe noted that household income is a bit broader than the adjusted gross \nincome which is the basis of the President's definition. According to \nTPC, that top quintile earns 55 percent of income and shoulders a huge \namount of the Federal tax burden. They say it is 67 percent.\n  Now, perhaps not too surprisingly, TPC finds that tax expenditures \nfor the top quintile approximate that top one-fifth's share of the tax \nburden. With the exception of the refundable credit tax expenditures, a \ntaxpayer has to pay income tax to benefit from the tax deduction credit \nor exclusion.\n  Those asserting that tax expenditures are mainly wealthy taxpayer \nbenefits are principally relying on TPC's distribution analysis. If \nconfronted with the TPC data, it seems to me they have four choices. \nTheir first choice would be to revise downward the income basis of \ntheir definition of ``rich.'' They could say we really did not mean \nfamilies at $250,000 of income; we meant families of $123,000 of \nincome. That would be similar to the adjustment made for ObamaCare. \nJoint tax distribution tables for ObamaCare showed that for every \nfamily below $200,000 who received an exchange credit, four families \npaid higher taxes. For\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\nevery middle-class family who receives a premium subsidy, five pay \nhigher taxes. That is just a fact. I guess I said five. It really would \nbe four who would pay higher taxes.\n  A second choice would be to revise the proportion of tax expenditures \nso that the tax expenditure dollar amount reflects the benefits \nattributable to taxpayers defined by the President as rich. The \nPresident's rich taxpayer definition is the top 3 to 5 percent of \ntaxpayers. It means the group of taxpayers who are roughly 25 to 33 \npercent of the size of the group in the TPC analysis.\n  Put another way, the TPC population of rich taxpayers is three to \nfour times the size of the group the President and my friends on the \nother side define as rich. If a consistent definition of the rich were \nused, the dollar amounts of tax expenditures in play would be \nconsiderably lower. Since the goal of the group pushing the cutback of \ntax expenditures is to relieve spending constituencies of the pressure \nof curtailing spending, my guess is they will not choose to reduce the \ntax expenditure kitty.\n  Their third choice would be to simply curtail or eliminate tax \nexpenditures for higher income taxpayers. This, of course, could \nlargely eliminate the preferential rates for capital gains and \ndividends.\n  Let's take another look at this chart because it shows a big share of \nthe capital gains tax expenditure goes to the top one-fifth. It looks \nas though about 95 percent of tax expenditures accrues in the top one-\nfifth. We see that about 50 percent of it accrues to the top one-tenth \nof 1 percent. Do we think it would make sense in the current economic \nclimate to double or triple the tax hit on investment?\n  At one point, at least, the President's answer was no. In August 2009 \nthe President was asked by a resident of Indiana:\n\n       [e]xplain how raising taxes on anyone during a deep \n     recession is going to help with the economy.\n\n  Here was the President's response:\n\n       Normally, you don't raise taxes in a recession, which is \n     why we haven't and why we've instead cut taxes. . . . You \n     don't raise taxes in a recession. We haven't raised taxes in \n     a recession.\n\n  So what is their fourth choice? Their fourth choice would be coming \nclean with the American people. Under this option they would admit that \ntax expenditures disproportionately go to families who are not rich \nunder the President's own definition. They would acknowledge that \ncutting back tax expenditures as part of a deficit-reduction exercise \nwould hit the middle class and betray the President's promise not to \nraise taxes on middle-class families.\n  As we can see, the proponents of these tax increases are in political \nquicksand, and there is additional evidence that they are sinking as \nthey struggle against the facts. I would ask my friends on the other \nside to take a look at the Joint Tax distribution tables on many of the \nmajor tax expenditure categories. Joint Tax publishes these tables \nevery year. They are available on the Joint Tax Web site.\n  I have a chart that summarizes the percentages of tax expenditures \nthat go to taxpayers under $200,000. I will have to bring that with me \nthe next time. That is the break point that Joint Tax uses--the \npercentage of tax expenditures that go to taxpayers under $200,000. It \nclosely squares with the definition of ``rich'' used by the President \nand his liberal allies.\n  Anybody above $200,000 is rich under my Democratic friends' \ndefinition. Anybody under $200,000 is not rich. You can find this data \nin the tax expenditures pamphlet published annually by the nonpartisan \nJoint Tax staff.\n  Now I wish to talk about the tax expenditures that Joint Tax \ndistributes by income. I have listed them in order, from the largest in \ndollar volume down to the lowest in dollar volume. The first one is \nwell known to tens of millions of our constituents. It is the mortgage \ninterest deduction.\n  If a taxpayer saves up a downpayment and borrows for a home, they can \ntake the interest paid on the mortgage as an itemized deduction. That \nmeans 30 percent of the benefit of the mortgage interest tax \nexpenditure goes to taxpayers over $200,000. Taxpayers with incomes \nbelow $200,000 receive 70 percent of the benefit of the mortgage \ninterest deduction.\n  Now, how do we measure whether the mortgage interest deduction \ndisproportionately benefits taxpayers over $200,000? There is a line in \nbold letters that reads: ``Compare Total Federal Tax Burden.'' That is \nthe baseline of how much tax is shouldered by the group of taxpayers \nabove and below $200,000. We have a very progressive tax system. \nTaxpayers earning more than $200,000 shoulder 64 percent of the tax \nburden. Taxpayers earning less than $200,000 shoulder 36 percent of the \ntax burden.\n  Taxpayers earning less than $200,000 receive 70 percent of the \nmortgage interest deduction while shouldering 36 percent of the tax \nburden. Who benefits from these tax expenditures? We are going to get \ninto that. That means by a ratio of almost 2 to 1, taxpayers under \n$200,000 benefit from the mortgage interest deduction; and since \n$200,000 basically fits the definition of ``rich'' used by my friends \non the other side of the aisle, we can see that other taxpayers who are \nnonrich, or the middle-income group, disproportionately benefit from \nthe mortgage interest rate deduction.\n  Now, let me talk about another tax expenditure. I am referring to the \nearned-income credit, or EIC. It is a refundable credit. That means \ntaxpayers receive it whether they pay income tax or not. That is why \nthe credit is basically scored as spending by the Congressional Budget \nOffice--the CBO--and Joint Tax.\n  There is a bit of irony about this tax expenditure because it is \nrefundable. It is more popular with my friends on the other side than \nother tax expenditures. That is because those other tax expenditures go \nto taxpayers who actually pay income tax. The refundable credit is \npopular with my friends on the other side because it is a robust \nincome-reducing mechanism.\n  President Obama, in his famous exchange with Joe the Plumber, \ncaptured the economic theory supporting this policy when he said we \nneed to ``spread the wealth around.''\n  Here is the irony. My friends on the other side derisively describe \nall tax expenditures as ``spending through the Tax Code.'' Yet the tax \nexpenditures they most support are the refundable ones, such as the \nearned-income credit. It should come as little surprise that the left's \nfavorite tax expenditure is the one that is scored as spending by \ncongressional spending scorekeepers.\n  Because the earned-income credit tax expenditure is refundable, we \nshouldn't be surprised to find that so-called rich taxpayers do not \nbenefit from it. The chart confirms this point.\n  The third tax expenditure is right here: the current $1,000-per-child \ntax credit. It is, by definition, limited to lower and middle-income \ntaxpayers. We should not be surprised to find that none of it goes to \nhigher income taxpayers, and the chart confirms this point: zero to \ntaxpayers over $200,000; 100 percent to taxpayers under $200,000.\n  Let's take a look at State and local taxes. It is the fourth one on \nhere. The chart shows that 50 percent of this broad-based deduction \ngoes to middle-income families.\n  No. 5 on this list is a tax benefit near and dear to many of my \nfellow Utah families. It is the itemized deduction for charitable \ncontributions or donations. Of all the tax expenditures listed on this \nchart--this big chart right here--this one, charitable itemized \ndeductions--distributes in the highest proportion to taxpayers above \n$200,000 in income. The chart says 55 percent, right here; 45 percent \nfor those under $200,000. Keep in mind, overall, taxpayers with income \nover $200,000 bear 64 percent of the tax burden.\n  Now, this means proportionately, the charitable deduction benefits \ntaxpayers under the $200,000 level more than taxpayers above the \n$200,000 level.\n  Now let's take a look at No. 6 on this chart. It is the tax-free \nportion of Social Security benefits, right there. Anyone advocating a \ncutback on tax expenditures is advocating a cutback on the aftertax \nSocial Security benefits for a big chunk of the senior population. \nGuess what. We are not talking about wealthy seniors. According to this \nchart, 2 percent of that favorable tax treatment of Social Security \ngoes to seniors with incomes over $200,000. My guess is that few of the \nseniors benefitting from this policy own yachts or regularly fly \ncorporate jets.\n  No. 7 is the itemized deduction for real property taxes. Right now, \ntheir\n\n[[Page S4473]]\n\nconstituents take the edge off that heavy local tax hit with the \nitemized deduction. If many of my friends on the other side have their \nway and hack away or eliminate tax expenditures without also cutting \ntheir constituents' Federal tax rate, guess what happens. In the case \nof local property taxes, the net effect will be to raise the property \ntax rate by as much as 35 percent.\n  Some of my friends may suggest that only those with villas are taking \nthe property tax deduction. This chart says otherwise. It says 80 \npercent of the real property tax benefits go to taxpayers under \n$200,000.\n  How about No. 9 on the list? No. 9 on the list is the itemized \ndeduction for medical expenses. ObamaCare cut back on that one. But if \nmy friends on the other side reduce or eliminate side tax expenditures \nto avoid dealing with out-of-control government spending, this \ndeduction will be cut back even more. The chart shows on these medical \nitemized deductions that 89 percent of this tax benefit goes to \ntaxpayers earning less than $200,000.\n  No. 10 is the dependent childcare credit. This is a modest tax credit \nthat working moms and dads can tap. Like the child tax credit, it \nmainly is used by middle-income families. The chart confirms it. It \nindicates that 96 percent of the benefits of this credit go to families \nearning less than $200,000.\n  The final item on the list is the student loan interest deduction, as \nshown right here on this chart. This tax benefit is income limited. Not \nsurprisingly, all of the benefit goes to taxpayers earnings learning \nless than $200,000--100 percent of the benefit. I do not think a lot of \nthe recent college graduates using this deduction are in the market for \na yacht. But if you listen to my friends on the other side, you would \nthink because this benefit is labeled a tax expenditure, those who \nbenefit from it have a schooner docked in the local harbor.\n  I am not saying that only middle-income families benefit from tax \nexpenditures. Wealthy taxpayers benefit from the lower capital gains \nand dividends rates.\n  Let me refer to this chart of the 10 largest tax expenditures for the \nperiod 2010 to 2014. But the lion's share of tax expenditures goes to \nthat part of the middle class that is already shouldering much of the \nNation's tax burden. Most of the tax expenditures are either income \nlimited or of limited value to wealthy taxpayers. Likewise, low-income \nfamilies do not pay income taxes. They receive tax expenditures that \nare designed for the nontaxpaying population.\n  So who is left? The answer is the taxpayers who are not rich by the \nPresident's own definition. The answer is middle-class families.\n  On our side, the reaction to all these choices would be simple. Many \non our side, including Ways and Means Committee Chairman Camp, have put \nit this way. Keep your hands off tax increases, including cutbacks in \ntax expenditures, for deficit reduction. Reserve those tax expenditures \nfor tax reform. In that way, taxpayers receive a benefit--lower rates \nin exchange for a broader base. That broader base would include reform \nof tax expenditures, if Chairman Camp and I have our way. Any other \napproach is just another tax increase. And they on the other side will \nspend every dime of it.\n  The President this morning gave another press conference. He asked \nwhat the holdup was in arriving at a deficit reduction compromise. The \nanswer seems pretty obvious. Contrary to the President's vague \nassertions, the leftwing base he is depending on for his reelection \nrefuses any meaningful structural reforms to the spending programs that \nare currently bankrupting our country. That means the only serious \ndeficit reduction option available to Democrats is massive tax \nincreases on the middle class. Democrats will not acknowledge the \ninevitable tax increases their agenda assumes, and Republicans will not \ngive the President any cover in his drive to ``spread the wealth \naround.'' That is what is holding up this process.\n  So let me offer a suggestion. Instead of berating Republicans for not \nsigning on to historic and economy-crushing tax increases, when \nunemployment is at 9.2 percent, maybe the President should take his own \nparty to the woodshed. Maybe he should ask the liberals in his party \nwho refuse any meaningful structural reforms to entitlements to get \nserious. Maybe he could go on television and explain to the American \npeople that we have over $60 trillion in liabilities and that tax \nincreases are not going to bring that into balance.\n  Instead, the President and his party sit around and spread the myth \nthat simply getting rid of tax expenditures and loopholes--and they \ncertainly are not loopholes, the ones I have been talking about--will \nfix our deficits and debt. We have two reasons to worry about that \nwrongheaded approach. One, to the extent deficit reduction energies are \ndiverted to cutting back tax expenditures, pressure is taken off the \nroot cause of the deficit and debt problem. That is, pressure that \nshould be brought to bear on out-of-control spending programs is \nreleased. Two, the productive sectors of the economy--workers, small \nbusiness owners, and investors--are burdened with yet more Federal \ntaxes.\n  For many reasons, cutbacks in tax expenditures are a deficit \nreduction dog that will not hunt.\n  If you look at all individual tax expenditures, you can see these are \nthe 10 highest tax expenditures by percentage.\n  Let me go back to the preceding chart. If you look at all these tax \nexpenditures, for the mortgage interest itemized deduction, 70 percent \nare people earning under $200,000; for the earned income tax credit, \n100 percent; for the child tax credit, 100 percent; for the State and \nlocal taxes, other than real property, 50 percent; for charitable \nitemized deductions, 45 percent--yes, the rich had 55 percent by their \ndefinition--for Social Security benefits, 98 percent; for the real \nproperty tax itemized deduction, 80 percent; for the education credit, \n100 percent; for medical itemized deductions, 89 percent; for the \ndependent childcare credit, 96 percent; for student loan interest, 100 \npercent.\n  Look, my point is, we have to come up with a better Tax Code. I am \ndedicated to changing this awful Tax Code we have that is too \ncomplicated, too large, too expensive, does not do the job, and is a \nbunch of muttering around and puttering around by Members of Congress, \nand simplifying that Code so everybody knows which end is up.\n  On tax expenditures, I am going to be happy to look at tax \nexpenditures, but they should be reserved until we do real tax reform. \nIf you have to give up some of these expenditures, then there better be \nappropriate reductions to account for that, and we have to do it by \nflattening out that tax system that we all know is completely out of \ncontrol and completely difficult to comply with. As a matter of fact, I \ndo not know of anybody on the Senate Finance Committee who fills out \ntheir own tax forms. I do not think most of us could do it because if \nyou had 10 different tax preparers on a semicomplicated tax return, you \nwould probably have 10 different approaches to it. That shows the \npathetic system that is wrecking our country.\n  To make it clear, when the President took over, the bottom 40 percent \nof all households did not pay income taxes. Yes, they paid payroll \ntaxes, but 23 million of them got refundable tax credits, much more \nthan they paid in payroll taxes. Keep in mind, I do not believe we \nshould tax the truly poor. But now that is up to 51 percent in a little \nover 2 years under this administration of people who do not pay any \nincome taxes. Are they all truly poor? I do not know. All I know is, it \ndoes not sound right that the majority of people, the majority of tax \nunits in this country, do not pay income taxes, and the minority has to \ncarry the whole burden.\n  If they are truly poor, I understand and I would be the last one to \ntax them, and I think I have a 35-year record here of being fair to the \npoor and fair to families and, above all, fair to children. My name is \non an awful lot of important bills around here, and I have led the \nfight on a lot of bills that help people in distress. So you can \nimagine how aggrieved I felt when one of our great television stations \nwas distorting one sentence--it seemed to me one sentence--out of a 30-\nminute set of remarks on the floor that made it very clear that I do \nnot want to tax the truly poor. But surely we have to have everybody \nparticipate. I actually think everybody ought to participate, even if\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\nit is only $1. We ought to all have some skin in the game. We ought to \nall help save this country, and we cannot do it without the middle \nclass. And the middle class is not just the top 49 percent of all wage \nearners.\n\n  This is an important issue, and it is one we have to resolve, and we \nhave to resolve it fairly, we have to resolve it in a way that is \nmeaningful and in a way that will help save our country too. I think I \nhave more than made the case that you cannot pile it all on the so-\ncalled 3 to 5 percent, the so-called rich, which includes 800,000 small \nbusinesses, where 70 percent of all jobs are created. And everybody \nknows that is true. Every time you tax them and take moneys away from \nthem like that, when they are paying pretty hefty taxes as it is, they \nhire less, they do less, they quit their businesses, some move \noffshore, some move their businesses to other countries, and some just \nplain give up.\n  We cannot let that happen. We have to have a fair tax situation. We \nhave to have Democrats and Republicans work on it together. We have to \nquit playing this card that basically pits one group of people against \nanother.\n  All I can say is this. I am concerned. I am pointing out difficulties \nin our Tax Code. I am pointing out difficulties in some of the \narguments the President is making. And I have to say that anybody who \nreads my remarks fairly will know these points I am making are real \npoints. These charts are important. As you can see, taxpayers earning \nunder $200,000 will be bereft without these benefits unless we can \nrevamp the whole Tax Code in a way that you do not have to have tax \nexpenditures. Tax expenditures are certainly not spending--at least \nthese ones we are talking about right here and now.\n  So if you compare the total Federal tax burden, those earning over \n$200,000 pay 64 percent; those earning under $200,000 pay 36 percent. \nAll of that is important for us to understand.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about some missed \nopportunities. Last week, I talked a little bit about how I thought the \nPresident had missed the opportunity with his deficit commission, he \nhad missed the opportunity with his State of the Union speech, and he \nhad missed the opportunity with his budget.\n  Well, almost 2 weeks ago, President Obama scolded Congress for not \nmaking enough progress on debt ceiling and budget negotiations. He said \nwe needed to stay in Washington last week and get things done. I took \nhim at his word. I thought the administration and the majority were \nserious about staying in Washington to push forward and get some \nresults. We were all in Washington last week, but we did not get \nanything done. The debt and the deficit and the lack of a budget are \nnot the only issues facing America. When are we going to have real \nissues processed through committees that provide real solutions?\n  Despite reports suggesting that Democrats have reached an agreement \non a budget deal among themselves, the majority did not present us with \nthat budget. Despite the President's comments that Congress needed to \nbe in session to reach an agreement, he refused to meet with our \ncaucus. We have gone more than 800 days without passing any sort of \nbudget in the Senate. When we stayed in Washington last week to work on \na budget deal, Democrats refused to bring up that budget for a vote.\n\n  Last week, we had an opportunity to make headway on the debt ceiling \nissue. I spoke on the floor last Wednesday and implored my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to join me in rolling up our sleeves and \nfiguring out a way to solve the fiscal mess this country is in. I laid \ndown the facts and figures--frightening numbers that should have \ngalvanized us all into action. Instead, we are still pushing for a \ncomprehensive solution to the problem or none at all. This isn't ``deal \nor no deal'' time.\n  Now, here we are, and what was supposed to have been an important \nworkweek has come and gone. What do we have to show for it? We had one \nvote canceled on the Libya resolution, a substitute vote on whether the \nSergeant at Arms should compel attendance, which was a nonbudget-\nrelated matter, and we had one legislative vote on Senator Reid's \nresolution about tax increases. This resolution is a sense of the \nSenate, which is not something that could become law. At this juncture \nmore than ever, we don't need publicity pieces.\n  What we could have done was moved forward with the balanced budget \namendment that all 47 Republicans have cosponsored or we could have \nvoted on my legislation to reduce spending by 1 percent each year until \nwe achieve a balanced budget or we could have voted on legislation \nother Republicans have offered that would cap spending or we could have \nvoted on legislation offered by Republicans to ensure we pay our \ncreditors in the event we cannot reach an agreement on the debt \nceiling. Unfortunately, we didn't do any of that. Instead, we spent a \nweek holding one legislative vote on a sense of the Senate about \nraising taxes that even if passed would not have the force of law.\n  Republicans have proposed a variety of ideas that will help us get \nout of this fiscal mess we are in. Some are baby steps; some are giant \nsteps. Every bill doesn't have to be comprehensive.\n  Members of the majority have said Republicans were using every tactic \nto delay. What was last week? A vote on a sense of the Senate? The \nHouse passed a budget in April. The Senate Republicans proposed two \nadditional budget measures. The only plan presented by the majority--\nPresident Obama's budget for fiscal year 2012--was unanimously opposed, \n0 to 97. Not even a single Democrat voted for the President's budget. \nIt sounds like a different course is needed.\n  I thought we were here to take care of business. Is one legislative \nvote on an opinion piece considered taking care of business? Not in my \nmind. I am willing to bet the American people don't think so either. \nThis is exactly the kind of behavior that is frustrating the people in \nWyoming and all across the country. They have asked us to come do a \njob. They have put their faith in us to take care of business and put \nthis country back on solid fiscal footing. The American people want us \nto thoughtfully and seriously work to address the debt ceiling and \nreduce spending. Taking one legislative vote in a week doesn't pass the \nsmell test for getting the job done. The work product we gave the \nAmerican people last week is appalling.\n  We are staring the most predictable crisis in American history in the \nface, and, with only one legislative vote last week, we essentially \nsaid it is not dire enough for us to get something done; it is not \nimportant enough to stop playing political games and stop running the \nclock. I am hopeful that this week will be different. I am hopeful that \nwe will actually make progress on budget negotiations.\n  I am encouraged that the President has finally taken it upon himself \nto engage leaders on the matter. His direct engagement should have been \nhappening for months, and his refusal to get directly involved has put \nus in the situation we are in today, with 3 weeks until the Treasury \nDepartment is left without options for the debt ceiling. We have lost \ntime. We have lost opportunities. We have lost the focus started by the \ndeficit commission. Every day that passes that we don't get anything \ndone is one more option lost and more money spent on borrowed time and \nborrowed money.\n  Businesses all across the country can't afford to waste a day, much \nless a week, without productivity, and if they did, I guarantee they \nwould pay a heavy price. If that unproductive behavior continued, they \nwould have to close their doors. People going to work every day cannot \nafford to sit around and not do their jobs. If Americans and businesses \nin this country have to work hard and stay productive to provide for \ntheir families and keep their businesses running, so should we. The \nstandards should not be any different in the Senate.\n  As for a solution that relies on increased taxes, when Congress fails \nby spending too much, the easy answer is always to raise taxes. There \nare many Republican proposals for raising revenue without raising \ntaxes. But we cannot get in a situation where, when we fail, we charge \nthe people more. It usually results in less revenue anyway.\n  The motion we are voting on tonight is a sham. When it passes, we \nhave permission to add amendments to the\n\n[[Page S4475]]\n\nsense-of-the-Senate resolution--maybe. In other words, we can amend the \nopinion of the Senate that cannot become law. How long will we amend \nand debate an opinion?\n  I am disappointed we didn't get anything done last week. I hope we \nall learned a lesson from the week we just lost. The issues facing the \ncountry today are too important and too dire for us to waste time the \nway we did. I know right now committees are not having real markups, so \nthere is nothing in the drawer to vote on. Even the few times a bill \nhas been brought up, the majority didn't want to vote on amendments and \nshut the process down. That isn't getting us anywhere. We need to \nchange course. The time for action is now, and I hope we can use last \nweek's failure to get things done as an incentive to roll up our \nsleeves and get to work.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, last week, the House Speaker--Speaker \nBoehner--and President Obama and his administration were both calling \nfor comprehensive tax reform as part of a large budget deal. Obviously, \ntoday, that seems to have lost some momentum, and I wanted to start \nthis afternoon by saying tax reform is too important to abandon after \n48 hours' worth of discussion.\n  To his credit, Chairman Conrad recognizes that, and certainly that is \nwhat I heard this weekend when, similar to the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, I was home and had the chance to travel across eastern Oregon, \nstopping in small towns. I think there is a keen awareness that it is \nnot possible to cut our way out of this economic challenge; that we \nalso have to grow. We have to grow. We have to make growth-oriented \nchanges in tax law.\n  That is what the Conrad budget clearly offers a wide berth to do. In \nfact, I am of the view that progrowth tax reform, for example, is one \nof the few ways to generate revenue that both Democrats and Republicans \nwill support. When you put people to work--and we have millions and \nmillions of our fellow citizens out of work today--those are folks who \ncan, in the private sector, start paying taxes again. That is what \nhappened after the last major tax reform bill in 1986. In those 2 \nyears--the 2 years after major tax reform--6.3 million new jobs were \ncreated in the private sector. We have an opportunity to do that again, \nand the Conrad budget offers a wide berth in which to do it.\n  So you generate revenue--revenue that both Democrats and Republicans \ncan support--and create jobs in the private sector the way Democrats \nand Republicans have said they want to do. Certainly, it is pretty \nclear, as of today, there isn't anything as promising in the economic \ntoolshed for long-term growth as tax reform. The fact is, a lot of \nother alternatives have been tried. Certainly, the Federal Reserve has \ndone its share. We have the Recovery Act. There have been a variety of \nsteps that have been taken.\n  My colleague from Oregon, in my view, has done yeomen's work on the \neffort to make sure homeowners--which is an enormous economic problem--\nhave additional time to work through the very challenging situations \nmillions are facing in the housing market. So we have thrown a lot of \neconomic tools at this huge challenge, but we obviously have a lot more \nto do. I don't see any more promising path--no more promising path--\nthan tax reform for the long-term economic growth this country needs. \nThe Conrad budget offers a wide berth in order to tap that opportunity.\n  The fact is, we understand what needs to be done in terms of tax \nreform. The fundamental language--the principles of that kind of \nreform--are laid out in the Conrad budget. We ought to go in there, \nclean out a score of these special interest tax loopholes, use that \nmoney to hold down rates for everybody, and keep progressivity. Those \nare the three key principles.\n  A number of my colleagues have spoken. I know my friend from Arizona, \nwith whom I serve on the Finance Committee, Senator Kyl, in a very fine \nop-ed piece he wrote in the Wall Street Journal not too long ago, \ntalked about tax reform built around exactly those principles--cleaning \nout the loopholes, holding down the rates, and, to his credit, Senator \nKyl specifically talked about the need to ensure progressivity in the \nTax Code.\n  Senator Coats and I have introduced legislation that picks up on \nthose key principles of the 1986 tax reform legislation. In fact, we \nmodernize the code in line with that kind of thinking--certainly \nimportant to do because there have been thousands and thousands of tax \nchanges made since 1986. So it is certainly time to go in there and \ntrim out all those unnecessary special interest tax breaks, and we can \ndo it in a way that will create jobs.\n  For example, right now, in the Federal Tax Code, there are actually \nincentives to export jobs out of the United States. Say that to \nyourself--export jobs out of the United States. What we want to do is \nexport goods out of the United States. In rural Oregon this weekend, \nthe farmers were telling me about how they want to get their \nagricultural products into Asia and other markets around the world. So \nwe can grow things here, make things here, add value to them here and \nship them somewhere. That is what we would like to be exporting. \nInstead, under the tax law, there is actually an incentive to export \njobs.\n  When you set up shop overseas and you are doing business overseas, \nyou get to defer your American taxes. So what Senator Coats and I seek \nto do--and this is something I think is even more important today than \nit was a quarter century ago because of the global economic challenge--\nis to take that incentive that now goes for exporting jobs out of the \nUnited States and we would use those very same dollars to dramatically \nslash rates for companies that offer what I call red, white, and blue \njobs--jobs in this country. The Conrad budget offers a very substantial \nberth for taking that kind of approach in tax reform, where he \nspecifically calls for lowering tax rates for American businesses. I \nparticularly wish to see that done because of the message I heard this \nlast weekend, where folks specifically, without my even mentioning tax \nreform, talked about the need to keep jobs here at home.\n  We are going to, over the next few days, see, of course, the \nnegotiations with the President and the Congressional leadership go \nforward. Chairman Conrad and other members of the Budget Committee will \nbe out discussing these issues as well. But I just hope, No. 1, the \ncause of tax reform is seen as far too important to give up on after \nonly a 48-hour flurry of interest and everybody then saying: Well, I \nguess we will have to do it another time. The time to make sure it is \ndone is now.\n  Senator Coats and I said earlier this month that what we ought to \ndo--recognizing that you can't write a complete tax reform bill between \nnow and August 2--is to get a commitment, lock in a strategy, to do \ncomprehensive tax reform in the fall and early next year. That alone \nwould send, in my view, a positive and bipartisan message to the \nfinancial markets of this country that there are going to be some \nchanges. So what we need is a roadmap for economic growth.\n\n[[Page S4476]]\n\n  There are other features of the Conrad budget I think make a lot of \nsense. I am particularly pleased about the opportunities for investment \nin infrastructure--roads and bridges. Certainly, that would provide an \nopportunity for something that has worked in the past--the Build \nAmerica Bonds program, which has been so successful in our State. I \nthink Senator Kerry's ideas for an infrastructure bank are excellent \nones. I support those as well. The best thing about that approach is we \nknow we have to find a way in our consumer-driven society to start \nstimulating demand--demand for goods and services.\n  There are few economic multipliers in our country for the short term, \nsuch as transportation. So the Conrad budget that puts a premium on \nthose kinds of approaches in the short-term makes a lot of sense for me \nas we look to the longer term, which I would define as the opportunity \nto set this country on a progrowth economic strategy, with tax reform \nin the forefront in a way that helps our economy to be both fairer and \nmore efficient. We will also see a lot of other benefits.\n\n  It was brought up to me over the weekend at home, in eastern Oregon, \nmatters we have talked about before, such as the alternative minimum \ntax. Talk about something that just defies common sense: the idea that \nthe alternative minimum tax would force middle-class people, people \nmaking $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 a year, to fill out their taxes twice \nusing two separate systems just defies any semblance of sanity.\n  So referring, again, to what happened this weekend, are we really \ngoing to tell American taxpayers getting clobbered by the alternative \nminimum tax that after 2 days' worth of discussion about tax reform we \nare just going to walk away and pursue some other topic? That doesn't \nmake any sense to me. Certainly, Chairman Conrad's budget, which does, \nas I have indicated, provide a broad berth for tax reform, makes it \nclear that he shares our view.\n  So, finally, if we have in front of us, as we will with progrowth tax \nreform, the opportunity to create jobs in the private sector, generate \nrevenue in a way that Democrats and Republicans can agree on, make \nourselves more competitive in tough global markets, and do it in a way \nthat brings the political parties together, I think it is clear that \nhas the fundamentals of what can take this country's economy in a \nbetter and healthier direction.\n  I want it understood that in spite of what happened this weekend, in \nspite of the sense that maybe tax reform is going to be put off yet \nagain, I am not going to give up for a minute. We are going to have \nanother hearing that is going to be very important this week--Chairman \nBaucus, Chairman Camp, the Finance Committee, the Ways and Means \nCommittee getting together to talk about tax reform. So we know what \nneeds to be done. Now it is a question of having the political will to \ngo forward.\n  I simply want to say to the President, and I think I can say to the \nSenate today--Senator Coats and I--despite the idea that this is too \nhard to do, that it can't be done now, let's put it off for another \ntime, we are going to come back to this floor and say again and again: \nIt has been done. We need to do it now when there are so few other \ntools in the economic toolshed. It would be wrong to walk away after \nthis brief flurry of interest in something that is so fundamental to \nthe economic well-being of millions of our people.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an amendment to the \nunderlying bill. This amendment is designed to give American employers \nsome relief from the regulatory burdens that continue to hold back our \neconomy and hinder job creation. This amendment is actually identical \nto the bill I introduced in April, S. 817, which has been endorsed by \nboth the Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses. It is the same amendment I also introduced on the small \nbusiness bill, the Economic Development Administration bills, and also \npart of the larger regulatory relief bill I introduced in June, which \ncurrently has 22 cosponsors.\n  Last week, as we know, we heard more troubling economic news. This \ntime it was the June jobs report, which unfortunately showed the \nunemployment rate had actually risen to 9.2 percent and hiring slowed \nto just 18,000 new jobs.\n  These are, of course, very disappointing numbers, but much more \nimportant are the families who are affected by it, families in my home \nState of Ohio and across the Nation who are struggling to find a job \nand to get the paycheck they need to make ends meet. The real \ndiscussion in Washington, this month in particular, has been focused on \nthe fiscal reforms we need to get our fiscal house in order, to get the \neconomy back on track. But there are other things we can do as well and \none, of course, is to reduce the regulatory burden, particularly on \nsmall businesses. I hear from them all the time. I am sure my \ncolleagues do as well.\n  This burden is increasing. One recent study commissioned by the Small \nBusiness Administration put that burden at $1.75 trillion annually. By \nthe way, that is more than the IRS collects in income taxes. I have \nbeen encouraged by what the current administration has been saying \nabout improving our regulatory system, but I continue to be deeply \nconcerned about the new regulatory costs this administration is \nimposing on the private sector as we meet here today.\n  We have seen a sharp uptick over the past 2 years in what are called \nmajor or economically significant rules. These are regulations that \nhave an economic effect of $100 million or more. According to OMB and \nGAO data, the current administration has been regulating at an average \npace of 84 of these major rules per year--which, by the way, is a 50-\npercent increase over the average regulatory output during the Clinton \nadministration, which had 56 major rules per year. These figures \ninclude both the executive branch agencies and the so-called \nindependent agencies. Today, I was pleased to see that President Obama \nissued a new executive order that specifically addressed independent \nagencies. These are the regulatory bodies that are not within the \nexecutive agencies but are considered independent. They would include \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, and the newly created Financial Protection Bureau, which \nhas been subject to a lot of debate on the floor. These are all \nindependent agencies which are designed by law to be insulated from \nPresidential control. This new order the President issued today and the \naccompanying Presidential memorandum endorsed two goals. First, it asks \nindependent agencies to participate in ongoing regulatory look-backs. \nThat means looking back retrospectively at rules that are already on \nthe books to see if they make sense. Every administration since \nPresident Ronald Reagan has done this, undertaken some kind of look-\nback, and it is important this work continue. Second, and more \nimportantly in my view, it calls on independent agencies to evaluate \nthe costs and the benefits of new regulations, as executive agencies \nare already required to do under executive orders, including an \nexecutive order by President Clinton and an executive order by \nPresident Obama in January. I am encouraged by the words of this new \nexecutive order and Presidential memorandum on independent agencies. It \nendorses a very commonsense principle; that independent agencies, no \nless than executive agencies, should evaluate the costs of new \nregulations before imposing a new burden on the economy. It is common \nsense. It is also consistent with these amendments I have been offering \non legislation this year and the independent agency part of the \nregulatory relief bill that was introduced in June.\n\n  The problem is the President's order today is entirely nonbinding \nbecause independent agencies don't answer to the President, so it has \nno force of law. The amendment I will offer would effectively write the \nPresident's new request into law. The President has now agreed with \nthis principle. We need to expand this cost-benefit analysis to\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\nindependent agencies, but we need legislation to do it because these \nindependent agencies are not answerable to the President.\n  Specifically, this amendment would extend the Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act of 1995, which was a bipartisan piece of legislation, where \nI was the Republican cosponsor in the House. It expands the two \nindependent agencies. Major rules issued by what is sometimes called \nthe headless fourth branch of government are today exempt not only from \nthe Unfunded Mandate Reform Act but also from the cost-benefit review \noverseen by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIARA, at \nthe Office of Management and Budget.\n  This amendment would change that, effectively making the President's \norder he issued today binding on these independent agencies. They would \nbe required, under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, to evaluate \nregulatory costs, benefits, and less costly alternatives before issuing \nany rule that would impose a cost of $100 million or more on the \nprivate sector or on State, local, and tribal governments. Based on the \nGAO data, it appears there are nearly 200 independent agency \nregulations that have been issued between 1996 and 2011 that would be \nconsidered major; in other words, have over a $100 million impact on \nthe economy. They were excluded from review under this cost-benefit \nanalysis we have been talking about. In 2009 and 2010 alone, the last \ncouple years, independent agencies issued 56 economically significant \nregulations, representing billions of dollars in regulatory costs \nexempt from the standard cost-benefit analysis rules. But this affects \nour economy in a big way. It affects jobs and our ability to get this \neconomy back on track.\n  Closing this independent agency loophole is a reform those of us on \nboth sides of the aisle should join the President in supporting. This \nis the right vehicle to be able to achieve that. No major regulation, \nwhatever its source, should be imposed on American employers or on \nState or local governments without a serious consideration of what the \ncosts are, what the benefits are, and whether there is available a less \nburdensome alternative to achieve the same objective. This amendment \nmoves us closer toward that goal. It is a commonsense amendment, again, \ntaking the President's executive order and memorandum of today and \nactually putting it into force through the force of law.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, the Senate has just adopted a motion to \nproceed to a bill, S. 1323, to express the sense of the Senate on \nshared sacrifice in resolving the budget deficit we have been so \nconcerned about.\n  It is my understanding the minority has amendments they wish to have \nconsidered. I am happy to work with the Republican leader to figure out \na way for this to happen. In the meantime, however, we need to push \nforward. We all need to do that. I am going to fill the tree and file \ncloture on this bill. I am happy to continue to talk with the \nRepublican leader and anybody else who is interested in having specific \namendments to this legislation we are now on.\n  I will not allow this legislation to be bogged down by an endless \nlist of unrelated amendments. It is too important for the Senate to \nreaffirm its commitment to ensuring all Americans--including \nmillionaires and billionaires and profitable corporations--contribute \nto the collective effort to reduce this deficit. This is a commonsense \nstatement that we believe in simple fairness. Middle-class families and \nseniors have already been asked to sacrifice too much.\n  Democrats have gone on record saying that the wealthiest of the \nwealthy should be asked to contribute to this effort and make similar \nsacrifices. We hope our Republican colleagues will finally join us in \nthis effort.\n  Over the past several weeks, I have had good conversations with the \nRepublican leader and the chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee about trying to work through appropriations \nbills under the regular order.\n  As a result of these conversations, in an effort to move forward, I \nam going to file cloture on a motion to proceed to the Military \nConstruction-VA Appropriations bill tonight. I hope we can show the \ncountry that the Senate can work through an important appropriations \nbill without getting bogged down.\n  Remember, there are different rules on these matters. You can't deal \nwith legislative matters on appropriations bills. I hope we can have \nsome amendments on our sense-of-the-Senate resolution dealing with \nhaving the wealthiest of the wealthy contribute to the problems we have \nwith the deficit in this country, and following that I hope we can move \nto Military Construction-VA. Our servicemen and veterans who have \nserved our country so well need this.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 529\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of \nColorado's great educators and community leaders, David Getches, who \npassed away on Tuesday, July 5, 2011, at the too-young age of 68.\n  This is more than a poignant moment for me. I had planned to come to \nthe floor to discuss David Getches' career and character because he was \nstepping down after 8 very productive years as the dean of the \nUniversity of Colorado Law School.\n  We all have had this terrible experience in our lives when somebody \nwhom we love and respect suddenly finds they have a cancer that is \naggressive--beyond aggressive. Literally a month ago, David was \ndiagnosed with pancreatic cancer. In the 4 weeks since that time, that \ncancer stole him from us. But he was always upbeat. He was always \nsomeone who we looked to for enthusiasm and inspiration. I will be \ninspired in my remarks today by what he did. I will attempt not to \ndwell on his loss.\n  As I said, Dean Getches served as dean of the Colorado Law School for \nthe last 8 years. With him at the helm, CU Law became one of the most \nforward-looking institutions of legal training in the country. I want \nto share a few examples of his vision and leadership. I could not cover \nall of them if I had a full hour. I want to share some of them with the \nSenate and with his friends and admirers in Colorado.\n  He steered this school through the construction of the new LEED \nCertified Wolf Law Building, which put CU and its law school at the \ncutting edge of environmental sustainability and energy efficiency--two \nideas that were connected to the values that Getches was committed to \nfostering throughout his career. Getches previously served as executive \ndirector of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources and as an \nadviser to the Interior Secretary in the Clinton administration. He had \nan extensive background in water, environmental, and public lands law. \nThrough his work, Getches impressed upon all Coloradans the importance \nof good stewardship of our State's precious natural resources.\n  Mr. President, I am not a lawyer, but I do know Dean Getches' efforts \nto\n\n[[Page S4479]]\n\nteach and share the legal framework that protects our resources could \nnot have been more critical to preserving our Western way of life.\n  David Getches left a lasting impression on the demographic \ncomposition of CU Law School. He was committed to a student body \ncomposed of people from many different backgrounds and cultures, and \nthat commitment made an indelible impact on the school and on \nColorado's legal community. In 2008, the Hispanic Bar Association \nawarded him their Community Service Award for increasing Hispanic \nenrollment, and he also assembled one of the most diverse \nadministrative teams of any law school in the country. He didn't stop \nthere, however. He then created a commission to produce a \ngroundbreaking report on diversity in the legal profession and how to \nincrease diversity in law firm recruitment. The highly skilled and \ndiverse alumni of the CU Law School reflects his efforts and successes.\n  David Getches also built a legacy of legal access to legal education \nfor all. He worked to expand scholarships and financial aid awarded by \nthe law school to worthy students regardless of their financial \nbackground, increasing scholarship awards from $600,000 in 2004 to a \nhefty $2.1 million in 3 short years by 2007.\n  In 2008, he worked with the Colorado State Legislature to pass a law \nallowing public universities to offer loan repayment assistance grants \nto graduates practicing public interest law and more recently founded \nan endowment to award grants to CU Law School graduates in the public \nsector.\n  What Dean Getches did by reducing the cost of law school was make \npublic service a viable alternative to private practice for bright, \nidealistic graduates of the law school. Without question, those \nstudents, CU Law School, the State of Colorado, and I would venture to \nsay the country will reap the benefits in the future from David \nGetches' foresight and thoughtful investments.\n  At the heart of why I wanted to come to the floor today was that I \nthink we know we can all learn from Dean David Getches' passion for \ngiving back to whatever community in which he found himself. He led a \nlife of service, and he also compiled an impressive academic record as \nwell as serving as the dean of CU Law School. He was, at his core, \ncommitted to the future of his children, our children, our \ngrandchildren, and his grandchildren, and he had a deep love for the \nRocky Mountain Western way of life. He was an avid outdoorsman, he was \nfit, and he faced any and all physical challenges just like he faced \nintellectual and emotional challenges. As I said in the beginning of my \nremarks, he was a mentor to all of us, and he always had his eye on the \nfuture. I know, as painful as it is for all of us who knew him to lose \nhim so suddenly, he would want us to be focused on the future.\n  Dean Getches did this and much more for Colorado and our country, and \nI just want to close with this, Mr. President. We have lost a unique \nman and a towering Colorado figure.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/11/senate-section/article/S4479-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4479-S4482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the situation involving the need for a \nbudget and the situation involving the need to raise the debt limit for \nthe United States is getting more and more crucial, it seems, by the \nhour. I have been a firm and consistent critic of this idea that has \nbeen developing the last several years in the Congress that a few \npeople meet in closed, secret meetings and somehow reach a decision \nthat I am supposed to assume is good and decent and ought to be \nconfirmed by a vote here in the Senate.\n  I feel that there are 100 Senators--and some a lot smarter and more \ncapable than I--but I feel a personal sense of obligation and duty to \nensure that when I vote on an important piece of legislation my \nconstituents care about, that I know what is in it and that I \nunderstand what is in it, and it is hard to know. When you have a bill \nthat comes out that proposes to have changes in the trillions of \ndollars, involving Federal spending for a decade, in a budget or some \nother fashion, it requires us to be careful about that.\n  So I would express again my dissatisfaction and belief that this \nSenate--not the House--has failed in its duty to participate in an open \nprocess concerning our budget. The House of Representatives did. The \nRepublican House promised to have open hearings. They had a bill on the \nfloor--a budget. They passed it within the time required--by April 15. \nIt completely changed the debt trajectory of America and put us on \nsound footing. It reduced spending by $6 trillion--not $2 trillion but \n$6 trillion--and it didn't raise taxes on the American people. In fact, \nit reduced taxes in a way they felt would engender better economic \ngrowth, which is the best way to engender more tax revenue--having more \npeople make more money and pay more taxes. So I really believe the \nHouse fulfilled their constitutional duty.\n  In the Senate, we have now gone well over 800 days without a budget. \nWe didn't have a budget when our Democratic colleagues had 60 \nSenators--the highest number one party has had in probably 70, 80 \nyears, maybe longer. They didn't pass a budget. You can pass a budget \nwith 51 votes--with the Vice President, 50 votes. It is a simple \nmajority. It is an expedited procedure. Budgets have been passed when \nparties have only had one-vote majorities in the Senate.\n  So I would say it is odd that we have gone 2 years without a budget, \nbut it is not odd--in part because of having no budget--that we have \nseen the largest surges of debt the Nation has ever seen. President \nBush was criticized for running up debt. He had, in 1 year--his last \nyear--a $450 billion deficit, and he was roundly criticized for that. \nSome of that was TARP money, which they scored as monies spent, and it \nwas properly and accurately scored. So it came out to $450 billion. The \nyear before, it was a $160 billion deficit. President Obama's first \nbudget deficit was $1,200 billion. His next budget was $1,300 billion. \nThis year's budget, by September 30, is projected to be around $1,500 \nbillion. We haven't had a budget. Is anything connected there?\n  So I want to say, first of all, one of the ways you act responsibly \nis when you do it out in front of the people.\n  I noticed at the press conference today that President Obama, when \nasked about some of these matters, pushed back and said: Well, we want \nto have an agreement right now. We don't want to wait any later, close \nto the election.\n  He was basically saying--it is pretty clear, really, and I am not \nexaggerating anything--when you get close to the election, Senators and \nCongressmen don't like to vote for more debt and they do not like to \nvote for more taxes. What is wrong with that? The American people don't \nwant debt. They do not want taxes. They want us to bring this \ngovernment under control. But what is being suggested is, oh, it is \npolitics. There is something corrupt politically if you believe you \nshouldn't bail out the big spenders in Washington by taking more money \nfrom hard-working Americans and taking it out of the private sector to \ngive to the public sector that has mismanaged the money they have.\n  Some might say: Well, Jeff, we have these big deficits because you \nall cut taxes.\n  We haven't cut taxes in years. President Bush cut taxes with revenues \nmuch higher today than when those taxes were cut. We have gone into an \neconomic decline, and this recession has reduced our income. That is \ntrue. It is not so much the rate of taxes. It is the rate of profit. It \nis the rate of income. It is the rate of money people are being paid, \nso they do not have as much money and they are not paying as much in \ntaxes. Now, we can run around and find everybody who is left with money \nand try to tax them, but at some point that begins to be self-\ndefeating.\n  So I guess I am trying to raise the point, How did we get here? Well, \nthere is another way we got here with these huge deficits we have. In \nthe Keynesian philosophy of economics, we had a big spending bill \ncalled a stimulus bill. I opposed it. I remember reading a piece by the \nNobel laureate, Professor Becker, from the University of Chicago, not \nlong before the vote saying it was not going to create jobs; that it \nwas not sufficiently stimulative to be a good stimulus bill, in fact, \nin his mind, as a Nobel Prize-winning economist. And that is exactly \nwhat happened. It didn't create jobs. It went to social\n\n[[Page S4480]]\n\nprograms, it went to State aid, and it went to things other than the \ninfrastructure that we were told it was going for. Only 4 percent of \nthat money went to roads and bridges--4 percent out of $850 billion. \nEvery penny borrowed will be to create or to stimulate jobs, they said. \nWe are going to redo our infrastructure, they said. It was not done \nthat way. It was social spending overwhelmingly, and it didn't create \ngrowth in the economy.\n  Another reason we have the debt is because the baseline spending has \nsurged under the Democratic leadership and President Obama. Defense \nDepartment has gone up 3 or so percent the last couple of years in \nspending. Nondefense discretionary spending--the things we do such as \nenergy programs and road programs and aid and grants and things we like \nto spend around here--went up 24 percent in 2 years. We were having a \ndrop off in income, a drop off in tax revenue, and we increased \nspending dramatically.\n  We never had 10, 12 percent increases in spending per year. But hold \nyour hat. The budget the President submitted to us in February of this \nyear--several months ago--proposed increases for the Education \nDepartment of 10.5 percent, proposed increases for the State Department \nof 10.5 percent, with 9.5 percent for the Energy Department and a 60-\npercent increase for transportation--the high-speed rail projects. But \nwe don't have the money. All of that would have been borrowed. We \ncouldn't sustain flat spending without borrowing money, we are so far \nin debt. Forty cents of every dollar we spend today is borrowed.\n  So I have been a big critic of this scheme to meet behind closed \ndoors and not tell the rest of the Congress or the American people what \nwe are doing and to plop down on the floor of the Senate some proposed \ndeal that we have to sign at the eleventh hour or the government is \ngoing to shut down. Why haven't we been talking about this? They talked \nabout it in the House. They voted on it. They reduced spending $6 \ntrillion. In the phantom budget that has been talked about by our \nDemocratic colleagues, one they never produced so it could actually be \naccounted for, they are claiming it would reduce spending $2 trillion \nand are patting themselves on the back about how great they are. But \nwhen you take out the interest savings that occur, it is only $1.4 \ntrillion in actual reduction of spending and it is a 2.7-percent, we \nestimate, increase in taxes.\n\n  Senator Conrad, the chairman of the Budget Committee, does a good \njob. He is a smart man. I think he understands the threat America \nfaces. I thought he did, although this phantom secret budget that they \njust leak out descriptions of whenever it is convenient has not \nimpressed me. Really, it just hasn't been impressive. Is it a vision? \nIs it a specter of some kind of a budget that nobody can ever grasp \ntheir hands around, and it is only what the people who are holding it \nclose to their vest say it is and all the rest of us have to accept \nthat? I don't think so. I have become very uneasy about what we hear in \nthis city of Washington about plans and policy.\n  When President Obama announced his budget, it was the most \nirresponsible budget this country has ever been presented with by a \nPresident. I don't think anybody can dispute that. I am prepared to \ndefend that against anybody who says so. It increased spending, it \nincreased taxes. Over a decade, it increased taxes and increased \nspending and made the deficit worse than if we hadn't done anything, at \na time when the Nation should have been working from January until \ntoday figuring out how to bring this government under control and \ncontain the growth in spending and contain the debt. This is what he \nsaid, and his budget director in our committee said--Mr. Lew--that: Our \nbudget calls on us to live within our means and pay down the debt.\n  The Congressional Budget Office scored the budget. They analyzed it \nover 10 years. The lowest single annual deficit that was occurring \nduring that time was $750 billion, the lowest deficit, almost half \nagain higher than President Bush's highest deficit. And it starts going \nup in the outyears 8, 9, and 10--to over $1 trillion in the 10th year \nannual deficit. Interest on that debt that would be accrued by such an \nirresponsible budget would go from around $200 billion last year, $240-\nsome-odd billion this year, to $930 billion in 2021. That would be \nlarger than Medicare, larger than Social Security, larger than the \ndefense budget including the war--much larger than those. So interest \nis a danger.\n  Senator Conrad talked this afternoon about his phantom budget, and he \ntold us a lot of things he wanted us to know about it, and he \narticulated it in a way that made you think that it is not such a bad \nidea. But we have real numbers people. Just like President Obama said \nhis budget was going to pay down the debt and cause us to live within \nour means when it had no deficit lower than $740 billion--he said it is \na blueprint. He said it is a framework. But he didn't say it was a \nbudget because it is not a budget. A budget is a document that can be \nread, ascertained, evaluated, and scored.\n  So they leak it to the Washington Post--not to Members or colleagues \nof the Senate here--they leak to the Washington Post some of the good \nthings he wanted to get out, and then they talk about some of the good \nthings here today. Forgive me if I am not impressed. If it is such a \ngood budget, why don't you print it out and propose it to us? That is \nwhat the House of Representatives did. They are prepared to defend \ntheir budget.\n  Senator Conrad said this: that he thought it could play a part in \nthis big deal the President is talking about to change our debt \ntrajectory in a positive way. Well, those words are good words, just \nlike the President's statement that he had a budget that was going to \ncause us to live within our means and pay down our debt. That is what \nhe said. That is what his budget director said. Well, you can say \nthings, but it doesn't make them true. I can say I don't have a desk in \nmy hand, but I have a desk in my hand, reality being what it is. So \nthat was not a good budget he submitted, and I am worried about this \nphantom budget we are hearing about today.\n  The way we calculate this phantom budget and the things that have \nbeen released about it, it would raise taxes as much as $2.8 trillion \nand cut spending about 4 percent over the 10 years--this is a 10-year \nbudget--at a time when we are projected to add, under the President's \nplan, $13 trillion to our national debt. So we are going to reduce the \ndebt by 4 percent from $13 trillion--an utterly unsustainable figure. \nThe House budget would cut discretionary spending $6 trillion. The \nToomey plan would have cut spending $8 trillion.\n  Senator Conrad actually said on the Senate floor that his budget--\nwhich raises taxes, as I indicated--would reduce taxes by $700 billion. \nHe said it would reduce taxes by $700 billion. Now, how is this \naccounting--this trick, I will suggest--accomplished? Well, to get to \nthat number, he is obviously comparing it to a CBO baseline which \nassumes that every single tax rate from the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that \nhas been in place now almost a decade is going to expire and all those \nrates go up. So he is saying that if he keeps a few of them from going \nup, he has cut taxes. Only in Washington can you raise taxes \ndramatically, change the tax rates that have been in place for a \ndecade, see taxes go up dramatically, and call that a tax cut.\n  By the way, baseline is very important. We don't know what baseline \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee is using. He understands it very \nwell. He is one of the most knowledgeable, capable Members of our body, \nand he understands these well. I believe the phrase he used was that it \nis a plausible baseline--a plausible baseline.\n  Well, let me tell you the baseline we should use. The baseline, when \nyou talk about whether spending increases or whether spending \ndecreases, should be what you are spending today. If you are spending \n$100 billion today and if you spend $102 billion, you have spent $2 \nbillion more. If you spend $98 billion, you are spending $2 billion \nless, right? Well, what they do in Washington and the reason this \ncountry is so close to bankruptcy is they assume growth rates, baseline \ngrowth rates. Then when you reduce the baseline growth rate, and it is \ngoing up $10 billion next year and you reduce that increase to $9 \nbillion, you claim you cut spending by $1 billion and it went up $9 \nbillion. Now, that is the kind of logic that has put us in the \ndifficult position we are in.\n\n[[Page S4481]]\n\n  So I have decided and told my staff on the Budget Committee that when \nwe get numbers, we are going to compare them to the only thing that is \nsolid, and that is a level baseline--does it go up or does it go down? \nIn fact, the Ryan House budget that cut $6 trillion still increases \nspending. It is not a real cut.\n  So you do have to figure out how much you are talking about and what \nbaseline you are using to know what the numbers are. The best way to do \nthat and the most objective way to do that is to use a flatline number \nand see whether we are up or down, and then we can communicate. But if \nyou get to choose your baseline--and CBO has one, the President has \nanother one, and it looks as though the Senate Democrats have chosen \nanother one they call a plausible baseline. I don't know what that \nmeans. The debt commission that had their recommendation for reducing \ndebt chose another baseline. It makes it confusing, and it makes it \nharder to understand.\n  So when you talk about a budget that is supposed to really make a \ndifference in our economy and you propose $2 in tax increases for every \n$1 in spending cuts and suggest this is the kind of thing you are \nworking with the President on in their negotiations, maybe we can begin \nto understand why the Members of the House and the Members of the \nSenate who have been in these meetings have been walking out of these \nmeetings and saying: All they want to do is raise taxes.\n  The President himself said several months ago that he thought $3 of \nspending cuts and $1 of tax increases would be a good mix. But what we \nare hearing today is $2 of tax increases to $1 of spending cuts. That \nis not acceptable and has no chance of passage. And if the American \npeople have time to read that kind of legislation and find out that is \nwhat is in it, they are not going to be happy with anybody that \nsupports it, in my view. So perhaps that is the reason they want to \nwait until the eleventh hour, claim the country is about to shut down, \nand try to force it through. As the President suggested, you don't want \nto get it too close to the election when people might remember what you \ndid to them.\n\n  Goodness gracious, they talk about a $900 billion cut in the Defense \nDepartment. That is part of their plan too. Well, let me just tell you \nhow that gimmick works. You propose a $900 billion cut in the Defense \nDepartment and you know that almost 20 percent cut is not going to \nbecome law, but you go out and tell the public you saved $900 billion \nand you plan to cut it from the Defense Department, and you can't cut \nthat much money from the Defense Department. So no wonder our retiring \nfine Senator Joe Lieberman, after the Democratic discussion of this, \nwas moved to say he was worried about what such a budget would do to \nour national security. Well, he should be.\n  I have been on the Armed Services Committee. I don't deny that the \nmilitary has to tighten its belt. Just like every other department in \nthis government, it may even have to take a real reduction in spending. \nBut we are not going to have an 18-percent, 20-percent reduction. Are \nwe going to have our men and women who place their lives on the line \nfor us have to pay for profligacy in Washington? I don't think so.\n  Mr. President, I would ask Majority Leader Reid, who I believe is the \nstrategist in the Senate who told our chairman, Senator Conrad, that he \nshould not bring up a budget--I think Senator Conrad and I were \nprepared to bring up a budget. He was working on one. His staff was \nworking on one. We were within days of a markup. He was going to \nproduce a budget, and those of us on the Republican side had amendments \nto offer, and we were preparing for a debate, and they decided all of a \nsudden not to have a markup. Later, Senator Reid said it would be \nfoolish to produce a budget.\n  I would say it would be foolish for the Congress of the United States \nto take a paycheck to operate the way we are operating when 40 cents of \nevery dollar we spend is borrowed. That is unthinkable. How did we get \nin this position where we are spending $3,700 billion and taking in \nonly $2,200 billion and all the difference is borrowed?\n\n  Finally--this is important--a lot of us have heard these numbers but \nit has not resonated with us about how important they are. Professors \nRogoff and Reinhart have written a book called ``This Time It's \nDifferent,'' studying eight centuries of sovereign governmental default \non their debts, the kind of thing Greece is going through today. They \nhave analyzed how it happens and the consequences. They chose the name \nbecause they said that every time politicians ran up debt in their \ncountry to high levels and caused a crisis, they said: It will not \nhappen to us. This time it is different. We are different from those \nother countries that went belly up. Then it happens just like that, \nsavagely, immediately, like the financial crisis that hit us in 2007-\n2008. What they concluded in further study was something else. Not only \nwhen you get your debt too high do you run the risk of a financial \ncrisis, but your debt slows your economic growth and the countries that \nhave debts that equal 90 percent of the economy--I see my good friend, \nSenator Reid. He has the toughest job in Washington and I am not making \nit any easier for him. It will be good for him to hear this. I think he \nknows it.\n  But they have concluded when your total American debt reaches 90 \npercent of our economy, our GDP, and goes above that, it pulls down \nyour economic growth by 1 percent. CBO now is scoring our growth to \ncome in at .9 percent below what it otherwise would be because of our \ndebt.\n  The first quarter we had 2 percent economic growth. If we had 3 \npercent economic growth that would be a 50-percent increase in growth. \nIf we had 1 percent greater increase in growth that would amount to, \naccording to the White House economic team some time ago, an increase \nof 1 million jobs in America.\n  What I am saying is we erroneously state too often, I think, that the \nquestion is about our children and grandchildren. I truly believe the \nsluggish growth and the very weak job numbers we have been having are \nthe result of carrying too much debt. We have to start reducing that \ndebt even if it is painful for us to do so. I hope our colleagues will \nproduce a budget that will actually change the numbers. I am not \nconfident that will happen.\n  Failing that I do hope, Mr. Leader, and I say this to my leader, too, \nthat if a bill is brought forth in the Senate we have at least 7 days \nto consider it before we are asked to vote on it. I believe it will \ntake that long to properly evaluate it.\n  I see the majority leader here. It is always a pleasure to work with \nhim.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say before my friend leaves the \nfloor, his leader, my friend, the senior Senator from Kentucky and I \nare representing the Senate along with Senator Kyl and Senator Durbin \nat the White House. We have been there many days now. We understand, \nall of us there, Democrats and Republicans, the significant adverse \neffect this huge debt has on our country. Everyone there is trying to \narrive at a point where we do something about that. We are not there \nyet. It is difficult to do. We understand it is going to take, we \nbelieve, a mix of spending cuts and some way to generate some more \nrevenue. We are working our best to get this done.\n  My friend is right, the debt is a drag on the economy. There is no \nquestion about that. Once we are able to raise the debt limit, I think \nwe are going to see some energy in this economy we have not seen in \nsome time. But we are not there yet. I wish I could report to my friend \nfrom Alabama and the rest of the Senate and the country that we have \ncompleted our negotiations, but we have not. We are going to go back \nagain tomorrow. The President said 3:45, and I said a.m. or p.m.? It \nwill be 3:45 p.m. tomorrow that we will be back, trying to move \nforward.\n  My friend from Alabama has an important responsibility as the person \nwho is the ranking member now of that most important Budget Committee. \nI am sure he has learned a lot, having taken this assignment, that he \ndid not know before. That is the way it is with everyone in the Senate. \nI have learned a great deal working through the CR, different \niterations of that, and now on this work we are doing trying to arrive \nat a debt reduction package along with raising the debt ceiling. I have \nlearned a lot. I have a lot more to learn.\n  I appreciate the intensity of my friend in that in which he believes, \nwhether it is this or as the person running the Judiciary Committee for \nthe\n\n[[Page S4482]]\n\nRepublicans. He is always very intense. He and I don't always agree but \nwe agree more than people think. But one thing no one can ever take \naway from the junior Senator from Alabama is the seriousness of his \nbeing in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/11/senate-section/article/S4482-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LAS VEGAS NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 20th \nanniversary of the Las Vegas Natural History Museum. For two decades \nthe Las Vegas Natural History Museum has provided children and families \nfrom all across southern Nevada with the opportunity to learn about \nscience and history in an educational setting outside of the classroom. \nIt is my great pleasure to honor this fine institution, its employees, \nand the museum's board members before the U.S. Senate today.\n  The museum started in 1989 when a group of dedicated citizens \npetitioned the Las Vegas City Council to find a permanent home for a \ncollection of wildlife and prehistoric exhibits. In July 1991, the \nmuseum opened its doors to the people of Las Vegas with a collection of \nloaned wildlife and prehistoric exhibits. Today, the museum has \nacquired a world-class collection of artifacts for their multimillion \ndollar collection. Even the Smithsonian Institution has taken notice of \nour museum. In 2002, the Las Vegas Natural History Museum became an \naffiliate with the Smithsonian Institution, granting them access to the \nSmithsonian's vast collection of exhibits.\n  While many museums across the country have struggled with the \neconomic downturn, the Las Vegas Natural History Museum continues to \nthrive and grow. Last year, the Las Vegas Natural History Museum \nprovided educational tours to 30,000 students in Clark County. All of \ntheir programs are designed by grade level to meet State educational \nrequirements. The museum also provides opportunities for at-risk \nschools to visit the museum free of charge. Their Open Doors Program \nprovided scholarships that allowed nearly 20,000 visitors from at-risk \nor economically disadvantaged schools to experience the museum.\n  I am proud to join with my fellow Nevadans in recognizing the Las \nVegas Natural History Museum on reaching this important milestone. For \n20 years, this institution has provided the children of southern Nevada \nwith an interactive learning experience, and I have no doubt that the \nmuseum will continue to be an important part of our community for years \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/11/senate-section/article/S4482-2", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I have added my name as a \ncosponsor of S. 598, the Respect for Marriage Act. This legislation \nwould repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, DOMA, which I voted for in \n1996.\n  I now believe it was a mistake for the Federal Government to \nlegislate in this area in a way that overrides the effect of State \nlaws. Prior to the enactment of DOMA, the Federal Government had \ndeferred to the States to determine what constitutes marriage. I \nbelieve we should return to that position.\n  I also believe it is wrong, and probably unconstitutional, for the \nFederal Government to treat married couples differently solely on the \nbasis of their sexual orientation.\n  Enactment of the Respect for Marriage Act will help ensure that the \nfull protections of our Constitution apply to all of our citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/11/senate-section/article/S4482-3", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COLUMBIA RIVER TREATY\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in \nacknowledging the 15 Columbia River Basin tribes' involvement in the \nColumbia River Treaty negotiation and review process. As some of you \nmay know, the Columbia River Treaty is an agreement between Canada and \nthe United States on the development and operation of the major \nhydroelectric dams in the Columbia River Basin. It addresses power and \nflood control benefits in both countries. The treaty has been in effect \nsince 1964. Under the provisions of the existing treaty, if either \ncountry wishes to modify or cancel the treaty, it must notify the other \ncountry by the year 2014.\n  With 2014 approaching, the United States and Canadian treaty \n``entities'' have already begun talks regarding a possible extension \nand modification of the treaty. The Columbia River Treaty review team \nhas designated representatives from 15 Columbia River tribes, also \nknown as the Sovereign Review Team, SRT. The Columbia Basin tribes have \nvital cultural and natural resources at stake since their homelands are \nlocated in the area affected by the treaty and, as sovereign units of \ngovernment and members of the Sovereign Review Team, SRT--they have a \nright to play an important role in those negotiations. It is important \nto recognize the unique fishing rights for salmon that will have to be \ntaken into account during any negotiations of this treaty with our \nneighbors to the north. The outcome of these negotiations could have a \nprofound impact on the Northwestern United States.\n  I really appreciate one of the designated tribal representatives from \nOregon, the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, for their \ncontinuous involvement. I also appreciate the other members of the \nSovereign Review Team. The tribes and folks from the Pacific Northwest \nall share a common desire for proactive approaches in salmon \nrestoration and recovery, and it is important to come together with \nshared strengths, joint efforts and coordinated education strategies.\n  Unfortunately, the Columbia River Treaty was enacted during a time in \nour history when consideration was not given to the treaty's effects on \nthe natural and cultural resources of tribes/first nations whose \nhomelands are located within the Columbia River Basin. Lack of previous \ndialogue and inclusion of tribal perspectives has disrupted regional \nand tribal interests by leading to the degradation of rivers, the \nsalmon population, traditional food sources, natural resources, and \ntribal customs and identities.\n  The Columbia River Treaty Review provides an opportunity for the \nUnited States to include Columbia Basin tribes in the treaty review \nprocess. I want to emphasize the importance of tribal consultation and \nincorporation of traditional knowledge in this process--to ensure \nprotection and conservation of the numerous natural resources that \ntribal people's way of life are dependent on.\n  The treaty review provides an opportunity to discuss and learn ways \nto strengthen both the government-to-government relationship that \nexists between the United States and the individual Indian nations as \nwell as the U.S.'s position relative to Canada. This can lead the U.S. \nto advance its relationship with 15 additional sovereigns. I have \nenjoyed working with tribes on a number of important issues; I value \nour continued friendship and look forward to working together in the \nfuture. I am proud to support the 15 Columbia River Basin tribes in \ntheir efforts to stand alongside the United States in negotiations of \nthe Columbia River Treaty and stand ready to assist in any way I can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/11/senate-section/article/S4482-4", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/11/senate-section/article/S4482-5", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/11/senate-section/article/S4482-6", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2219.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana memorializing Congress to review and \n     consider eliminating provisions of federal law, which reduce \n     Social Security benefits for those receiving pension benefits \n     from federal, state, or local government retirement or \n     pension systems, plans, or funds; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 57\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has enacted both \n     the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the spousal and \n     survivor Social Security benefit, and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision (WEP), reducing the earned Social \n     Security benefit for any person who also receives a public \n     pension benefit; and\n       Whereas, the intent of Congress in enacting the GPO and the \n     WEP provisions was to address concerns that a public employee \n     who had worked primarily in federal, state, or local \n     government employment might receive a public pension in \n     addition to the same Social Security benefit as a person who \n     had worked only in employment covered by Social Security \n     throughout his career; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of Congress in enacting these \n     reduction provisions was to provide a disincentive for public \n     employees to receive two pensions; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a spouse or survivor \n     receiving a federal, state, or local government retirement or \n     pension benefit who would also be entitled to a Social \n     Security benefit earned by a spouse; and\n       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor \n     Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefit received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases \n     completely eliminating the Social Security benefit; and\n       Whereas, nine out of ten public employees affected by the \n     GPO lose the entire spousal benefit, even though their \n     spouses paid Social Security taxes for many years; and\n       Whereas, the GPO often reduces spousal benefits so \n     significantly it can make the difference between self-\n     sufficiency and poverty; and\n       Whereas, the GPO has a harsh effect on thousands of \n     citizens and undermines the original purpose of Social \n     Security survivors benefits; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively impacts approximately 27,144 \n     Louisianians; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefits, in addition to working in employment covered under \n     Social Security and paying into the Social Security system; \n     and\n       Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned Social Security benefit \n     using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula and may \n     reduce Social Security benefits for affected persons by as \n     much as one-half of the retirement benefit earned as a public \n     servant in employment not covered under Social Security; and\n\n[[Page S4485]]\n\n       Whereas, the WEP causes hard-working individuals to lose a \n     significant portion of the Social Security benefits that they \n     earn themselves; and\n       Whereas, the WEP negatively impacts approximately 25,322 \n     Louisianians; and\n       Whereas, because of these calculation characteristics, the \n     GPO and the WEP have a disproportionately negative effect on \n     employees working in lower-wage government jobs, like \n     policemen, firefighters, teachers, and state employees; and\n       Whereas, these provisions also have a greater adverse \n     effect on women than on men because of the gender differences \n     in salary that continue to plague our nation and because of \n     the longer life expectancy of women; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort to improve the \n     quality of life of its citizens and to encourage them to live \n     here lifelong, yet the current GPO and WEP provisions \n     compromise that quality of life; and\n       Whereas, retired individuals negatively affected by GPO and \n     WEP have significantly less money to support their basic \n     needs and sometimes have to turn to government assistance \n     programs; and\n       Whereas, the GPO and the WEP penalize individuals who have \n     dedicated their lives to public service by eliminating \n     benefits they have earned; and\n       Whereas, our nation should respect, not penalize, public \n     servants; and\n       Whereas, the number of people affected by GPO and WEP is \n     growing every day as more and more people reach retirement \n     age; and\n       Whereas, the GPO and WEP are established in federal law, \n     and repeal of the GPO and the WEP can be enacted only by the \n     United States Congress. Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to review the \n     Government Pension Offset and the Windfall Elimination \n     Provision Social Security benefit reductions and to consider \n     eliminating or reducing them by enacting the Social Security \n     Fairness Act of 2011 (H.R. 1332), the Public Servant \n     Retirement Protection Act of 2011 (S. 113), or a similar \n     instrument. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/11/senate-section/article/S4485-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. BINGAMAN, from the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, with amendments:\n       S. 630.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to take \nimmediate action to recover ecologically and economically from a \ncatastrophic wildfire in the State of Arizona, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am introducing, with Senator John \nMcCain, S. 1344, which is a response to Arizona's largest wildfire, \ncalled the Wallow Fire. This act is the Wallow Fire Recovery and \nMonitoring Act.\n  The Wallow Fire in Arizona burned, over about 40 days, 538,000 acres \nof Arizona land, making it the largest fire in the history of our \nState. Just to put it into perspective, that is nearly 841 square miles \nor almost four times the\n\n[[Page S4487]]\n\nsize of the city of Chicago. The fire destroyed 32 homes and 4 rental \ncabins. Nearly 10,000 people were evacuated at one point, and the fire \ncost the taxpayers over $100 million before it was finally \nextinguished. Unfortunately, it will likely cost double that amount for \nthe necessary rehabilitation of the forests that needs to occur now. \nAfter a fire such as this, there is only a short opportunity to hasten \nforest rehabilitation, reduce risks of flooding, insect epidemics, and \nfuture fires, and capture at least some of the economic benefit from \nthe dead and dying trees to help offset and pay for those restoration \ncosts.\n  Given the urgent need for action, as I said, I am introducing today \nthe Arizona Wallow Fire Recovery and Monitoring Act, joined by my \ncolleague, John McCain, as an original cosponsor. This legislation \nwould expedite the removal of hazard, dead, and dying trees in \ncommunity protection management areas within the Wallow Fire area. The \nremoval projects carried out under the act will be completed within 18 \nmonths of enactment. The reason for this timeline is that when it comes \nto timber harvesting of the fire-killed trees, the costs of delay are \nextreme. Fire-killed trees will lose more than 40 percent of their \nvalue in less than 2 years.\n  Due to the intensity, the size, and the magnitude of the fire, there \nis a tremendous amount of dead and dying trees within the Wallow Fire \narea. Portions of the forest that have burned pose a risk to forest \nusers, to communities, and to private property and the remaining \nresources. These risks include the hazards of falling trees, erosion, \nflooding, reburns due to excess fuel loads, and insect infestation risk \nto the remaining live trees. Under these postfire conditions, timber \nsalvage is a management tool to mitigate these risks, generate revenue \nand jobs, and put the forest on the road to recovery.\n  We saw the negative consequences of delay firsthand in Arizona after \nthe Rodeo-Chediski Fire in 2002, which at that point had been our \nState's largest fire. Bureaucratic regulations and lawsuits so severely \ndelayed salvage efforts that by the time the projects were cleared to \nproceed, the trees had lost most of their economic value. Congress \nshould not stand by and allow this situation to be repeated.\n  That said, we are not looking to eliminate environmental safeguards \nor exempt timber harvests from Federal environmental laws. This bill is \nnarrowly tailored, limiting the removal of hazard, dead, and dying \ntrees to those trees located within community protection management \nareas. One of these areas includes the wildland urban interface and \nother areas critical to communities. In addition, a comprehensive \nhazard tree and commercial timber evaluation and an environmental \nassessment under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, are \nrequired. All appeals and judicial review would follow the processes in \nthe bipartisan Healthy Forest Restoration Act.\n  The practice of postfire timber salvage may be controversial in part \nbecause there is limited scientific information on its ecological \neffects. Most of the scientific literature that does exist is based on \nforests in the Pacific Northwest. The forests in that part of the \ncountry are very different from the dry ponderosa pine-dominated \nforests that burned in the Wallow Fire. Thus, the bill would require \nmonitoring for all timber removal projects implemented under the act.\n  Finally, from a fiscal perspective, there is never going to be enough \nFederal funding for the forest restoration work that needs to be done \nto save the forest that remains. Acknowledging this reality, this bill \ntakes the proceeds from the timber removal project sales and keeps them \non this forest to help pay for future forest restoration treatments.\n  This bill strikes a responsible balance between environmental \nconcerns and economics after a catastrophic wildfire. I urge my \ncolleagues to support its swift passage.\n  The Arizona Wallow Fire Recovery and Monitoring Act requires a \ncomprehensive evaluation of the forest conditions and hazard tree and \nfire-damaged timber resources across the Wallow Fire Area; limits the \nareas where dead and dying trees can be removed to Community Protection \nManagement Areas; limits tree removal to hazard trees and trees that \nare already down, dead, broken or severely root sprung trees where \nmortality is highly expected; prohibits the construction of new, \npermanent roads; provides for an expedited, but thorough, environmental \nreview of tree removal projects proposed in the Wallow Fire Area, \nincluding full public participation in the development of such \nprojects; uses the processes for appeals and judical review established \nin the bipartisan Healthy Forest Restoration Act; requires monitoring \nof the ecological and economic effects of timber removal projects; and \nauthorizes the use of timber receipts to offset the costs of forest \nrestoration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/11/senate-section/article/S4487-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 230--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT ANY \n   AGREEMENT TO REDUCE THE BUDGET DEFICIT SHOULD NOT INCLUDE CUTS TO \n             SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS OR MEDICARE BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Brown \nof Ohio, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. Franken) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the ongoing \nnegotiations on the Federal budget and our rapidly approaching debt \nceiling. I think we all agree the situation we face is increasingly \ngrave. I believe every responsible person agrees that a failure to act \non the debt limit would have awful repercussions and set back our \nfragile and tentative economic recovery. Surpassing the debt limit \ncould inflict a triple economic harm on our struggling economy: the \neconomic harm of all at once pulling 40 cents of every Federal dollar \nout of the economy, the economic harm of shutting down every work \nproject that depends on Federal permits, contracts or regulatory \napprovals, and the economic harm of driving up interest rates for our \nconstituents and for our country. We must, therefore, act and act \nquickly to ensure that we avoid that outcome.\n  I also believe the debt limit presents an opportunity to make some \ntough decisions on our unsustainable deficits. The longer we wait to \nmake these choices, the harder they will be. It is my strong belief \nthat any agreement we reach to reduce the deficits must be based on \nreal savings and must not be made at the expense of our most vulnerable \ncitizens. That is why I am so concerned about reports that Social \nSecurity and Medicare benefits have been raised as possible sources of \ndeficit reduction. Cuts to Social Security and to Medicare benefits are \nunnecessary, are wrong, and should not be on the table. Social Security \nis not the cause of the deficit, and beneficiaries of Social Security \nshould not be made to shoulder the burden of deficit reduction.\n  A balanced deficit reduction package is certainly within our grasp. I \nwish to commend our chairman, Senator Conrad, chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, for his proposal which would cut the deficit by $4 trillion \nover the next decade. His plan would cut the deficit by more than the \nHouse Republican budget and would do so without cutting Social Security \nor Medicare benefits. Chairman Conrad's blueprint would balance $2 \ntrillion in spending cuts with an equal amount of tax loophole closers \nfor wealthy individuals and corporations. His budget would call for \nshared sacrifice, not just go after the elderly and other vulnerable \nAmericans. We should not, as Americans, balance the budget on the backs \nof those who can least afford it. That is why I rise to offer a \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate that any budget agreement \nshould not include cuts to Social Security or Medicare benefits. Social \nSecurity is funded through the contributions of our Nation's workers \nand businesses. It currently has a trust fund balance over $2.5 \ntrillion, and it is projected to be fully solvent for another quarter \ncentury. So while I agree with steps to strengthen Social Security, it \nis a vital program, any changes should be considered independent of \nthis effort to reduce the deficit, and under no circumstances should we \ncut Social Security benefits. Indeed, the solvency of the program could \nbe extended significantly just by applying payroll taxes to a greater \nportion of the earnings of millionaires and billionaires. What we \nshould never do is to put elderly Americans' security at risk in the \nstock market or increase the retirement age or cut benefits through \nbackdoor methods such as lowering the cost-of-living adjustment.\n  As has the Presiding Officer, I have heard from hundreds of folks \nfrom my home State--Rhode Islanders who agree with me--and, \nparticularly, I rely on seniors to whom I have listened at community \ndinners and senior centers throughout the State who are concerned that \nthey have already gone 2 years without a cost-of-living adjustment when \nprices are going up all around them.\n  Audrey from Middletown told me that after her husband died, she had \nmany expenses but ``no income except for his Social Security check \nwhich enabled me to go on living--simply but adequately--without being \na burden on my sons and losing my dignity as well.''\n  Ronald from Cumberland, RI, has been on Social Security for a number \nof years. He wrote me to say:\n\n       It . . . seems that it's always the people who need the \n     help the most who get cut from the Federal Government. Why is \n     this? No Social Security COLA for two years, yet prices for \n     the basic needs still rise. . . . In a country like the \n     United States of America, this should not happen.\n\n  The threat to Medicare is just as real. Earlier this year, House \nRepublicans passed a budget that in 10 years would put an end to the \nMedicare Program as we know it. Estimates suggest their proposal would \nend up forcing a typical 65-year-old senior to pay, on average, $12,500 \neach year in out-of-pocket expenses, starting in 2022--more than double \nwhat a senior is estimated to pay under the current system. In Rhode \nIsland, where the average senior only gets about $14,200 per year from \nSocial Security, charging an average $12,500 for seniors would be an \nexercise in poverty creation.\n  The Republican budget would also throw seniors right away--in the \nnext year--back into the Medicare prescription drug doughnut hole we \nhave just begun closing through the affordable care act, and it would \neliminate the lifesaving preventive services that were added by the \nhealth care reform law. Cutting Medicare benefits is the wrong approach \nto balancing our budget, especially while Republicans continue fighting \nto protect every single tax break, every single loophole, every single \nearmark in the Tax Code enjoyed by millionaires and billionaires and by \ncorporations, many of whom pay no taxes at all.\n  Medicare and Social Security are cornerstones of our Nation's \nprosperity, and they benefit all of us. These programs allow Americans \nto live their lives free from worry about their retirement security or \nthe welfare and health treatment of their parents. This American \nfreedom is a value we should fight to protect.\n  While we should always be open to improving these vital programs, we \nmust not cut the benefits our seniors and disabled Americans have \nearned and rely upon.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the ongoing \nnegotiations on the Federal budget and our rapidly approaching debt \nceiling. I think we all agree the situation we face is increasingly \ngrave. I believe every responsible person agrees that a failure to act \non the debt limit would have awful repercussions and set back our \nfragile and tentative economic recovery. Surpassing the debt limit \ncould inflict a triple economic harm on our struggling economy: the \neconomic harm of all at once pulling 40 cents of every Federal dollar \nout of the economy, the economic harm of shutting down every work \nproject that depends on Federal permits, contracts or regulatory \napprovals, and the economic harm of driving up interest rates for our \nconstituents and for our country. We must, therefore, act and act \nquickly to ensure that we avoid that outcome.\n  I also believe the debt limit presents an opportunity to make some \ntough decisions on our unsustainable deficits. The longer we wait to \nmake these choices, the harder they will be. It is my strong belief \nthat any agreement we reach to reduce the deficits must be based on \nreal savings and must not be made at the expense of our most vulnerable \ncitizens. That is why I am so concerned about reports that Social \nSecurity and Medicare benefits have been raised as possible sources of \ndeficit reduction. Cuts to Social Security and to Medicare benefits are \nunnecessary, are wrong, and should not be on the table. Social Security \nis not the cause of the deficit, and beneficiaries of Social Security \nshould not be made to shoulder the burden of deficit reduction.\n  A balanced deficit reduction package is certainly within our grasp. I \nwish to commend our chairman, Senator Conrad, chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, for his proposal which would cut the deficit by $4 trillion \nover the next decade. His plan would cut the deficit by more than the \nHouse Republican budget and would do so without cutting Social Security \nor Medicare benefits. Chairman Conrad's blueprint would balance $2 \ntrillion in spending cuts with an equal amount of tax loophole closers \nfor wealthy individuals and corporations. His budget would call for \nshared sacrifice, not just go after the elderly and other vulnerable \nAmericans. We should not, as Americans, balance the budget on the backs \nof those who can least afford it. That is why I rise to offer a \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate that any budget agreement \nshould not include cuts to Social Security or Medicare benefits. Social \nSecurity is funded through the contributions of our Nation's workers \nand businesses. It currently has a trust fund balance over $2.5 \ntrillion, and it is projected to be fully solvent for another quarter \ncentury. So while I agree with steps to strengthen Social Security, it \nis a vital program, any changes should be considered independent of \nthis effort to reduce the deficit, and under no circumstances should we \ncut Social Security benefits. Indeed, the solvency of the program could \nbe extended significantly just by applying payroll taxes to a greater \nportion of the earnings of millionaires and billionaires. What we \nshould never do is to put elderly Americans' security at risk in the \nstock market or increase the retirement age or cut benefits through \nbackdoor methods such as lowering the cost-of-living adjustment.\n  As has the Presiding Officer, I have heard from hundreds of folks \nfrom my home State--Rhode Islanders who agree with me--and, \nparticularly, I rely on seniors to whom I have listened at community \ndinners and senior centers throughout the State who are concerned that \nthey have already gone 2 years without a cost-of-living adjustment when \nprices are going up all around them.\n  Audrey from Middletown told me that after her husband died, she had \nmany expenses but ``no income except for his Social Security check \nwhich enabled me to go on living--simply but adequately--without being \na burden on my sons and losing my dignity as well.''\n  Ronald from Cumberland, RI, has been on Social Security for a number \nof years. He wrote me to say:\n\n       It . . . seems that it's always the people who need the \n     help the most who get cut from the Federal Government. Why is \n     this? No Social Security COLA for two years, yet prices for \n     the basic needs still rise. . . . In a country like the \n     United States of America, this should not happen.\n\n  The threat to Medicare is just as real. Earlier this year, House \nRepublicans passed a budget that in 10 years would put an end to the \nMedicare Program as we know it. Estimates suggest their proposal would \nend up forcing a typical 65-year-old senior to pay, on average, $12,500 \neach year in out-of-pocket expenses, starting in 2022--more than double \nwhat a senior is estimated to pay under the current system. In Rhode \nIsland, where the average senior only gets about $14,200 per year from \nSocial Security, charging an average $12,500 for seniors would be an \nexercise in poverty creation.\n  The Republican budget would also throw seniors right away--in the \nnext year--back into the Medicare prescription drug doughnut hole we \nhave just begun closing through the affordable care act, and it would \neliminate the lifesaving preventive services that were added by the \nhealth care reform law. Cutting Medicare benefits is the wrong approach \nto balancing our budget, especially while Republicans continue fighting \nto protect every single tax break, every single loophole, every single \nearmark in the Tax Code enjoyed by millionaires and billionaires and by \ncorporations, many of whom pay no taxes at all.\n  Medicare and Social Security are cornerstones of our Nation's \nprosperity, and they benefit all of us. These programs allow Americans \nto live their lives free from worry about their retirement security or \nthe welfare and health treatment of their parents. This American \nfreedom is a value we should fight to protect.\n  While we should always be open to improving these vital programs, we \nmust not cut the benefits our seniors and disabled Americans have \nearned and rely upon. I wish to thank Senators Blumenthal and Sanders; \nSenator Sherrod Brown; the Presiding Officer, Senator Merkley; and \nSenator Franken for their support in cosponsoring this resolution. I \nhope my colleagues will join us in protecting the promise we have made \nto our Nation's seniors through Social Security and Medicare.\n  In closing, the challenge before us is a formidable one, but I truly \nbelieve we can reach an agreement on the deficit and debt ceiling \nwithout compromising the security and well-being of our seniors.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/07/11/senate-section/article/S4488-1", "month": "07", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 527.
