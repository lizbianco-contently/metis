Mr. President, as the Presiding Officer and all Senators \nshould understand, we have a new sheriff in the Senate now. And we wish \nElizabeth MacDonough well. She is certainly well qualified for this \njob. She has proven that in the decade she has been here, her fairness \nand astuteness of Senate rules. Let everyone understand that a new boss \nis in the Senate now.\n  This morning, following any leader remarks, the Senate will be in a \nperiod of morning business for 1 hour. The Republicans will control the \nfirst half and the majority will control the final half. Following \nmorning business, we will resume consideration of the STOCK Act.\n\n\n                             The STOCK Act\n\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Republicans are going \nto have a luncheon today. I hope they discuss what they want to do here \non the Senate floor. Last night we had a situation where two of our \nfine Senators, Mr. Lieberman and Ms. Collins, who have a reputation of \nbeing fair and bipartisan, did their best to work through some \namendments, to set up votes on them, and they couldn't do it because we \nhad Senators who offered amendments that had nothing to do with this \nbill--nothing. But Republican Senators said they would not allow a vote \non germane and relevant amendments until they were guaranteed a vote on \ntheir nongermane amendments. So that is not a good situation, and we \ncannot legislate in that fashion. It is one thing to offer an amendment \nthat is not germane, but to demand a vote on it out of order before any \nother amendments? So the minority has to make a decision whether they \nwant to legislate or have people give speeches all day that have \nnothing to do with the legislation.\n  I hope the leadership and the Senators generally on the other side of \nthe aisle will work together to help us move this piece of legislation \nout of here. It is an important piece of legislation. We were told it \nis bipartisan. Only two Senators voted against breaking the filibusters \nso we could start debating this bill.\n\n\n                                Spending\n\n  The Republicans in Congress often claim they are the only thing \nstanding against a wave of deficit spending. But where were these \nRepublicans when President Bush pushed for trillions in unpaid tax cuts \nfor the rich? Where were they? They were right here in Congress, that \nis where. So instead of pointing the finger at us, Republicans should \nexamine their own track record of extravagant spending: a prescription \ndrug plan, unpaid for; two unpaid wars; tax breaks for the rich, unpaid \nfor. And they were paid for--borrowed money, money borrowed from \nAmerican taxpayers. Trillions of dollars. In fact, President Bush's tax \ncuts were the single largest contributor to the ballooning budget \ndeficits during his administration. There were plenty of others, but \nthat was No. 1. And no one benefited from these tax breaks more than \nbillionaires and millionaires. Tax breaks for the richest Americans \npiled nearly $1 trillion on our debt over the last decade. The tax bill \nwas far more than that, but that is just people making more than $1 \nmillion a year.\n  Yesterday the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released a \nreport showing that these tax cuts will continue to push deficits to \nunsafe levels. We know that, but in addition to doing that, what it \ndoes is it makes the poor\n\n[[Page S234]]\n\npoorer, the rich richer, and squeezes the middle class every day. \nExtending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans--people making \nmore than $1 million a year--would add another $1 trillion to the \ndeficit over the next decade. We can no longer afford to bankrupt our \nNation to give more tax breaks to people who do not need them. People \nare putting up accounts in the Cayman Islands, stashing money in \nSwitzerland.\n  Republicans are right about one thing: We do have a deficit problem \nin this country. And there are two ways to ease this crisis. We could \ncut more jobs for teachers, firefighters, police, and Federal \nemployees. We could cut Social Security and Medicare benefits for \nseniors after a lifetime of hard work. We could put off repairing our \ncrumbling roads, bridges, and schools. We could continue to let our \nschools fall into disrepair and our students fall further behind. We \ncould continue talking about what really does not matter.\n\n  The House keeps talking about bills they have passed that create \njobs. Everyone, every pundit who has looked at those knows it is just a \nsubterfuge. They want to cut regulations, and that would make people \nsicker, that would make our air dirtier and our water less pure and our \nfood less safe. That is what they are doing to create jobs.\n  The other way to cut spending would be to take care of those \nunnecessary tax breaks for millionaires and billionaires.\n  So this is the choice we face: cutting the heart out of America or \nhaving the richest of the rich contribute just a little bit to the \nproblems we have in America today as it relates to spending. The choice \nwe face should not be a very difficult choice.\n  This country has limited resources, and we must use those resources \nwisely. Investing in the middle class is a wise use of those resources. \nWhen you put money back in the pockets of the middle class, they spend \nit. They spend it on groceries and gas and buying new cars, paying \ntheir mortgages, paying their rent, maybe repairing their family car, \nor spending it to fix the roof on their house that has become \ndilapidated. That spending boosts business, spurs hiring, and helps the \neconomy. Rigging the tax system to favor the richest of the rich does \nnot do that. Rigging the system does not create jobs. It does not spur \ngrowth. It is not a wise use of our resources.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/01/senate-section/article/S234-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later this morning President Obama is \nscheduled to speak in Virginia on the economy. I have not seen the \nspeech, but I expect he will not be talking about the negative impact \nhis health care bill is already having on job creation, and I guarantee \nhe will not be talking about one provision in particular, the CLASS \nAct, which the House of Representatives is voting to repeal today.\n  Like so many of his policies, the CLASS Act has not turned out the \nway the American people were told it would. At the time of its passage, \nAmericans were told it would be a long-term care cost saver. Proponents \nof the CLASS Act said it would account for nearly half of the deficit \nreduction they claimed the health care bill would somehow miraculously \nbring about.\n  More recently, however, the administration has admitted that \ngovernment officials knew their projections about the CLASS Act could \nnot possibly be true. They knew it would not work as advertised. Yet \nthe Obama administration went ahead with it anyway.\n  In 2009, the Chief Medicare Actuary wrote that, based on his 36 years \nof actuarial experience, he believed the CLASS Act would ``collapse in \nshort order, and require significant Federal subsidies to continue'' \nand that it would lead to what he called an insurance death spiral \nsince only the sickest people would sign up, making it impossible for \nthe program to remain solvent. Another health care policy official said \nthat the program ``seemed like a recipe for disaster.''\n  So last October the Obama administration was finally forced to admit \nwhat they refused to admit when the health care bill first passed: that \nthe CLASS Act was indeed unsustainable. As HHS Secretary Sebelius put \nit, there is no viable path forward for the program. Yet for some \nreason the President is unwilling to follow through on that conclusion \nby his own administration. He opposes today's vote over in the House.\n  Most people would conclude that the administration would support \nrepealing a portion of the health care bill that they now acknowledge \nis not financially viable, but they would be wrong. Despite admitting \nthis program is doomed to fail, the Obama administration refuses to \ntake it off the books. This refusal is all the more remarkable given \nthe fact that President Obama has repeatedly said he is willing to \nlisten to critics of his health care bill if they come up with ways to \nimprove it. When it comes to the CLASS Act, the President does not even \nappear to be willing to listen to himself.\n  Well, it should be obvious what is going on here. The President is so \ndetermined to distract people from his own legislative record that he \ndoes not even want to have a conversation about it. He is so determined \nto convince people that the ongoing economic crisis is someone else's \nfault that he is acting as though the first 3 years of his Presidency \nnever even happened. He refuses to admit the central role his policies \nhave played in prolonging the economic mess we are in. Instead of \nleading, the President is biding his time, hoping the public will blame \nsomeone else for the jobs crisis. Instead of acknowledging the effects \nof his own policies, he is hoping he can change the subject. The \nproblem is, the longer we wait to tackle these problems, the harder \nthey will be to solve. And, frankly, most Americans think the President \nshould be leading that charge, not avoiding it.\n  In 2009, President Obama said that rising health care costs were the \nmost pressing fiscal challenge we faced as a nation. Yesterday, the \nCongressional Budget Office said government health care costs will \ndouble over the next decade. So the verdict is in. The administration \nlooked at an area that both parties agree was in critical need of \nreform, and they made it worse, and now they will not even admit it. \nWhy? Because it interferes with the President's reelection strategy. If \nit is about him or his policies, he does not want to talk about it. And \nwhen it comes to the CLASS Act, it is easy to see why.\n  So I would encourage our friends over in the House in their efforts \ntoday. I hope they send this bill over to the Senate with a strong \nbipartisan vote. If the President will not listen to his own advisers, \nlet's hope he listens to Congress on the failures of his health care \nbill and in particular the failures of the CLASS Act.\n  If we are going to replace the President's health care bill with the \nkind of commonsense reform that the American people want, repealing the \nCLASS Act is a good place to start. As the House is showing today, if \nthe President refuses to act on this important issue, Congress will.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/01/senate-section/article/S234-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S234]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, President Obama has said that every morning \nwhen he gets up, he thinks about what he can do to create jobs. Yet \njust in the last couple weeks, he turned thumbs down on a project that \nwould create\n\n[[Page S235]]\n\n20,000 shovel-ready jobs, the Keystone XL Pipeline, which is a project \nthat is teed up and ready to go. It would invest $7 billion initially \nand create 20,000 jobs immediately. It will address a very important \nissue for this country--energy.\n  We talk about getting away from the dependence on foreign sources of \nenergy and becoming more energy independent, and we have an opportunity \nto do that and, at the same time, create economic opportunity in this \ncountry and get people back to work. It is a mystery as to why the \nadministration and the President would not find this particular project \nto be in America's national interest.\n  It comes down to whether we are going to continue to import the oil, \nthe energy we need, from unfriendly nations--we get about 700,000 \nbarrels a day from Venezuela--or whether we will get that oil from a \nfriendly neighbor such as Canada. When we look at that juxtaposition, \nthat comparison, and ask should we get that 700,000 barrels of oil from \nHugo Chavez or from Canada, most Americans would say it makes more \nsense to do business with our friendly ally to the north. Also, we \nwould have that come down into this country in a 1,700-mile pipeline, \nwhich would transport that oil to refineries in the United States, \nwhere it would be refined and create jobs there as well.\n  In almost all respects, as we look at the project and the attributes \nthat come with it, they are job creation, investment, energy security, \nnot to mention the State and local tax revenue, which is something that \nis important to a lot of people whom I represent in South Dakota. In \nfact, I had someone from western South Dakota in my office last week, \nand he said: We care about the energy security issue, the jobs issue, \nand all that, but we need the tax revenue for our school districts and \ncounty governments that would be generated.\n  So we have all these positive benefits associated with this \nparticular project. Yet after having studied it for 3 years, about \n1,200 days, and having done multiple environmental impact statements--\nthe last one concluded in August of last year--lo and behold, the \nPresident decides he is not going to move forward with this project.\n  We think that is terribly unfortunate, not in the national interest. \nWe believe it is in the national interest to move forward to address \nthe important energy security needs, as well as the needs for job \ncreation and economic growth.\n  Two of my colleagues, former Governors, now Senators from Nebraska \nand North Dakota, are people who are well acquainted with these types \nof projects. The Governor from North Dakota was very involved when the \nfirst Keystone Pipeline that was built from Canada through North \nDakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and points south. That project went \nthrough a permitting process. It was a couple years in the making and \nit was approved. The construction process was concluded and it is now \noperational. That is an example of how this particular project can \nwork.\n  This pipeline would cross the State of the Senator from Nebraska. \nThere were concerns about whether it had the right route in order for \nthis to be done in the best environmental way. Those issues have been \naddressed. The Nebraska legislature met in special session, and they \nand the Governor came up with an alternative idea about how to do this. \nThey have been supportive of moving forward with this project as well.\n  The question before the House is if the President of the United \nStates determines this is not in the national interest, notwithstanding \nthe support of lots of Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle \nand I think overwhelming support of the States through which this line \nwould traverse and the labor unions which represent a lot of people who \nare involved. Many editorial pages support this, including the Chicago \nTribune, which said:\n\n       Obama's decision will cost the U.S. jobs. . . . He seems to \n     think those jobs will still be there when he gets around to \n     making decision on the pipeline. But they may well be gone \n     for good.\n\n  They go further and say his decision ``will deny the U.S. a reliable \nsource of oil.''\n  They recognize the importance of this project and doing business with \na friendly country, the importance of energy independence, and the fact \nthat if we don't benefit from this, it will go somewhere else. They \nhave made it abundantly clear this is not something--if the United \nStates turns it down--they will continue to wait around for until \nsometime in the future when we might consider it. They will go \nsomewhere else--probably China--with it.\n  For those reasons, we believe we need to do everything we can do to \nmove this project forward. My colleagues came up with legislation that \nrecognizes the role of the Congress under the commerce clause and our \nability to approve this project. I hope we will get an opportunity to \ndiscuss and debate this issue in the Senate and get a vote and perhaps \nget a vote as well in the House of Representatives, where Congress \ncould weigh in and perhaps change the President's mind about this \nimportant project.\n  I am glad to be with my colleagues today. I will yield to the Senator \nfrom North Dakota and the Senator from Nebraska, two great leaders on \nthis particular issue and all issues relating to energy security. They \nunderstand the history of this, as well as its importance to America's \nfuture.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota if he would like to give us an \ninsight about the first Keystone Pipeline, built through his State a \nfew years ago, the history of that, and the history of how this \nparticular project was put forward as well and why we think it ought to \ngo forward.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota for \norganizing the colloquy and I also thank the good Senator from Nebraska \nfor joining us as well. I appreciate working with them on this project, \nwhich is not only vital to our State but to our country.\n\n  As the Senator from South Dakota said, this project is critically \nimportant to our country for a number of reasons. First, it will create \ntens of thousands of jobs. There will be a $7 billion investment, not \none penny of which will be Federal Government spending but all private \nsector investment. The Perryman Group projected, when they did a study \non the job creation, that it would create 20,000 construction jobs \nright away; it would create upward of 100,000 spinoff jobs as they \nexpand refineries and with the other economic activity that is created. \nSome might dispute those job numbers, but any way we look at it, tens \nof thousands of jobs will be created by the private sector, which is \nwhy it has strong union support at a time when we have 13-plus million \npeople out of work and we need the jobs.\n  As the Senator from South Dakota said, it will generate hundreds of \nmillions in tax revenues from a growing economy, from more economic \nactivity. The last I checked, it is pretty important at the local, \nState, and Federal levels to have those revenues coming in. In \naddition, it will reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East. \nWith what is going on in Iran--and they are threatening to blockade the \nStrait of Hormuz--and with gas prices at $3.50 a gallon, roughly, and \ngoing up, it is important to consumers and the businesses of this \ncountry that we use the oil in this country and from our closest ally, \nCanada, rather than relying on the Middle East.\n  The third point is, this oil will be produced. If we don't build the \npipeline capacity to bring it to our refineries to be refined, it goes \nto China. That is a fact. It will be produced. It will either go to \nChina or it will come to us.\n  I have this chart to give a history of the project because, as the \ngood Senator from South Dakota said, this has been under review for \nmore than 3 years. TransCanada, the company that is trying to build the \npipeline, built this Keystone Pipeline already. That is this red line \non the chart. That project was approved in 2 years. Again, Keystone XL \nhas been under study more than 3 years. The sister pipeline has already \nbeen built, and that was approved in 2 years. It comes from Alberta, \nCanada, to the refineries in the Patoka, IL, area.\n  The existing project, as we can see, comes through North Dakota--that \nwas when I was Governor--through South Dakota, and down through \nNebraska. The Keystone XL comes just to the west. I point that out \nbecause of the Bakken oil play in North Dakota\n\n[[Page S236]]\n\nand Montana, it is very important we have the ability to put oil into \nthis pipeline. We are looking at putting 100,000 barrels a day of U.S. \ncrude into this pipeline so it can get to our refineries. In other \nwords, it is not just about bringing Canadian crude to our refineries; \nit is about bringing our own crude to them. It also saves wear and tear \non our roads, and it is a safety issue because it reduces truck \ntraffic. We are talking 500 truckloads a day and 17 million truck miles \na year that we don't have to put on our roads. We don't have to have \nthe traffic issues, the safety issues or the road issues in our country \nbecause we have the ability to move the product with this pipeline.\n  Let's look at this timeline. September, 2008. I know this is hard to \nread. I will make an important point. In September 2008, TransCanada \napplied for a permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline. In November of 2008, \nthe current administration was elected. For the entire time the current \nadministration has been in office, they have held up this project. It \nhas gone through the full NEPA process. It had the full environmental \nimpact studies done. Even the State Department said there would be a \ndecision before the end of last year. For the entire time this \nadministration has been in office, TransCanada was working to go \nthrough the process with EPA and the Department of State, and the \nDepartment of State said they would have a decision before the end of \nlast year, but we still don't have a decision. We have to ask why. Why \ndon't we have a decision? That is what we are talking about. It is long \npast time to act.\n  Let's look at this chart. What are we talking about? What we are \ntalking about is this--another pipeline. We are talking about another \npipeline just like the one that has already been built. How about the \nhundreds or maybe I should say thousands of pipelines we already have, \nand somehow we cannot build this pipeline? That doesn't make any sense. \nSomebody needs to explain this to us.\n  We have legislation, with 45 Senators, 45 sponsors, who are saying: \nHey, it is time to move forward and build the project. As a matter of \nfact, we are doing everything we can to address any and all problems or \nconcerns the administration has raised.\n  That is why I am going to turn it over now to my good colleague from \nNebraska, because when the administration says there is an issue or a \nState or the EPA says there is an issue, we stepped up in our \nlegislation and solved it. We say: Great, let's address it, but let's \nmove forward for the good of our economy and the good of our country.\n  I defer now to the good Senator from Nebraska.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments that have been \noffered by my colleagues from South Dakota and North Dakota. They \nabsolutely have it right in terms of the importance of constructing \nthis pipeline. There is no question that we are in a dire situation in \nthis Nation. We need the jobs, we need the oil, and this pipeline can \ntake a significant step forward in both regards.\n  I think the pipeline will be a huge help in those areas. But let me \nstart by noting that I was a cosponsor of the first Keystone bill. I am \nalso a cosponsor of the bill that Senators Hoeven, Lugar, and Vitter \nintroduced just this past Monday, the bill we are talking about today.\n  Here is a very important point for my State. In both cases, and \nspecifically in reference to this bill, the effort was specifically \ncrafted to safeguard the route selection process that is occurring in \nNebraska. I thank my colleagues for recognizing that work and \nrecognizing that Nebraska has a process that will near completion this \nAugust or September. They have worked very hard to take into account \nour issues, and their bill recognizes that the Nebraska effort will \ncontinue.\n  They decided in our State--the Governor, the legislature, and \nTransCanada--to work on an alternative to the proposed \nroute. Recognition occurred that the route through Nebraska involved \nsome very sensitive land--the Sand Hills--and a very sensitive water \nsupply--the Ogallala aquifer. The Governor called a special session, \nand, as we do in Nebraska, everybody sat down and said: How do we solve \nthis problem?\n\n  So they came to an agreement that the best way to solve the problem \nwas to do an environmental impact statement, which will be no cost to \nthe Federal Government. It will be paid for by Nebraskans. That was \npart of the provision of this agreement. And TransCanada agreed they \nwould work to reroute the pipeline through our State. Everybody shook \nhands. We are now in agreement. Our problem is solved in Nebraska.\n  For months and months, the Federal Government has been saying to the \nState of Nebraska: You have the power to route this pipeline through \nyour State. And that is exactly what we are doing. So this legislation \nrecognizes that agreement and says: Great, we are going to allow \nNebraska to move forward. But very wisely this legislation also \nrecognizes there is no need whatsoever for any delay on the remainder \nof this pipeline. This was the only segment--and it is a handful of \nmiles in our State--that anybody was contesting. So why not issue the \npermit? Why not get the project going?\n  My colleagues worked very hard on coming up with a solution, and \ntheir solution works. It says: Construction can begin immediately. Why? \nBecause, as my colleague from North Dakota has explained well, Congress \nhas the constitutional authority to regulate foreign commerce. This \nbill exercises that power in a thoughtful, deliberate, and careful way. \nIt says: Look, this project has gone through 3 years of study and \nanalysis. It specifically notes in this legislation the part regarding \nNebraska will be solved, as the Federal Government has been saying for \nmonths, by Nebraska officials, but that we can go forward and start \nconstruction elsewhere.\n  So what is holding up the creation of these jobs? What is holding up \nour ability to get more oil from places such as North Dakota and a \nfriendly ally such as Canada, versus a very unfriendly ally in Hugo \nChavez in Venezuela? What is holding that up? What could possibly be \nholding that up? Well, the simple answer to that question is, the \nPresident of the United States is holding it up.\n  The President is in a bind. The environmentalists have declared war \non the oil sands in Canada. They do not want the pipeline because they \ndo not want the oil sands. On the other hand, unions want to build the \npipeline. They want the jobs, and thoughtfully so. So this is a time \nwhere Congress does need to step in and exercise our constitutional \npowers. This is nothing unusual. In fact, there was a recent opinion by \nthe Congressional Research Service which noted the Congress has the \npower to do exactly what this legislation is doing.\n  I will wrap up my comments today and yield back the time to the \nSenators from South Dakota and North Dakota and say this: This is a \nwin-win situation for everybody. It is a win because we create jobs. It \nis a win for our country because we are trying in every way possible to \nget the Federal Government to lessen our dependence on foreign oil. \nMaybe the only person who it is not a win for is President Obama in his \nreelection. But this is a case where we need to put national interest \nahead of November.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that was \nthoughtfully crafted. It is the right approach. I thank them for their \nsensitivity to the process going on in the State of Nebraska.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work of the Senator \nfrom Nebraska on this subject, as well as the Senator from North \nDakota, and he has fashioned a solution which I think does give us an \nopportunity as a Congress to assert our role under the Constitution, \nunder the commerce clause of the Constitution, to move this project \nforward, notwithstanding the opposition, really of one person--the \nPresident of the United States, who is the person right now who is \nstanding in the way of this.\n  I would again say to my colleague from North Dakota, as we wrap up \nhere, I hear people say this needs to be studied further; that we need \nto do more analysis. It is sort of mind-boggling to think after more \nthan 1,200 days of study, analysis, review, and scrutiny that people \nwould come to that conclusion. The Keystone XL\n\n[[Page S237]]\n\nPipeline I, which the Senator from North Dakota is well acquainted with \nbecause it goes through his State and he was involved in negotiating \nthat project, took 693 days in the process of getting approved. What is \ninteresting to me about this particular project is that after 1,200 \ndays--longer than any of the pipelines of this magnitude--the extended \nreview and more than 10,000 pages of environmental analysis concluded--\nconcluded--the pipeline will not adversely impact the environment. When \nthe announcement was made to deny the construction of the pipeline, the \nState Department still had 5 weeks to review it if they had chosen to \nuse it. Clearly, the announcement wasn't based on policy but on \npolitical expediency, which is what the Senator from Nebraska pointed \nout.\n  There is a tremendous amount of resource in my colleague's State--the \nState of North Dakota--that could benefit as well. I think the State of \nNorth Dakota has the potential to generate somewhere on the order of \n500,000 barrels of oil, about 100,000 of which, I am told, could be \nmoved through this pipeline if it is approved. It seems to me at least, \nagain, that here is a resource, an energy reserve in our country, in my \ncolleague's State, that could benefit people in this country.\n\n  By the way, in 2011, Americans spent more on gasoline than any other \nyear since 1981. And reports indicate that 2012 could be even worse. So \nwhen we look at the economic impact on Americans, from our not having \nour oil and energy being produced in this country, it is a very real \nimpact. In fact, since the President has taken office, gas prices have \ngone from $1.84 a gallon to over $3.30 a gallon, and this pipeline \ncould be part of that solution.\n  I want to end with a quote made by the State Department in their \nreview of the pipeline. The Department of Energy, I should say, but it \nwas part of the State Department's review. The Department of Energy \nnoted:\n\n       Gasoline prices in all markets served by East Coast and \n     Gulf Coast refineries would decrease, including the Midwest.\n\n  That is coming from the State Department's review, the Department of \nEnergy, that gasoline prices in all markets served by east coast and \ngulf coast refineries would decrease. That is a pretty remarkable \neconomic impact, not to mention all the jobs that would be associated \nwith the construction, and once it is operational the jobs that would \nbe created in refining this oil.\n  So again it is a win-win, as we heard from the Senator from Nebraska, \nwho said that initially their State had some concerns about the route, \nbut that has been all resolved so this project can move forward.\n  The legislation of the Senator from North Dakota, which I am proud to \nsupport and cosponsor, I hope gets a vote in the Senate, and I know the \nSenator is going to do everything he can to advance it--I hope he \ndoes--and I look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from South Dakota \nagain for organizing this colloquy this morning. I thank him and the \nesteemed Senator from Nebraska for their support of this legislation.\n  Again, we have taken a problem-solving approach to this legislation, \nand we are continuing to do that. We will continue to work with other \nMembers of the Senate and our colleagues in the House, but we need the \nadministration to engage with us on this important issue for the good \nof the American people.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, with that, I yield back the remainder of my \ntime, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Whitehouse pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2059 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand).

Madam President, too many Americans are out of work. We \nknow that. Without a steady income, it is hard for families to stay \ncurrent on their monthly expenses. We have all talked about the \nconsequences of losing a job. When I meet with the unemployed in \nIllinois, one of the first things we talk about is health insurance \nbecause that is one of the first casualties. It is very difficult if \nnot impossible for someone unemployed to maintain COBRA payments once \nthey are out of work. They deplete their savings and find themselves in \na very vulnerable position. Some fall behind on mortgage payments. More \nthan 4 million families have lost their homes since the housing crisis \nbegan in 2008. Another 10.7 million Americans own mortgages that are \nunderwater--the homeowner owes more than the home is worth.\n  One of the major mortgage banking associations in Washington, DC, \nrecently had a short sale of their headquarters building in Washington. \nThey went underwater. They could not pay their mortgage, and they ended \nup selling. It is happening not just to businesses, obviously, but to a \nlot of homeowners.\n  It is hard to keep up with these basic expenses. A lot of people who \nused to donate to food banks are now in line at food banks. According \nto the U.S. Department of Agriculture, one out of six Americans really \nhas a food issue. They are hungry at the highest level since the \ngovernment started taking these numbers in 1995.\n  But there is another obligation, a financial obligation that needs a \nlittle more focus here in Washington. Private student loan debt is \nbecoming the biggest burden for families across America. Student loan \ndebt in October of 2010 for the first time in our history surpassed \ncredit card debt in America. At public universities, the average debt \nfor a graduating student was $20,200. At private nonprofits, it was \n$27,650. For students at for-profit colleges, the debt burden is even \ngreater. Students at for-profit colleges graduated with an average debt \nof $33,000. More than three out of four young adults say that college \nhas become harder to afford in the past 5 years. Almost as many say \nthat graduates have more student debt than they can possibly manage. \nThere are few penalties for schools whose students incur huge amounts \nof debt when the student cannot repay their loan.\n  How did we reach this point? Two trends have led to this phenomenal \nlevel of student loan debt:\n  First, the for-profit college industry has grown by leaps and bounds \nover the last decade. It is the fastest growing sector of higher \neducation. Three numbers put it in perspective. Ten percent of students \nout of high school end up in for-profit schools, yet for-profit schools \nconsume 25 percent of all the Federal aid to education and account for \n44 percent of student loan defaults. What is the obvious conclusion? \nThese for-profit colleges are drawing in more student loan assistance \nfrom the Federal Government than their counterparts in the public and \nnonprofit area, and their students, deep in debt, cannot find jobs to \npay off their debts and default on their loans.\n  Second, the cost of college is so far out of reach for most people \nthat they exhaust their ability to borrow from the government and end \nup taking out private loans. Private loans are not federally \nguaranteed. The issuer is not required to work with you to consolidate \nthe loans or restructure them in the future. If that sounds familiar, \nthat is because many of the banks issuing these loans are the same \nbanks holding your mortgage. Even more outrageous, the loans are \nprotected in bankruptcy. What that means is, unlike other loans we \nwould incur in our lives that we might bring into a bankruptcy court in\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\ndesperation, these loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. These \nloans will trail the borrowers to the grave. Student loan decisions \nmade at the age of 19, 20, and 21 years end up being a lifetime of \nresponsibility.\n  Yesterday the president of a small, very good college in Illinois \nsaid that so many students she meets with who are interested in going \nto school are debt-dumb; they do not even understand debt as it might \naffect them today and tomorrow. Unfortunately, these for-profit \nschools--and many others--are taking advantage of students with little \nor no life experience who end up, many times, with their parents \nsigning for student loan debt that is unconscionable, at levels they \nwill never be able to repay in any reasonable time, and often, when it \ncomes to for-profit schools, for worthless diplomas if the student is \nlucky enough to finish.\n  One of my constituents, Hannah Moore, recently contacted my office \nregarding her outstanding student debt. I wanted to bring this to the \nattention of the Senate. In 2007, Hannah graduated with a bachelor of \narts from a for-profit school called the Harrington College of Design. \nIt was part of the Career Education Corporation's program. When Hannah \ngraduated in 2007 from the Harrington College of Design, her student \ndebt was $124,570.\n  After she exhausted all her Federal student loan options, she turned \nto private loans when she wanted to finish and get a degree. At first \nshe tried to manage her payments of close to $800 a month by working \nthree jobs. Her Federal loan is a reasonable payment because she signed \nup for the income-based repayment program, but the private loan demands \nare unreasonable. When the payments became unmanageable, she tried to \nwork out a plan with her lender. They refused. She said that she speaks \nto her lender about once a month asking for assistance, with no help. \nWhen it became apparent she would not be able to afford the payments, \nher family offered to help. Her dad, who had retired, got a job just to \nhelp his daughter make her student loan repayments. Dad went back to \nwork, out of retirement. Her parents spend their time stressing over \nher loans with her.\n  Hannah is 30 years old. She wants to be independent, but her student \ndebt of over $124,000 is making that impossible. With the help of her \nfamily, dad going back to work and all she can do, she makes her \nmonthly payments, but her life is still very much on hold. She said, \n``My education doesn't feel rewarding, it's a burden right now.'' When \nasked how her student loan debt is affecting her life, she said: I \ncan't start a family, can't buy a house, I can't even buy a car. She \nrides her bike to work. Think about that. She went to college, she \nstuck with it, and she graduated with a degree of no value and $124,000 \nin student debt.\n\n  She is not alone. Every week I hear from constituents who are seeking \nrelief, and I invite them to come to my Web site and tell me their \nstories about student loan debt in America.\n  Last week, in his State of the Union, the President spoke about a \nplan to keep the cost of higher education from going even further. His \nproposal will provide better information to families, while enlisting \ncolleges and State governments to partner with the Federal Government \nto keep costs down while improving student outcomes.\n  To make sure students and families have accurate information, the \nPresident has proposed creating a college scorecard for all \ninstitutions of higher education--all of them. The scorecard will \nprovide families with clear, concise information about affordability \nand student outcomes--how many students go to this school and finish, \nhow many who finish with a degree get a job. It is a pretty basic \nquestion. Then students and their families can make a good choice. They \nwill not be overwhelmed by the spam and ads tossed at them on the \nInternet.\n  The plan would reward schools that give value, serve low-income \nstudents, and set reasonable tuition policies. These schools would be \nrewarded with additional campus-based aid so more students can attend \ncollege.\n  The President's proposal also builds on the success of the current \nRace to the Top Program by creating a new Race to the Top Program \nrewarding college affordability and completion that will promote change \nin State systems of higher education. This Race to the Top challenge \nwill incentivize Governors and State legislatures around the Nation to \njoin us in keeping tuition costs down.\n  Following the President's challenge to keep college costs down, the \nSenate HELP Committee is holding hearings this week on college \naffordability. I thank them for that. It is long overdue, and I look \nforward to working with Senators Harkin and Enzi on this issue.\n  A hearing we had just a week or so ago in Chicago on the abuse of the \nGI bill education rights by for-profit schools should be a wake-up call \nto every Member of Congress. Holly Petraeus, the wife of General \nPetraeus, testified. She works at the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, an agency that is in the news. It is controversial because the \nappointment of its Director, Richard Cordray, was announced by the \nPresident by executive appointment when the Senate refused to give him \nan opportunity to serve.\n  The Senate refused to break a filibuster on Mr. Cordray, even though \nI heard no speeches criticizing his ability. The speeches criticized \nthe agency, which some Republicans loathe and despise, but it is in the \nlaw and it should be given a chance to work. Those who are critical of \nit should meet with Holly Petraeus, General Petraeus's wife. She is \nworking with military families trying to stop the abuses of for-profit \nschools under the GI bill. That is something on which we should all \njoin together, Democrats and Republicans alike. Americans who serve in \nthe military are entitled to not only the GI bill but to institutions \nof learning that give them a chance to take their time in school and \nturn it into a much better life for themselves and their families.\n  I hope we can come together on the question of affordability and on \ntaking a close look at many of these institutions of higher learning \nthat are, unfortunately, defrauding many innocent children, families, \nand veterans who are returning from conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, it is a new day and with it comes the \nhope we will make more progress than we did yesterday. Actually, we \nwere prepared, after some good work by the four of us--Senator Collins; \nSenator Brown; the occupant of the chair, Senator Gillibrand; and \nmyself--and our staffs to move forward yesterday afternoon. \nUnfortunately, we were blocked in that. But I know efforts continue to \nallow us to at least proceed with the amendment Senator Paul offered \nthat was modified--or prepared to be modified, after discussion, with a \nreasonable conclusion that I think will be supported by most Members of \nthe Senate.\n  There is so much we can do. Our staffs worked overnight. They have \ntried to divide the amendments into those that are germane and relevant \nand those that are not. I understand leadership on both sides will be \ntalking about how to proceed.\n  I repeat what I said at the outset--and I know all of us who have \nworked so hard to respond to the concern that Members of Congress and \nour staffs are not covered by insider trading laws--that we not try to \nsolve every problem or correct every potential source of public \nmistrust of Congress on this bill for fear that we will, therefore, \nnever get anything accomplished.\n  I am hopeful, as the morning goes on and certainly into the \nafternoon, after discussions that occur at the lunch hour, we will be \nable to proceed to handle some amendments in an expeditious way and \nthat we can see our way to the end of consideration of this bill, \nremembering that on the basic provisions of the bill we have \noverwhelming bipartisan support.\n  I understand the vote on cloture to proceed to the bill does not \nexactly express support for the final vote, but there were only two who \nvoted against cloture, so clearly an overwhelming number of Members of \nthe Senate want to proceed to vote on the bill.\n  If we do not break this unfortunate and unnecessary and harmful \ngridlock, either the majority leader is going to have to file cloture \nor leave the bill and go on to other pressing business--FAA \nreauthorization and the like--and that would be not only disappointing \nto us, but having aroused the hope that we would respond to the public \nconcern and anger about the possibility that we are not covered by \ninsider trading laws, we will have ended up increasing that concern and \nanger and disenchantment with Congress. I do not think any of us want \nto do that.\n  With that appeal to our colleagues to apply a certain rule of reason \nso we can get something done that will be good for our government and \nthe people's respect for us, I am very pleased to see my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Blumenthal, in the Chamber. I know he has an \namendment he wants to offer at this time, and I will yield the floor to \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, I thank the Presiding Officer, the \ndistinguished Senator from New York, and my colleagues, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Collins, and Senator Brown, for their superb \nleadership on this issue, and I am very pleased to strongly support the \nunderlying bill.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1498 to Amendment No. 1470\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment \nbe set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, essentially this amendment, very \nsimply and directly, assures that Members of Congress who may be \nprosecuted and convicted of the offenses specified in the amendment \nalso should see their pensions revoked, along with potentially other \ncrimes that they may have committed.\n  The purpose essentially is to assure the credibility of Congress by \nrevoking pensions of corrupt Members of Congress, not only those who \nmay be convicted under this pending bill--insider trading--but also a \nvariety of other public corruption offenses. In fact, the amendment \nadds 22 new public corruption offenses to existing law that merit the \ncancellation or revoking of congressional pensions.\n  I have worked with Senator Kirk, who, unfortunately, could not be \nwith us today. He and his staff have been integral. It is a bipartisan-\nproposed statute that is similar to one I worked to enact in \nConnecticut when I was the attorney general there.\n  The guiding principle is absolutely crystal clear, consistent with \nthe basic measure we are considering: not one dime of taxpayer money \nshould go to corrupt elected officials.\n  Over the past 50 years, Members of Congress have been convicted of 16 \nseparate felonies. So the need for this measure is considerable, even \nif it is a small minority of the Members of Congress. In fact, right \nnow, approximately $800,000 a year is paid to Members of Congress who \nhave been convicted of these kinds of felonies.\n  So I wish to particularly thank Senator Kirk and quote him since he \ncould not be here today. He said, earlier this year, of this \nlegislation:\n\n       American taxpayers should not be on the hook for the \n     pension benefits of convicted felons. Expanding current law \n     to include additional public corruption felonies will block \n     pension benefits for Members who fail to honor their pledge \n     to defend the Constitution and uphold the laws of the United \n     States. Once you have violated the public trust in that way, \n     I think that the taxpayers should not be supporting your \n     retirement.\n\n  In short, very simply, a breach of law by an elected official is a \nserious offense that should have consequences. Taxpayers should not pay \nfor the retirement benefits of elected officials convicted of a \nfelony--Members of Congress, anyone else--especially as the United \nStates faces the soaring deficits that it does now and the crippling \ndebt that grows even higher.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1491 to Amendment No. 1470\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I call up my amendment No. 1491, which is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1491 to amendment No. 1470.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To extend the STOCK Act to ensure that the reporting \n requirements set forth in the STOCK Act apply to the executive branch \n                       and independent agencies)\n\n       On page 7, line 7, strike ``a'' insert ``each officer or \n     employee as referred to in subsection (f), including each''.\n       On page 7, line 8 insert a comma after ``employee of \n     Congress''.\n       At the end, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 11. PROMPT REPORTING AND PUBLIC FILING OF FINANCIAL \n                   TRANSACTIONS FOR EXECUTIVE BRANCH.\n\n       ``Each agency or department of the Executive branch and \n     each independent agency shall comply with the provisions of \n     section 8 with respect to any of such agency, department or \n     independent agency's officers and employees that are subject \n     to the disclosure provisions under the Ethics in Government \n     Act of 1978.''.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the amendment \nthat I have offered, No. 1491, to the STOCK Act.\n  Right now, the STOCK Act, as it is written, does not apply to the \npublic disclosure requirements to the executive branch or independent \nagencies.\n  The amendment that I have offered this morning ensures the public \ndisclosure of all trading by senior government officials. Yes, I will \nsay it again. My amendment ensures the public disclosure of all trading \nby senior government officials.\n  This is a very reasonable amendment, as it is limited to the \nexecutive branch and independent agency personnel who are already \nsubject to the reporting requirements.\n  My amendment merely expands the enhanced disclosure requirement under \nthe STOCK Act to these current filers. Without this amendment, it would \nbe impossible for the public to know whether the executive branch \nofficials are complying with the STOCK Act. The public should be able \nto monitor trades of all executive and legislative branch officials in \nthe same manner. Let's not make Congress transparent while leaving the \nexecutive branch and independent agencies in the dark.\n  Ironically, the disclosure provisions of the STOCK Act currently do \nnot apply to the Securities and Exchange Commission, their employees, \nand so forth, which is the body that will be responsible for enforcing \nsuch provisions on Congress. That is nonsense. The SEC, which has \naccess to vast financial markets information, should be held to\n\n[[Page S241]]\n\nthe same standards it has been charged with enforcing.\n  My amendment will apply the disclosure provisions of the STOCK Act to \nall branches, ensuring transparency for all in government.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to work with \nme. I look forward to working with them more to improve public \ndisclosure for both the executive and legislative branches.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Alabama for \ncoming to the floor and proposing his amendment. I agree that there \nshould be parity between the legislative and executive branches \nwherever it is appropriate. I am very happy to work with him.\n  I must say that yesterday we made some progress on a somewhat similar \namendment by Senator Paul to appropriately scope the amendment on \nrequiring executive branch officials to report on their financial \ntransactions to Senate-confirmed positions. I don't know whether that \nis the resolution here, but I think we should work on it. I want to \nstate for the record that the executive branch is not free of conflict-\nof-interest regulations. In fact, in some sense you might say they have \ntougher restrictions. Even the SEC employees have to get permission \nbefore they can make stock transactions, and then they have to file \ndisclosures not within 30 or 10 days but within 2 days, I believe. \nThere are many other regulations on them.\n  I think part of what is going on here is the nature of the two \nbranches of Government to deal with conflicts of interest. We have \nfocused on a system of disclosure and transparency. We have embraced \nthe adage that sunlight is the best disinfectant. In contrast, the \nexecutive branch actually addresses potential conflicts of interest \nthrough not just transparency but statutory mandates that require the \ndivestiture of stock when it may involve a conflict of interest and \nrecusal being involved in handling anything that relates to any \npersonal interest that an individual in the executive branch has. There \nis a very extensive system of high-ranking agency officials being \nforced to divest themselves of conflicting stock holdings--obviously, \nsometimes at a financial loss.\n  There could be an amendment to come up on that. But to do it in \nexactly the way--at least on the recusal section--the executive branch \ndoes it would not be appropriate for Members of Congress because \nMembers are called on to vote on issues across the widest array of \nactivity. Recusal, therefore, is not a viable option because it would \ndeny our constituents representation and our votes on a very wide array \nof public issues. An amendment on divestiture of blind trusts or mutual \nfunds is another question.\n  But the main point I wanted to make is there is a lot of regulation \non the executive branch. The ethics rules, requirements, and guidance \nthat have been put forth over the years by the Office of Government \nEthics and at the agencies are extensive. I know volume of pages of law \nisn't everything, but it says a lot. There are six pages in the Senate \nCode of Conduct that cover conflicts of interest, while there are \nliterally hundreds of pages of rules and requirements governing such \nconflict of interest situations for the executive branch.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Alabama, as drafted, would \nrequire that the annual filings of over 300,000 career civil servants \nand managers be published on the Internet. That is a lot of people and \na lot of work to be done to process and handle those. But I understand \nthe intention of Senator Shelby. I think it is a good intention. \nSenator Wyden has a similar amendment, and I wish to work with them, as \nI know Senator Collins would as well, to see if we can come to some \nmeeting of the minds that would allow us to achieve the purpose we all \nhave in the underlying bill, which is to build confidence in our \ngovernment and its integrity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I support the intent of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Alabama. I think he is right, we need \nparity, as much as possible, in the disclosure requirements. I also \nbelieve he is correct the disclosure reports should be online so they \nare easily accessible. So the intent of his amendment is one I \nwholeheartedly support.\n  As Senator Lieberman does, I have some questions about the universe \nof Federal employees who would be covered by the amendment of the \nSenator from Alabama. We have been working successfully with the \nSenator from Kentucky, who first brought up this issue of parity, to \nmake sure the scope of coverage is appropriate. It seems to me one way \nto solve these issues is to use a similar scope as we have agreed on \nwith Senator Paul in the amendment that Senator Shelby has brought \nforth. We would then have a certain consistency that we had vetted the \nuniverse of Federal employees that should be covered. That seems to me \nto be a very appropriate and relatively easy fix to this issue.\n  I do want to emphasize that I agree with Senator Shelby that those \nFederal employees should be required to file in the same timeframes as \nMembers of Congress and their staffs, and that certainly those reports \nshould be accessible online.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1481\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, across the Nation, Americans wonder \nif Washington is working for them. Congress's approval rate, as we know \nso well, is an abysmal 13 percent, 12 percent--different surveys--but \nnot very good. One factor contributing to this distrust is the sense \nthat elites in Washington are using their positions to get ahead \nfinancially. Members of Congress have the privilege and the honor of \nbeing elected to serve the public. Unfortunately, some elected \nofficials have used the information they have acquired through service \nto the public--and I might put service to the public in quotation \nmarks--to enrich their stock holdings. That is wrong. Public servants \nshould not receive financial benefits for the votes they cast or the \nissues they work on. That is why I appreciate the work Senator \nGillibrand, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Collins are doing in this \nlegislation.\n  How many articles do we have to read about the appearance of \nimpropriety on the investment decisions of lawmakers and their staff? \nIn a Washington Post article from June of 2010, Taxpayers for Common \nSense said:\n\n       By being on a committee with a particular jurisdiction, \n     they're in a better position of influencing the performance \n     of their investments, or at least appearing to have that \n     ability.\n\n  I am not saying my colleagues do that. I think perhaps some do. I do \nnot know that, but I do know that the appearance to the public is that \nMembers of the Senate are in a position to enrich themselves on a \nvariety of issues and investments.\n  In a Washington Post article on December 20, the Project on \nGovernment Oversight--this was about a year, 13, 14 months ago, this \narticle--said:\n\n       It's a problem. They will come back and say that it's \n     ludicrous that I would think of my stocks, that they only \n     think about the nation's interests and of their constituents. \n     The problem is, we can't know.\n\n  That is exactly right. We can't know.\n  This is a USA editorial from yesterday:\n\n       If lawmakers were really concerned with ethics, they'd put \n     their equity holdings in blind trusts, so they wouldn't have \n     the obvious conflict of interest that comes from setting the \n     rules for the companies they own.\n       Banking committee members wouldn't invest in financial \n     institutions, armed services committee members wouldn't \n     invest in defense contractors, and energy committee members \n     wouldn't investment in oil companies.\n\n  These stories simply do not reflect well on the world's greatest \ndeliberative body. Most of us think these investments don't affect our \ndecisions. They probably do not. But isn't it time we hold ourselves to \na higher standard?\n  That is what the STOCK Act is all about. The Senate is considering \nthe\n\n[[Page S242]]\n\nSTOCK Act, which clarifies the insider trading laws, that they apply \nthe same way to Members of Congress as they do to people in the rest of \nthe country. But the STOCK Act only deals with insider trading, which \nis very important, but that is only a small part of the problem. \nSenator Merkley and I are proposing the Putting the People's Interests \nFirst Act amendment to the STOCK Act. It would require all Senators and \nsenior staff, probably legislative director, their most senior \nlegislative people--person--and their Chief of Staff, all Senators and \ntheir Chiefs of Staff, all subject to financial disclosure, to sell \nindividual stocks, divest themselves of individual stocks that create \nconflicts or place all of those individual stock investments in blind \ntrusts.\n  No one is required to avoid equities. We can still invest in broad-\nbased mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. We have already had this \nin a limited way. Senate ethics rule 37.7 requires committee staff \nmaking more than $125,000 a year to ``divest himself or herself of any \nsubstantial holdings which may be directly affected by the actions of \nthe committee for which {that person} works'' unless the Ethics \nCommittee approves an alternate arrangement.\n  The Armed Services Committee requires all staff, spouses, and \ndependents to divest themselves of stock in companies doing business \nwith the Department of Defense and Department of Energy. The Committee \ndoes permit the use of blind trusts.\n  In the executive branch, Federal regulations and Federal criminal law \ngenerally prohibit employees, their spouses, and their children from \nowning stock in companies they regulate.\n  All Senator Merkley and I are saying is Members of the Senate should \nhold themselves to the same standard we require of committee staff and \nexecutive branch employees. We tell committee staff and executive \nbranch employees they can't do this. Why should we be allowed to do \nthis? If we think this is a sacrifice--which it is not, ultimately--\nremember that while the median net worth of all Americans dropped 8 \npercent from 2004 to 2010, the median net worth of Members of Congress \njumped 15 percent over that same period. It is not a judgment of my \ncolleagues, simply what we should do, what the public would want us to \ndo.\n  Some argue selling our stock will make us lose touch with the rest of \nsociety. That thinking falls on deaf ears for most Americans. Why \nshould they vote on issues that affect the oil industry when they own \noil stocks? Why should Members of the Senate vote on issues that affect \nhealth care when they own stock in pharmaceutical companies--Big PhRMA \nstocks?\n  Appearance matters. Right now the American people do not trust that \nwe are acting in the Nation's best interests far too often.\n  I will close with this and then turn to Senator Merkley. Public \nservice is a privilege. Folks around Washington are paid pretty well \nfor what we do--are paid very well for what we do. We take these jobs \nseriously. We should take them seriously. We should look at them as the \nprivilege they are to serve in the greatest deliberative body in the \nworld and get to serve my State, 11 million people; the State of \nSenator Gillibrand, 19 million people, something like that; and the \nState of Senator Merkley--millions of people we serve. It is a \nprivilege to do it. There is no reason our colleagues need to be buying \nand selling stocks in multimillion dollar portfolios. When asked about \nthe fact that the Senate Armed Services Committee conflict of interest \nrules apply only to staff and to DOD appointees, President Bush's \nDeputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England said, ``I think Congress \nshould live by the rules they impose on other people.''\n  In the State of the Union Address the President said, ``Let's limit \nany elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact.''\n  Everything we do in this body, almost everything we do--committee \nhearings, floor sessions, calls to agencies--affects businesses and the \nprofits businesses make or do not make. That is why Senator Merkley and \nI are introducing this amendment. It is simple. It is direct. The \npublic should expect nothing else.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise today in support \nof the STOCK Act and in support of amendment No. 1481 that my colleague \nfrom Ohio has put forward to address the fundamental issues of conflict \nof interest that reside here in our body.\n  Let me start with the defining principle; that is, there should not \nbe one set of rules for Members of Congress and a different set of \nrules for ordinary Americans. I think the citizens of the United States \nof America in every State understand that principle. Everyone else in \nthe country has to abide by rules that say they cannot profit in the \nstock market from privileged information. There is no reason those \nrules should not apply to Members of Congress.\n  Indeed, Members of Congress at any given time can hold access to \nimmense amounts of information from previews of economic forecasts, \nfrom advanced knowledge of events affecting major employers in their \nState, to classified defense information that might have implications \nfor, for example, the oil market.\n  Under the right circumstances, all of this information can provide \ninsider knowledge of which ways the markets are likely to move. So I am \ndelighted that this body has voted overwhelmingly to move forward with \nthe STOCK Act. It would make clear that trading on congressional \nknowledge is no more acceptable than any other form of insider trading, \nand it would also make financial disclosures for Members of the Senate \nsearchable online, and that is also very important in the principle of \ntransparency.\n  These are important steps, but they do not go far enough. Let's \nremember that insider trading is extraordinarily difficult to define \nand extraordinarily difficult to prosecute. Where did you get that \ninformation and what truly motivated you to make a particular trade in \na stock? And because of that, when the conflict of interest exists, we \nhave stepped forward to say that this must be addressed. We ask members \nof the executive branch to put aside their individual stocks in \nsituations where the conflict arises. We ask our staff members to set \naside and divest themselves of their stock when a conflict of interest \narises. We applaud the fact that partners in law firms dealing with \ncases set aside and divest themselves of stock when the conflict of \ninterest arises. But somehow we have not seen fit to have the debate \nabout our own activities.\n  My colleague put it very well when he said: Why should we allow \nMembers of Congress to hold oil stocks and then vote on issues \naffecting oil companies? Why should folks be able to invest in \nrenewable energy companies and then fight for tax credits that benefit \nrenewable energy companies? Why should we allow Members to hold stock \nin pharmaceutical companies and then be deciding on issues such as \nwhether we should have competition in the pricing of pharmaceuticals \nfor Medicare? It is a direct conflict of interest.\n  Any Member of this body who says, I never even gave a passing thought \nto the impact on my several-hundred-thousand-dollar investment in X, Y, \nand Z, I must say, well, I honor their thought, but it doesn't address \nthe issue about us as an institution because no one else outside these \nwalls will believe you didn't think a little bit about the impact on \nyour personal financial portfolio when you voted for that tax credit or \nyou voted for that policy that made your investment worth a lot more \nthan it would have been otherwise.\n  The people in America are far ahead of us. During January, I had \nseven townhall meetings in which the STOCK Act came up several times, \nand I asked for feedback. I said: How many folks here believe Congress \nshould live by the same rules of insider trading that everyone else in \nAmerica lives by? And there was not a person who raised their hand in \nsupport of having a separate set of rules for Congress. Then I asked \nthe question: Do you think we should go further? Should Members not be \nallowed to hold individual stocks given that they are making decisions \nthat affect the values of the stock? Again universal support that \nCongress should address this conflict of interest in the same way we \nhave addressed it for the executive branch or for our staff members. So \nthe citizens of this country understand this.\n\n[[Page S243]]\n\n  The amendment that Senator Brown is championing and that I am \npartnering to support has three advantages: It directly prevents \nconflict of interest, and that is a good thing. Second, it eliminates \nthe appearance of impropriety. It gives Americans confidence that we \nare addressing issues not with a thought to our personal financial \nstatus, and that is a good thing. Third, it is very straightforward to \nenforce. It is not like insider trading, which is difficult to define \nand difficult to prosecute. It is very clear-cut. You get rid of your \nindividual stocks and you hold broad mutual funds, you hold your \ninvestments in a blind trust. These are reasonable options. So for \nthese three reasons, the Members of this body should debate this.\n  I know many do not agree. A number have come up to me and said they \nare almost offended by the notion that we would address conflict of \ninterest in this body. I would invite them to come to the floor and \nconverse on this. Yes, it is a longstanding Senate tradition, but there \nhave been a lot of longstanding Senate traditions that didn't work well \nfor the Senate and our place in helping to shape the laws of this \nNation. We have changed many of them, and we should change this.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment Senator Brown has \nput forward, and I applaud him for doing so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would just briefly explain that \nwe narrowed the amendment to only cover those who disclose, which means \npeople pretty much making over $120,000 or so. It conforms with the \ndisclosure requirement under the STOCK Act. Our concern is top staff in \nmajor decisionmaking positions and sitting U.S. Senators. That is our \ntarget, that is our concern, and we wanted to conform it with \nprovisions Senator Gillibrand has put in her legislation subject to the \nSTOCK Act.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

PROHIBITION ON UNAUTHORIZED EARMARKS.\n\n       (a) In General.--It shall not be in order to consider a \n     bill, joint resolution, conference report, or amendment that \n     provides an earmark.\n       (b) Supermajority.--\n       (1) Waiver.--The provisions of subsection (a) may be waived \n     or suspended in the Senate only by the affirmative vote of \n     three-fourths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (2) Appeal.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provision of this section shall be \n     limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the appellant and the manager of the measure. \n     An affirmative vote of three-fourths of the Members of the \n     Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under this section.\n       (c) Earmark Defined.--In this resolution, the term \n     ``earmark'' means a provision or report language included \n     primarily at the request of a Senator or Member of the House \n     of Representatives providing or recommending a specific \n     amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, \n     or other spending authority for a contract, loan, loan \n     guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with \n     or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality, \n     or congressional district unless the provision or language--\n       (1) is specifically authorized by an appropriate \n     congressional authorizing committee of jurisdiction;\n       (2) meets funding eligibility criteria established by an \n     appropriate congressional authorizing committee of \n     jurisdiction by statute; or\n\n[[Page S244]]\n\n       (3) is awarded through a statutory or administrative \n     formula-driven or competitive award process.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, today I understand Senator Toomey is going \nto be offering an amendment that will--it is quite an \noversimplification to state it this way, but it would make permanent \nthe temporary ban on earmarks. I think this is something we have talked \nabout and talked about and talked about on this floor. In fact, the \nlast time we talked about an amendment to put a moratorium on earmarks, \nmy conservative rating of No. 1 in the U.S. Senate moved to No. 20 \nbecause I was telling the truth and not demagoguing an issue.\n  The problem we have is this: When the House of Representatives, first \nof all, came up some time ago--2 years ago--with doing away with \nearmarks, putting a moratorium on earmarks, then they defined what that \nmoratorium was and defined an earmark in a certain House rule. The \nbottom line is this: It said it is any kind of an appropriation or \nauthorization.\n  Now, here is where the problem is. Because everybody is upset with \nthe process that has taken place by Democrats and Republicans on the \nfloor of this Senate--and I will not name names, but I think most of \nthe Members know the ones I am talking about. Many of them are members \nof the Appropriations Committee, where they would sit down during the \ncourse of an appropriations bill, and they would swap out deals, \nfavors, and get things for their State. This is the type of thing that \nis wrong, and it should not take place.\n  But I have to remind my friends here that we have a Constitution for \nthis country. Article I, section 9 of the Constitution makes it very \nclear that we--those of us in this Chamber and in the House Chamber \nacross the hall--have a primary constitutional responsibility; that is, \nto authorize and appropriate. That is what article I, section 9 of the \nConstitution says we are supposed to be doing.\n  If you go back and study what Justice Joseph Story, back in 1833, \ntalked about, he kind of made the interpretation of the intent of the \nConstitution so far as what our duties and the President's are. He said \nvery clearly that we are doing this because if the President has the \npower to do the appropriating--or if you want to call it earmarks, you \ncan call it earmarks--appropriating or authorization, that is too much \npower in the hands of one person. So he is very specific that our \nFounding Fathers wanted to make sure the President does not do this.\n  So what happens today? Today we get a budget from the President, \nwhich is taking place right now as we speak. I could talk about this, \nall the deficits in the budget and all that, but that is not my purpose \nfor being here. My purpose for being here is to articulate how things \nare working today and how they have worked up until the moratorium \nlanguage came into effect.\n  The President sends a budget to Congress. Then that is supposed to go \nto authorizing committees. I am on two authorizing committees--one is \nEnvironment and Public Works, one is the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. The Senate Armed Services Committee is staffed with experts \nin areas of missile defense, in areas of national defense, in areas of \nstrike vehicles, in areas of lift capacity--all the areas that are in \nhis budget in every area of national defense. But here is the thing: \nThese are experts, so they advise us as we have our meetings and we are \ndrafting in the Senate Armed Services Committee--SASC--the defense \nauthorization bill, the NDAA, as we did just a few months ago. We come \nup with how we think we should be spending the money to defend America \nwithin the parameters of the President's budget.\n  I will give you an example. A couple years ago, before there was any \ndiscussion on the moratorium, the President had in his budget $330 \nmillion to go to a launching system. It was called a bucket of rockets. \nIt was a good system, something we need, something that would be very \nhelpful to have. But with the limited resources we have and the fact \nthat we were fighting a war on two fronts at that time, we made a \ndetermination in the Senate Armed Services Committee that $330 million \nwould be better spent if we bought six new F-18E/F models. Those are \nstrike vehicles. One of reasons for that was the President in his \nbudget did away with the only fifth-generation fighter we had, the F-\n22. That was back in his first budget, and he is talking about delaying \nthe F-35, the Joint Strike Fighter, which is going to be necessary to \nhave.\n  So we made that decision, and that was made by a majority of the \nmembers of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It had nothing to do \nwith whose home State makes the F-18. None of that made any difference. \nIt was just that we could do a lot more to defend America by having six \nnew F-18s than we could by having the launching system called a bucket \nof rockets. Now, if you do that today, that is an earmark, to say: \nWell, no, that was not in the President's budget.\n  I have to remind everyone, it does not matter whether the President \nof the United States is a Democrat or Republican; the President is the \nguy who designs the budget. A lot of people do not know that. It is not \nthe Democrats, not the Republicans, not the House, not the Senate. It \nis the President. When he designs this budget, he makes the \ndetermination as to how he thinks everything should be spent. If we say \nwe cannot do authorization and appropriation, then that would be called \nan earmark, and there is a ban on earmarks.\n  The reason I have kind of walked around the barn a long way on this \nissue is that I have an amendment, the amendment I have just now \nbrought up for consideration, amendment No. 1500. What that does is it \nmerely defines an earmark as an appropriation that has not been \nauthorized. I just described the authorization process. If we go \nthrough that, then there are not going to be any earmarks in the way \nmost people think of earmarks, but we will be doing our duty.\n  I feel very confident we are going to be able to get this passed. \nSeveral of the individuals here very responsibly have talked about this \nissue. For example, Senator Toomey said yesterday on the floor that \nsome earmarks ``ought to be funded. But they ought to be funded in a \ntransparent and honest way, subject to evaluation by an authorizing \ncommittee.'' So here is the author of the ban on earmarks agreeing that \nif we go through an authorization process, it is all right to fulfill \nour constitutional function of appropriating and authorizing.\n  Senator Coburn, my junior Senator, said:\n\n       It is not wrong to go through an authorization process \n     where your colleagues can actually see it. It is wrong to \n     hide something in a bill. . . .\n\n  Agreed. We all agree on that. That was a year ago when he made that \nstatement.\n  Senator McCain--by the way, I introduced this amendment in bill form \nlast year. He was my cosponsor. We introduced it together. That was \nmerely changing the definition of an earmark to be an appropriation or \nspending that has not been authorized.\n  Senator McCain said:\n\n       Some of those earmarks are worthy. If they are worthy, then \n     they should be authorized.\n\n  That is the whole issue. I can understand some Democrats wanting to \ndo away with congressional earmarks because if they do that, it goes \nright back to Obama. If I were in a position where I felt President \nObama or any other President could do a better job of appropriating \nmoney, that would be another motivation to do this. But for responsible \nconservatives who believe in what the Constitution says, this is a very \neasy solution to the problem.\n  The amendment will be brought up. I do not know when yet. I suppose I \ncould find out just what our timing is going to be. But the amendment I \nhave offered simply bans any congressional earmark that is not first \nauthorized.\n  If we do this, instead of an outright ban, it will preserve our \nability to keep the President's power in check. I would hope that many \nof my colleagues go back and read what our Founding Fathers had in mind \nwhen they talked about article I of the Constitution. I think they \nwould find that they made it very clear we want to have a separation of \nthose powers so we do not have either the House or the Senate or the \nPresidency doing everything. Instead, we should follow the \nConstitution.\n  So that is what my amendment is all about. I will be looking forward \nto bringing it up. I think it probably will be considered today. I look \nforward to that.\n\n[[Page S245]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, we have an incredibly important \nopportunity to do something so basic, so commonsense to begin restoring \nthe faith and trust that the American people have in this institution. \nWe have a responsibility to do it right, to show without question, \nwithout any ambiguity, that all Members of Congress, their staffs, and \nFederal employees play by the exact same rules as everyday Americans.\n  The American people deserve to know their lawmakers' only interest is \nin what is best for the country, not their financial interest. Members \nof Congress, their families, their staffs, and Federal employees should \nnot be able to gain any personal profit from information they have \naccess to that ordinary Americans do not--whether it is trading stock \nor making inside real estate deals. It is simply not right. Nobody \nshould be above the rules.\n  The commonsense bill before us would finally codify this principle \ninto law, as it should be. Chairman Lieberman, Ranking Member Collins, \nSenator Brown of Massachusetts, and their committee members and staffs \nhave crafted a very strong bipartisan bill with teeth that is narrowly \ntailored and targeted to ensure that we achieve this very common goal. \nBecause of this bipartisan work, last night this Chamber came together \nin what has become nearly an unprecedented fashion these days and voted \nalmost unanimously to begin debate on this sorely needed legislation. \nAs we continue to debate, I urge my colleagues to focus on the specific \ntask at hand. Let's show the American people we can come together and \nget this done to begin to restore their trust in us.\n  If there are ideas to make the bill stronger, let's debate them. But \nlet's not get bogged down in the politics as usual, with nongermane \nside issues that will prevent us from swiftly moving on an up-or-down \nvote the American people expect of us. We are already starting in a \nstrong position with our colleagues in the House.\n  This STOCK Act legislation is very similar to legislation introduced \nby my colleague in the New York delegation, Congresswoman Louise \nSlaughter, and Congressman Tim Walz. I thank them for their \nlongstanding advocacy and focus and leadership on this important issue.\n  Our bill, which has received the support of at least seven good \ngovernment groups, covers several very important principles. First, \nMembers of Congress, their families, their staffs, and Federal \nemployees should be barred from gaining any personal profit on the \nbasis of knowledge gained through their congressional service or from \nusing knowledge to tip off anyone else.\n  This bill will, for the first time, establish a clear fiduciary \nresponsibility to the people we serve. This simple step removes any \npresent doubts as to whether the SEC and the CFTC are empowered to \ninvestigate and prosecute cases involving insider trading of securities \nfrom using this nonpublic information. It also provides additional \nteeth. Such acts would also be in violation of Congress's own rules, to \nmake it clear that this activity is inappropriate and subjects Members \nto additional disciplinary measures by this very body.\n  Second, Members should be required to disclose major transactions \nwithin 30 days to make this information available online for their \nconstituents to see, providing dramatically improved oversight and \naccountability. We should be able to agree that these reports should be \navailable in the light of day and not stored in some dusty back room.\n  The committee heard experts testifying during a Senate hearing that \nreducing this new reporting requirement to 90 days was not good enough. \nThe committee listened to these experts carefully, and the bill has \nbeen strengthened and currently has a 30-day proposal, a sea change of \nimprovement from the current reporting requirement of a yearly \nreporting requirement on a paper document.\n  Some critics say this bill is unnecessary and is already covered \nunder current statutes. I have spoken with experts tasked in the past \nwith investigations of this nature, and they strongly disagree. We must \nmake it clear as day and unambiguous that this kind of behavior is \nillegal.\n  President Obama told us in the State of the Union to send him a bill, \nand he will sign it right away. We should not delay. This is the time \nto act. Let's show people who send us here that we can come together \nand do the right thing. Let's show them we know they deserve a \ngovernment that is worthy of them. We have an opportunity to take a \nstep toward restoring some of the faith that has been lost in \nWashington and in this institution. I urge my colleagues to seize this \nopportunity.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1489 to Amendment No. 1470\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I call up amendment No. 1489 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself and \n     Mr. Isakson, proposes an amendment numbered 1489 to amendment \n     No. 1470:\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SECTION 9. REQUIRING MORTGAGE DISCLOSURE.\n\n       Section 102(a)(4)(A) of the Ethics in Government Act of \n     1978 (5 U.S.C. App) is amended by inserting after ``spouse'' \n     the following: ``, except that this exception shall not apply \n     to a reporting individual described in section 101(f)(9)''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am sure, listening to that, it is hard to understand \nexactly what this is all about, so let me take a moment.\n  I want to first thank Senators Lieberman and Collins for all their \nhard work and I want to thank Senator Gillibrand for writing the STOCK \nAct.\n  I come to the floor as the chairman of the Ethics Committee with an \namendment that we wrote together, Senator Isakson and I, who is the \nvice chair of the committee. So this is quite a bipartisan amendment \nand I don't think it should be controversial or troublesome in any way.\n  This amendment actually comes from a bill that Senator Isakson and I \nwrote together after the Countrywide fiasco. If you want to recollect \nthat unhappy issue, it was a situation where Countrywide had set up a \nVIP program and they literally targeted Members of Congress of the \nHouse and Senate to put them into this program and never told the \nMembers of Congress that there was this program, and yet it went \nforward. And because there is no rule that personal mortgages be shown \non the disclosure form, this was quite a shock when it all came out. \nWhat we are saying is we want to improve the disclosure requirement on \nhome mortgages.\n  Right now, if it is at your own personal home, you don't have to show \nthe mortgage, and this would correct that. It would mean that you have \nto show the date the mortgage was entered, the balance, and a range, \nthe interest rate, the terms, the name and address of the creditor. So \nit is an omission--but actually it is a pretty glaring omission--in our \nfinancial disclosure requirements because, again, of the Countrywide \nexample. We don't want to have a situation--because we are not allowed \nto get better treatment than anyone else. And the fact that we didn't \ndisclose these mortgages--it was quite a story when it came to light \nthat there was this special VIP program at Countrywide. So this \nlegislation, this amendment, addresses this omission. It requires \nMembers of Congress to make a full and complete disclosure of all the \nmortgages on their personal residences.\n\n[[Page S246]]\n\n  Again, right now this requirement is in place for mortgages that you \nmay have on investment properties but not on your personal properties. \nIt would include Members of Congress and their spouses as well.\n  In his State of the Union Address, the President spoke about the \ndeficit of trust between Washington and the rest of the country. I \ndon't know that this amendment is going to cure all those problems, but \nI do think it shows that we are ready to learn from a bad experience, \nwhich was the Countrywide experience. So I think the Boxer-Isakson \namendment and the underlying bill are sensible steps toward rebuilding \nour Nation's faith in government.\n  Again, the rules are already clear that we are not permitted to get \nany financial arrangements that are better than they are for any other \nconstituent, so I think by this disclosure we are saying that even in \nour own personal mortgages we have to be aware of this. I think this \nlisting is called for, and I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment and the underlying legislation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on the \namendment that has been proposed by the Senator from California to the \nlegislation written by Senator Brown. Senator Gillibrand has a similar \nbill as well, and I want to explain to our colleagues what the state of \nthe current law is, which I think would be helpful.\n  Under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, there is an exemption \nfrom disclosure for mortgages secured by real property that are the \npersonal residence of the reporting individual or his spouse.\n  Under the liabilities section of that same report, which we now file \nannually, liabilities in excess of $10,000 must be reported that are \nowed by the Member, the spouse, or the dependent child to any one \ncreditor during any time during the reporting period. Credit card \ndebts, for example, are reported. Other kinds of loans are reported. \nMortgages held on investment properties--properties, for example, that \nare rented--are reported. The exemption only goes to the personal \nresidence of the Member and/or the Member's spouse.\n  I am unclear, and need to get clarification from Senator Boxer and \nalso the Office of Government Ethics, whether her amendment would \nextend the new disclosure requirement that she is proposing to \nexecutive branch employees or whether it would only apply to the \nlegislative branch. As I read her amendment, it looks as though it only \napplies to the legislative branch and perhaps only to Members.\n  I would ask, through the Chair, if the Senator from California could \nclarify for me--this is truly an informational question--whether she is \nintending this new requirement to apply to congressional staff and \nwhether she is intending this new requirement to apply to executive \nbranch members who are currently required to file an annual financial \ndisclosure form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I very much thank Senator Collins for that question.\n  Senator Isakson and I, as the chair and vice chair of the Ethics \nCommittee, are applying this to the Members of Congress. That is \nbecause the scandal that took place with Countrywide involved the \nMembers of Congress. We are not including staff in this. It also \napplies to more than one residence, because some of our Members have \nseven homes, six homes, four homes, two homes. If you have mortgages on \nany of those properties, you would now have to disclose those.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nclarifying that issue and answering my question.\n  I guess my further question would be, why would we only apply it to \nMembers of Congress and not apply it to members of the executive \nbranch? For example, I would argue that if there are conflict of \ninterest issues or allegations of a sweetheart deal for mortgages that \nmight be revealed by this disclosure, that that would apply equally to, \nsay, Treasury officials--in fact, even more so to Treasury officials or \nbank regulators--as it would Members of Congress.\n  I wonder if the Senator's intent is to make sure that Members are not \ngetting sweetheart deals on their mortgages--which obviously no Member \nshould be receiving a sweetheart deal on a mortgage--why that same \nlogic would not apply to executive branch officials, particularly since \narguably they have far more direct influence and jurisdiction and \nregulatory authority over financial institutions than do Members of \nCongress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would be happy to go on as a cosponsor \nto Senator Collins if she wants to take on the additional burden of \nmoving this idea forward. I don't have any problem with it.\n  The point is, I am here--and I have been very open about it because I \nknow what I am talking about when it comes to Members of Congress, \nbecause as chair of the Ethics Committee, I don't oversee Treasury. \nThis is not my role, this is not my expertise, and I am very humble \nabout that. I did see what happened here, along with, I would say, \nevery member of the Ethics Committee and Senator Isakson.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment and we know what we are talking about, \nand we are saying there was a problem and Members of Congress were \ncourted by Countrywide. Did they court other people? I don't know. But \nif there is some proof that they did and there is need to go and cover \nthem with a similar amendment, I would be happy to work with my \ncolleague on that. But I am not going to change this particular piece \nof legislation, because I know what I am talking about here. I know how \nto fix this. I know we have made a big mistake, and I feel it is our \njob to clean up our own business. And our own business, when it comes \nto this, is not good.\n  Would I wish to look over at what the Bush administration did or what \nthe Obama administration is doing or what other administrations will \ndo? I am happy to do that. But I am here to address our house--our \nhouse. Clean it up. Act as a role model.\n\n  I do not have any problem with supporting another piece of \nlegislation. Maybe there is a problem over there. I, frankly, do not \nknow what their ethics rules are. I know what our ethics rules are, and \nI know we have made a glaring omission when Members may have three, \nfour, five, six, seven houses; they may have two, three, four, five, \nsix mortgages and they never have to show them. Let's clean it up.\n  If my friend believes there is need for another amendment, I am happy \nto look at it. But Senator Isakson and I are doing something we have \nlong wanted to do. This is not something we just made up. We have had a \nbill for a long time doing exactly this. This is a moment we would like \nto get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the reason I am raising this issue--I \nrealize the Senator from California has not had the misfortune I have \nhad, of being constantly on the floor listening to the debate on this \nbill--but a major issue we have been grappling with is parity in the \nrules. This issue has not just come up with regard to the amendment of \nthe Senator from California, it has come up over and over.\n  I am not in any way singling out the Senator from California to raise \nthis issue. This has come up on every single issue we have been \ntackling on the floor, which is, if we are going to have more \ndisclosure for the legislative branch, should we not have the exact \nsame or comparable disclosures for high-ranking executive branch \nofficials?\n  The issue I raised, I wish to assure the Senator from California, is \nno means unique to her amendment. It has come up over and over and, \nindeed, the first amendment that we were supposed to have voted on last \nnight was an amendment by Senator Paul, making clear that this bill \napplied to the\n\n[[Page S247]]\n\nexecutive branch and then Senator Shelby had an amendment to make sure \nthere was online disclosure by the executive branch.\n  This is an issue that has permeated the entire debate on the STOCK \nAct. It is not unique to the issue that has been raised by the Senator \nfrom California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague for that because it was a little \nsurprising. My understanding, and I hope to stand corrected by the \nSenator from Maine, if I am wrong, and the Senator from New York, that \nthe whole idea behind the STOCK Act, the bill written by Senator \nGillibrand and the bill written by Senator Brown, did not deal with the \nexecutive branch. I thought the whole notion behind this was for us to \nclean up our act. Clean up our act over here. That is the best way to \nproceed.\n  I have no problem if my colleague wants to write an amendment, she \nherself, on this particular issue. If she can make the case that it has \nbeen shown that VIP loans were given to members of the executive \nbranch--whether under George Bush or Barack Obama--and I think in the \nyears she is looking at it would have been under Bush, but those are \nthe years the Countrywide scandal took place--if my friend has absolute \ninformation for me that shows that members of the Bush administration \nor the Obama administration got special treatment from the Countrywide \nscandal, I would like to know about it. I do not know anything about \nthat at this time.\n  If my friend believes it would be a good thing to do, to offer a \nseparate amendment covering certain members of the executive branch, I \nam happy to look at it. But it strikes me as bizarre that this has \nbecome an issue. It sounds like what is going on from the Republican \nside is all of a sudden they want to turn attention over to the \nexecutive branch rather than focus it on us--which I think is critical. \nBut I am happy to look at any amendment that deals with abuses the \nSenator can show me were occurring over on the executive branch side \nduring those years that Countrywide was doing its damage. I would be \nhappy to support an amendment. But I think we should keep this \namendment clean. I think this amendment should be clean because we are \nlooking at a particular ethics rule and we are essentially cutting out \na loophole which has allowed colleagues to not have to list their \npersonal residences when, in fact, we know some of them got special \ntreatment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, let me make the point to the \nSenator from California, I am a cosponsor of the STOCK Act. I \ncosponsored Senator Brown's bill, so it is not that I do not think \nlegislation is needed in this area. I am a cosponsor on this bill and \nhave commended him for his work. But the fact remains that in our \ncommittee markup the bill was changed.\n  I know the Senator was distracted when I answered that question. The \nbill was changed in committee to extend to the executive branch. It is \nin the bill that is before us now. The Senator was misinformed in that \nregard. The bill was changed to make very clear that the insider \ntrading prohibition applied to the executive branch and that executive \nbranch members have a duty to their agencies, to the government. We \nmake that explicit. That was changed in committee.\n  The Senator is not correct that the bill that was brought to the \nfloor only applied to Congress. It does not. It applies to the \nexecutive branch.\n  The second point I will make is this is not a partisan issue. We have \nbills on both sides of the aisle. We have amendments on both sides of \nthe aisle. Indeed, we have disclosure amendments that apply to the \nexecutive branch coming from both sides of the aisle. Senator Wyden has \na disclosure amendment that is similar to that of Senator Shelby's. We \nare working with both of those offices right now to try to work those \nout.\n  I do not know how this all of a sudden became a partisan debate or a \ndebate about the Bush administration or anything. This is a debate \nabout good government and how we can best assure the American people \nthat, regardless of whether public officials are in the executive \nbranch or the legislative branch, they are putting the public's \ninterests ahead of their private interests and that they are not \nprofiting from insider information, nonpublic information that is not \navailable to the public which they are using inappropriately--if, in \nfact, that is even happening--for personal gain.\n  I did wish to clarify that the bill, as reported from committee, does \napply to the executive branch as well as the legislative branch, that \nthe statement made by the Senator was inaccurate in that regard, and \nthat we have amendments on both sides of the aisle that we are working \non right now to extend the disclosure requirements, the reporting \nrequirements to the executive branch. Those are amendments coming from \nboth Democrats and Republicans.\n  I would like to yield at this point to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I can respond?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine has the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator can't yield--I would like to have the floor \nnow. She can't yield to another colleague except if it is for a \nquestion. I would like to have the floor since the Senator just said I \nwas incorrect. I would like to correct her, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What I said was, when these bills were introduced, they \nwere directed at the Congress. That is what I said. I talked about the \nbills. I did not talk about what went on amending them, et cetera. I \nwill repeat what I said was accurate. Both Mr. Brown's bill and Mrs. \nGillibrand's bill were, in fact, talking about the Congress.\n  What I would also like to say is if my colleague wants \nbipartisanship, she should be happy with this amendment since it is \ncoming from Senators Boxer and Isakson, the chairman and the vice \nchairman of the Ethics Committee.\n  We did not investigate the executive branch and Countrywide's going \nafter the people in the Bush administration and the Obama \nadministration. We do not have that information. If she has information \nthat shows there have been sweetheart deals over there, I certainly \nwant to know about it. As I said, if my colleague wants to offer a \nfirst-degree amendment that broadens this, I am happy to look at it. \nBecause if it can be shown to me that there have been abuses over \nthere, from the mortgage companies going after these folks over there, \nI am happy to agree to that. I would have to take it to Senator Isakson \nbecause he is, in fact, the coauthor. Also, I have to point out that \nthis same amendment I offered was put forward in a bill by Senator \nCornyn in 2008. So there is a lot of interest on this.\n  I am a person who likes to know what I am talking about. I try very \nhard. I do not know if there has been abuse from the mortgage companies \nover to the executive branch. But I know for sure there has been a big \nproblem here with colleagues getting sweetheart deals. I want to put an \nend to it.\n  If my colleague wants to strengthen my amendment, she can offer a \nsecond-degree amendment. If she can prove to me that there has been \nabuse and there has been a problem and there is not enough protection, \nI am happy to support it. But I guess I am a little taken aback as I \ncome here in a bipartisan spirit to offer a bipartisan amendment, I \nhave kind of been the subject of some weird sort of attack for not \ngoing far enough with my amendment. I find it bizarre, to be totally \nfrank, and I will continue to stay on the floor until I understand what \nthis is all about. Maybe I have nothing to do with it. If I said \nsomething wrong, I would like to know what it is. But I am offering, in \ngood faith, a bipartisan amendment that is a no-brainer, that comes \nstraight out of the Countrywide scandal that we studied in a bipartisan \nway, in Congress, and we are moving to correct the problems we know \nexist.\n  If there are more problems out there and if my friend has proof of \nthat, if she can prove it to us, I am happy to support a first-degree \namendment to this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I do not know why the Senator from \nCalifornia, first of all, is assuming I am somehow\n\n[[Page S248]]\n\nopposed to her amendment. I have not said that. What I raised was a \nvery legitimate question of asking whether she had considered extending \nit to the executive branch.\n  Then her response seems to be an attack; that if I have information \nthat there are problems and sweetheart deals in the executive branch, I \nshould prove them.\n  I am not making allegations. I do not make unsubstantiated \nallegations against individuals. What I was trying to tell the Senator \nfrom California is that the issue of the scope and applicability of \nthis bill has come up over and over. It came up in committee. We \nchanged the bill in committee to make it clear that the prohibition \nagainst insider trading and a duty applied to the executive branch as \nwell as to the legislative branch.\n  I have not criticized her amendment in any way. I asked a series of \nquestions about the scope of her amendment because this issue has come \nup repeatedly, on both sides of the aisle. It came up in committee \nduring our markup. It has come up on the Senate floor repeatedly as far \nas what the disclosure requirements should be and to whom they should \napply.\n  I am the one who is baffled by the response of the Senator from \nCalifornia, since I have not indicated any opposition whatsoever to her \namendment.\n  I have merely brought up the fact that the issue of the scope of this \nbill has come up repeatedly, so I was curious why she chose to have \nsuch a narrow bill rather than applying it to executive branch \nofficials who filed the same kinds of disclosure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Ms. BOXER. Mr. President, we can go back and forth 100 ways to \nSunday. I thought I explained exactly why Senator Isakson and I have a \nnarrow bill. We are trying to fix a problem we know exists. We feel \nvery strongly that for the good of the Senate, in particular--because \nthis is the body we serve in. We love it. We want to make it strong and \nappreciated and not derided. We had a scandal that touched this body \nand we had a thorough investigation. It took a long time to get to the \nbottom of it. We uncovered the fact that Countrywide had a sweetheart \ndeal and they were aiming it at Members of Congress.\n  We have crafted this amendment to respond to what we know is a \nproblem. I am not in the business of coming down here and legislating \non things that I might guess are a problem or, gee, maybe I can throw \nout a fishing net and catch everybody in it. If there is a problem \nelsewhere, I am happy to support my colleague if she would like to \nbroaden this. I am not against it. I am saying for me and Senator \nIsakson, we have offered an amendment that cures a very simple problem; \nthat ethics rules, as they are today, allow Senators and Members of \nCongress to avoid showing the mortgages they hold on personal \nresidences. If the same thing exists in the executive branch, I don't \nknow about that. I am dealing with an amendment here and so is Senator \nIsakson, that we know about.\n  If the Senator asks again why our amendment is narrow, let me again \nanswer it in another way: We are curing a narrow problem but a problem \nthat exists. We are not throwing out some big fishing net to catch \neverybody in it whom we don't know about. We think this will make the \nCongress a better place. We do. Because there are Members who have two, \nthree, four, and five homes. They may have two, three, four, and five \nmortgages, and we think it is important for the public to know that.\n  But, again, I hope my colleague from Maine supports this. I don't \nknow if she does.\n  She doesn't oppose it. That is a good start. I hope she supports it. \nIf she feels she can make it stronger, she should offer a first-degree \namendment, let me take a look at it, let me see whether it is \nnecessary, and let me see whether there is reason to do it. I can \nsurely tell her I am very open to broadening it, but the reason it is \ncrafted the way it is is that it is dealing with a problem we are not \nguessing exists; we know it exists where there have been abuses before \nand we are trying to cure that problem.\n  I thank the Senator for her patience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I enjoyed that back and \nforth debate very much. I appreciate the spirit in which that amendment \nwas offered. I wrote the original bill. It was my bill and Senator \nGillibrand then filed a bill. We went through the committee process, \nand the original intent of the bill was to deal with insider trading. \nIt applied to all Federal employees, not just congressional, so it is \nan insider trading bill.\n  The spirit of what we have been trying to do over the last day and a \nhalf is to address issues equally so as to eliminate all appearances of \nimpropriety and for any branch of government to not play by the same \nrules as the American people would play by. So every single amendment \nthat has come through this Chamber right now has not only been expanded \nto cover, obviously, those in the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives but also equally to the executive branch.\n  So if this amendment is going to have any chance of passing, I can \nassure you I will not support it unless it specifically also applies to \nthe executive branch. If she wants to amend it or modify it to include \nthat, then it will have a good chance of passing; if not, I will do my \nbest to prohibit it because it needs to be applied to everybody. For us \nto come and say we need to come up with proof that somebody is doing \nsomething or not doing something--listen, it is no different than what \nwe are trying to do on the insider trading bill. There is no one who \nhas been brought to court and found criminally responsible. We are \ndealing on inference and reference and innuendo. That is why we are \ntrying to reestablish the trust with the American people to do \nsomething that would not traditionally have been done but not for a 60-\nminute speech. So if we knew something was happening in the mortgage \nindustry, great, let's let it apply across the board and not exclude a \ngroup of Federal employees for some particular political reason.\n  Once again, if she wants to amend it, great. If not, I am going to do \nmy best to make it amended so we can have it apply equally if we are \ngoing to ultimately take it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Thank you, Mr. President. I also enjoyed this debate. I \nagree with Senator Brown. It is a form they already fill out now. We \njust have to add one other line. It is not complicated. I think it is a \ngood idea. I will leave it at that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business about the STOP \nAct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Begich pertaining to the introduction of S. 2054 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BEGICH.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To require Senate candidates to file designations, \n              statements, and reports in electronic form)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FILING BY SENATE CANDIDATES WITH COMMISSION.\n\n       Section 302(g) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 \n     (2 U.S.C. 432(g)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(g) Filing With the Commission.--All designations, \n     statements, and reports required to be filed under this Act \n     shall be filed with the Commission.''.\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to be \nrecognized to speak on this amendment for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment with \nSenator Cochran and ask unanimous consent that he be added as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. This is a straightforward amendment. It simply requires \ncandidates for the Senate, both challengers and incumbents, file their \nquarterly campaign finance reports electronically. Anyone seeking the \nPresidency or a spot in the U.S. House of Representatives is required \nto submit campaign finance records electronically right now, but \nSenators or would-be Senators are not. It makes no sense.\n  Right now, Senate candidates drop off a hard copy of their filing \nreport with the Secretary of the Senate. Someone from the FEC comes \nover and then takes the reports over to the FEC to make copies, and \nthen, finally, the copies are put online.\n  These documents often run hundreds of pages in length. The FEC \nestimates it wastes about $250,000 of taxpayer money each year just to \nmake those copies and put them online. Now, that might not sound like a \nlot of money in Washington, DC, but the idea of spending $1/4 million \non an outdated process represents what is wrong with Washington, DC.\n\n  Americans deserve to know how much money candidates raise and from \nwhom, and they deserve to be able to access that information in real \ntime.\n  It is not just the cost of the current process that folks should be \nangry about. The process of making copies and posting the documents \nonline takes weeks. That is not just a waste of time, it is bad for the \ndemocratic process.\n  Campaign finance data filed right before a general election is not \navailable to the public until the following February, long after the \nelection has already taken place.\n  Since the Citizens United ruling, folks aren't able to tell who is \nfunding third-party advertisements. It is hard enough to know who is \nspending the money on third-party advertisements. The least we can do \nis to make sure that folks have better access to the information about \nwho is giving to the candidates.\n  My bill from the last Congress had strong bipartisan support--14 \nDemocrats, 6 Republicans, and 5 of the cosponsors are members of the \nHomeland Security Committee. I especially appreciate, and I wish to \nthank, the Republican manager of the STOCK Act, Senator Collins, for \nbeing a supporter of that original bill.\n  We have an opportunity to do something that cuts government spending \nand adds more transparency and accountability to the elections process. \nI urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S250]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, \nproductive work is going on to try to reach a final list of amendments \nfor the STOCK Act and to have an agreement which will come up for a \nvote, and to have that obviously by a bipartisan agreement. We are \nmaking progress. I hope we can continue to do that.\n\n\n                            Order for Recess\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess from 4 to 5 p.m. so \nthat all Senators can attend a classified briefing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I do week after \nweek, as a physician who practiced medicine in Wyoming for a quarter of \na century to give a doctor's second opinion about the health care law.\n  I was thinking last week, while sitting in the House Chamber when the \nPresident was giving his State of the Union Address, about something he \nsaid. He said:\n\n       We will not go back to an economy weakened by outsourcing, \n     bad debt, and phony financial profits.\n\n  Repeating, he promised not to go back to an economy weakened by phony \nfinancial profits. That is why today, in the next hour or so, the House \nof Representatives will answer the President's call. They will agree. \nThey will vote to repeal the CLASS Act--a program that is the perfect \nexample of phony financial profits.\n  Let me explain further. President Obama's health care law established \nthe CLASS Act--a brandnew Federal long-term care entitlement program. \nCLASS pays a stipend to individuals enrolled when they are unable to \nperform daily living activities, such as dressing, bathing, and eating. \nThe issue is that to qualify for the CLASS benefit, an individual would \nhave to pay a monthly premium for 5 years before the Federal Government \nstarts to pay out any benefits. Well, that sounds great, but not so \nfast. It turns out that the math for the program doesn't add up and it \nwill not work.\n  The worst part about it is that the administration has known from the \nvery beginning that this CLASS Program--and the President's entire \nhealth care law--was built on phony financial profits. Specifically, \nthe Obama administration hid behind a Congressional Budget Office \nestimate showing that this program would reduce the deficit by $70 \nbillion over a 10-year period. These savings are entirely mythical, and \nthey come from premiums collected over the first 5 years. During that \ntime, the program isn't required or even allowed to pay out individual \nbenefits. Over its first 10 years, this program, the Congressional \nBudget Office estimated, would collect $83 billion in premiums but \nwould only pay out $13 billion in benefits. But then instead of holding \non to the $70 billion in excess premiums collected to pay out future \nexpenses, the Washington Democrats used it as an accounting gimmick, a \nbudgetary trick to pay for the President's health care law. Adding \ninsult to injury, Washington Democrats then tried to claim that the \nsame $70 billion could also be used to pay down the deficit. Talk about \nphony financial profits. This is the very practice used by the \nPresident that the President now objects to.\n  The good news is that the administration finally admitted late last \nyear that the CLASS Act was a complete failure and they could not make \nit work. The bad news is that the phony financial profits continue.\n  Just because the program won't go forward doesn't mean that the costs \nof the President's health care law don't go forward, because they do. \nNow the American people are stuck with the bill, and it is a much more \nexpensive bill than the one they had been promised and the one they had \nexpected. In fact, just yesterday, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice reported that the health care law is now likely to cost $54 \nbillion more than expected between 2012 and 2021.\n  As Politico says:\n\n       The big change that makes the law more expensive is the \n     Obama administration's decision not to implement the CLASS \n     Act, which means the government will not collect $76 billion \n     in premiums over the next 10 years.\n\n  I applaud the House for taking the lead and voting to repeal the \nCLASS Act. I call on President Obama and my colleagues in the Senate to \ndo exactly the same. Senate majority leader Harry Reid should bring \nH.R. 1173, the Fiscal Responsibility and Retirement Security Act, to \nthe Senate floor for a vote. This bill will repeal the CLASS Act so \nthat the American people have a clear understanding of the cost of the \nPresident's health care law.\n  It is time to end the phony financial profits in the President's \nhealth care law that continue to burden our economy and our Nation. It \nis time to finally find out if the President truly does believe in \nfairness because if he does, he will repeal the CLASS Act and make it \nclear that he has the same accounting standards for Washington as he \nhas for the private sector. Washington should not be able to cook the \nbooks and to make the President's health care law look more financially \nsound than it really is.\n  The American people are sick of phony financial profits, and they are \ndemanding fairness in the public sector as well as the private sector. \nThat is why I will continue to come to the floor and fight each and \nevery day to repeal and replace the President's broken health care \nlaw--replace it with a patient-centered plan, a plan that allows \nAmericans to get the care they need from a doctor they want at a price \nthey can afford.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we start Black History Month, I rise to \ndiscuss a national hero I have spoken about many times on the Senate \nfloor. With this year's Black History Month focused on African-American \nwomen, it is all the more appropriate for me to talk about Maryland's \nHarriet Ross Tubman and her dedication to justice, equality, and \nservice to this country.\n  In my career, I have spoken on the Senate floor, at events in \nMaryland, in meetings with constituents, and with my colleagues about \nHarriet Tubman's legacy. While I hope each opportunity I have taken to \ndiscuss the life of this remarkable woman helps raise the\n\n[[Page S251]]\n\nawareness about her importance to the history of our great Nation, my \nultimate goal is to properly commemorate her life and her work by \nestablishing the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National \nHistorical Park on the eastern shore of Maryland, and, in working with \nmy colleagues from New York, to establish the Harriet Tubman National \nHistorical Park in Auburn, NY.\n  A year ago this week, I reintroduced the Harriet Tubman National \nHistorical Park and the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National \nHistorical Park Act with Senators Schumer, Mikulski, and Gillibrand as \noriginal cosponsors. I am happy to say since that time the Senate \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committees held a positive hearing on the \nbill, the Energy Committee favorably reported the bill, and it has been \nplaced on the Senate calendar. I thank my colleagues on the committee \nfor their support, particularly Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member \nMurkowski, and the chairman of the National Park Subcommittee, Senator \nUdall of Colorado.\n  The establishment of the Harriet Tubman Historical Park has been \nyears in the making and is long overdue. The mission of the National \nPark Service has evolved over time, from preserving our natural wonders \nacross the United States for recreational purposes to commemorating \nunique places of significance to historical events and extraordinary \nAmericans who have shaped our Nation.\n  The woman who is known to us as Harriet Tubman was born in \napproximately 1822 in Dorchester County, MD, and given the name \nAraminta--Minty--Ross. She spent nearly 30 years of her life in slavery \non Maryland's eastern shore. She worked on a number of different \nplantations on Maryland's eastern shore, and as a teenager she was \ntrained to be a seamstress. As an adult, she took the first name \nHarriet, and when she was 25 years old she married John Tubman.\n  In her late twenties, Harriet Tubman escaped from slavery in 1849. \nShe fled in the dead of night, navigating the maze of tidal streams and \nwetlands that to this day comprise the eastern shore's landscape. She \ndid this alone, exercising incredible courage and strength.\n  Not satisfied with attaining her own freedom, she returned repeatedly \nfor more than 10 years to the places of her enslavement in Dorchester \nand Caroline Counties, where under the most adverse conditions she led \naway many family members and other slaves to freedom in the \nNortheastern United States.\n  She helped develop a complex network of safe houses and recruited \nabolitionist sympathizers residing along secret routes connecting the \nsouthern slave States and the northern free States. No one knows \nexactly how many people she led to freedom or the number of trips \nbetween the North and South she led, but the legend of her work was an \ninspiration to the multitude of slaves seeking freedom and to \nabolitionists fighting to end slavery.\n  Tubman became known as ``the Moses of her people'' by African \nAmericans and White abolitionists alike. She is the most famous and the \nmost important conductor of the network of resistance known as the \nUnderground Railroad.\n  During the Civil War, Tubman served the Union forces as a spy, a \nscout, and a nurse. She served in Virginia, Florida, and South \nCarolina. She is credited with leading slaves from those slave States \nto freedom during those years as well.\n  Following the Civil War and the emancipation of all Black slaves, \nTubman settled in Auburn, NY. There she was active in the women's \nsuffrage movement and established one of the first incorporated \nAfrican-American homes for the aged to care for the elderly. In 1903, \nshe bequeathed the Tubman Home to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion \nChurch in Auburn where it stands to this day. Harriet Tubman died in \nAuburn in 1913, and she is buried in Fort Hill Cemetery.\n  Fortunately, many of the structures and landmarks in New York remain \nintact and in relatively good condition. Only recently has the Park \nService begun establishing units dedicated to the lives of African \nAmericans. Places such as the Booker T. Washington National Monument on \nthe campus of Tuskegee University in Alabama, the George Washington \nCarver National Monument in Missouri, the Buffalo Soldiers at Guadalupe \nMountains National Park, the National Historical Trail commemorating \nthe march for voting rights from Selma to Montgomery, AL, and, most \nrecently, the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial on The National Mall.\n  These are all important monuments and places of historical \nsignificance that help tell the story of the African-American \nexperience.\n  As the National Park Service continues its important work to \nrecognize and preserve African-American history by providing greater \npublic access and information about the places and people that have \nshaped the African-American experience, there are very few units \ndedicated to the lives of African-American women, and there is no \nnational historical park commemorating African-American women.\n  I cannot think of a more fitting hero than Harriet Tubman to be the \nfirst African-American woman to be memorialized with a national \nhistorical park that tells her story and her fight against institutions \nof slavery and the work on the Underground Railroad. I hope my \ncolleagues will support my effort to honor Harriet Tubman and support \nthe passage of my bill to authorize the creation of the Tubman National \nHistorical Parks in New York and Maryland.\n  Let me just point out that the landscapes in which she lived still \nexist today, and that will be an incredible part of the national park \nthat can tell the story, particularly to young people, about the \ncourage of this extraordinary woman. A number of structures exist in \nAuburn, NY, which complement her life as the conductor of the \nUnderground Railroad, as well as her later life in helping to advance \nthe rights of all people.\n  This is an incredible opportunity for us to honor her with this \nnational park and to help future generations understand the history of \nAmerica and the courage of this extraordinary leader and hero of our \nNation, Harriet Tubman.\n  Mr. President, these parks will hopefully pave the way for the Park \nService to develop more National Historical Park commemorating the \nlives of many other important African-American women in our history.\n  The vision for the Tubman National Historical Parks is to preserve \nthe places significant to the life of Harriet Tubman and tell her story \nthrough interpretative activities and continue to discover aspects of \nher life and the experience of passage along the Underground Railroad \nthrough archaeological research and discovery.\n  The buildings and structures in Maryland have mostly disappeared. \nSlaves were forced to live in primitive buildings even though many \nslaves were skilled tradesmen who constructed the substantial homes of \ntheir owners. Not surprisingly, few of the structures associated with \nthe early years of Tubman's life still stand.\n  As I mentioned, the landscapes of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, \nhowever, remain similar to the time Tubman lived there. Farm fields and \nforests dot the lowland landscape, which is also notable for the \nextensive network of tidal rivers and wetlands that Tubman, and the \npeople she guided to freedom, would have traveled under the cover of \nnight.\n  In particular, a number of properties--including the homestead of Ben \nRoss, her father, Stewart's Canal, where he worked, the Brodess Farm, \nwhere she worked as a slave, and others are within the master plan \nboundaries of the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Similarly, Poplar Neck, the plantation from which she escaped to \nfreedom, is still largely intact in Caroline County. The properties in \nTalbot County, immediately across the Choptank River from the \nplantation, are currently protected by various conservation easements.\n  Were she alive today, Tubman would recognize much of the landscape \nthat she knew intimately as she secretly led black men, women and \nchildren to freedom.\n  There has never been any doubt that Tubman led an extraordinary life. \nHer contributions to American history are surpassed by few. Determining \nthe most appropriate way to recognize that life and her contributions, \nhowever, has been exceedingly difficult.\n\n[[Page S252]]\n\n  The National Park Service determined that designating a Historical \nPark that would include two geographically separate units would be an \nappropriate tribute to the life of this extraordinary American.\n  The New York unit would include the tightly clustered Tubman \nbuildings in the town of Auburn. The Maryland portion would include \nlarge sections of landscapes that are representive of Tubman's time and \nare historically relevant.\n  Harriet Tubman was a true American patriot. She was someone for whom \nliberty and freedom were not just concepts but values she fought \ntirelessly for. She lived those principles and achieved freedom with \nhundreds of others. In doing so, she has earned the Nation's respect \nand honor.\n  Harriet Tubman is one of many great Americans who we honor and \ncelebrate every February during Black History Month.\n  In schools across the country, American History curriculums teach our \nchildren about Tubman's courage, conviction, her fight for freedom and \nher contributions to the greatness of our Nation during a contentious \ntime in U.S. history. Now it is time to add to Tubman's legacy by \npreserving and commemorating the places representative of her \nextraordinary life.\n  Every year, millions of school children, as well as millions of \nadults, visit our National Historical Parks and gain experiences and \nknowledge about our Nation's history that simply cannot be found in \nhistory books or on Wikipedia.\n  Our Nation's strength and character comes from the actions of the \nAmericans who came before us and the significant events that shaped our \nNation.\n  The National Park Service is engaged in the important work of \npreserving where American history has taken place and providing a \ntangible experience for all people to learn from.\n  It is one thing to learn about Harriet Tubman from a book, it is a \ncompletely different and fulfilling experience to explore, to see, to \nlisten, and to feel the places where she worked as a slave, where she \nescaped from, and where she lived her days as a free American.\n  The National Park Service is uniquely suited to honoring and \npreserving these places of historical significance, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in preserving and growing the legacy of Harriet \nTubman by establishing the Harriet Tubman National Historical Parks in \nher honor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                     Remembering J. Joseph Garrahy\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague and \nfriend from Rhode Island to pay tribute to former Rhode Island Governor \nJ. Joseph Garrahy, who passed away last week at the age of 81.\n  Joe Garrahy loved Rhode Island, and in turn the people of Rhode \nIsland loved Joe Garrahy. His intelligence, his instinct, and his \nintegrity led our State with compassion and courage. He believed in the \npeople of Rhode Island and in the virtue of public service.\n  More than three decades after he left public office, Joe Garrahy \nremains one of our most respected and beloved leaders. A man of the \npeople, the Governor of Rhode Island, Joe Garrahy, is a Rhode Island \nicon who will be held in high esteem for generations to come. Rhode \nIslanders lost a friend. We all lost a good friend.\n  John Joseph Garrahy was born in humble circumstances in Providence, \nRhode Island, on November 26, 1930, the son of Irish immigrants. He \ngraduated from La Salle Academy in Providence and attended the \nUniversity of Buffalo and the University of Rhode Island.\n  The Governor began his political career in 1962 when he was elected \nto represent Smith Hill in the Rhode Island General Assembly. He served \nas Rhode Island's Lieutenant Governor from 1969 to 1976, and then was \nelected Governor and served from 1977 to 1985.\n  After his retirement from public life, Governor Garrahy was a \nbusiness consultant who championed new economic development projects \nand helped existing businesses that have always been the backbone of \nour economy in Rhode Island. He never stopped looking for and finding \nnew ways to promote his beloved State of Rhode Island.\n  As Governor, Joe Garrahy had vision, initiative, and an incredibly \nstrong work ethic. He possessed the unique ability to bring people \ntogether to address their needs at the most basic level, while at the \nsame time tackling the most pressing public policy issues of his time. \nHe was also particularly gifted in bringing together opposing sides and \nwould often invite diverse interests into the room to discuss issues \nand matters of conflict. Because of his integrity, his decency, and his \nsincerity, he was more than an honest broker; he was someone people \ntrusted.\n  His leadership and his example led Rhode Island with special \ndistinction. He brought people together because they innately trusted \nthis kind and wise gentleman. They knew he always had the interests of \nthe State at heart, not his personal ambition, not his personal \nprogress, but the welfare of the people of Rhode Island. His list of \nachievements is long. His many good works have made a lasting \nimpression on our State. He believed government could and must do all \nit can to improve the lives of its citizens.\n  He was elected Governor after the Navy decided to close Quonset \nPoint--which was a premier naval air station in Rhode Island, a major \nemployer and a major source of economic activity--and reduced its \npresence in Newport. This was a shock to the economy of Rhode Island. \nIn spite of double-digit unemployment and the challenging economy that \nwas worsened by this departure, he set a new course to redirect \nresources and make government work for the people.\n  He fought for the rights of the disabled and led in the \ndeinstitutionalization of the mentally disabled citizens of Rhode \nIsland. He closed the Ladd School, which was our residential center, \nand he literally ended the practice of warehousing the disabled at the \nInstitute of Mental Health. He reformed Rhode Island's prison system, \nwhich was plagued with unrest and violence, transforming it to a \nnational model.\n  Following the energy crisis in the 1970s, the Governor provided \nresources to a much needed energy office to look for innovative ways to \ndeal with a problem that still challenges the State and the Nation. He \nalso forged creative partnerships with neighboring States throughout \nthe Northeast and with leaders in Canada.\n  Governor Garrahy was a man of great passion, great decency, and he \nhad a special affection for the elderly and the children of Rhode \nIsland. Under his tenure he created the Department of Elderly Affairs \nand Children, Youth and Families, he said, to focus the attention of \nthe State and make the delivery of services to these seniors and \nchildren more efficient and more effective. That was Joe Garrahy--\nthinking not about himself but, in particular, thinking about the most \nvulnerable people in our society.\n  He was always a great cheerleader for Rhode Island. He led the way \nfor the Rhode Island Heritage Commission to flourish and to publicize \nand popularize our State's unique contributions to American history and \nits rich cultural heritage--a rich ethnic heritage which he was awfully \nproud of. He was always a staunch supporter of our tourism industry.\n  He also had a profound respect and regard for the environment and \nworked diligently to clean up pollution in Narragansett Bay and \npreserve our open spaces. He helped establish the Narragansett Bay \nCommission, which is one of the leading agencies in the State that \ntreats our waste products and makes sure they are not discarded \nuntreated into the bay. In fact, his efforts--with foresight years \nago--paved the way for one of the largest projects ever completed in \nthe State of Rhode Island, which now prevents sewage from flowing into \nour bay unabated. But this was just one of the extraordinary \ncommitments he made to our environment.\n  He was always looking to bring businesses to Rhode Island--high-tech \nbusinesses, along with businesses that would provide people the chance \nfor employment, the chance to own a home, and the chance to provide for \na better life for their children. He worked to revitalize, \nparticularly, the downtown Providence area through his work with the \nCapital Center Commission, which did landmark work in literally \nreshaping the face of Providence, making it one of the most attractive \nand most compelling cities in our country.\n\n[[Page S253]]\n\n  Throughout his administration, he always worked for public \ntransportation facilities, and everything that would complement our \neconomic growth. He did it with great passion, great diligence and, \nagain and again and again, extraordinary decency.\n  In his final days in office he launched The Greenhouse Compact, which \nwas a bold economic revitalization plan. He proposed to create 60,000 \nhigh-paying jobs and lay the foundation to combat the dying \nmanufacturing industries of the State of Rhode Island at that time. And \nalthough the compact was not approved by the voters--there were \nconcerns about how it would be paid for--many of its proposals have \ncome to fruition; a tribute again to his foresight, to his vision, to \nhis courageous leadership, and to his confidence, that bringing these \nissues to the people would eventually lead to their adoption. And they \nhave.\n  Joe Garrahy was the person you wanted leading you in difficult times, \nand there was no more difficult time than in 1978, when the great \nblizzard descended upon Rhode Island. Literally, Rhode Island was \nparalyzed. You couldn't move. People were without communication, \nwithout electricity. But there was one constant beacon of hope and \nstability and strength, and that was Governor Joe Garrahy. He was the \nvoice who quelled the anxiety--the fear, frankly--that this natural \ndisaster would overwhelm us. In time of great turmoil, he was there. He \nassured us that help was on the way. And in what has become a famous \nhistoric relic in the State of Rhode Island, he did it all wearing the \nsame plaid shirt, it seemed. That plaid shirt was a symbol of him: \nNothing fancy; someone you could trust; someone you could depend upon; \nsomeone who rolled up his sleeves to get the job done for the people of \nRhode Island to literally, in some cases, save people in a very \ndemanding natural disaster through his leadership. He was, as I say \nagain and again, one of the most decent individuals I have ever met. He \nwas so kind to me, so understanding, so tolerant. And I am not alone.\n  I recall something that was said about another great American, \nFranklin D. Roosevelt. He was in his final position; the cortege was \ngoing down Pennsylvania Avenue. There was an individual by the side of \nthe road who was weeping, literally. A reporter went up to him and \nsaid, Well, you must have known the President; you are so upset. And he \nsaid, No, no; I didn't know him, never met him. But he knew me.\n  Joe Garrahy knew the people of Rhode Island. He was a man of innate \ndecency and goodness. He believed that every situation had some merit, \na silver lining, something he could do to bring forth good out of bad, \nprogress out of adversity. He was a man of deep faith, who worked hard, \nand remained optimistic and compassionate in every moment. He was a \nnoble public servant. That word is used often, but no more accurately \nthan with respect to Joe Garrahy, a man of nobility--a nobility born \nnot of privilege or wealth but of character, conscience, and concern.\n  He had an extraordinary winning personality. He was one of those \npeople you wanted to bump into because he made you feel better. His \nwarm, embracing personality, his humor, his friendliness, his caring, \nhis sincerity, all those things transmitted this sense of knowing you \nand caring for you--which was unique and will never, I think, in my \nmind, be replicated by any of us in Rhode Island.\n  Whenever you were with the Governor, you always felt a little bit \nbetter about where you were, about the future, and about the world. He \nwas fond of people, and that fondness was repaid by a deep sense of \ngratitude for what he has done and profound respect for a wonderful \nman.\n  But above all this, he loved his family the most. He was a devoted \nhusband, father and, as he was described by his grandchildren, their \nPoppy.\n  We remember him now, and we also remember his family because they \nhave lost a great man. But he did so much for all of us to make us \nbigger and better that we can withstand this great loss.\n  I want to join with my fellow Rhode Islanders in offering my \nheartfelt sympathy to his wonderful wife Margherite and his wonderful \nfamily, Colleen and Michael Mahoney, their children Ryan and Michaela; \nJohn and Barbara Cottam Garrahy, their daughters Katherine and \nElizabeth; Maribeth and Robert Hardman and their son Wesley; Sheila and \nGregory Mitchell and their children, CJ, Todd, and Chad; and Seana and \nMichael Edwards and their children Drew, Brayden, and Ellie Rose.\n  We will miss him. But his legacy and his personal example of kindness \nand good will continue to sustain and inspire us. Today, we celebrate \nhis life, and in the days and weeks and years to come we will remember \nhim fondly as one of Rhode Island's greatest Governors. We are all the \nbetter for having Joe Garrahy in our Biggest Little State.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my senior \ncolleague, Senator Reed, in tribute to the memory of a great public \nservant and a great friend, Jay Joseph Garrahy, former Governor of \nRhode Island, who passed away last week at the age of 81.\n  At his funeral services this week, he was remembered by an enormous \ncrowd for his warmth, for his kindness, and for his steady leadership \nof our State.\n  Joe Garrahy was born in Providence, RI to a blue-collar, Irish \nimmigrant family. He worked his way through Catholic school, and he \nserved in the Air National Guard and in the Air Force during the Korean \nwar. He came back home from the war and went to work as a beer salesman \nfor our Narragansett Brewery. He was what they fittingly called a \nNarragansett Goodwill Man. And, as Senator Reed has explained, Joe \nGarrahy brought good will wherever he went.\n  He turned to politics and to public service with the 1960 \nPresidential campaign of John F. Kennedy. Joe followed his path \nhimself, ultimately, with election to the Rhode Island Senate, and then \nhe was elected statewide as Lieutenant Governor, and then served two \nterms as Rhode Island's Governor--serving as Chief of State in the very \nstatehouse where his mother had once cleaned floors. It was a beautiful \nAmerican success story for him to rise to lead the statehouse that his \nmother had cleaned.\n  The story was told at his funeral that when he was Lieutenant \nGovernor and she was still cleaning the statehouse, he said: Mom, don't \nyou want to find something else to do now that I am here as Lieutenant \nGovernor? She turned to him and said: Joe, I got here first.\n  In his public life, Joe Garrahy always made the effort to be what he \nonce described as ``probably one of the easiest guys in the State of \nRhode Island to get along with.'' He sure was. I don't think anyone who \nhas worked with him over the years would disagree with that. Joe was \ncertainly always very kind and supportive to me as I embarked on my \nfledgling career in public service.\n  But Governor Garrahy's service to our State stands as a guidepost for \ntoday's political leaders. He saw Rhode Island through the difficult \neconomic recession of the early 1980s. He was a staunch defender of \nNarragansett Bay, our environmental jewel, and of Rhode Island's open \nspaces; his efforts to attract high-tech industries to Rhode Island and \nto advance our economy; his work on behalf of children and senior \ncitizens and those with disabilities all continues to inspire us.\n  Of course, all Rhode Islanders who are old enough remember the \nblizzard of 1978, which buried parts of our State under 3 feet of snow \nand brought our roads and businesses to a shuddering halt. People spent \ndays in factories, in movie theaters, in department stores where they \nwere snowed in. I still recall the scene of cars up and down 95 covered \nin snow, abandoned, the road closed. Rhode Islanders are filled with \nstories of where they were and what they did during the great blizzard \nof 1978 and how they struggled to get home to their loved ones.\n  Through all of that, Governor Garrahy marshaled resources from the \nFederal Government and from neighboring States and got Rhode Island \nback on its feet. In his frequent televised messages to Rhode Islanders \nduring the crisis, his plaid flannel shirt became a trademark of his \naccessible, hard-working, easygoing style.\n\n[[Page S254]]\n\n  Governor Garrahy's righthand man throughout his political career was \nBill Dugan, his chief of staff. As fate would have it, we are also \nmourning the loss of Bill, who passed away the day before we lost the \nGovernor. It was often said that Governor Garrahy didn't know how to \nsay no. He was too nice for that. Well, that job often fell to Bill \nDugan.\n  Joe and Bill were lifelong friends, graduated in the same class at La \nSalle Academy, went into politics together, and made a memorable \npolitical team in Rhode Island history. Last Thursday, Joe Garrahy and \nhis dear companion and political associate Bill Dugan were together one \nlast time.\n  Bill's sons are friends of mine, David and Richard. At Bill's funeral \nI spoke to Richard, and I remarked on how extraordinary it was that \nthis exceptional Rhode Island friendship and political alliance should \nend with these two men dying in the same week within virtually hours of \neach other.\n  Richard looked back at me and he said: Sheldon, you don't know the \nhalf of it. It was during my father's wake at Boyle's Funeral Home that \nthe Governor was brought home from Florida, where he had been \nvacationing, by the State police to Rhode Island. And that night, the \ntwo old companions rested one last time, side by side, on Smith Hill at \nBoyle's Funeral Home.\n  On behalf of my wife Sandra and my family, I extend to the Garrahy \nfamily our deepest condolences. To Joe's loving wife Margherite, to \ntheir children Colleen, John, Maribeth, Sheila, Seana, and their 11 \ngrandchildren and the entire Garrahy family, we have you in our hearts.\n  Joe Garrahy often spoke about the great joy his children and his 11 \ngrandchildren gave him, especially in the years after his retirement. \nOur thoughts and prayers are with them all today.\n  I am very pleased to have this opportunity to join with Senator Reed \nand with so many Rhode Islanders who are still remembering, thinking \nof, praying for, and giving homage to Governor Garrahy. We will never \nforget his ready smile, his easy friendship, his distinguished service, \nhis ability to remember every name, and his long and very loving \nmarriage.\n  I join Senator Reed in saluting his legendary service to our State.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I know folks are riveted \nto their televisions. I wanted to give them an update as to where we \nare on the STOCK Act.\n  First of all, there have been a lot of good amendments back and \nforth. We have reviewed them. We worked obviously late into last night \nand have been working throughout today. We are gearing up for votes \nthat hopefully will be forthcoming, if not today, then hopefully \ntomorrow.\n  But I do appreciate the process, and I wanted to publicly thank \nLeader Reid for his willingness to allow us to work through this \nprocess because it is sensitive for some people and it is new territory \nfor others. But I will say, being the first time and having the ability \nto come down and co-manage the floor with Senator Collins and work with \nSenator Lieberman and Senator Gillibrand, the process has been open and \nfair. We are trying now to eliminate some of the amendments that may \nnot be relevant. We have had some folks step back and say, yes, take \nthis off or take that off, and that is good. And we have been trying to \ncombine other amendments to try to solidify where we want to go.\n  But I did want to let folks know that we are working diligently with \nthe staffs of all the concerned Members, and hopefully we will get some \nvotes very shortly.\n  Once again, I commend Leader Reid and his staff, the chairman and his \nstaff, Senator Gillibrand, and Senator Collins, for everyone working \ntogether trying to make this happen. I appreciate that, and I want to \nmake that reference for folks who are paying attention.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the call of the \nquorum be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize to the Presiding Officer and \nstaff and Senators, but we have not been able to reach an agreement yet \non how to move forward on this simple bill. Remember, everybody loved \nthe bill? We should have been able to finish it quickly. It has not \nworked out that way, but we are close. I hope in the morning we can do \nthis and finish the bill tomorrow afternoon. That would be preferable. \nI hope we can do that.\n  Everyone has worked in good faith and there are a number of \namendments we will vote on, and if that is the case, we can finish this \nhopefully tomorrow, late in the afternoon or early evening. We are not \nthere yet, but we are very close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, while the majority leader is here, I \nwished to thank him for the work he and his staff have continued to do \nto enable us to get to a vote on this bill, which most everybody in the \nSenate supports, to make it clear that Members of Congress and our \nstaffs are covered by anti-insider trading laws. Senator Gillibrand, \nSenator Collins, and Senator Brown have all been working to bring this \nto an end and give Members on both sides the opportunity to introduce \namendments. Senator Reid has been showing great forbearance in not \nmoving to file a cloture motion. In some sense, this is a test of \nwhether we can all apply to ourselves a rule of reasonableness so that \nthere can be a pretty open amendment process, but one that does not \nstop the Senate from getting something accomplished.\n\n  I share the leader's optimism. There is only one obstacle now to \nhaving an agreement and, hopefully, we can begin voting tomorrow \nafternoon and get it done before we finish.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is Senator Gillibrand's fault we are in \nall of this trouble.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I wish to commend the leader for his forbearance and \npatience in this very long and extended process. But we are making \ngreat efforts to come together to work in a bipartisan way to \naccomplish something good for the American people and to begin to \nrestore faith and trust in this institution and in our government. So I \nthank our leader. We are so grateful for his patience. I also thank the \nchairman for his work in leading this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to Senator Lieberman, we did a lot more \ngeneralized work than the distinguished junior Senator from New York. \nShe is an absolute expert in this area where we are dealing with \ncorporate law, all the stuff we did with derivatives and all that, and \nI was certainly joking when I said she was the cause of trouble for \nthis legislation. It was her idea. We appreciate her good work. Senator \nLieberman and I have been through a number of battles together and this \nis one of the minor skirmishes.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/01/senate-section/article/S254-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S254]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND.

Mr. President, I rise to send my best wishes and \ngratitude to a good friend of mine and a loyal public servant to the \npeople of\n\n[[Page S255]]\n\nKentucky for many years, Ms. Phyllis Causey. After nearly 2 decades \nworking for the Representative from Kentucky's 2nd Congressional \nDistrict--first Congressman Ron Lewis, then Congressman Brett Guthrie--\nshe has chosen to embark on a well-earned retirement.\n  As a field representative for Congressmen Guthrie and Lewis, she has \nmade a huge impact on the lives of countless Kentuckians. Her \ndedication and hard work has set a standard for all who enter public \nservice. She made many friends across the Commonwealth in her 18 years \nas a House staffer, and I am proud to be one of them.\n  Phyllis graduated from Hopkinsville Community College in 1970 and \nearned her bachelor's degree at Western Kentucky University in 1972. \nShe also worked for Western Kentucky University for 23 years.\n  Before going to work for Kentucky's Second District, Phyllis was the \nvice chairwoman of the Warren County Republican Party. It was in that \ncapacity she met Ron Lewis, who was exploring a run for Congress. A lot \nof people did not give Ron much of a chance at the time--after all, the \nprevious holder of that district's Congressional seat, a Democrat, had \nheld it for almost 40 years.\n  Well, Ron Lewis surprised a lot of people when he won that race. \nAfter winning, one of his first decisions--one of his best decisions--\nwas to hire Phyllis Causey. And one of Brett's best decisions was to \nretain her.\n  In her retirement, Phyllis has said she hopes to be able to spend \nmore time with her husband, Larry, and also care for her mother. As so \nmany people have stepped forward to wish her well upon the news of her \nretirement, Phyllis has humbly said, ``All I can hope is that I have \nmade a difference.''\n  I certainly think it is safe to say she has. I value her friendship \nand wish her the best in her future endeavors. I know my colleagues in \nthe U.S. Senate join me in honoring Ms. Phyllis Causey upon her \nretirement and thanking her for her many years spent in public service.\n  The Bowling Green, Kentucky-area publication The Daily News recently \npublished an article highlighting Phyllis Causey's life and career. I \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From The Daily News, Jan. 14, 2012]\n\nCausey Is Hailed as Public Servant; Guthrie Aide Retiring at the End of \n                                January\n\n                          (By Andrew Robinson)\n\n       When U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie, R-Bowling Green, was \n     campaigning for Congress in 2008, he was frequently posed a \n     question. But it wasn't about his views on taxes, federal \n     spending or social issues.\n       ``Are you going to keep Phyllis Causey?'' people often \n     asked Guthrie.\n       Guthrie did in fact keep Causey, who served as his field \n     representative for the past three years. But Causey said \n     goodbye Friday, retiring after 18 years of work with \n     congressmen in Kentucky's 2nd Congressional District.\n       Causey, who worked for former U.S. Rep. Ron Lewis before \n     joining Guthrie's office, officially retires at the end of \n     January.\n       In a reception at the Warren County Justice Center, Causey \n     thanked co-workers, friends and families for their support \n     over the years.\n       ``I have mixed emotions,'' Causey said. ``I've been crying \n     a lot, as a matter of fact. It's very nice that people are \n     stopping by.''\n       She said she'll remember the friends she has made.\n       ``And, of course, working for a great guy like (Guthrie) \n     and the previous congressman is a blessing,'' Causey said.\n       In December, Guthrie spoke for a few minutes about Causey's \n     service on the floor of the U.S. House, a moment that was \n     entered into the Congressional Record.\n       ``She has been such an inspiration to me,'' Guthrie said on \n     the floor. ``She has always been devoted to the causes she \n     believes in--church, family and friends. Phyllis is an \n     incredible wife, daughter, sister and mother. I know her \n     family, especially her husband Larry, will be happy to have \n     her around more often.''\n       The moment caught Causey by surprise.\n       ``I did not know that was happening until the day before,'' \n     Causey said. ``I'm overwhelmed and honored that he would want \n     to do that.''\n       Of course, Guthrie and Lewis had nothing but good things to \n     say about Causey.\n       ``I used to tell her, and she thought I was kidding, but I \n     used to say, ''Phyllis, don't run against me, you'll beat me \n     hands down,''' Lewis said. ``In the counties that Phyllis \n     serves, the people love her. She's never met a stranger. \n     Everywhere you go, they know Phyllis Causey.''\n       Lewis met Causey in 1993. She was working as the vice \n     chairwoman of the Warren County Republican Party and Lewis \n     was trying to gauge his support in Warren County when he ran \n     for Congress.\n       Lewis was invited by Causey to several events in Warren \n     County.\n       ``She became one of my first supporters in Warren County,'' \n     Lewis said. ``She told me all the key people to talk to.''\n       Such stories are endless, Lewis said.\n       ``A lot of people who are very political have trouble \n     turning that into public service,'' Guthrie said. ``And \n     what's amazing about her, as hard-core of a Republican she \n     is, she served everybody.''\n       Causey plans to spend more time with her husband, as well \n     as be a full-time caregiver for her mother. Mark Lord, who is \n     serving as Guthrie's district director, will step up to serve \n     Warren and Barren counties as field representative.\n       ``She just has a great personality, loves people, loves her \n     job--and talk about a true public servant,'' Lewis said. \n     ``Phyllis is a public servant. I'm sad she's retiring because \n     people love her.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/01/senate-section/article/S255-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S255-S256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KEN HARVEY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a \ndistinguished Kentuckian who has worked tirelessly and selflessly in \npublic service for over 25 years. I am sad to report to my colleagues \ntoday that Mr. Ken Harvey, the longest serving tourism director for any \ncounty in the Commonwealth, is retiring today.\n  Ken has worked since 1986 as the executive director of the London-\nLaurel County Tourist Commission in southeastern Kentucky. During his \ntenure, tourism growth in the area has tripled, the number of motels in \nthe area has more than doubled, and the number of restaurants has \ndoubled. Ken's coworkers, friends, and neighbors know that such a feat \nwould not have been possible without Ken's endless energy and \nenthusiasm in his work.\n  When Ken moved to London, KY, with his wife Cheryl many years ago, he \nwas working for Kmart and was sent to Kentucky for a temporary \nassignment. But, in Ken's own words, London ``just felt like home.'' It \nis to the rest of the town and county's benefit that Ken and Cheryl \ndecided to put down roots and make London their home.\n  In addition to his long tenure as executive director of the London-\nLaurel County Tourist Commission, Ken keeps busy with many other \npursuits. He is a longtime board member of the Southern/Eastern \nKentucky Tourism Development Association and has served as that \norganization's president. He has been a board member of the Kentucky \nTourism Council Federation and served that group for several terms as \nchairman or vice chairman. He has served with the Kentucky Festival \nAssociation and the Kentucky Main Street Board. Ken is also an avid \nhistorian who has volunteered for the Kentucky Civil War Trail and \nhelped coordinate Civil War reenactments.\n  Ken is also a member of the Optimist Club, the Laurel County Rotary \nClub, and a Leadership Tri-County graduate. He was named Laurel County \nMan of the Year by the News Leader in 1990. And I would certainly be \nremiss if I did not mention what many believe to be Ken's greatest \nachievement as tourism director--for many years he has been the driving \nforce behind the World Chicken Festival.\n  The World Chicken Festival brings over 200,000 visitors to Kentucky \neach year for what has become one of the top 10 festivals in the \nSoutheastern United States. It offers entertainment, talent shows, art \nexhibits, carnival rides, and of course food--particularly chicken. It \nhas been noted for exhibiting the world's largest stainless steel \nskillet. Lasting 4 days, taking up 10 square blocks, and free to \nvisitors, I am sure my colleagues will understand when I say that under \nKen's leadership, the World Chicken Festival is one of Kentucky's most \n``egg-citing'' events.\n  Ken's retirement will be Kentucky's loss but certainly his family's \ngain. I understand he is looking forward to spending more time with his \n6-year-old grandson. On behalf of the people of London, Laurel County, \nand all of Kentucky, I want to thank Mr. Ken Harvey for his many years \nof service. He will be missed, and I certainly wish him all the best in \nhis well-earned retirement.\n  Mr. President, a recent article printed in the Laurel County area \npublication the Sentinel Echo highlighted Mr. Ken Harvey's many \nachievements. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S256]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sentinel Echo, Nov. 28, 2011]\n\n                            Harvey To Retire\n\n               Longest-Serving Tourism Director in State\n\n                           (By Nita Johnson)\n\n       Laurel County, KY.--What began as a year's assignment in \n     1982 evolved into the longest-running term of a tourism \n     commissioner in the state.\n       Ken Harvey, executive director of the London-Laurel Tourist \n     Commission, announced his plans to retire on Feb. 1, after \n     serving in that capacity for 26 years.\n       He has seen much growth during his tenure with the tourist \n     commission, with his latest focus on developing the Heritage \n     Hills property off Falls Street.\n       But the evolution of the World Chicken Festival, the Redbud \n     Ride, various athletic events and a motel tax are just a few \n     of the accomplishments that have brought revenue to the \n     tourism commission during Harvey's term--accomplishments he \n     credits to the board members with whom he has served.\n       Board members returned the compliment, with Tourism \n     Commission Board President Caner Cornett describing Harvey as \n     ``one of a kind.''\n       ``He's a self-propelled man. Ken only knows one speed--full \n     force,'' Cornett said. ``He's the kind who can talk to \n     someone on jail work release or the governor and show no \n     partiality. He has that kind of personality.''\n       Cornett said Harvey's exit as tourism director leaves \n     ``some big shoes to fill.''\n       ``He'll be hard to replace. His knowledge and experience is \n     invaluable,'' he added.\n       Though coming to London from Ohio, Harvey said just a few \n     months after settling here, he and wife Cheryl knew they \n     wanted to stay in the area.\n       ``It just felt like home,'' he said. ``When we came here, \n     there were 650 motel rooms. Now there are 1,300,'' he said. \n     ``Interstate 75 is an attraction in itself for travelers \n     going north or south. We have a good cross-section of dining \n     here and our board is made up of citizens whose home is \n     here.''\n       Other attractions that have increased the tourism business \n     are the annual Battle of Camp Wildcat, which Harvey considers \n     ``the best in the state,'' along with the location of the \n     Harley-Davidson dealership.\n       Harvey has been honored several times for his diligence in \n     promoting tourism in the London area and is proud that the \n     London commission is highly respected across the state. While \n     he readily admits he does not wish to retire, he realizes \n     that his ongoing health problems and three recent back \n     surgeries are limiting his ability to serve in the capacity \n     that he wishes to continue.\n       ``It's time. I hope they bring in someone with fresh ideas \n     that can continue to develop the Heritage Hills property and \n     give some new ideas for other developments,'' Harvey said. \n     ``Besides, I have a grandson who is six years old and I'm \n     looking forward to spending lots and lots of years with \n     him.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/01/senate-section/article/S256-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S256]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          VISA WAIVER PROGRAM ENHANCED SECURITY AND REFORM ACT\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, Senator Kirk and I have introduced the \nVisa Waiver Program Enhanced Security and Reform Act.\n  This is a piece of legislation near to my heart. For those who have \nknown me, they have known I have fought long and hard for Poland to \nbecome free and independent. I think about the dark days of martial law \nin Poland, when we worked to support the solidarity movement in Poland \nand remove the yoke of communism. And after Poland emerged from the \nIron Curtain, I worked with many of my colleagues to secure Polish \ndemocracy and bring them into NATO, securing their future in Western \nInstitutions.\n  This legislation would help provide Poland a path to entry into the \nvisa waiver program. It would eliminate the need for Polish citizens to \nobtain a visa to travel to America. As the granddaughter of a woman who \ncame to America from Poland over 100 years ago, it would warm my heart \nto know a grandmother from Gdansk would no longer need a visa to visit \nher grandchildren in Baltimore.\n  This legislation does much more than just strengthen our relationship \nwith Poland. It is a jobs bill. The visa waiver program makes America \nopen for business for more tourists from allied countries. This can \nhave a profound impact. South Korea entered the VWP in early 2009. In \n2010, there was an increase of 49 percent in arrivals to the United \nStates from South Korea, which created $789 million in new spending and \nsupported 4,800 new jobs.\n  If Poland becomes eligible for the visa waiver program and has a \nsimilar increase in visitors, it would create $181 million in new \nspending and 1,500 new jobs. It's good for business and good for the \neconomy.\n  Finally, it would strengthen America's national security by improving \nhow we protect our borders. To participate in the visa waiver program, \ncountries must agree to stronger passport controls, border security, \nand cooperation with American law enforcement--making it harder for \nterrorists to use these countries as entry points to the United States.\n  This legislation reinforces the program as an important component of \nnational security by placing member countries on probation if any of \nthe VWP requirements are not met and requiring a country's removal if \nit does not fulfill its requirements within two years.\n  The legislation also reinstates the Secretary of Homeland Security's \nWaiver Authority and a new cap on visa refusal rates will be set at no \nmore than 10 percent, allowing the Secretary to recognize those nations \nthat have met U.S. concerns on passport security, law enforcement \ncooperation, and border security. By admitting countries that have \ngreater security standards for their travelers, the State Department \ncan focus its limited consular resources on higher risk nations.\n  Poland has long been a friend to the United States, sending two of \nits finest heroes, Kosciusko and Pulaski, to fight in the Revolutionary \nWar for America's freedom. In recent years, Poland has stood besides \nthe United States in the aftermath of September 11, sending troops to \nfight alongside Americans in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Poland has overcome a melancholy history to become a vibrant and \ngrowing democracy. This legislation helps cement that relationship \nwhile improving America's security and creating new jobs. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to secure its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/01/senate-section/article/S256-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S256-S257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REMEMBERING RAY REID\n\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Ray \nReid, a devoted champion of Arkansas and its citizens, affectionately \nknown as Arkansas's `fifth congressman.'\n  Ray dedicated his life to public service, serving more than 30 years \nin the Army including three wars--WWII, Korea and Vietnam--before \nretiring as a colonel and continuing his commitment to this country \nserving for more than 23 years as chief of staff for three of \nArkansas's Third Congressional District Congressmen--John Paul \nHammerschmidt, Tim Hutchinson and Asa Hutchinson.\n  As a loyal staffer, Ray was an ambassador of and to Arkansas, going \nabove and beyond to help resolve issues constituents had with the \nFederal Government. Under his guidance, Congressman Hammerschmidt laid \nthe groundwork for successful constituent service. Ray recognized that \nthe key to good governing and good public service is that you treat \neveryone fairly and set political differences aside.\n  Congressman Hammerschmidt recently said of his former right-hand man \nthat he was the best administrative assistant in the House during his \nservice. Upon his retirement Congressman Asa Hutchinson said Ray was \nknown to be one of the most knowledgeable men in Washington.\n  When I was elected to Congress in 2001, Ray went out of his way to \nhelp us get on the right track. His skills and experiences were vital \nto helping us build a strong foundation to serve the people of the \nThird District.\n  Despite working in the minority for much of his career, Ray managed \nto accomplish great things for Arkansas because of the long-lasting \nrelationships he built. Certainly Ray saw many changes in the Third \nCongressional District during his years of service to Arkansas and many \ncan be credited to his efforts. Ray had a hand on many infrastructure \nprojects including Interstate 540 and the Northwest Arkansas Regional \nAirport.\n  In a recent interview, Congressman Hammerschmidt fondly recalled \nRay's passion for the Natural State: ``Ray really loved Arkansas,'' he \nsaid. Ray helped change the landscape of Arkansas. His impact is far \nreaching and his legacy is evident in the Third Congressional District.\n  The State of Arkansas has lost a true friend who went to great \nlengths to make it a better place.\n\n[[Page S257]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/01/senate-section/article/S257-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               RECOGNIZING MONTH OF THE HAWAIIAN LANGUAGE\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Today I wish to speak to the celebration of the \nHawaiian language. February is designated as the ``Month of the \nHawaiian Language'' by the State of Hawai`i. Speakers and students of \nthe language use this time to foster and promote Hawaiian through \nfestivals, spelling bees, and speech and debate competitions where the \nHawaiian language is the primary medium.\n  Since the first official designation in 1994, February has been a \ncelebration of the Hawaiian language in Hawai`i. However, this modern \nrenaissance happened only after the Hawaiian language came close to \nextinction, and the people of Hawai`i fought to preserve it.\n  In 1896, following the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, English \nwas named as the primary language of instruction in Hawai`i's schools. \nAs a result, students who spoke Hawaiian were subject to physical \npunishment or public humiliation. As Native Hawaiian families struggled \nto assimilate with the increasing Western presence in Hawai`i, parents \ngave children non-Hawaiian first names. Families who carried Hawaiian \nfamily names adopted Western surnames to avoid a Hawaiian identity. \nParents stopped teaching their children Hawaiian, and maintained \nEnglish-only households. This was a sad chapter in Hawai`i's history, \nbut fortunately, today, thanks to the effort of many Hawai`i residents, \npolitical and community leaders, and educators, the Hawaiian language \nis thriving.\n  In 1978, the Hawaiian language, also called `Olelo Hawai`i by its \nspeakers, was declared one of the two legal languages of the State of \nHawai`i. In 1984, the first Hawaiian language preschool was \nestablished, `Aha Punana Leo. Three years later, Hawaiian language \nimmersion expanded to include kindergarten through grade 12, and today, \nstudents can study the Hawaiian language from preschool through their \ndoctorate studies.\n  Use of the Hawaiian language is not limited to its fluent speakers. \nThose who live in and visit Hawai`i use Hawaiian words and phrases in \ntheir everyday vocabulary, whether they are Native Hawaiian or not. \nTowns, roadways, schools, and parks bear Hawaiian names. Island \nresidents commonly give each other directions using the words mauka--\nmeaning towards the mountains, or makai--meaning towards the ocean. A \nwaitress might ask you if you are pau, or done, with your meal before \nshe clears the table. You might tell her it was `ono, or delicious.\n  Some of the more commonly used words, including aloha and mahalo, are \nknown well beyond the shores of Hawai`i. I probably do not have to \nexplain that mahalo means thank you, or that aloha is a greeting that \nconveys warmth, love, and affection and is used to both welcome someone \nand wish them well.\n  The Hawaiian language is thriving in our modern society and it \nremains relevant as technology evolves around us. The iPhone and \nGoogle's homepage are just two instances where the Hawaiian language \ncan be selected as an option in language settings. Developers of the \npopular website, Wikipedia, borrowed the Hawaiian word wikiwiki, \nmeaning speedy, for its name. Travelers through Honolulu International \nAirport are greeted every half hour with a public announcement first in \nHawaiian, followed by its English translation. Local television \nreporters and weather forecasters consult with language experts on \nHawaiian pronunciation. One of the morning news shows features a \nsegment produced entirely in the Hawaiian language. Cable subscribers \nreceive a channel featuring Hawaiian language reporting.\n  The Hawaiian language is engrained in our daily lives in Hawai`i, and \nis important to all of Hawai`i's people. I am extremely grateful for \nthe efforts made by kupuna, our elders, as well as language and \ncultural educators, to preserve the Hawaiian language. According to the \nUniversity of Hawai`i at Hilo, there are approximately 7,500 people \nlearning the Hawaiian language today, from preschools, institutions of \nhigher education, and community programs. Parents are again raising \ntheir children to speak Hawaiian. While there is an increasing interest \nin the Hawaiian language, this is still just a small percentage of the \npopulation of the State of Hawai`i. I applaud the State for designating \nFebruary as the ``Month of the Hawaiian Language'' and bringing \nawareness to the need to perpetuate our language so that future \ngenerations may learn the language of their ancestors.\n  E ola mau ka `Olelo Hawai`i! Long live the Hawaiian language.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/01/senate-section/article/S257-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S257-S258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING NATIONAL GIRLS AND WOMEN IN SPORTS DAY\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, today, February 1, I wish to \ncelebrate the 26th annual National Girls and Women in Sports Day, on \nwhich we praise the importance of sports participation and athletics in \nthe lives of girls and women everywhere. This year's celebration has \nspecial meaning as it falls on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the \npassage of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. For over 40 \nyears, this historic law has furthered gender equality in sports \nparticipation in schools so that young women, including my three \ndaughters, Caroline, Halina and Anne who all play soccer, may enjoy the \nbenefits that come along with sports participation.\n  Studies show that participation in sports has a positive influence on \nthe intellectual, physical and psychological health of young girls. \nAccording to the National Federation of State High School Associations, \nby a 3-1 ratio, female athletes do better in school, do not drop out, \nand have a better chance to get through college. Additionally, a study \nfrom the Women's Sports Foundation showed that high school athletes are \nless likely to smoke cigarettes or use drugs than their non-athlete \npeers. Sports participation is also linked to lower rates of pregnancy \nin adolescent female athletes. With these statistics in mind, it is not \nsurprising that a study from the Oppenheimer/MassMutual Financial Group \nshows that of 401 executive business women surveyed, 82 percent \nreported playing organized sports while growing up, including school \nteams, intramurals, and recreational leagues.\n  In my home State of Colorado, we are ahead of the curve with regard \nto the participation of girls and women in sports. The U.S. Olympic \nTraining Center, located in Colorado Springs, was created by an act of \nCongress in 1978, just a few years after title IX was passed. It is \nencouraging to know that women like Gold Medal Winner Lindsey Vonn, now \nmake up nearly half of all U.S. Olympians competing at the games, \nrepresenting more than 48 percent of the 2008 team. Colorado also \nsupports the success of Paralympians such as Sarah Will, who after a \nskiing accident that left her paralyzed from the waist down, went on to \nhelp found the Vail Monoski Camp and won 12 gold Paralympic medals from \n1992 to 2002.\n  Colorado is also a vanguard in providing early education and sports \nopportunities for women. The flagship all girls school, GALS, Girls \nAthletic Leadership Schools, has opened its first public charter school \nin Denver, CO. The school practices active learning that engages \nstudents in health and wellness activities in the belief that these are \nkey contributing factors in optimizing academic achievement and self-\ndevelopment. There are also groups such as the Colorado Women's Sports \nFund Association that work towards increasing the number of girls and \nwomen who participate in athletics and reducing and eliminating \nbarriers that prevent participation.\n  Despite the vast improvements with regard to sports participation for \ngirls and women, inequalities and disparities still remain. According \nto the National Federation of State High School Associations, schools \nare still providing 1.3 million fewer chances for girls to play sports \nin high school than boys. These numbers have an even greater impact on \nLatinas and African-American young women. The Women's Sports Foundation \nshows that less than two-thirds of these girls play sports while more \nthan three-quarters of Caucasian girls do. And three-quarters of boys \nfrom immigrant families are involved in athletics, while less than half \nof girls from immigrant families are.\n  Mr. President, we have work to do. Part of our job is to promote the \nimportance of this national effort to grow the rates of female \nathletes. Please\n\n[[Page S258]]\n\njoin me in celebrating National Girls and Women in Sports Day by \nsupporting efforts to expand equality in sports participation and \neducation for women and girls around the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/01/senate-section/article/S258-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JACK KING\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator \nBoxer, I join my colleagues in the House of Representatives, including \nMr. Costa, Mr. Lungren, Mr. Cardoza, Mr. Farr, Mr. Denham, Ms. \nRichardson, Mr. Baca, Mr. Herger, Mrs. Capps, Mr. Filner, Ms. Lofgren, \nMs. Matsui, Mr. Nunes, Mr. McNerney, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Schiff, Ms. Lee, \nMs. Loretta Sanchez, Ms. Eshoo, Ms. Chu, Ms. Speier, Ms. Linda Sanchez, \nMr. Becerra, Ms. Hahn, Mr. Sherman, Mr. Honda, Mr. McClintock, and Mr. \nCalvert, to pay tribute to Mr. Jack King on the occasion of his \nretirement from the California Farm Bureau Federation. For more than 35 \nyears, Jack King has worked on behalf of our Nation's farmers and \nranchers to ensure that they have a voice in our Nation's capital. His \npassion for agriculture has made him a strong and effective advocate \nfor the American Farm Bureau Federation and the California Farm Bureau \nFederation.\n  Growing up on a dairy farm in Wisconsin taught Jack the value of hard \nwork, and the important role agriculture plays in America--specifically \nwhen it comes to feeding and clothing our families and supporting our \neconomy. Upon graduating from the University of Wisconsin, Jack began \nhis career in agriculture with the university's cooperative extension \noffice. Jack then went on to work for the Wisconsin Council of \nAgricultural Cooperatives and the Wisconsin Council of Agriculture. In \n1973, Jack ventured west and joined the California Farm Bureau \nFederation as assistant manager of the information division.\n  Jack expanded his work with the Farm Bureau, and in 1985, he became \nnews services director for the American Farm Bureau Federation. Based \nin Illinois, Jack managed internal and external communications and \noften worked in conjunction with the Washington, D.C. office to ensure \nthat legislators were connected with farmers and ranchers. In 1994, \nJack returned to California to serve as manager of the California Farm \nBureau Federation's National Affairs Division. He served as a direct \nlink between farmers, ranchers, and Members of Congress.\n  Jack's tremendous contributions and dedication can be measured in a \nnumber of ways. Notably, Jack made approximately 200 trips to \nWashington, D.C. His deep commitment was based in his belief that \nlegislators needed to hear directly from farmers and ranchers in order \nto understand their contributions and the difficulties they face. \nSpecifically, Jack has been dedicated to working on comprehensive \nimmigration reform, natural resource regulations, and renewable energy.\n  Of course none of these accomplishments would be possible without the \nlove and support of Jack's wife, Mary Ann; their sons, Carl, David and \nBryan; and two grandchildren.\n  We ask our colleagues to join us in recognizing Jack King's \nenthusiasm and work ethic. His devotion and loyalty to our Nation's \nfarmers and ranchers make him a source of pride for our community, \nState and Nation. We thank Jack for his work on behalf of farmers and \nranchers in California and all across the country, and wish him well in \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/01/senate-section/article/S258-2", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING BULL JAGGER BREWING COMPANY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have heard time and \nagain how difficult it is to start a business in our current economy. \nAs the new year begins, I find it especially critical to honor those \nentrepreneurs, who in spite of these challenging times, are surmounting \nall obstacles to pursue the American dream of starting a small \nbusiness. With this in mind, today I wish to commend and recognize the \nmost recent addition to the renowned brewing family, the Bull Jagger \nBrewing Company of Portland, ME.\n  Bull Jagger opened in the fall of 2011 with two employees and a dream \nto produce high-quality lager. In a 1,500-square-foot space in \nPortland's Riverside Industrial Park, the two owners, Tom Bull and \nAllan Jagger, have begun producing the Portland Lager. In their small \nfacility, they currently produce about eight barrels a week which makes \napproximately 1,800 bottles of the refreshing beverage. Their lager \ndebuted at the Portland Harvest on the Harbor in October of 2011 to \nrave reviews.\n  This success is truly exceptional as only a few years ago, Tom Bull, \na Bath native who has worked at local companies such as Gritty McDuff's \nand the former Stone Coast Brewing, was developing his own homemade \nbeer and dreaming of opening a micro-lager business. Fortunately, after \nmeeting through mutual friends and tasting Tom's homebrew, local \nbusinessman Allan Jagger was convinced that Tom's dream was worth \npursuing. Together as partners, they decided to turn their aspirations \ninto reality and venture into Maine's micro-brew market.\n  Across the State, both Tom and Allan found that Maine's micro-brew \nmarket lacked one particular beer variety--a micro-brew lager. While \nlarger breweries all produce lagers, most micro-breweries shy away from \nlagers because of the increased length of brewing time in comparison to \nales. Typically, lager has to sit in a cold cellar for several weeks to \nallow proper fermentation to occur. While this may have deterred other \nmicro-breweries in the past, Bull Jagger believed their lager would be \nworth the wait, and they were certainly right. In true lager fashion, \nthis small brewery allows their lager to ferment over 6 weeks, which is \napproximately a month longer than traditional ales. This may have \ndiminished the speed with which the product leaves the factory, but it \ncertainly has not slowed down the consumption, as sales are continuing \nto grow.\n  As a new small business that has already distinguished itself in \nMaine's prominent micro-brew market, Bull Jagger is looking forward to \nproducing additional varieties, including a Pilsner beer, in the near \nfuture. This small firm's attention to detail and initial success \ndemonstrates the remarkable quality of their product. I am proud to \nextend my congratulations to Tom Bull and Allan Jagger for their \ntremendous efforts, and offer my best wishes for the continued success \nof Bull Jagger Brewing Company.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/01/senate-section/article/S258-3", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S258-S259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ERICA MARIE D'AQUIN\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I recognize Ms. Erica Marie \nd'Aquin, a bright and talented young Louisianian.\n  Each year since 1743, the carnival celebration known as Mardi Gras, \nFrench for Fat Tuesday, has been celebrated by the people of New \nOrleans. The season officially begins on January 6, the Twelfth Night \nof Christmas and the Feast of the Epiphany. Also recognized in many \ncountries around the world with large Roman Catholic populations, Mardi \nGras is the final blow out party prior to the ritual fasting of the \nLenten Season, which begins on Ash Wednesday.\n  Over the many decades that New Orleanians have celebrated Mardi Gras, \n``krewes'', or private Mardi Gras social organizations, have also \ncontributed to the merriment and glee surrounding the festive season. \nIn Greek mythology, Endymion was known for his everlasting youth and \nbeauty. In 1966, the Krewe of Endymion was established and has annually \nparaded through the streets of New Orleans. Today, Endymion is known \nfor being the largest parade in New Orleans, both for the number of \nmembers--2300--and also for the number of floats. This krewe has meant \na lot to me since I had one of my first jobs as a high school student \npainting Endymion's floats--white primer only, as I wasn't trusted with \ncolors.\n  During this, the Krewe of Endymion's 46th year, Ms. Erica Marie \nd'Aquin will reign as queen. Ms. d'Aquin is a senior at Archbishop \nChapelle High School and is on the distinguished honor roll. She is a \nmember of the National Art Honor Society, is a member of the pro-life \nclub, has a fond love for art, and is very active in the Chapelle \nAnimal Rescue Effort to promote the awareness of issues affecting \nanimals. She is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Daryl d'Aquin and the \ngranddaughter Mr. and Mrs. Edmond J. Muniz, the founder and captain of \nthe Krewe of Endymion.\n\n[[Page S259]]\n\n  It is exciting for such an accomplished young person to have this \nhonor and will be something she will cherish for a lifetime. She joins \na long line of family members who have also had the honor of serving as \nqueen of Endymion: her mother Mary in 1984, her aunt Michelle in 1986, \nand her aunt Margie in 1991.\n  As we celebrate the 2012 Mardi Gras season, it is my pleasure to \nhonor Ms. Erica d'Aquin as the 46th queen of the Krewe of \nEndymion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/01/senate-section/article/S259-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING GAIL ACHTERMAN\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize someone \nwho may not be familiar to members of the Senate, but in my State is \nsynonymous with what makes Oregon a place that values the environment, \nits natural resources and its scenery.\n  Gail Achterman of Portland passed away on January 28 of pancreatic \ncancer. Gail was a special friend for more than 40 years. When I \narrived on the Stanford University campus in the summer of 1969, Gail \nand I were tour guides together, two Democrats at the conservative \nHoover Institution of War, Revolution and Peace. We laughed about it \nthen, and kept sharing jokes and stories for more than 40 years.\n  Gail leaves behind an impressive legacy of public service and \ndedication to environmental causes that will endure for years to come. \nHer professional resume is impressive: Lawyer, director of the \nInstitute for Natural Resources at Oregon State University, chair of \nthe Oregon Transportation Commission, natural resources advisor to a \nformer governor and member of too many State councils, boards and \ncommissions to list here.\n  Even more impressive, however, was her life-long commitment to those \nthings that make Oregon great. For an example, look no further than the \nindispensable role she played in creation of the Columbia Gorge \nNational Scenic Area in 1981. Anyone who has seen the majestic Columbia \nRiver Gorge knows it is one of the most beautiful places on earth--a \ncrown jewel in a landscape filled with natural beauty.

By Mr. BEGICH (for himself, Mr. Thune, Mr. Tester, Mr. Blunt, \n        Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hoeven, Mr. Brown of \n        Massachusetts, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Johanns, Mr. Casey, \n        Mr. McCain, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Johnson of Wisconsin, \n        Mr. Burr, Mr. Risch,\n\n[[Page S263]]\n\n        Mr. Toomey, Mr. Paul, Mr. Coburn, and Mrs. Shaheen):\n  S. 2054. A bill to suspend the current compensation packages for the \nsenior executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and to establish \ncompensation for all employees of such entities in accordance with \nrates of pay for other Federal financial regulatory agencies; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. BEGICH. The STOP Act is the Stop the Outrageous Pay for Fannie \nand Freddie Act, the bill Senator Thune and I introduced this morning. \nOur bill comes in the aftermath of a series of events that began last \nNovember when reports surfaced that the Federal Housing Finance Agency, \nFHFA, approved nearly $13 million in bonuses for 10 executives, that \nenterprise that supervises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  In response, Senator Thune and I spearheaded a bipartisan letter, \nsigned by 58 other Senators to the FHFA, Acting Director Edward DeMarco \nand the Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner. We expressed outrage over \nthese pay levels, and I believe our message was heard. Almost 3 months \nafter our letter was sent, the pressure was clearly on. Government \nregulators were cutting the pay of the executives they hired to replace \nthe departing heads of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  Also, in response to our efforts, House Financial Services Committee \nchairman Spencer Bachus introduced legislation suspending these bonuses \nand limiting future compensation packages for Fannie and Freddie \nemployees. In November, his committee passed the bill by a vote of 52 \nto 4.\n  The Begich-Thune STOP Act is a commonsense approach to address the \noutrageous Wall Street-like bonuses and pay that have occurred at \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac for far too long and which continue to occur \nto this day, even after billions in taxpayer bailouts. I wish to make \nit clear, this bill will not change the life much for nonexecutives. \nThe pay structure for the everyday, hard-working Americans at Fannie \nand Freddie will stay almost as it is today. They are not the target. \nHowever, it will change the life for executives such as Peter Federico, \nwho earned $2.5 million in 2010 and had a target compensation of $2.6 \nmillion in 2011. This was at the same time he was gambling that \nstruggling homeowners would be unable to refinance their high-interest \nmortgages to record-low interest rates. This is unacceptable, \nunethical, and I know this body will not tolerate it.\n  Here is how our legislation works: It simply places Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac employees on the same pay scale as the financial regulators \nat the FDIC and SEC, a pay scale long established in Federal law. It is \na pay scale called the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and \nEnforcement Act. This is the pay scale we are basing our legislation \non.\n  Under our approach, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac employees cannot be \npaid more than employees of other Federal financial regulatory \nagencies. Right now the highest paid person under this pay scale makes \n$275,000 a year. This is our pay cap. While this is a lot of money, it \nis not any more than what the cops, as we call them, on the financial \nbeat make to ensure that ordinary Americans are protected and get a \nfair shake.\n  Our legislation also stops any future bonus payments that go beyond \nthe cap established in this legislation. Also, any bonuses that have \nbeen granted but have not yet been paid will be stopped. Any money in \nexcess of the cap we have established will be used to pay down the \nnational debt. Finally, our bill requires that Fannie and Freddie \nsalaries be made available to Congress and the public through the \nSenate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee.\n  I am aware of the criticism of this bill and I would like to address \nthem. Senator McCain offered an amendment yesterday that freezes bonus \npay. I support Senator McCain in his efforts. In fact, I cosponsored \nthis very same amendment the last time it was offered. Many of my \ncolleagues have asked me why our bill does not freeze bonus pay. Our \nbill is based on a broad-based approach that looks at the entire pay \nstructure within Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  While it tackles the huge bonuses and pay policies for executives at \nFannie and Freddie, we believe the everyday employees earning modest \nsalaries should be occasionally rewarded for outstanding work so it \nensures they get the small bonuses that may be effective for them. But \nto clarify, these would be modest bonuses that would never exceed the \npay cap established in this bill.\n  I have also heard the concern that Fannie and Freddie will not be \nable to attract the right kind of talent if they cannot pay people \nmultimillion-dollar compensation packages. I hate to state the obvious: \nFannie and Freddie have proven the opposite. They paid executives \noutrageous compensation and yet still failed by Alaskans and all \nAmericans. They needed hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer \nbailouts and still ended up in conservatorship. This sends an \nunsettling message to millions of hard-working people who are \nstruggling to make ends meet. They have taken Alaskans' tax dollars in \nthe form of bailouts. Yet when my constituents in Anchorage or Kotzebue \nor Fairbanks or Juneau needed help to avoid foreclosure or refinance \ntheir loans, Fannie and Freddie often turned their backs.\n  Finally, I have this response to people who say Fannie and Freddie \nexecutives need to earn millions: Whatever happened to the concept of \npublic service or to the notion that it is an honorable calling to work \non behalf of your friends and your neighbors? There are lots of \ndedicated, hard-working professionals at Fannie and Freddie who believe \nin that notion, and they are doing their absolute best to help American \nfamilies to afford the American dream of owning and keeping their \nhomes.\n  The Begich-Thune bill makes sure this hard work continues and that \ntheir bosses at Fannie and Freddie come to work every day not with \nvisions of dollar signs but instead with a clear eye of doing what is \nright for all Americans.\n  I urge all Members to support this commonsense bipartisan bill. \nSenators Tester, McCaskill, Baucus, Blunt, Grassley, Hoeven, Enzi, and \nScott Brown have already joined Senator Thune and me as original \ncosponsors. I wish to thank them for their support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Begich, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Harkin, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n        Reed):\n  S. 2059. A bill to reduce the deficit by imposing a minimum effective \ntax rate for high-income taxpayers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, we are in an age of tight budgets and \ntough choices, and I rise today to introduce legislation that would \naddress some loopholes in the Tax Code that provide ways for Americans \nwith superhigh incomes to pay lower tax rates than are paid by regular \nhardworking, middle-class families. These middle-class families feel \nthey are struggling to get by but then find that some people with \nextremely high incomes are actually paying a lower, all-in federal tax \nrate than they are. To them, it defies common sense, and I think for \nall of us it defies common sense. Americans deserve a straight deal, \nand right now they are not getting one from our tax system.\n\n  To see the unfairness of our current tax system, we don't have to \nlook much further than the national headlines. According to a Forbes \nmagazine report last fall, billionaire Warren Buffet ``paid just 11.06 \npercent of his adjusted gross income in Federal income taxes'' in 2010. \nMr. Buffet is the first to express his dismay at this circumstance and \nacknowledges that the rate he pays is lower than the tax rate paid by \nhis own secretary. Mr. Buffet has called for a correction of this \nanomaly, and I agree with him. So does President Obama, who, in his \nState of the Union Address, said Washington should stop subsidizing \nmillionaires. I agree.\n  We should celebrate the success of people who are earning $1 million \nand more a year, but we don't--particularly in this time of tight \nbudgets and hard choices--need to subsidize that. The legislation I \nhave introduced today, the Paying a Fair Share Act of 2012, would \nensure that those with extremely high incomes pay at least a minimum \nFederal tax rate of 30 percent. I thank Senators Akaka, Begich, Leahy, \nHarkin, Blumenthal, and Sanders for being initial cosponsors of this \nmeasure.\n\n[[Page S264]]\n\n  The structure of our bill is pretty simple. If your total income--\ncapital gains included--is over $1 million, you calculate your taxes \nunder the regular system. If your effective tax rate turns out to be \ngreater than 30 percent, you pay that rate. If, on the other hand, your \neffective tax rate is under 30 percent, like Warren Buffet's 11 \npercent, then you would pay the fair share tax rate.\n  After collecting input from some of my colleagues, I have also \nincluded a provision to allow the fair share tax to be gradually phased \nin for taxpayers earning between $1 million and $2 million per year. \nTaxpayers earning less than $1 million--which is 99.9 percent of all \nAmericans--wouldn't be affected by this bill at all. Taxpayers earning \nover $2 million would be subject to the 30 percent minimum Federal tax \nrate, and those in between $1 million and $2 million would pay, on a \nphased-in basis, a portion of the extra tax required to get up to the \n30-percent effective tax rate. This way we make sure no taxpayer faces \na tax cliff where earning an additional $1 of income increases his or \nher taxes by more than $1.\n  In his State of the Union Address on Tuesday, President Obama called \nfor legislation to ensure that the highest earning taxpayers pay at \nleast a 30-percent tax rate. The Fair Share Act would do just that. To \ncall our tax system fair, I believe the highest income Americans should \npay a higher rate--not a lower one--than middle-income taxpayers. For \nmore context, let's take a look again--because I have given this speech \nover and over on the floor--at how superhigh-income-tax payers fare \nunder our current system.\n  This is the Helmsley Building in New York, as I have pointed out \nbefore. It is on Park Avenue, and it has a unique characteristic, which \nis that it is so big it has its own ZIP Code. Because the Internal \nRevenue Service publishes information about tax payment by ZIP Code, we \ncan see what the tax payments are that come out of this building. What \nwe find with the latest information that the IRS has published is that \nthe average filer has an adjusted gross income of over $1 million in \nthe Helmsley Building, but the average tax payment out of that building \nis only 14.7 percent.\n  To provide a little context for that, if we look at what the average \nNew York City janitor or the average New York City security guard pays \nin terms of an effective all-in Federal tax rate, it is 28.3 percent \nfor the security guard and 24.9 percent for the janitor. So at this \npoint it looks as if the people who are the very successful occupants \nof the Helmsley Building pay an actual lower Federal tax rate than the \npeople who come in and clean the building, and that does not seem fair \nor sensible.\n  One might say, well, maybe it is just something about the Helmsley \nBuilding that causes it, but it is not. Despite Leona Helmsley's \ninfamous line that it is only the little people who pay the taxes, it \nis a broader issue than that. Take a look at the income tax information \nabout the 400 highest earning Americans.\n  In the same way that the IRS aggregates information by ZIP Code, it \nalso takes the highest income earners and reports on them in aggregate. \nThe 400 top incomes for 2008--which is the last year the IRS has \nassembled--had an average income each of $270 million, which certainly \nis something to be proud of and to celebrate if one can achieve that \nkind of success. But the average tax rate paid by the 400 was only 18.2 \npercent, which is--apart from the discussions we have been having in \nthe Senate--about what the top income tax rate should be.\n  We discuss often whether the top income tax rate should be 35 percent \nor should be 39.6 percent. It was 39.6 percent, for instance, during \nthe booming Clinton economy. It is now 35 percent. Depending on where \nthe tax cut discussion goes, it may go back up again. But that is not \nwhat a large number of these very high income earners pay. In fact, the \ntop 400 aren't anywhere near that. They are at half that, at 18.2 \npercent. We are supposed to have a progressively graduated Tax Code, \nwith people who earn more paying a higher rate.\n  Let's see who else pays at the 18.2-percent rate. We looked at Bureau \nof Labor Statistics information for a single filer earning $39,350. \nThat is where you hit an 18.2-percent tax rate, just like the 400 who \nmade $\\1/4\\ billion each, on average. They are in the same position as \nsomebody who is earning a little less than 40,000 who pays 18.2 percent \nunder our present system. If we look at the type of jobs that hit that \narea, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the Rhode Island \nlabor market a truckdriver earns on average $40,200. So we have a \ntruckdriver paying the same rate of Federal tax as somebody earning \n$\\1/4\\ billion in a year.\n  So I think there is plenty of room for correction and to bring our \ntax system in line to the principle that I think we all espouse \ntheoretically, which is that it is a progressive tax system. The more \nyou earn, the more you pay and indeed the higher rate you are supposed \nto pay. It is not supposed to be at the other way around where, at the \nother high extreme, you end up paying lower rates than regular \nAmericans.\n  The Helmsley Building was one building that has a little story to \ntell all of us. Here is another building with a story to tell. This is \na building that is called Ugland House, and it is in the tax haven \nCayman Islands. It doesn't look like much, does it? I don't want to say \nit is a crummy little building, but it certainly doesn't compare to a \nlot of other business buildings. But it does have something remarkable \nhappening within it. It has 18,000 corporations that claim to be doing \nbusiness out of this location--18,000 corporations in this little five-\nstory building. It gives a new meaning to the phrase ``small \nbusiness.''\n  As our budget chairman Kent Conrad has pointed out, the only business \ngoing on in Ugland House is funny business with our Tax Code, shell \ncompanies that hide assets and dodge tax liabilities. It does not make \nsense that our tax system permits the highest income Americans to pay a \nlower tax rate than a truckdriver pays, and it doesn't make sense that \nwe allow Americans and American companies by the thousands to hide \nincome in offshore tax havens.\n  If we look at the rates that are paid--Warren Buffet 11.6 percent, \nthe occupants of the Helmsley Building on average 14.7 percent, and the \n400 $\\1/4\\ billion-a-year earners on average 18.2 percent--and we look \nat the fact that we have multi-trillion-dollar budget deficits, it \nmeans the taxes they are not paying at the nominal 35-percent rate are \ntaxes that somebody else ends up having to pay either through deficit \nor through additional taxation.\n  This is why the Fair Share Act makes a lot of common sense, and I \nhope Senators on both sides of the aisle will take a look at it. This \nbill would do a lot of good. It would simplify taxes. There is no point \nchasing loopholes if someone knows they are going to have to pay the \n30-percent minimum. It will simplify that. It would discourage the \nexotic tax dodges that allow people to go down to 14 percent or \nwhatever tax rates because they know they are going to get caught at 30 \npercent, so why do the effort. The exotic tax dodges will be \ndiscouraged. It will reduce the deficit. We don't have a number yet \nfrom the Joint Committee on Taxation, but the public reporting so far \nhas suggested it is going to be in the $40 billion to $50 billion range \nper year. Of course, it will bring fairness, as well as common sense, \nto our tax system. It makes no sense for somebody earning $80,000 or \n$100,000 or $120,000 a year to be paying a substantially higher tax \nrate than somebody earning $\\1/4\\ billion a year.\n  There are a lot of advantages that come with enormous income, and \nthat is a great thing because America thrives on capitalism, and we all \nlove success. We celebrate success in America. We provide an economy \nand a culture in which people can accomplish remarkable things and \ncreate enormous fortunes and become enormously successful. That is part \nof what is good and what is right with America. They do it through hard \nwork, they do it through being smarter than other people, they do it \nwith a lot of good personal characteristics. But with all the \nadvantages that do come with an enormous income, paying a lower tax \nrate than regular working families should not be one of those \nadvantages.\n  I hope we can get together to correct this, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n\n[[Page S265]]\n\n  S. 2060. A bill to provide for the payment of a benefit to members \neligible for participation in the Post-Deployment/Mobilization Respite \nAbsence program for days of nonparticipation due to Government error; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Military \nLeave Act. This legislation fixes a problem that is preventing some of \nour brave servicemembers from using benefits that they earned after \nserving multiple or extended deployments overseas.\n  In 2007, the military established the Post-Deployment/Mobilization \nRespite Absence Program, or PDMRA, to assist men and women who are \nordered to deploy beyond the established standards for troop rotation \nby providing extra paid leave when they return home. Unfortunately, a \nmistake during demobilization prevented some soldiers from receiving \nthe paid leave they earned. The Army's records indicate that this \nproblem affects 577 soldiers across the country, including 80 in \nWisconsin.\n  These soldiers have since gotten their military records corrected to \nreflect the days of PDMRA leave they were supposed to receive. However, \nthe only way for these soldiers to use this benefit is to take extra \npaid leave on a future deployment. For those soldiers who will not \ndeploy again or who have left the military entirely, this remedy does \nnot work.\n  Mistakes happen, but they need to be fixed. The Fair Military Leave \nAct gives troops the option of cashing out the leave they were \nincorrectly denied when they came home. This solution is modeled after \nlegislation Congress passed in the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor fiscal year 2010. As with that bill, the Fair Military Leave Act \nreimburses soldiers at a rate of $200 per day of PDMRA that they were \nincorrectly denied.\n  I am pleased to have the senior Senator from Oregon join me as an \noriginal cosponsor of this legislation. My friend from Oregon led the \neffort to fix the earlier problem with PDMRA benefits in the 2010 \ndefense authorization.\n  The men and women of our Armed Forces have done so much for our \ncountry, and we should not drag our feet in making this right. These \ntroops earned their PDMRA benefit, and they should be allowed to use \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/01/senate-section/article/S265-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 365--HONORING THE LIFE OF KEVIN HAGAN WHITE, THE \n            MAYOR OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS FROM 1968 TO 1984\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Brown of Massachusetts) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 365\n\n       Whereas Kevin White was born in Boston on September 25, \n     1929;\n       Whereas his father, Joseph C. White, a legislator of the \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts; his maternal grandfather, \n     Henry E. Hagan; and his father-in-law, William Galvin; each \n     served as presidents of the Boston City Council;\n       Whereas Kevin White earned a bachelor's degree from \n     Williams College in 1952, a law degree from Boston College in \n     1955, and also studied at the Harvard Graduate School of \n     Public Administration, now the John F. Kennedy School of \n     Government;\n       Whereas in 1956, Kevin White married Kathryn Galvin;\n       Whereas in 1960, at the age of 31, Kevin White was elected \n     Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and was \n     reelected 3 times, serving until 1967;\n       Whereas in January 1968, Kevin White became the 51st Mayor \n     of the City of Boston, Massachusetts;\n       Whereas within months after taking office as Mayor of \n     Boston, Kevin White was instrumental in helping guide the \n     City of Boston after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther \n     King, Jr.;\n       Whereas on April 5, 1968, Mayor White asked that the James \n     Brown concert at the Boston Garden be televised rather than \n     be cancelled, as many suggested;\n       Whereas during the concert, Mayor White addressed the \n     citizens to plead for calm and said, ``Twenty four hours ago \n     Dr. King died for all of us, black and white, that we may \n     live together in harmony without violence, and in peace. I'm \n     here to ask for your help and to ask you to stay with me as \n     your mayor, and to make Dr. King's dream a reality in Boston. \n     No matter what any other community might do, we in Boston \n     will honor Dr. King in peace.'';\n       Whereas during his time as Mayor of Boston, Kevin White \n     undertook a program of urban revitalization of the downtown \n     areas of Boston that forever transformed Faneuil Hall and \n     Quincy Market;\n       Whereas during his time as Mayor, Kevin White brought the \n     residents of each neighborhood of Boston, from Mattapan to \n     Charlestown, from South Boston to Brighton, from East Boston \n     to West Roxbury, together through programs like Summerthing, \n     Little City Halls, and jobs for at-risk youth;\n       Whereas in 1974, Judge W. Arthur Garrity Jr. of the United \n     States District Court for the District of Massachusetts \n     ordered Boston to begin busing children to integrate its \n     schools;\n       Whereas during a difficult period of racial tension for the \n     City of Boston, Mayor White urged the people of Boston to \n     remember their common identity;\n       Whereas from 1984 to 2002, Kevin White was the director of \n     the Institute for Political Communication at Boston \n     University;\n       Whereas Mayor White valiantly fought against Alzheimer's \n     disease after his diagnosis in 2003 and despite this \n     debilitating challenge, he never stopped being an example of \n     strength for the City of Boston and his family;\n       Whereas Kevin White is survived by his wife, Kathryn; a \n     brother, Terrence, who managed his early campaigns; his sons, \n     Mark and Chris; his daughters, Caitlin, Beth, and Patricia; \n     his 7 grandchildren; and his sister, Maureen Mercier;\n       Whereas the most famous campaign slogan coined Kevin White, \n     ``A loner in love with the city''; and\n       Whereas the irony of the slogan is that Kevin White was \n     never lonely and that the people of Boston who he loved so \n     much, loved him back: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) recognizes that Kevin White forever enriched the Boston \n     political landscape and forged a new path for the City of \n     Boston;\n       (B) pays tribute to the work by Kevin White to improve the \n     lives of the residents of the City of Boston; and\n       (C) requests the Secretary of the Senate to prepare an \n     official copy of this resolution for presentation to the \n     family of Kevin White; and\n       (2) when the Senate adjourns today, it stand adjourned as a \n     mark of respect to the memory of former Boston Mayor Kevin \n     Hagan White.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/02/01/senate-section/article/S277-1", "month": "02", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING THE LIFE OF WILMAN VILLAR MENDOZA AND CONDEMNING THE CASTRO \n                                 REGIME\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND.
