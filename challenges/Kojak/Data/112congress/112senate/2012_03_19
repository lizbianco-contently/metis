Mr. President, this week the Senate resumes debate on a \nmeasure to improve innovators' access to capital. This bill passed the \nHouse on a bipartisan vote and has President Obama's support. We could \nmake this legislation even better by passing the modest consumer \nprotections included in the substitute amendment we will consider \ntomorrow. But Members of both parties agree we should pass it quickly. \nWe will finish work on this legislation this week.\n  It is nice to see Democrats and Republicans standing on common ground \nfor a change. But while this IPO proposal will be good for business--\nhelping to give startups the flexibility they need to hire and grow--\nexperts agree its impact on job creation will be limited. The IPO bill \nis a good bill, but we all recognize its job creation impact will be \nfairly limited.\n  We want to do something with this legislation to increase the amount \nof jobs that will be forthcoming soon, which we have done. So as part \nof this IPO bill, it is important Congress also reauthorize the Ex-Im \nBank, and do it now.\n  Reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank will help American exporters \ncompete in a global economy and sell more of their products overseas. \nLast year, Ex-Im Bank financing helped 3,600 private companies and \nalmost 300,000 jobs were added in more than 2,000 communities. That is \nwhy the Ex-Im Bank has always enjoyed broad bipartisan support.\n  The last time this measure came before the body, it was offered by a \nRepublican Senator and was passed by unanimous consent. The \nreauthorization legislation we will vote on tomorrow is also \nbipartisan. It passed the Banking Committee unanimously. It has three \nRepublican cosponsors and the strong backing of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce. Yet I read that some of my Republican colleagues don't want \nto advance this bipartisan measure.\n  Remember, it does not increase the debt whatsoever. Instead, I have \nbeen told that some Republicans want to start another drawn-out, \nknockdown fight over a proposal that passed unanimously the last time \nthe Senate considered it. It doesn't make sense.\n  So let's review what is at stake. Unless Congress acts, Ex-Im Bank \nmay hit its lending limit this month. American exporters could no \nlonger rely on an even playing field with global competitors.\n  The Ex-Im Bank loans money to American businesses when private \nlending is not available. Its investments made $41 billion in U.S. \nexports possible last year alone. That is why Ex-Im Bank Chairman Fred \nHochberg says our competitors abroad ``are licking their chops'' at the \nidea that America would stop backing businesses that sell their \nproducts overseas.\n\n  Many of the businesses that are growing and hiring because of Export-\nImport Bank financing are small businesses. But the men and women who\n\n[[Page S1764]]\n\nrun large outfits such as Boeing, American Express, Johnson & Johnson, \nCaterpillar, GE, and Motorola are also on record in supporting the Ex-\nIm Bank.\n  American entrepreneurs can't afford Congress to give up on them now. \nChina already provides three to four times as much financing as we do \nto help Chinese exporters. So we must help American exporters. We must \ncontinue to give American businesses a fair shot to compete in a global \nmarket. Since Ex-Im Bank doesn't add a penny to the deficit, there is \nno excuse for Republicans not to support it. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office says this commonsense legislation will \nactually reduce the deficit by about $1 billion.\n  It is critical we pass the IPO bill to help businesses access \ncapital, but it is even more important we reauthorize the job-creating \nExport-Import Bank which helps those companies compete abroad. This \nproposal will support hundreds of thousands of more jobs in the small \nbusiness capital bill. Together it will be a real knockout. It will be \ngreat for America.\n  Democrats brought this measure to the floor in an effort to find more \ncommon ground, and passing it would be another major accomplishment of \nwhich both parties can be proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/19/senate-section/article/S1764-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today I rise to discuss H.R. 3606, the so-\ncalled JOBS Act. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Securities, \nInsurance, and Investment of the Senate Banking Committee, I wish all \nof my colleagues to know this legislation, as it is currently drafted, \nis not ready to become law--and if it does, it could have unintended \nconsequences that will hurt investors, seniors, and average American \nfamilies.\n  One of the supposed premises behind this legislation is that if we \njust deregulate the securities market, then more companies will choose \nto issue public stock. The only reason they have been deterred from \ngoing to the public markets, according to this view, is the excessive \nregulatory burdens placed upon them.\n  The Banking Committee has been holding a series of hearings on \ndifferent provisions in this legislation, and the reason we have \ndiscovered there have been fewer IPOs does not appear to be connected \nto regulatory burdens in any real way, but it appears to be more \nconnected to economic and geographic factors. That being said, many of \nus hear on a daily basis, despite the recent financial crisis, about \nhow the American regulatory system is making us less competitive, \nespecially in the context of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act.\n  In fact, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Lynn \nTurner, a former SEC chief accountant, states that the data says \notherwise. In his words:\n\n       The reason IPOs track the economy is that investors invest \n     to earn a return. When the economy is growing, companies can \n     grow. . . . However, when the economy has stalled or is \n     declining, and companies are not growing, investors simply \n     cannot achieve the types of return they need to justify \n     making an investment. . . . As a result of the downturns in \n     the economy that occurred during much of the 1970s brought on \n     in part by withdrawal from Vietnam, the recession brought on \n     by inflation at the beginning of the 1980s, the dot com \n     bubble and the corporate scandals, and the most recent great \n     recession, investors became concerned about returns that \n     could be earned in the markets and IPOs declined. As the \n     economy and employment have recovered after each of these \n     downturns, so has the IPO market.\n\n  Mr. Turner went on to state when he served on a Colorado commission \nthat was exploring why so many small companies were failing in \nColorado, he said:\n\n       [W]e found that access to capital was not the primary cause \n     of failure. Rather it was lack of sufficient expertise and \n     management within the company including in such areas as \n     marketing and operations. While access to sufficient capital \n     for any company is important, I have found that those \n     emerging companies with better management teams and proven \n     products, or products with great growth potential are able to \n     obtain it. Those are the types of companies VCs and private \n     equities seek out.\n\n  VCs are venture capital companies.\n  As another securities expert, Professor Mercer Bullard, the Jessie D. \nPuckett, Jr. Lecturer and Associate Professor of Law at the University \nof Mississippi School of Law, wrote to me in a letter dated March 15 of \nthis year:\n\n       The exemption for emerging growth companies would exempt so \n     many companies from key investor protection provisions that \n     the world-leading brand that is the ``U.S. public company'' \n     would be substantially weakened.\n\n  So how do we find the balance between facilitating capital formation \nwhile maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets and protecting \ninvestors?\n  As chair of the Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance and Investment, \nI want all of my colleagues to know this legislation, as it is \ncurrently drafted, does not have that right balance.\n  We are getting inundated with letters and phone calls from securities \nexperts from around the country saying: Please slow down and let this \nlegislation be improved and amended. On Friday, Commissioner Luis \nAguilar of the Securities and Exchange Commission stated:\n\n       It is clear to me that H.R. 3606 in its current form \n     weakens or eliminated many regulations designed to safeguard \n     investors. I must voice my concerns because as an SEC \n     Commissioner, I cannot sit idly by when I see potential \n     legislation that could harm investors. This bill seems to \n     impose tremendous costs and potential harm on investors with \n     little or no corresponding benefit.\n\n  The Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary \nSchapiro, wrote in a letter dated March 13, 2012:\n\n       While I recognize that H.R. 3606 is the product of a \n     bipartisan effort designed to facilitate capital formation \n     and includes certain promising approaches, I believe there \n     are provisions that should be added or modified to improve \n     investor protections that are worthy of Senate consideration.\n\n  In a Banking Committee hearing we held on March 6, 2012, Professor \nJay Ritter, the Cordell Professor of Finance of the University of \nFlorida, also testified that we should be careful because some of these \nbills could actually decrease capital formation and discourage job \ngrowth. He stated:\n\n       It is possible that by making it easier to raise money \n     privately, creating some liquidity without being public, \n     restricting information that stockholders have access to . . \n     . restricting the ability of public market shareholders to \n     constrain managers after investors contribute capital, and \n     driving out independent research, the net effects of these \n     bills might be to reduce capital formation and/or the number \n     of small IPOs.\n\n  In a hearing before the Securities, Insurance, and Investment \nSubcommittee in December, Professor John Coates, the John F. Cogan \nProfessor of Law and Economics at Harvard Law School told us some of \nthe proposals in the House bill actually have the potential to harm job \ngrowth. He stated:\n\n       Whether the proposals will in fact increase job growth \n     depends on how intensively they will lower offer costs, how \n     extensively new offerings will take advantage of the new \n     means of raising capital, how much more fraud can be expected \n     to occur as a result of the changes, how serious the fraud \n     will be, and how much the reduction in information \n     verifiability will be as a result of these changes. . . . \n     Thus, the proposals could not only generate front-page \n     scandals, but reduce the very thing they are being promoted \n     to increase: Job growth.\n\n  In other words, if these bills don't protect investors enough more \nfraud will occur, and it will actually decrease access to capital for \nsmaller companies.\n  We have also heard from respected business commentators about the\n\n[[Page S1765]]\n\nshortcomings of the House bill. Steve Pearlstein, the noted business \ncolumnist for the Washington Post, wrote:\n\n       What we know from painful experience--from the mortgage and \n     credit bubble, from Enron, WorldCom and the tech and telecom \n     boom, from the savings and loan crisis and the junk bond \n     scandal and generations of penny-stock scandals--is that \n     financial markets are incapable of self-regulation. In fact, \n     they are prone to just about every type of market failure \n     listed in economic textbooks.\n\n  Pearlstein points out the characteristics of markets that can lead to \nfailures. First, there is the prevailing problem of asymmetric \ninformation. Insiders typically know, or should know, a lot about their \ncompany. If key information is withheld, investors are denied critical \ninformation to make informed judgments. The House bill would, under the \nguise of ``streamlining,'' undercut necessary disclosures which are \nessential to protect investors. He further notes the misalignment of \nincentives between promoters of securities and investors. Once the sale \nis complete, the promoter typically moves on to other targets.\n  The investor depends on the performance of the company to validate \nthe investment, and that usually takes time. Indeed, in many respects, \nit is the issue of the short run versus the long run that distinguishes \nsound investments from get-rich-quick schemes. The disclosures inherent \nin the securities laws have, over 80 years, attempted to strike a \nbalance--to provide investors with the information to make sound long-\nterm investments and to thwart the ``fast-buck'' promoters in for a \nquick kill. The House bill seriously undermines these disclosures.\n  The editors of Bloomberg have also weighed in with telling criticism \nof the House bill. They point out:\n\n       Supporters of the [House] bill point to the falloff in \n     initial public offerings as evidence that regulatory costs \n     are dissuading entrepreneurs from creating businesses or \n     taking them public. And they say rescinding the analyst \n     research restrictions would benefit small companies, which \n     Wall Street otherwise ignores. That sounds great in theory, \n     but the reality offers a different picture. It's true the \n     number of initial offerings has declined, but evidence \n     suggests that has less to do with regulation and more to do \n     with global economic trends.\n\n  That is according to the Bloomberg editors.\n  They go on to point out the conclusions of Professor Jay Ritter, whom \nI have already cited. Again according to Bloomberg, Professor Ritter \n``has documented, the decline in IPOs is related to declining \nprofitability of small business. Many are opting to merge with larger \ncompanies to quickly get bigger and more profitable, rather than go \npublic.''\n  The Bloomberg editors further point out:\n\n       Many of the rules the [House] bill seeks to upend have \n     helped companies, including the internal controls rule. An \n     SEC study, for example, found that such audits helped \n     companies avoid financial restatements, which are costly \n     exercises that often drive down share prices.\n\n  They conclude:\n\n       It shouldn't be necessary to gut investor safeguards to \n     promote job creation. If investors lose confidence because of \n     worries about fraud, they will demand a higher return on \n     their money, raising the cost of capital for all.\n\n  Floyd Norris, the respected financial writer for the New York Times, \nstruck similar themes and criticisms in an article last week. He asked:\n\n       Do you remember the scandals of the dot-com era? Then Wall \n     Street firms got business by promising companies that they \n     would write positive research reports if the company would \n     only hire them to underwrite an initial public offering of \n     stock. Companies went public at a feverish pitch, often \n     rising to amazing heights without much in the way of sales, \n     let alone profits. Then it all came crashing down.\n       In the aftermath, the brokers were forced by the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission, as well as the New York attorney \n     general, to mend their ways. No longer would analysts be \n     allowed to go on such IPO sales calls.\n\n  Norris goes on:\n\n       This bill would end that rule for all but the biggest new \n     offerings--those that involved companies with sales of over \n     $1 billion. And it would go much further. As the law stands \n     now, to keep underwriters from making sales pitches that go \n     beyond what companies are allowed to say, the underwriters \n     are prohibited from publishing research on a company while \n     its initial public offering is under way. This bill would \n     allow such research, and would say that the company bore no \n     responsibility for what was said in it. Effectively, there \n     would be a second prospectus--one largely immune to \n     securities laws and free to hype the offering by making \n     forecasts not otherwise allowed.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       Why is this needed? Advocates point to the fact that there \n     are fewer initial public offerings now than there were during \n     the Internet bubble. That most of those offerings were \n     horrible investments is conveniently ignored. Nor is any \n     consideration given to the idea that once-burned investors \n     might be more wary. The explanation must be excessive and \n     unreasonably expensive regulation.\n\n  Norris went on further to remind his readers of the relentless \ningenuity of promoters trying to circumvent the disclosure laws under \nthe securities acts. He recalled the recent activities of Chinese \ncompanies to gain access to American investors without full disclosure \nthrough the process of reverse mergers. He pointed out:\n\n       Last year, the SEC, worried about a spate of frauds, \n     required Chinese companies to follow the same rules that \n     American ones do, with prospectuses made public as soon as \n     they were filed. Since last summer, there have been no new \n     Chinese initial public offerings in the United States. That \n     tightening of regulation would be reversed by this bill.\n\n  He went on to quote Paul Gillis, a former auditor for \nPricewaterhouseCoopers in China who is now a visiting professor of \naccounting at Peking University. Mr. Gillis's words:\n\n       If you like those e-mails from Nigerian scammers, wait \n     until you see the new round about to come from shady Chinese \n     companies looking for investment--and they will be legal.\n\n  In an interview, Mr. Gillis praised section 404, the part of the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that requires companies going public to have \neffective internal controls and for auditors to certify them. He said:\n\n       When companies list, they hire consultants to help them \n     design internal control systems to provide integrity in their \n     reports. These control systems are new to these countries. \n     They have helped significantly. . . .\n\n  The second premise behind this legislation is that access to capital, \nwhether through crowdfunding, mini-offerings, advertising private \nofferings, or more IPOs, will lead to more jobs. In actuality, in this \ncase it is unclear whether more access to capital will temporarily \ncreate jobs and then destroy them or have a minimal effect. Most of the \nexperts we have talked to suggest the effects will be minimal. In \neffect, it could create a bubble like the ones we have seen with \nmortgages, the ones we have seen with dot-coms.\n  If this legislation remains unbalanced, then it is likely to result \nin more unsuccessful investments for investors. Recent history has \nshown this will result in investors ultimately pulling out of the \nmarket, reducing business access to capital and costing families and \nothers money much needed for education and retirement.\n  Like many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I do believe \nthere are some innovative proposals in the House bill, and I believe \nthe amendment I am proposing along with Senator Landrieu and Senator \nLevin--the substitute amendment--includes many of these ideas in a way \nthat better balances market transparency and investor protection with \nimproving small business's access to capital.\n  One of these ideas with merit is the creation of a financial \nframework that allows entrepreneurs and small businesses to raise \ncapital through crowdfunding--relatively small investments from many \nindividuals through online platforms. There is a lot of energy around \nthis concept of crowdfunding. However, this proposal needs to be done \nvery carefully. It is critically important to ensure appropriate \nregulatory oversight for crowdfunding and make sure there is a strong \nbalance between investor protection and improving small business's \naccess to capital.\n  In our bill, this is the place where we envision the smallest \nentrepreneurs could obtain much needed seed capital for their good \nideas.\n  I recently visited a company in Rhode Island called Betaspring. \nInstead of being an incubator for small businesses, Betaspring \nconsiders itself to be a ``boot camp'' for entrepreneurs. Betaspring is \nconstantly trying to help entrepreneurs to access capital, but \nsometimes it is difficult to find enough friends and family who can \nhelp out. But my colleagues, Senators Jeff Merkley, Michael Bennet, and \nScott Brown, have worked long and hard on structuring a bill in this \narea, which we have included in the Reed-Landrieu-Levin substitute \namendment. I will let\n\n[[Page S1766]]\n\nthem talk to you about this part of our amendment in more detail. \nHowever, I believe their crowdfunding language is a vast improvement \nover the House bill, which would permit investors to invest up to the \ngreater of $10,000 or 10 percent of their annual income without having \nto meet any minimum wealth or financial sophistication standards.\n  Not only are issuers exempt from registration from securities \nofferings for up to $2 million in the House bill, it would also exempt \nthe intermediaries who seek to profit from the operation of \ncrowdfunding markets.\n  I think these House provisions are corrected by the approach taken by \nmy colleagues, Senator Merkley, Senator Brown, and Senator Bennet. I \nbelieve the Senate bill they propose addresses many of the concerns \nexpressed by Professor John Coffee of the Columbia University School of \nLaw when he called such crowdfunding provisions the ``Boiler Room \nLegalization Act''--a reference to the bad old days when people \ngathered in what were called boiler rooms and made cold calls to try to \nelicit unwary investors into dubious schemes.\n  There is another section of our bill which will help small and \nmedium-sized companies access larger amounts of money--up to $50 \nmillion--to infuse their businesses with much needed capital.\n  We have proposed a few but very important improvements to the work of \nSenators Tester and Toomey in their legislation and to similar language \nin the House bill.\n  Let me talk about the improvements to the so-called regulation A or \nmini-offering section of the bill to achieve a better balance between \ninvestor protections and access to capital.\n  Like the House bill, our bill raises the amount of money that can be \nraised in a mini-offering process. However, four improvements are made \nin the Reed-Landrieu-Levin amendment.\n  We require that audited financial statements be filed with the mini-\noffering statement so that investors truly know what the financial \nsituation of the company is before they invest.\n  Let me make a point here. The House proposal would not require \naudited financials be filed with the offering documents. I would think \nas a basic premise, if you are making an offering for up to $50 \nmillion, investors deserve to have financial statements signed off on \nby a third party auditor. Our legislation requires it.\n  We require periodic disclosures of material information to investors. \nFor example, perhaps the investor of a certain high-tech product the \ncompany is making leaves the company or passes away or something else \nhappens. Investors deserve to know about that type of information.\n  We limit the amount that can be raised through the mini-offering \nprocess to $50 million every 3 years. The House bill would allow \ninvestors to raise $50 million every 12 months, potentially allowing \nmany companies to avoid going fully public and evading more rigorous \npublic reporting requirements.\n  Finally, we require a study and report on the new mini-offering \nexemption from Securities Act registration. This study is to be \nconducted by the SEC, in consultation with the State securities \nadministrators, and submitted to Congress no later than 5 years after \nthe date of enactment, so that we consider whether any changes need to \nbe made to the mini-offering concept created in this legislation.\n  Although this is still an experiment--to allow general solicitation \nand advertising to retail investors for what are bound to be risky \nofferings--I believe the protections we have built in will make it a \nsafer experiment.\n  We also worked to make some improvements to the initial public \noffering or IPO on-ramp section of the bill.\n  The essence of this proposal in the House is to phase in certain \nsecurities laws and regulations for, in their terms, ``emerging growth \ncompanies'' so they can grow more slowly into becoming a public \ncompany, with all of its benefits and responsibilities.\n  There are companies that have or will outgrow either the reg D \nprivate placement method of raising capital or the new reg A mini-\noffering method of raising capital. But the key issue here is what we \nthink the definition of an ``emerging growth company'' should be.\n  The way the House bill is written, it would exempt virtually all new \npublic companies from nonbinding shareholder votes on say on pay and \nexecutive compensation pay in connection with a merger acquisition; the \nrelationship between executive compensation and the performance of the \nissuer; the requirement under Securities Act section 7 that more than 2 \nyears of audited financial statements be provided for an IPO; and a \nrequirement that the company's auditor attest to the effectiveness of \nthe company's financial systems or internal controls under section \n404(b).\n\n  After discussions with many experts, it is clear that a company with \n$1 billion in annual revenue is not what most of them consider to be an \nemerging growth company. But that is the level the House has chosen, $1 \nbillion in annual revenues.\n  In fact, under this definition, the House bill would have exempted \nmore than 80 percent of current IPOs from registration requirements \nwhich, as I mentioned earlier, are requirements that only recently \nappear to be difficult to manage.\n  As a result, Senators Landrieu, Levin, and I decided this definition \nneeded to be much more targeted toward smaller IPO companies with less \nthan $350 million in annual revenue. Even the House bill would have \nallowed Enron and WorldCom to be subject to this phase-in, in terms of \nreporting and auditing requirements.\n  In addition to focusing this provision on smaller firms, we also took \nout the provisions in the House bill that were eliminating corporate \ngovernance improvement made in the Dodd-Frank bill, such as say on pay \nand requirements that the company demonstrate the connection between \nexecutive performance and company performance. We need to give these \nprovisions more than a year to see how well they are working.\n  The Reed-Landrieu-Levin amendment also eliminates the provision in \nthe House bill that interferes with independent accounting standards, \nand would have set up two different sets of rules, one for emerging \ngrowth companies and one for other public companies. We agreed with the \nChamber of Commerce that these provisions should be taken out. The \nchamber stated in a letter dated February 15, 2012 that:\n\n       The opt-out for new accounting and auditing standards would \n     create a bifurcated financial reporting system with less \n     certainty and comparability for investors, while creating \n     increased liability risk for boards of directors, audit \n     committees and Chief Financial Officers.\n\n  We also dramatically narrow the provisions in the House bill that \nwould have eviscerated the settlement between all of the securities \nregulators and 10 Wall Street investment banks regarding the undue \ninfluence of the investment banking unit of a firm on the securities \nresearch unit affiliated with the same brokerage firm.\n  We learned at a significant cost through the 1980s and the 1990s the \nvalue of independent analysis of markets and securities. Jeff Madrick, \na respected journalist, discussed this issue in his book. In his words:\n\n       A measure of this practice was the increase in the number \n     of buy recommendations. At the end of the 1980s, after a long \n     run-up in stocks, buy recommendations exceeded sell \n     recommendations by a large and suspect margin of four to one. \n     By the early 1990s, buy recommendations exceeded sells by \n     eight to one. By the late 1990s, only 1 percent of analysts' \n     recommendations urged an outright sale. The low percentage \n     remained unchanged even when stock prices were falling and \n     the investment community was pessimistic.\n\n  After the stock market collapsed in the early 2000s, securities \nanalysts started to admit what was happening inside these firms. Ronald \nGlantz, a veteran respected analyst from Paine Webber, testified before \nCongress in 2001 as follows:\n\n       Now the job of analysts is to bring in investment banking \n     clients, not provide good investment advice. This began in \n     the mid-1980s. The prostitution of security analysts was \n     completed during the high-tech mania of the last few years. \n     For example, in 1997 a major investment banking firm offered \n     to triple my pay. They had no interest in the quality of my \n     recommendations. I was shown a list with 15 names and asked, \n     ``How quickly can you issue buy recommendations on these \n     potential clients?''\n\n  We believe that the wall between a financial institution's research \nand brokerage units needs to be maintained.\n\n[[Page S1767]]\n\nOur substitute amendment would allow a research report to be provided \nby a firm subject to SEC restrictions, disclosure, and filing \nrequirements. In particular, the research cannot contain any \nrecommendation to purchase or sell such security.\n  In addition, any written communications provided to potential \ninvestors must be filed with the SEC so that they can take a look at \nit. These written communications will become part of the issuer's \nprospectus, which should give investors some added protections. This \ntoo is a bit of an experiment, given the massive fraud committed on \ninvestors that led to the global research analyst settlement in 2003. \nBut we have dramatically narrowed the scope of the experiment from the \none in the House version.\n  Finally, we allow companies to opt out of the emerging growth company \ndesignation and fully comply with all public company regulatory \nrequirements, which very well may improve the price of their stock, \nsince investors will have more information regarding the company.\n  As I said earlier, if these changes in exemptions go too far, some \nbelieve we are doing more harm than good by weakening the value of the \npublic company brand in the United States and actually harming our \ncompetitiveness in world markets. That is why we have tried to narrow, \nappropriately, the proposals in the House legislation.\n  Next, I want to talk about the most important changes in our bill \nfrom the House bill. The House bill effectively eliminated SEC \nprohibitions against soliciting or advertising about private offerings \nof securities. Most private placements are offered under SEC rules \nknown as regulation D. These securities are sold without an IPO or \nregistration statement being filed with the SEC, usually to a small \nnumber of chosen accredited investors.\n  In the United States, for an individual to be considered an \naccredited investor, he or she must have a net worth of at least $1 \nmillion, not including the value of the person's primary residence, or \nhave made at least $200,000 each year for the last 2 years, or $300,000 \ntogether with his or her spouse, if married, and have the expectation \nto make the same amount in the current year.\n  The current net worth and income triggers were adopted 30 years ago. \nThey have never been changed. The share of U.S. households that met the \ntest in 1982 was 1.6 percent. It is now at least four times that share. \nThe largest share of accredited investor households is retirees, many \nof whom struggled for decades to save their nest egg.\n  Because accredited investors are eligible for private placement, they \ncan be targeted with slick sales pitches without any SEC review or \nmandatory disclosure. The House bill removes current prohibitions \nagainst general solicitation or advertising for these private \nofferings, which most securities experts believe will have serious \nconsequences.\n\n  Under the current regulatory framework, if the SEC sees unregistered \nofferings being advertised, they can immediately close down the issuer, \nsince they are breaking the law by publicly advertising or soliciting. \nUnder the House bill, there will be a lot more solicitation of all \ninvestors, perhaps on late-night cable or the Internet, with the only \nprotection being after the fact under antifraud principles or ex post \ninspections of sales records to see if the issuers appropriately sold \nonly to accredited investors.\n  SEC Commissioner Aguilar stated in his statement on March 16, 2012, \nthat this provision may be a ``boon to boiler room operators, Ponzi \nschemers, bucket shops, and garden variety fraudsters, by enabling them \nto cast a wider net, and make securities enforcement more difficult.''\n  Realizing in a world of the Internet and Twitter that even private \ncommunications to accredited investors can be broadly disseminated, our \nbill takes a much more targeted approach to this issue. In our \namendment, we allow for limited public solicitation and advertising \nthat is done only in ways and through methods approved by the SEC. We \nare sympathetic to the fact that in a world of new media, it is \nincreasingly difficult for issuers to control their outreach efforts to \naccredited investors. We believe our amendment gives the SEC the tools \nit needs to formulate a limited exemption to the general solicitation \nand advertising rules allowing private offerings to still be private. \nNone of us wants this legislation to be a boon to boiler room operators \nand Ponzi schemers targeting our Nation's retirees or anyone else.\n  Finally, I want to talk about the shareholder cap issue. What has \nbecome clear to me as a result of the capital formation hearings in the \nBanking Committee is that this issue of the appropriate number of \nshareholders to trigger routine reporting through the SEC is something \nthat requires very careful consideration. The present 500 recordholder \nthreshold was originally introduced to address complaints of fraudulent \nactivity in the over-the-counter market for securities.\n  Since firms with fewer than the threshold number of investors were \nnot required to routinely disclose their financial information, outside \nbuyers were not able to make fully informed decisions regarding their \ninvestments. The exchange act mandates that investors in over-the-\ncounter securities be provided with equivalent information to that \nprovided to investors trading stocks on the major exchanges if the \ncompany has 500 holders of record and at least $10 million in assets.\n  Many believe this threshold needs to be updated. But the House bill \ndramatically increased the threshold from 500 to 2,000. Others believe \nraising this threshold to 2,000 would impair capital allocation and \nmarket efficiency, reducing public information about widely traded \ncompanies and denying investors appropriate information about \ncompanies.\n  First, we believe the House bill risks allowing large companies with \nless than 2,000 recordholders--and listen to some of these companies: \nHyatt, Hertz, Chiquita Brands, Adobe Systems, HCA Holdings--Hospital \nCorporation of America--Kaiser Aluminum, Royal Caribbean Cruises, \nTowers Watson, Ralph Lauren, and Accenture--and these are just some of \nthem--to delist and go dark without disclosure or regulatory oversight. \nI think that would frustrate the expectations of many of their \ninvestors.\n  As a result, we decided to take a more prudent approach in our \namendment and raise the level from 500 to 750. At the same time, we \nbelieve the holder of record actually needs to be the beneficial owner \nof the security. This means he or she has power to vote the share or \ndispose of the share. Through our hearings on this matter, it is clear \nthat many big firms are getting around this requirement by pooling \nshares in a street name, such as an investment company like JP Morgan. \nThese big firms have many thousands or hundreds of beneficial owners \nthat can sell and dispose of their shares and have the right to the \ndividends. But on the books of the company, it is just one \nrecordholder. Our amendment eliminates this work-around and requires \nthe holder of record to actually be the beneficial owner.\n  We are also sympathetic to the fact that many more companies are \nstarting to give their employees stock as part of their compensation \nplan. We are sympathetic to their desire not to have this prematurely \ntrigger the Securities Exchange Act. Companies such as WaWa and Wegmans \ntestified before the Banking Committee that they want to give their \nemployees shares without forcing their company to have to go public. As \na result, our amendment exempts employees for the recordholder account, \nwhich should allow firms to give as many shares as they want to their \nemployees without forcing them to go public before they are ready.\n  We think our provision achieves a better balance between market \ntransparency through disclosures and investor protections and the needs \nof some of our most successful family-owned or privately held firms to \nreward their employees and maintain their private status.\n  As we debate H.R. 3606, which could dramatically weaken the world \nleading brand that is the American public company, we should realize \nthat we are undertaking a dramatic and perhaps unfounded experiment. We \nshould also understand that deregulating our securities markets may \nhave no effect whatsoever on the number of IPOs.\n  Companies are desperate for funding since we just went through the \nbiggest financial crisis since the Depression\n\n[[Page S1768]]\n\nand lending is down. Deregulating our capital markets could temporarily \ninfuse our markets with more cash, but at what cost? The cost could be \nquite great. As Jessie Eisinger stated in his ProPublica column on \nMarch 14:\n\n       It's been about a year now since Chinese reverse-merger \n     companies collapsed. In that scandal, dozens of those small \n     Chinese companies went public in the United States without \n     having to run the gauntlet of the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission's registration rules. After they blew up by the \n     boatload, the SEC cracked down and tightened its rules. Since \n     then, short-sellers' pickings have been slim. By allowing new \n     public small companies to not disclose financial information \n     for years, the bill will provide new targets for short-\n     selling hedge funds.\n\n  Like Mr. Eisinger, I believe the House bill as currently drafted \nbasically makes markets less transparent and more subject to \nmanipulation. What the House bill clearly does not do is address the \nneeds that I hear about from employers in my State.\n  The economy consists of a lot of moving pieces. Economic recovery on \nits own will do more to reverse the decline in business activity than \nany provision in the House bill. Moreover, the House bill doesn't \ninclude provisions that I am hearing from Rhode Island employers would \nactually be helpful to creating jobs, such as Small Business \nAdministration loans and export assistance. As a result, our amendment \nactually includes a number of already tried and true, tested job-\ncreating measures. It is estimated, for example, that by reauthorizing \nthe Export-Import Bank, our amendment would support an estimated \n288,000 American jobs at more than 3,600 U.S. companies in more than \n2,000 communities.\n  Other provisions in our amendment would expand the Small Business \nInvestment Company Program, supporting more small business startups in \ncommunities across the United States.\n  Finally, we continue a modification to the Small Business \nAdministration 504 Loan Program to allow for the refinancing for short-\nterm commercial real estate debt. This provision has proved essential \nfor many small businesses with short-term debt. As we have been looking \nat the House bill more closely, I think we have all been learning that \nit is not doing what it was advertised as doing, which is creating more \njobs. We need to slow down and go through an appropriate amendment \nprocess in the Senate.\n  As Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer \nFederation of America, recently stated in a March 11, 2012, San \nFrancisco Chronicle article, the House bill as currently drafted is \n``completely bipolar.'' On one hand, we are trying to make it easier \nand less expensive for companies to go public. On the other hand, by \nincreasing the shareholder threshold in the legislation, the House is \nactually encouraging and letting companies stay private or go private \nand avoid an IPO.\n  I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take up the \nReed-Landrieu-Levin amendment as the base text of the legislation and \nengage in both a robust debate and amendment process. Our securities \nmarkets deserve just as much attention as our Nation's transportation \nsystem, and we spent several weeks dealing with the Transportation bill \non the Senate floor. The Reed-Landrieu-Levin amendment is a much better \nplace to start this debate on how to improve access to capital in our \nsecurities markets without opening them up to unnecessary fraud and \nmanipulation.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin).

Mr. President, I wasn't here when they \npassed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This week will \nmark the second anniversary of what I call a very Orwellian name for \nthat piece of legislation because I personally do not believe it is \ngoing to protect patients, nor do I believe it is going to improve the \naffordability of our health care system.\n  The reason I ran for the Senate was primarily because of this law. I \ncertainly recognized how it was going to result in a lower quality of \nhealth care, how it was going to lead to rationing, and how it was \ngoing to severely limit the amount of medical innovation we enjoy in \nthis country. In particular, I was offended by the political process \ndemonizing doctors and health care providers, demonizing the health \ncare system in order to pass this health care law.\n  The reason that offended me is a very personal story. It has to do \nwith my daughter who was born with a very serious congenital heart \ndefect, her aorta and pulmonary artery were reversed. So her first day \nof life, the doctors--who President Obama said would take out a set of \ntonsils for a few extra dollars--saved her life within the very first \nfew hours of life. Then, 8 months later, when her heart was only the \nsize of a small plum, another incredibly dedicated and incredibly \nskilled team of medical professionals totally reconstructed the upper \nchamber of her heart. Her heart operates backwards now, but she is 28 \nyears old and now she is a nurse herself in a neonatal intensive care \nunit and she is taking care of those babies.\n  So when they passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, I \nknew the health care system that saved my daughter was at risk. I also \nknew this health care law was in no way, shape or form going to reduce \nour Federal deficit. It is just not possible. How can we expect to add \n25 million people to government-run health care and reduce the deficit \nat the same time?\n  The reason they were able to put forward that fiction is they \nproposed a piece of legislation that would have revenue, fees, taxes, \nand penalties for 10 years, while at the same time only providing \nbenefits for the last 6 years of that time period. Basically, what they \ndid was to say we will raise revenue for 10 years of about $1.1 \ntrillion, and we will have 6 years' worth of cost, a little under $1 \ntrillion. That was the fiction.\n  Half of that revenue generated is going to be in taxes, fees, and \npenalties. Personally, by increasing taxes and increasing fees on \nthings such as medical insurance, on medical devices, and on \npharmaceuticals, I don't see how that bends the cost curve down. It \nwould not bend the cost curve down. It is the same logic this President \nhas used when he is talking about high gasoline prices. He says by \nincreasing taxes on oil companies we will reduce the price of gas. It \nis just not possible. Increasing fees on providers, reducing \nreimbursement rates to providers is not going to bend the cost curve \ndown. It is basically not going to happen.\n  The other half of the pay-fors--the other half of that $1.1 \ntrillion--was proposed reductions basically in payments to Medicare \nproviders. Congress, I would say wisely, has not enacted the \nsustainable growth rate cuts to providers because they realize, if they \ndo that, access for seniors to medical care will be reduced. I don't \nsee how, if we reduce Medicare by $529 billion, that same access also \nwould not be reduced. From my standpoint, I think it is highly unlikely \nCongress will actually enact that $529 billion worth of reductions to \nMedicare. When they do not do that, the $143 billion reduction in our \ndeficit, that fiction, will totally go away.\n  Another reason for that fiction being exposed is because, \nfortunately, Congress realized the CLASS Act portion of ObamaCare \nsimply wasn't going to save the money they said it was going to save. \nIt simply wasn't sustainable. Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad \nactually called the CLASS Act a Ponzi scheme. So this administration \nhas decided not to move forward with its implementation. In doing so, \nthat is removing $70 billion of revenue from that budgetary fiction.\n  I know Senator Kyl has been following this very carefully, in terms \nof\n\n[[Page S1769]]\n\nwhat is going to happen to our Federal budget, and I am wondering if \nSenator Kyl would want to comment on how he sees the real effect of the \nhealth care law on the Federal budget and why that is not going to save \nus $143 billion in the first year and probably result in far greater \ncosts to the Federal Government if this thing is actually implemented.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say my colleague from Wisconsin is \nabsolutely right. Let me first of all say, millions of citizens around \nthis country have gotten engaged for the same reason as my colleague \ndid; as a normal citizen, running his business, he saw what was \nhappening here and he decided to get involved. Not everyone can run for \nthe Senate successfully and come back to Washington to bring that \nmessage from America right here to the Senate Chamber, but he has done \nit, and I commend him for his leadership.\n\n  Yes, he is absolutely right. It turns out that his predictions and \nthose of us who were on the Senate floor when this bill passed into law \nsaying it was going to cost a lot more than our Democratic friends \nsaid; that it was going to cost a lot more than the Congressional \nBudget Office estimated, well, now the numbers are in and here they \nare.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last week just released \nits updated figures, and it shows that the real cost of the ObamaCare \nsubsidy spending is going to almost double. When ObamaCare was passed, \nthey estimated the cost would be $938 billion. That is on the Medicaid \npart as well as the taxpayer-funded health insurance subsidies. As my \ncolleague said, that is a 10-year cost. Of course, part of the game is \nthat they are collecting money over 10 years but only paying benefits \nover 6 and that can make it look pretty good, as my colleague said. But \nit turns out, when CBO had to reexamine, now with 2 years' experience, \nwhat they found is, looking at the entire 10-year budget window, the \ntrue size of this cost was masked. Now that we have a clearer picture, \nvoila, CBO says the projected amount is $1.7 trillion over 10 years. In \nother words, ObamaCare is going to cost more than $700 billion more \nthan CBO estimated at the time the law was passed.\n  How can they miscalculate by almost double, from $938 billion to now \n$1.7 trillion? It is not CBO's fault. CBO is a bunch of accountants. \nThey take what we give them and do their figuring. As the Senator from \nWisconsin said, what the Senate Democrats and the President gave them \nwas just part of the picture. They said: We are going to give you 10 \nyears' worth of revenues, but we are only going to give you 6 years' \nworth of expenses. See how that works out. I wish we could all do our \nprivate budgets at home that way.\n  Here is another way to look at it. We have all heard of a mortgage \nwith a bubble payment at the end. That is, in effect, what this was. \nThey basically said: Look, we know CBO has to estimate 10-year budgets, \nso we have a great idea on how to make this cost less. We will put some \nof the big expenditures in years 11 and 12. Voila, 10 years of \nexpenditures, not too bad. But now that 2 years have passed and we are \nnow looking at a 10-year budget that goes out 10 more years from now--\n12 years from when ObamaCare was first calculated--it turns out when we \nadd in years No. 11 and 12, it adds hugely to the cost--$700 billion \nworth.\n  We all said this at the time. It was a trick. It was smoke and \nmirrors. They were pulling a fast one on the American people. We said \nthat. But we heard: Oh no. You can trust CBO. Sure, we could trust CBO \nas far as they could calculate it. But if one had said, how about years \n11 and 12, they would have had to say: That is another story, but we \nweren't asked about that.\n  I say to my friend from Wisconsin, he is exactly right. Now the \nchickens have come home to roost. Now we know what the real cost of \nthis is going to be and, oh, by the way, if we want to go out over the \nentire period once the law is fully implemented--remember, ObamaCare \nhas not been fully implemented yet. So what happens when we calculate \nits full cost when truly implemented? The Budget Committee, on which \nSenator Sessions sits, says total spending under ObamaCare will reach \n$2.6 trillion. So these are the real costs we have to pay attention to, \nnot just the estimates that were made at the time they were trying to \nget the law passed.\n  I might either ask the Senator from Wisconsin or our ranking member \non the Budget Committee, what about this? If we use real numbers and \nreal costs, are the American taxpayers going to be on the hook for \nsomething akin to $2.6 trillion, according to the Budget Committee? \nThat is a lot of money.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I wish to point out, the numbers Senator \nKyl is talking about are CBO projections, just using a different \ntimeframe. That isn't even taking into account what I have been talking \nabout is an even more significant risk to the deficit, and that is one \nparticular CBO estimate that says, on net, only 1 million Americans \nwill lose their employer-sponsored care.\n  There are 154 million Americans who get their employer-sponsored care \nfrom employer-sponsored plans. To assume that only 1 million people \nwill lose that coverage and get forced into the exchanges is absurd, \nparticularly when we have a study by a very reputable firm, McKinsey & \nCompany, surveying 1,300 employers, which said 30 to 50 percent of \nemployers plan on dropping coverage and having their employees go into \nthe exchanges. It is pretty easy to understand why that might happen. \nRight now, the health care law is 2,700 pages; there have been another \n12,000 pages of rules and regulations. So employers looking at the \nhealth care law are looking at, Do I try and comply with, do I try and \nunderstand 15,000 pages of regulations and then pay $20,000 for a \nfamily plan--which is the new CBO estimate for a family plan in the \nyear 2016. Do I do that or pay the $2,000 penalty?\n  With ObamaCare, they are not exposing their employees to a financial \nrisk. They are making them eligible for huge subsidies, $10,000, if \nthey have a household income of $64,000.\n  So I will throw it over to Senator Sessions on the Budget Committee. \nMy concern is we are not even beginning to contemplate what the effects \nof that might be. What does the Senator think of that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I couldn't agree more about the concerns the Senator \nraised.\n  Senator Johnson was a successful businessman. He provided health \ninsurance for his employees. He had to purchase it. I will just ask him \none quick question. Based on his experience--a year and a half ago he \nwas doing this business. What are the incentives for a business that is \nalready in existence, providing health care, why might they not \ncontinue to provide it? Why might a new company, a startup company, a \nsmall business that hopes to grow and have hundreds of employees--why \nmight they never start with employer-based health care?\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Again, it is becoming so complex. It is \nbecoming so expensive. Again, the big difference ObamaCare throws into \nthe equation is, in the past, responsible employers--and most employers \ntruly care about the people who work with them--wouldn't have dreamed \nof exposing their employees to financial risk that would be obvious if \nthey didn't provide health care insurance. But with ObamaCare, that is \nnot what is happening. Now these exchanges will be available as well as \nhuge subsidies.\n  I am not aware of too many large Federal subsidies that go unused, \nand that is my concern. So the equation is totally different now. It is \ngoing to be totally different under ObamaCare.\n  My question for CBO--I know they just conducted a study and did some \nsensitivity analysis, but they didn't go anywhere near far enough, from \nmy standpoint. I think the largest number of employees they took a look \nat might have been 20 million individuals. But when we have 154 million \nAmericans getting employer-sponsored care and the McKinsey study saying \nhalf of those, more than 75 million--I think we need to take a very \nserious look at what effect on our budget that would have.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think all of us need to be listening to this because \nit is something that was not sufficiently considered during the debate; \nthat is, that dramatically more employers may quit providing insurance, \nnew companies that get started will not provide it, people will be on \nthe exchanges, and it will cost far more than was expected. That is an \nentirely new issue.\n  Assuming the low numbers the Congressional Budget Office said will go\n\n[[Page S1770]]\n\ninto the exchanges, just taking the numbers they assumed, let me point \nout what Senator Kyl said. President Obama, in an exact quote to the \njoint session of Congress when he was promoting this legislation, not \nsome off-the-cuff figure, said this:\n\n       Now, add it all up. And the plan I'm proposing will cost \n     around $900 billion over 10 years--\n\n  This was a deliberate attempt, as has been suggested, to manipulate \nthe figures because the taxes started right away, but the spending was \n4 years delayed essentially, so we only have 6 years of spending under \nthe plan. It also excluded many other provisions.\n  For example, the bureaucratic implementation costs were not counted. \nThe amount of effort, even the IRS will have to hire people who have to \nbe involved, and this was not counted. New spending to close the \nMedicare doughnut hole. We didn't have the money in 2002 or 2003 to \nfund that provision. We have never been in worse shape. We are \nborrowing 40 cents of every $1 we spend, far worse than we were. Next \nyear will be the fifth consecutive $1 trillion deficit. We don't have \nthe money. So now we are spending more on that program that we don't \nhave, the new or early retiree program.\n  So once we add all the different provisions in the health care law, \ntotal gross spending over the original 10 years, when only 6 years is \nbeing paid for--over 10 years is actually 1.4 trillion. Those are the \nnumbers we have. So this was a misrepresentation. This is from 2010 \nthrough 2019, 1.4 trillion. But when we add all the costs over the \nfirst full 10 years of this health care bill, it will be $2.6 trillion.\n  The point is, the bill is not good health policy. The American people \noppose it overwhelmingly. Absolutely, we do not have the money. We have \nnever had a more systemic death threat to America, and it is so painful \nto see this happen.\n  I thank Senator Johnson for his energy, for the commitment he has \nbrought to this issue. He has seen it on the other side, the real-world \nside, and he is helping to motivate us all to explain to the American \npeople the dangers of the bill.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I wish to ask Senator Sessions a question. \nWe have talked about this in the past. I know a lot of people talked \nabout the Medicare cuts being double counted, and I never quite \nunderstood exactly what that was. Can the Senator maybe explain a \nlittle bit to the American people what that means.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  As a part of the funding for the ObamaCare legislation, there was an \nincrease in Medicare taxes and a cut in Medicare benefits totaling $400 \nbillion. That money was used to fund the new health care bill by the \nU.S. Treasury, an entirely new program. But it is Medicare's money. It \nis not the Treasury's money. Medicare has trustees. Medicare loaned the \nmoney to the U.S. Treasury. It was borrowed money that was used to fund \nthis bill, not money that came in new and free of charge. Since \nMedicare is going into default and going to claim its debt in a few \nyears, the Federal Government is simply going to have to either raise \ntaxes, cut spending somewhere else or, more likely, convert the \nborrowing from Medicare, borrow money on the open market from China and \nother places, and then pay Medicare back.\n  It is, as the CBO Director told me in a letter, December 23, the \nnight before we voted: You are double counting the money.\n  No wonder this country is going broke. This isn't extra money. Half \nthe original estimate of the bill, $900 billion, was funded by borrowed \nmoney from Medicare. This is how this country is surging in its debt \nand why we are in danger of the entire economy entering into collapse.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Does the Senator believe those Medicare \nsavings will actually be realized? Does the Senator believe Congress \nwill actually enact those savings?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is a good point, because in the past we have \nattempted and claimed we were going to make savings in Medicare and \nthey never occurred.\n  What I am saying is if these savings were to occur and if the new \ntaxes on Medicare go into effect, as they are, that money is what is \nbeing used to fund an entirely new health care program. There is real \ndoubt it will ever achieve those savings in Medicare, because if we \nkeep cutting doctors and we keep cutting hospitals, they can't keep \ndoing work. They will start refusing Medicare and Medicaid work. We are \nin that position already on some of the cuts that we rescind every year \nbecause we know the health care system would collapse if those cuts \nwere to go into effect.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. That is one of my concerns. Let's say we \nactually do enact those cuts to Medicare and we don't reimburse \nproviders and doctors in some cases to even cover their costs.\n  I know this is hard to get to, but I have read where only 60 percent \nof providers are willing to see and treat Medicaid patients. Now what \nwe are going to be doing is adding 25 million new individuals onto \nMedicaid rolls, where only 67 percent of providers are seeing those.\n  I would ask Senator Boozman, because he is not only a new Senator but \nalso a doctor and he ran a business, would he comment on that as well. \nI think he has some comments in terms of how this health care law will \nbe affecting employment and jobs.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. I appreciate the Senator's leadership in this area. I \nalso appreciate the fact that he jumped out and ran for the office and \nwas elected, because we desperately need people such as Senator \nJohnson, people who were successful businessmen who understand the \nunintended consequences of much of what we do. I, similar to the \nSenator, also have a firsthand understanding of this issue from an \nemployer's perspective and maybe a little bit unique perspective.\n  Before I came to Congress, I practiced optometry and helped run an \neye care clinic with my nine other partners for 24 years. So when \nPresident Obama's health care bill came before us when I was in the \nHouse, I fully understood, from both the medical provider and from the \nbusiness aspect, that from both accounts, it was the wrong approach to \nthe problem of rising health care costs and, with the Doctors Caucus in \nthe House, worked very hard to highlight the problems and to also \nhighlight the alternative options working through the free market \napproach.\n  There is no doubt about it, we are facing a serious crisis. Health \ncare costs are crippling Americans. Many Americans lack access to \nquality health care. It is stifling our Nation's overall economic \ndevelopment. There are real difficulties with physicians and hospitals \nthat they face when it comes to accessibility and affordability of \nhealth care services. But despite all that, there is a right way and a \nwrong way to address the problem. The President's health care law is \nsimply the wrong approach and the wrong answer.\n  Coming with a pricetag of $1.75 trillion, the law causes many more \nproblems than it solves. It is not lowering health care costs, as we \nare seeing. In fact, it is driving them up. It is not deficit neutral. \nIt is a budget buster.\n  Because of Medicare cuts, because of the way it is set up, it is \ngoing to lead to rationing and decreased quality of care. It will not \nhelp the economy. In fact, it is further stalling the recovery.\n  On that note, specifically, the President's health care law makes it \ndifficult for small business owners to hire more employees. At a time \nwhen our economic recovery continues to lag, the concerns over new \nmandates, confusing rules, and additional taxes in the law have small \nbusiness owners rightfully concerned. Again, I can appreciate this in \nthe sense of not only being an eye care provider, a health care \nprovider, but somebody who had 85 employees.\n  Far from getting jobs, as the President promised, it is estimated the \nlaw will actually result in 800,000 fewer jobs over the next decade. It \nis almost as if the law was written with no input from America's small \nbusiness owners and the health care providers that will run it.\n  In the 24 years I was at our clinic in northwest Arkansas, we grew \nour staff from 5 employees to 85. My colleague from Wisconsin can \nattest to the fact that guiding one's business to the point where one \ncan add personnel is not an easy task. It takes strategic planning and \nmanagement, but it also takes an economic environment that allows small \nbusinesses to expand, invest, and\n\n[[Page S1771]]\n\nhire. Instead of doing that, the health care law furthers the climate \nof uncertainty that our job creators already face.\n\n  Small business owners are certainly hurting in this economy. They are \nworrying about tax hikes that Washington keeps threatening to force \nupon them. They see an enormous flood of regulations coming their way. \nGas prices keep skyrocketing. Profits are way down as a result of the \nsluggish economy. There is so much uncertainty, what mandates will \nevolve from this health care law and ultimately what these costs will \nbe for small business owners only adds to that unease.\n  When interviewed, business owners said that the major concern that \nkeeps them from hiring--and I have been out and about as much as \nanybody in the last 2 years, and this is exactly what I am hearing--is \nthe uncertainty caused by the cost that they believe they will incur by \nthe new health care law. We need to repeal and replace it with health \ncare reform based on a free market system.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I thank Senator Boozman. I think it is \nextremely important for us, in the next coming weeks and months, to \npaint a very accurate picture for the American people about what our \nhealth care system is going to look like, what our Federal budget is \ngoing to look like, the effect on American jobs and our economy, and \nthe effect on our freedoms that we are going to witness if this health \ncare law is fully implemented. I think it is critical we provide the \nAmerican people that type of information.\n  Of course I know Senator Roberts has some thoughts in terms of how \nthis health care law will affect jobs and our economy. He has been very \ngood at describing some of the nonsense regulations that are being \nundertaken by this administration. I want Senator Roberts to share his \nthoughts about what he thinks--paint us a picture of what is America \ngoing to look like under this health care law.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. No. 1, I want to give the Senator a lot of credit for \nleading this colloquy in regard to where we are 2 years from the \npassage. It is hard to say what it is. Now it is ACA, the Affordable \nCare Act; it used to be PPACA, the acronym, which I thought was very \nappropriate. Of course if you politicize it, it is called ObamaCare. I \ndon't mean to do that in this debate. But I do thank the Senator for \nfocusing on jobs and costs.\n  I thank Senator Kyl for a CBO truth. He ought to start a new program \nlike the old show ``Truth Or Consequences.'' Senator Kyl pointed out \nthe consequences. He pointed out the consequences, when you ask the CBO \nfor a score when you are going to try to pass the bill, they will give \nyou exactly what you want, but the truth is down the road it costs an \nawful lot more.\n  There is one person you left out in terms of the CBO telling the \ntruth and that is Richard Foster, who is the Actuary down at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. That man ought to get a Purple \nHeart, a Medal of Honor--not a Medal of Honor, just give him a Purple \nHeart and maybe a Bronze Star for action in the war zone and then maybe \na Medal of Freedom later.\n  Senator Sessions, who is our resident bulldog on the budget, hit it \non the second counting. I thank him for that. That is a half trillion \ndollars. The other half of that is that it is a half trillion that goes \nto all these exchanges and the rules and regulations in setting up the \nAffordable Health Care Act. Basically, it denies Medicare reimbursement \nto all sorts of folks--doctors, nurses, hospices, pharmacists, \nambulance drivers, hospital administrators--on and on. We had a health \ncare summit in Topeka, KS, and 34 regulations popped out of the \nwoodwork. We could have had 164 but we sent the 34 in to the Secretary \nof HHS. Then he went out to Hays, KS. That is really out there in the \nrural health care system. We had seven different regulations. I hope \nlater when we have a colloquy on regulations we can certainly insert \nthose into the Record.\n  Senator Boozman, who is a physician, gave a standpoint of what \nhappens in regard to rationing.\n  Let met get Senator Boozman's attention for a minute. Do you know who \nenforces this thing, at the end of the year if you do not sign up, if \nyou do not put on your tax return, which I assume it will be, in terms \nof what kind of coverage you have? It is the IRS. The IRS is going to \nbe the enforcement entity in regard to whether you have a provider. If \nyou do not, you get fined.\n  Stop and think a minute about what is going on, and all the waivers \nthat have been going on in terms of who is enforcing this. Your \nfriendly Internal Revenue Service--what--reinforcer? I have a lot of \nfeeling about this.\n  I took the floor today to discuss something called promises made and \npromises not kept. I tell the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, of \nall the words that come back to bite you, this one has. That is the \nfamous statement prior to passage of the health care reform law by the \nPresident: ``If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.'' I \nwill give him credit, he may have believed it then. But as we pointed \nout with Senator Kyl, Senator Sessions, Senator Boozman, Senator \nJohnson--that is not the case. I didn't believe it then and I said so. \nNeither did Senator Sessions. Neither did Senator Kyl. Those two are \nhere now, taking a good look at it. They don't believe it either.\n  Why? It is pretty simple. Employers and health care providers told me \nthat when the majority of the provisions of the health care reform law \nwould take effect, it would be more affordable for an employer to \nsimply stop offering their employee coverage and pay a penalty rather \nthan face the predictable increase in premiums and to continue to offer \nany coverage.\n  Now these predictions have turned into facts. A new study just \nreleased by McKinsey & Co., a consulting company, predicts large \nnumbers of workers will be shifted into the health exchanges in 2014. \nThat is a shift that folks should be worried about--exactly what you \nare talking about, Senator Johnson. Literally thousands of regulations \nand waivers are pouring out of the Department of Health and Human \nServices; in fact, to date, 12,307 pages of additional regulations to \nrestrict personal freedom and micromanage the private market.\n  To make matters worse, there is the predictable worry that the \nexchanges would be better described as much like Medicaid HMOs. That is \nthe kind of service we can expect to get and that threatens access, \nchoice of doctors, and not to mention the rationing regime that will be \nthe marching order of the day. I will have a lot to say about that in \nthe colloquy in the next several days.\n\n  At the time the President made his promise, the CBO estimated that, \nas Senator Kyl pointed out, only about 7 percent of employees covered \nby employer-sponsored insurance would make the switch, or be forced to \nswitch, to taxpayer-subsidized exchanges. Now I tell the Senator, study \nafter study is releasing facts and figures that find the health care \nreform law will cause many or even most employers to quit offering \ntheir current health insurance.\n  In a survey by benefits consultants at Lockton, when asked about the \ncost of notifying employees of changes required by or resulting from \nhealth care reform law, they said each notification will cost $1 to $3 \nper employee. Talk about cost. This would raise costs by tens of \nthousands of dollars or more for some firms and nearly one in five \nfirms is considering terminating coverage outright, thanks to the law.\n  With each study the numbers go up. The McKinsey survey found that 45 \nto 50 percent of employers say they ``will definitely or probably'' \npursue alternatives to their existing health care plans. Even more \nalarming, some 30 percent of employers will simply stop offering any \ncoverage. Those are the facts. There are more to come.\n  I am going on too long here, I understand that. I simply say again I \nthank my colleagues. Contrary to this administration's seeming belief, \nthere is no such thing as free health care. Somebody does pay. In this \ncase the American taxpayers will be forced to foot the bill for workers \nwhose employer-sponsored coverage has been dropped due to health care \nreform.\n  There is another quote I wish to mention. It should be the subject of \nanother colloquy. There is absolutely no rationing in this bill, it is \njust scare talk. Want to bet? There is nothing that hurts the truth \nmore than stretching it. With PPACA or ACA or\n\n[[Page S1772]]\n\nObamaCare, jobs and costs will be stressed beyond the limit.\n  I truly thank the Senator for sponsoring this colloquy.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I appreciate the comments of the Senator. \nHe mentioned rationing. What is the Independent Advisory Board for? Do \nyou have a clue? To me that would somewhat lead, potentially, to \nrationing. I would be suspicious of that. Senator Kyl stood up here. He \nmay have some additional comments.\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. I would say when my colleague from Kansas talked about \nthe free care, it reminded me of the old saw: You think insurance is \nexpensive now, just wait until it is free. That is the point. Somebody \nhas to pay for it at the end of the day, and we just happen to have \nsome new statistics how this is working out now that CBO has had a \nchance to examine how ObamaCare plays out. Here is their newest \nestimate. We are talking about real costs to real families.\n  CBO now estimates that ObamaCare will increase premiums by 10 to 13 \npercent. To make that number real, that is a $2,100 annual increase in \nthe cost for the average family of purchasing their own insurance \ncoverage. Six separate private actuarial analyses have all indicated \nObamaCare will increase premiums with projected increases ranging as \nhigh as 60 percent.\n  Why is that so? It is like a balloon; you push in on one side, it \npops out the other. Health care is still going to cost. Doctors still \nhave to treat people, hospitals still have to take care, pay the people \nwho work in the hospitals and so on. It is not free, as our colleague \nfrom Kansas is pointing out. Somebody has to pay for it. If the \ngovernment cannot afford it, then what the insurance companies have to \ndo is charge the extra expense to the people in the private insurance \nmarket.\n  When the President complains about why insurance costs are going so \nhigh, he only has himself to blame. If the government is not going to \nreimburse the providers adequately, they have to get the money from the \nprivate sector. That is why the $2,100 annual increase in the cost of \ninsurance for the average family, because of the cost shifting that is \ngoing on. It is a result of the way the government designs the \ninsurance that is provided for in ObamaCare. It hits the young people \nespecially hard because they are the ones who have to buy insurance \nthey do not need, according to America's Health Insurance Plans. \nPremiums increase 48 percent for people between 18 and 29 years old. \nThat is in only 42 of the 50 States, premium increases of 48 percent. \nThen of course they also tax health insurance, which we end up paying \nfor because that cost is passed on to us in the form of higher \ninsurance premiums. That is a $60 billion tax on health insurance added \non top of the new taxes on innovation, on new pharmaceutical products, \non new medical devices. The taxes that are included in ObamaCare on \nthose are all passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices.\n  The bottom line is we are paying for all this one way or the other, \neither through new taxes, through what we pay to the government, or \nthrough what we pay in our private insurance, because the physicians \nand hospitals have to make up the money one way or the other.\n  The bottom line is that ObamaCare, which was supposed to have reduced \ncosts, ends up increasing them. By the way, it was supposed to expand \nthe numbers of people who are covered but now we find that, according \nto Milliman, which is a private association estimating the cost here, \nactuaries there have estimated the cost shift from government programs, \nMedicare and Medicaid, totals $88.8 billion a year, adding $1,788 to a \nfamily's insurance policy. That is on top of what I spoke of before.\n  This cost shift obviously will greatly increase with ObamaCare's \nMedicaid and Medicare cuts, which are further on down the road here. \nThat will cause premiums to skyrocket even more.\n  The bottom line is that we were right when we said it: The law is \ngoing to drive up insurance premiums for families, it is going to drive \nup taxes, it is going to reduce innovation. At the end of the day, it \ndoesn't cover more people. All in all, a great success, I would say.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I remember back in Oshkosh, WI, President \nObama famously promised: If you pass this health care law, the average \ncosts per family would decline by $2,500 per year. That is one of those \nbroken promises that Senator Roberts was mentioning earlier.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The Senator asked me about IPAB. It is not an iPad or an \niPhone or whatever. I am sure Apple has nothing to do with it.\n  Well, the administration, in response to a lot of concern about \nrationing, wrote an op-ed and sent it to many different publications \nand said, ``[T]he claims that the board will ration care are simply \nfalse.'' At the time, I repeated my concerns over and over again. \nSenator Kyl will remember those days in the Finance Committee. I think \neverybody left when I started my rant. And the health care reform law's \npotential to ration care--I made speech after speech--is not only IPAB; \nthere is the CMS Innovation Center, the new authority granted to the \nU.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the Patient-Centered Outcomes \nResearch Institute, and finally IPAB, and that is not a toothpaste.\n  At the time, the American public was told over and over that these \nprovisions of the health care reform law would not result in the \nrationing of care, loss of access, or reduced quality. But once again \nthe Medicare Actuary, Richard Foster--bravest man in the government--\nand many others have noted that the kinds of payment reductions \ncontemplated by IPAB will amount to a de facto rationing by reducing \naccess to care. The Actuary has stated that the payment reductions in \nthe law could ``jeopardize access to care for beneficiaries''--senior \nbeneficiaries. He also predicted that the IPAB reductions in particular \nwould be difficult to achieve in practice because of the access-related \nharm to seniors that would result. That is IPAB for you.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. Earlier Senator Roberts mentioned the U.S. \nPreventive Services Task Force. Wasn't that the agency that proposed \ndenying women mammograms until they reached the age of 50?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. That is correct. For every proposal like that, thank \ngoodness there has been a reaction by the public and the medical \nprofession and everybody else to say: Wait a minute, this doesn't make \nany sense. Again, it is an agenda-oriented board or commission or \nwhatever that comes under the banner of rationing.\n  I have a wonderful chart I will show to you in the next colloquy in \nregard to the four rations--and one was just mentioned--and then ask me \nabout IPAB. They are a little benign. I am going to have to change the \ncaricatures. They are like the four horsemen of the apocalypse in \nregard to the health care system of the United States. As you look at \neach one of them and what they are doing, they are rationing care. They \nare rationing care.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. If this is implemented, we are just \nbeginning to see the tip of the iceberg of the assault on our freedom \nthat this is going to represent.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. I think this rationing is such an important situation. \nWe are already seeing rationing right now. As an optometrist more than \nbeing a Senator, I get calls all the time from people who have moved \ninto town and they can't find a health care provider for their aunt or \nuncle who is in the Medicare age group. Physicians are definitely \ncutting back because of the payment plan.\n  Seniors are smart enough to figure out that you can't add 30 percent \nmore patients under this plan, and along with that, there is no \nincrease in physician fees, no increase in the infrastructure required \nto take care of them. Something has to give, and that is going to be \ntwo things: quality of care and rationing.\n  The same thing is true of Medicaid. In Arkansas, we are going to have \nto increase our Medicaid rolls by 250,000 people. Our State only has 3 \nmillion people to begin with. Again, something has to give. How do you \npay for that? The reality is that will cost us in the neighborhood of \n$400 million. Where will that come from? It will come from providers. \nIt will come from decreased funding for education, roads, and things \nlike that. Again, you can't do this without rationing and \nconsolidation.\n\n[[Page S1773]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I think the bottom line of this health care \nlaw is that it is basically going to increase demand while at the same \ntime reducing supply, and that is not a good thing. It is certainly not \nthe way you bend the cost curve down.\n  I understand Senator Sessions has a few more comments.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Senator Kyl and the Senator from Kansas, as he has \nindicated, were engaged in this cost curve-bending plan. The essence of \nthe President's proposal--it went to the core of other proposals \nfinancially--was that by a Federal Government expansion of our \nauthority, we would bend the cost curve and make health care cheaper \nfor all Americans. That was a fundamental principle that was sold to \nbusinesspeople, and some businesspeople thought it was a great idea, \nbut it has not happened. Already the premiums in private health care in \nAmerica have gone up $2,000, almost $200 a month, and we are going to \nsee it continue to go up. It does not bend the cost curve down. In \nfact, we are seeing the opposite occur.\n  We have to know that our per-person government debt--Senator Johnson \nis on the Budget Committee, and he knows this--is worse than any other \nWestern world nation. Per capita, we have more debt than Greece, Spain, \nItaly, and Ireland, with $44,000 per person that every man, woman, and \nchild owes. And if the President submitted a budget and if it were to \nbe enacted--and certainly it will not be--that would go to $75,000 per \nperson in 10 years.\n  This health care bill is dramatically adding to that. Every expert we \nhave had at the Budget Committee has told us that we are on an \nunsustainable spending and debt path that will lead to financial \ncollapse. Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, who chaired President \nObama's debt commission, both issued a written statement that America \nhas never faced a more predictable financial crisis. What they told us \nwas that spending and running up debt as we are today guarantees a \nfinancial collapse that could impact every person in America and deeply \nimpact our ability to have health care in this country.\n\n  So I think we have to recognize that the Republican-controlled House \nof Representatives will unveil a budget plan tomorrow. The Senate is \nnot going to bring up a budget. The Democratic leader said it is \nfoolish to have a budget, so we will go for the third consecutive year \nwithout even attempting to pass a budget. It is supposed to be out of \nthe committee by April 1. It is supposed to be passed by April 15. The \nHouse is going to do it. They are going to step up to the plate, and \nthey are going to lay out a plan like they did last year, a plan that \nwill change the debt course of America, a plan that would put us on a \nsustainable path so that we don't have to fear financial collapse.\n  They are going to look at this legislation, and it cannot be imposed. \nWe do not have the money. It is going to make health care worse, as we \nhave heard, but more than that, we simply--even if it were a good idea, \na nice thing to have, we do not have the money. We are borrowing 40 \ncents of every dollar we spend, and they misrepresented the cost. It is \nfar higher than anyone has expected, and it is going to continue.\n  For example, our people have looked at the CBO score--on the Budget \nCommittee--and they have analyzed it fairly, and I am prepared to \ndefend these numbers. Based on CBO's scores, from 2014--the first year \nthe law is really in effect--until 2023, it will cost $2.66 trillion. \nIt is far more than was projected. How much money is that? Over the \nsame 10-year period, we would spend $626 billion on Federal highways. \nWe had been fighting over highways, and we finally passed a highway \nbill. The Federal money for the whole highway system would be $626 \nbillion, while we are adding a new program that is improperly funded \nfor $2,600 billion. Over the next 10 years, we expect to spend $1,000 \nbillion for education, and this health care cost is going to be $2,600 \nbillion. We have disasters. We spend a lot of money on disasters. It is \nexpected that we will spend $111 billion on disasters, whereas we will \nspend $2.6 trillion on the health care bill.\n  This is the kind of thing that has the American people asking us: Are \nyou crazy? How can you borrow 40 cents of every dollar you spend, as we \nare doing today. How can you do that to America? What is the matter \nwith you people?\n  They say people back home are not smart, they are just angry. Well, \naren't they right to be angry? We are adding a program that is \nfinancially unsound, that is going to make health care worse, and we \ndon't have the money. This money needs to be used to save Medicare and \nSocial Security--programs that are already in great jeopardy. If we \nhave money, we have to use it to save them, not start a new program of \nmassive proportions that, over 60, 75 years, is going to cost far more \nthan anyone imagines.\n  I thank Senator Johnson for raising this, and I am concerned about \nthe costs. I know Senator Boozman and others have talked about the \nrationing. There are a lot of reasons why we simply can't go forward \nwith this health care bill. It must be eliminated as we know it. We can \nmake reforms, but this legislation cannot go into effect.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Wisconsin. I certainly appreciate Senator Sessions' \ncomments and those of Senator Roberts, Senator Kyl, and Senator \nBoozman.\n  There are two points I would like to make. It is important to \nunderstand that all these numbers we are talking about are estimates. \nThe Federal Government is not particularly good at making those \nestimates because if you think back to 1965 when they first passed \nMedicare, they projected out about 25 years and said that in 1990 it \nwill cost $12 billion. In fact, it ended up costing $110 billion--nine \ntimes the original cost estimate.\n  The other point you were making is, Does it make sense for the \nFederal Government to take over one-sixth of our economy? When I went \nback to Wisconsin, I asked that question of thousands of individuals. \nDo you really believe the Federal Government can take over one-sixth of \nour economy--the health care sector--and do it effectively and \nefficiently? I asked that to thousands of people. I have had two brave \nsouls raise their hands. The fact is, the American people do not \nbelieve the American Government is capable of doing that.\n  In closing, I would like to remind everybody what Speaker Pelosi very \nfamously said: We have to pass this bill so we can find out what is in \nit.\n  I know Senator Sessions and Senator Boozman are dedicated to making \nsure we don't have to fully implement the health care law before we did \nfigure out what it truly costs us because it could bankrupt this \nNation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons).

Mr. President, yesterday the average price of \ngasoline in Connecticut topped $4 a gallon--the fifth highest average \nprice in the country. Across the Nation, prices are fast approaching \nthat amount for every American. The rising cost of gasoline is a real, \nharsh, and unacceptable fact of life for ordinary Americans. It is \ncrushing to the average consumer, it is stifling economic growth, and \nit is hurting our businesses. For people across the country, ordinary \nAmericans or middle-class, these dramatic increases are not a luxury. \nIt is more than an inconvenience. It threatens their ability to go to \nwork, to do their work, and it drives up the prices of goods for all \nkinds of commodities, not just gasoline. It threatens to derail our \neconomic recovery.\n  Many factors contribute to the price of a gallon of gasoline. There \nis no question that it is complex. There is a growing consensus among \nenergy analysts that a large part of the reason has to do with \nspeculation. I am mindful of the fact that there are a lot of experts \nand a lot of debate on different sides of this issue, but there is a \npowerful and growing consensus that speculation is a major cause of the \nrising cost of gasoline.\n  In fact, there is a list of businesses, government organizations, and \ntrade associations that have undertaken their own study and \ninvestigation of the oil futures market. Let me list them for you: \nExxonMobil, the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, Goldman \nSachs, the American Trucking Association, the Consumer\n\n[[Page S1774]]\n\nFederation of America, Delta Airlines, the International Monetary Fund, \nthe St. Louis Federal Reserve. What do they all have in common? They \nhave all indicated that excessive oil speculation significantly \nincreases oil and gasoline prices. In fact, according to a recent \narticle in Forbes--that is based on a report from Goldman Sachs--\nexcessive oil speculation ``translates out into a premium for gasoline \nat the pump of $.56 a gallon.''\n  The Chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission has stated \npublicly that Wall Street speculators now control more than 80 \npercent--in fact, as much as 85 percent--of the energy futures market, \na figure that has more than doubled over the last decade. In short, \npeople are buying contracts for future delivery of oil or gasoline they \nhave no intention of ever taking delivery of.\n  Something is not working in the markets. Demand has dropped; \nconsumption has been reduced; supply is at least at the level it was \nlast year; yet prices are rising. The excessive oil and gasoline \nspeculation is clearly causing market disturbances that prevent the \nmarket from accurately reflecting the forces of supply and demand. It \nis vital that the government use every available resource to protect \nAmericans from markets that are not working, from price-gouging or \nprice-fixing or illegal manipulation. The causes of the market \ndisruption must be confronted.\n  Last April, the Attorney General announced the formation of a \nFinancial Fraud Enforcement Task Force working group--I will repeat \nthat--Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force working group--that was \nspecifically empowered to combat illegality in these markets.\n  I wrote to the Attorney General last May in the wake of the \nappointment of that task force, telling him respectfully that \n``announcing investigations and beginning to issue subpoenas could curb \nsome of the worst speculative activity that may well be underway at \nthis very moment.'' I believe now that this task force has the \nauthority, it has the mandate, it has the responsibility, and it has \nthe obligation to be effective.\n  We have heard virtually nothing about it over this last year. We have \nheard of no investigation, no action, and certainly no prosecution. Now \nis the time it should be active. That is the reason I have again \nwritten to the Attorney General, and I ask unanimous consent that the \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 18, 2011.\n     Hon. Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n     Attorney General of the United States, U.S. Department of \n         Justice, Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Holder: Just yesterday, the average \n     price of a gallon of gas in my home state of Connecticut \n     topped $4 a gallon, the fifth-highest average price in the \n     country. The rising price of oil is putting a significant \n     financial strain on millions of Americans. Oil prices are at \n     their highest levels since 2008; gas prices are up an average \n     of 12 percent in 2012, and the national average price of \n     gasoline is now over $3.74 a gallon.\n       Given this situation, it is vital that the government make \n     use of every resource available to protect Americans from \n     price-gouging. For many consumers, the dramatic increase in \n     price for a commodity upon which they rely is more than an \n     inconvenience: It limits their ability to get to work, drives \n     up prices for goods of all kinds, and threatens to hinder our \n     nascent economic recovery.\n       While many factors contribute to the price of a gallon of \n     gasoline, there is a growing consensus among energy analysts, \n     independent observers, and businesses that operate in the oil \n     futures market that excessive speculation is contributing \n     significantly to these spikes in oil prices. I am very \n     troubled by this prospect.\n       We must make every effort to ensure that Americans pay fair \n     prices for gasoline and heating oil, and that the markets for \n     these commodities operate without manipulation or fraud.\n       Last April, you announced the formation of a Financial \n     Fraud Enforcement Task Force Working Group, charged with \n     focusing on fraud in the energy markets. I believe that the \n     recent run-up in prices in the oil futures market requires \n     more aggressive, muscular investigation and prosecutorial \n     action to crack down on possible widespread wrongdoing that \n     distorts the markets and drives prices higher. By making \n     vigorous and judicious use of your Task Force's investigative \n     and regulatory authorities, you can send a signal to \n     speculators that excessive manipulation and fraud in the oil \n     futures market will not be tolerated.\n       In May of last year, I wrote to you following the creation \n     of this Task Force. Citing the Department of Justice's wide-\n     ranging criminal and civil authority to investigate and \n     prosecute fraud and price manipulation, I maintained that \n     ``announcing such investigations and beginning to issue \n     subpoenas could curb some of the worst speculative activity \n     that may well be underway at this very moment.'' I continue \n     to believe that is the case, and I am hopeful that a renewed \n     focus by the Task Force will help restore some stability to a \n     market upon which millions of Americans rely.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I \n     look forward to your reply.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Richard Blumenthal,\n                                                      U.S. Senate.\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. I am seeking from the Attorney General that this task \nforce be proactive and effective by beginning investigations and taking \nwhatever action is necessary to combat illegality in these markets.\n  I believe if the Attorney General of the United States makes vigorous \nand effective use of his task force's broad investigatory and \nregulatory authorities, he can send the signal to speculators that \nmanipulation and fraud in the oil futures market will not be tolerated.\n  These gasoline prices are on the minds of Americans across the \ncountry. They have economic effects, but they also have effects on \nconsumer confidence and on the lifeblood of economic recovery. Even \nmore than the share of dollars that go to pay for gasoline at the pump, \nthere is an effect on consumer confidence.\n  This obligation on the part of our law enforcers is one that goes to \nthe core of their credibility--not just popularity. Credibility of law \nenforcement demands that the Attorney General of the United States take \nthis action to reenergize and revive the task force. I am hopeful, \nknowing of his reputation, that he will act accordingly to assure all \nof us that illegality, whether it is price-fixing or price-gouging or \ncornering the market, will not be tolerated and that effective action \nwill be taken against it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, the majority leader has indicated that \nthe Senate may soon turn to legislation to reform a much needed, much \nbeloved American institution--the U.S. Postal Service.\n  The Postal Service is nearly as old as our Nation itself. Our \nFounding Fathers recognized the importance of having a Postal Service. \nArticle I, section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to \nestablish post offices. This is the same section that allows Congress \nto declare war, to coin money, to borrow money on the credit of the \nUnited States, to collect taxes, et cetera. So, clearly, the Post \nOffice was viewed from the very beginning of our Nation as being \nessential to our economic well-being and to bringing together our \ncountry.\n  The Postal Service is also required by law to provide as nearly as \npracticable the entire population of the United States with adequate \nand efficient postal services at fair and reasonable rates. This is \nwhat is known as the universal mandate and it ensures that the Postal \nService cannot leave behind our rural States or our small towns. Yet, \nthe Postal Service, which has delivered mail to generation after \ngeneration of Americans, will not be able to meet its expenses sometime \nthis fall, according to the Postmaster General.\n  In the past 2 years alone, the Postal Service has lost an astonishing \n$13.6\n\n[[Page S1775]]\n\nbillion. First-class mail volume has dropped 26 percent since 2006, and \nthe trends are not encouraging. Since no one wants the mail to stop \nbeing delivered later this year, that means we must pass a postal \nreform bill and we must do so soon.\n  The economic impact of the Postal Service is enormous. It is the \nlinchpin of a mailing industry that employs more than 8.5 million \npeople and generates almost $1 trillion of economic activity every \nyear.\n  Virtually everyone--from big retailers to small businesses, to online \nshops--relies on the Postal Service to deliver packages, advertise \nservices, and send out bills. The jobs of Americans in fields as \ndiverse as direct mail, printing, catalog companies, and paper \nmanufacturing are all linked to a viable Postal Service.\n  Nearly 38,000 Mainers work in jobs related to the mailing industry, \nincluding thousands at our pulp and paper mills, such as the one in \nBucksport, ME, which manufactures the paper that is used for Time \nmagazine.\n  My point is, many of us think in terms of the post office by way of \nthe small post office that may be in our community or the friendly \nletter carrier who comes to our door. Certainly, that is an important \npart of the service provided by the Postal Service. But the economic \nimpact of the Postal Service is enormous.\n  The crisis facing the Postal Service is dire. They cannot lose \nbillions of dollars year after year after year and hope to stay in \nbusiness. The crisis is not, however, hopeless. With the right tools \nand action from Congress, the administration, and the Postal Service \nleadership, the Postal Service can reform, rightsize, modernize, and \ncontinue to serve our country for generations to come.\n  My colleagues--Senator Lieberman, Senator Carper, Senator Brown--and \nI have worked extremely hard during the past several months to craft \nbipartisan legislation to update the Postal Service's business model \nand give it the tools it needs to survive and succeed.\n  We have introduced a bill that will help the Postal Service reduce \nits operating costs, modernize its business model, and innovate to \ngenerate new revenue. However, the Postmaster General and I \nfundamentally disagree on how to save the U.S. Postal Service. I am \nconcerned--indeed, deeply worried--that he continues to make decisions \nthat will severely degrade the service and drive away customers, and \nthat will undermine the opportunity for our bipartisan legislation to \nbe successful.\n  It is clear we have two very different visions on how best to help \nthe Postal Service. While each of us wants to ensure that the Postal \nService is set on a sustainable path, I fear the Postmaster General's \napproach would shrink the Postal Service to a level that will \nultimately hasten its insolvency.\n  I cannot think of another business that would respond to a loss of \ncustomers by further shrinking its service to its existing customers. \nMost businesses, whether they are large or small, would redouble their \nefforts to better serve their customers in hopes of retaining them and \nattracting new businesses.\n  Yet the current plan by the Postal Service would slow the delivery of \nfirst-class mail, close facilities, and ignore Congress. It flies in \nthe face of the good-faith that I and the other negotiators have \nextended to the Postal Service during the many months we have worked on \nthe reform bill.\n  We have worked hand in hand over a number of months with the \nPostmaster General to craft a bill that would save the Postal Service \nmoney in a way that prioritizes the lifeblood of the mail: the mailers \nand the service around which commercial mailers have built their \nbusiness models and around which individual customers have developed \ntheir mailing habits.\n  Despite these negotiations, the Postmaster General has pushed ahead \nwith plans to abandon the current mail service standards in favor of \nreduced access, slower delivery times, and higher prices. That will \nsimply force many customers to pursue delivery alternatives. If those \nadjustments involve shifting to nonpostal alternatives--even in a \nminority of cases, say, 10 or 20 percent--the Postal Service would face \nan irreversible catastrophe. For once customers turn to other \ncommunications options and leave the mail system, they will not be \ncoming back. The result will be that the Postal Service will be sucked \ninto a death spiral from which it will be unable to recover. We simply \ncannot allow that to happen.\n  What do I mean when I say businesses will adjust their business \nmodel? Companies large and small that rely on the mail tell me if \nservice continues to deteriorate--if the Postmaster General engages in \nthese wide-ranging closures of essential processing plants--the Postal \nService's customers will conduct more business online and encourage \ntheir customers to switch to online services for bill paying and other \ntransactions.\n  Other companies, such as small weekly newspapers or pharmaceutical \nsuppliers, have told me they would seek nonpostal delivery options, \nsuch as for local delivery and transport services. Again, let's assume \nonly a small fraction of businesses change their operations by shifting \naway from the Postal Service. It still could spell the end for the U.S. \nmail system. Listen to this statistic: For every 5 percent drop in \nfirst-class mail volume, the Postal Service loses $1.6 billion in \nrevenue.\n  That is why the downsizing of the labor force and excess capacity the \nPostmaster General states is so critical to saving the Postal Service \nmust be carried out in a way that preserves service and does not \ninflict avoidable harm on dedicated postal workers.\n  Too many in the Postal Service leadership have assumed this simply \ncannot be done, that it is impossible. But the fact is there are many \noptions to cut costs and expand revenue while preserving service. Let \nme just mention some of them. Several of them are in the bipartisan \nbill.\n  First, we could reduce the size of processing plants without closing \nthem. I have suggested this for the processing plant in Hampden, ME, \nthat is on the chopping block. It should not be because it means that \nmail from northern Maine would have to make a 622-mile round trip for \nsome northern Maine communities in order to be processed. But if the \nprocessing plant is too big, reduce its footprint. Rent out part of the \nplant. That would even generate revenue and rightsize the processing \nplant without hurting delivery times.\n  We could move tiny post offices into local grocery stores. We could \nand should and must reform an expensive and unfair workers' \ncompensation program that costs the Postal Service more than $1 billion \na year.\n  We could allow the Postal Service to ship wine and beer the way its \ncompetitors can.\n  We could refund and should refund an overpayment into the Federal \nretirement system that amounts to between $10 billion and $11 billion.\n  The Postmaster General says he can develop a new health care plan \nthat would greatly decrease the need to prefund future retiree \nbenefits.\n  We could use buyouts authorized by our bill to encourage employees to \nretire. Many postal workers are eligible for retirement.\n  But, sadly, the Postmaster General is, instead, proceeding with a \ndisastrously flawed plan, as is evidenced by the recent announcement of \nDraconian processing plant closures. This coupled with the still-\npending closures of nearly 4,000 mostly rural post offices and the \nPostmaster General's push to eliminate overnight and Saturday delivery \ntell me the current postal leadership is gravely underestimating the \nconsequences of lesser service on revenue from customers who depend on \nthe service as it is provided today. That is not to say there is not \nexcess capacity. That is not to say the workforce should not be \nreduced, but it can be done so in a smart way and a compassionate way.\n  It also suggests the Postmaster General is prepared to have rural \nAmerica bear the brunt of severe reductions in service that violates \nthe universal service mandate.\n  The Postal Regulatory Commission concluded just that in its analysis \nof the impact of the proposal to end Saturday delivery. It found the \nsavings were far less than the Postmaster General had estimated.\n  The Postal Service will not be saved by a bare-bones approach that \nwill require massive adjustments by its customers. That will drive more \nof them out of the Postal Service. Perhaps that might have worked in a \ntime when customers had no alternatives, such as\n\n[[Page S1776]]\n\nwould have been the case decades ago. But today the massive shift to \nonline publications and commerce provides many businesses and \nindividual consumers with alternatives to using the mail. A good \nportion of them may well explore and settle on those alternatives if \nthe Postal Service makes it harder for them to serve their customers. \nFor customers who simply cannot adjust their business model, they could \nbe forced out of business, taking much needed jobs with them.\n  The approach taken by our postal reform bill, the 21st Century Postal \nService Act, would be to reduce excess capacity while still preserving \nservice for the customers of the Postal Service. Our bill would not ban \nthe closure of every single postal facility, but it would establish \nservice standards and allow for meaningful public comment procedures \nthat would ensure that delivery delays and the impact on customers are \nconsidered. The result would be that most facilities would remain open \nso as to preserve overnight delivery, Saturday delivery, and easy \naccess to bulk processing for commercial mailers.\n  Our bill would still allow the Postal Service to reduce the workforce \nusing buyouts, and it would still allow processing capacity to be \nreduced to match the declining volume. For example, rather than closing \na plant that has excess capacity, our plan would allow the plant to \ndownsize its labor and volume capacity. This could mean running one \nshift instead of two or a half shift instead of a whole shift or using \none sorting machine rather than two or using half the space and renting \nout the rest, and so forth. That way the plant could still process the \nmail in the region in a timely fashion while saving money and, indeed, \nin some cases, generating more revenue.\n  Under the Postmaster General's plan, however, that plant would close, \nand its volume would be processed much further away, thus degrading \nservice. The loss in revenue due to dramatically reduced service under \nthe Postmaster General's plan would not take place under our plan, and \nthe negative ripple effects on customers, jobs, and the broader economy \nwould be avoided with our bill set to come to the floor very soon.\n  The Postmaster General has nonetheless moved forward with \npreparations for sweeping closures and service reductions. That means \neven if our bill were to pass quickly, get through conference, be sent \nto the President's desk, and start to be implemented over a matter of \njust a few months, the Postal Service's ill-conceived actions would \nalready have done damage to its customer base.\n  After all, customers have to plan now for what they fear may be \ncoming. Customers are already making contingency plans and exploring \nalternatives. In this way the Postal Service has already triggered the \npotential hemorrhaging of customers that our bill would prevent should \nit become law. But on top of the damage already incurred, what this \nreckless move demonstrates is an attitude that is dead set on letting \nthe Service deteriorate and ignoring what customers want.\n  That attitude seems to be so stubbornly entrenched among the senior \nleaders of the Postal Service that I worry that even if our bill were \nto become law next week, the current Postal Service leadership would \nnot enact it properly. Without an attitude of service first, I am \nconcerned that all the important processes and considerations we put in \nthe bill could just become box-checking exercises for the Postal \nService; that it is looking to just maintain the appearance of \ncompliance rather than embarking on a new path.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. This approach by the Postal Service is all the more \ninexcusable given its unfortunate reputation for fuzzy math. By cutting \nservice and raising prices and not fully calculating the resulting \ndisastrous revenue losses, the Postal Service has put forth numbers \nthat we simply cannot rely upon. Unfortunately, this is not new.\n  The Postal Service's assumptions about the projected losses and \nsavings from service cuts have proven unreliable in the past, as the \nPostal Regulatory Commission has found. Furthermore, we are relying on \nthe Postal Service's data and projections without giving the Postal \nRegulatory Commission the opportunity to provide its advisory opinion, \nwhich is expected this summer.\n  I hope my concerns can be addressed. But it raises real questions \nabout whether proceeding with the postal reform bill is futile. If the \nPostmaster General is eroding the customer base and implementing \nservice cuts before we can enact legislation, are we just wasting time \ntrying to pass a bill? Can we still save the Postal Service?\n  So I find myself in a quandary, one created by the Postmaster General \nhimself as he shifts from plan to plan, from negotiation to \nnegotiation. This makes it extraordinarily difficult for those of us \nwho are so committed to saving the historic Postal Service so it can \ncontinue to be a vital American institution for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/19/senate-section/article/S1776-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 3606, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3606) to increase American job creation and \n     economic growth by improving access to public capital markets \n     for emerging growth companies.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Reed) amendment No. 1833, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Reid amendment No. 1834 (to amendment No. 1833), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 1835 (to amendment No. 1834), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Reid (for Cantwell) amendment No. 1836 (to the language \n     proposed to be stricken by amendment No. 1833), to \n     reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States.\n       Reid amendment No. 1837 (to amendment No. 1836), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid motion to recommit the bill to the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, with instructions, Reid \n     amendment No. 1838, to change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 1839 (to (the instructions) amendment \n     No. 1838), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 1840 (to amendment No. 1839), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nabout an amendment I am cosponsoring with Senator Cantwell as well as \nSenator Graham and Senator Shelby to reauthorize the Export-Import \nBank. This amendment is important to thousands of workers in Senator \nCantwell's home State of Washington, and I thank her for offering it \nwith me.\n  This amendment is not just important to the State of Washington; it \nis important to our national economy. It will create and support more \njobs than any other provision in the underlying bill before us today. I \nbelieve this is why there was unanimous bipartisan support last year \nwhen Senator Shelby and I passed this bill out of the Banking \nCommittee, and it is why we should pass it this week.\n  This legislation would ensure that the bank is able to continue to \nprovide support for U.S. exporters and workers. The amendment extends \nthe authorization of the bank for 4 years and will increase the bank's \nlending authority to $140 billion by 2015. It also strengthens \ntransparency and accountability at the bank, strengthens restrictions \nagainst companies doing business with Iran, and provides for greater \noversight of the bank's financing and any risks it may have to \ntaxpayers.\n  The Export-Import Bank is the official export credit agency of the \nUnited States. It assists in the financing exports of U.S. goods and \nservices to international markets. Following the financial crisis, the \nbank experienced a dramatic increase in its activities, as many \ncompanies struggled to find financing in the private market.\n\n  In fiscal year 2010, the bank saw a 70-percent increase in \nauthorizations from 2008. Last year the bank committed to almost $33 \nbillion in support of U.S. exports, a new record.\n  The bank has been self-funding since 2008, returning nearly $2 \nbillion to the Treasury. In fiscal year 2011 alone the bank generated \n$400 million to offset\n\n[[Page S1777]]\n\nFederal spending and bring down the budget deficit. It is not often \nthat we discuss government programs that reduce the deficit. So let me \nrepeat that. The Export-Import Bank returned $400 million to American \ntaxpayers last year.\n  We cannot take future success for granted, however. So I am pleased \nthis legislation will implement reforms to help ensure that the bank is \nworking as efficiently and effectively as possible to protect the \ntaxpayers. We must not forget American companies are competing in a \ntruly global marketplace. The Export-Import Bank plays a vital role in \nensuring that the global marketplace is also a fair one. When other \ncountries are helping their own companies with export financing, we \ncannot afford to unilaterally disarm in the face of this global \ncompetition.\n  Let me be clear. This is the JOBS bill. The Export-Import Bank \ncharter directs it to use exports to create and maintain jobs at home. \nLast year the Export-Import Bank supported almost 290,000 American \njobs. These are jobs in cities and towns across the Nation, at large \ncompanies as well as small businesses. In fact last year, the Export-\nImport Bank financed more than $6 billion in exports by small \nbusinesses, the engine of economic growth.\n  In my home State of South Dakota, Ex-Im has worked with large and \nsmall businesses to help export goods all over the world. In the last 5 \nyears alone it has helped support over $20 million worth of export \nsales. This support has been critical to many companies in my State as \nthey look to expand their customer base. More importantly, Ex-Im \nfinancing has helped support good-paying American jobs in South Dakota, \nsomething we need to make sure there are more of.\n  I believe while the bank is doing a good job, they can and must do \nmore. I believe this legislation will help the bank reach that goal. \nThis measure was a bipartisan effort in the Senate Banking Committee. I \nthank Senator Shelby for his support. In addition, I thank Senator \nWarner, Senator Bennet, and Senator Hagan for their important input \ninto this legislation.\n  The bank's current authorization expires on May 30, 2012--in just 2 \nmonths. It is important that we pass this jobs amendment today. I hope \nmy colleagues will support the Cantwell-Johnson-Graham-Shelby amendment \nto ensure that the bank continues to carry out its mission of \nsupporting American jobs and exports.\n  I would also like to briefly address a filed amendment on which \nMajority Leader Reid and Senator Udall have spoken, the credit union \nmember business lending amendment. As chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, I held a hearing on this issue last June. My staff and I \nhave told the leader and his staff since then that this is a very \ncontroversial matter.\n  From the testimony of the credit union and banking industry witnesses \nat that hearing, and the ongoing competition over the past month, it is \nclear there is no consensus. If the Senate chooses to go forward on \nthis issue, I urge the Senate to move forward carefully.\n  Finally, with respect to the underlying House bill, I would like to \nmake a few comments.\n  This is not the bill I would have drafted. Over the last several \nmonths, I have worked to enhance the investor protections contained in \nthe capital formation proposals passed by the House in a thoughtful \nmanner while helping to support entrepreneurs, grow small businesses, \nand put Americans back to work.\n  I will have a separate statement laying out my views in more detail.\n  I am pleased to have assisted my colleagues in crafting the Senate \nsubstitute amendment that addresses investor protection concerns. I \nurge my colleagues to support the Senate substitute.\n  If this body chooses to reject the enhanced investor protections in \nthe Senate substitute, we must remember that all Members of Congress \nhave a duty to keep an eye on the effects of these changes. We are \nplowing new ground here, and we have a shared responsibility to ensure \nthat, going forward, the new changes we enact into law will truly \nbenefit, and not undermine, both startups and investors alike.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I support the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee and his call for us to come together this week to support the \nexpansion of the Export-Import Bank. It is an extremely successful tool \nto use to help small, medium, and large businesses to be able to \ncompete overseas and to give small businesses--particularly Main Street \nbusinesses--the help they need to succeed in overseas markets, which \ncan be very daunting. I thank the chairman for his strong support and \nthe way he worked in a bipartisan manner. I plan to vote for that \namendment tomorrow.\n  The biggest vote we are going to take tomorrow is not on the Ex-Im \nBank. That is something that I think there is generally broad support \nfor, a general understanding, and a general level of comfort with, \nalthough there will be some who do not vote for the expansion of the \nbank because they philosophically are opposed to a muscular role of \ngovernment. Those of us who believe that the private sector, the \ngovernment, and nonprofits all need to have muscle working together on \nbehalf of the people we seek to serve will most certainly not allow \nideology to get in the way of voting for a good idea such as the Ex-Im \nBank.\n  That is not our problem. Our problem is the IPO legislation. I call \nthis the ``ill-advised political opportunity'' bill, the Jumpstart \nAmerica bill, the JOBS bill. It has several names, but what it does is \nderegulate financial markets under the guise of job creation.\n  Over the weekend, there were literally dozens and dozens of \neditorials against the House bill that we are going to vote on \ntomorrow. I know we are not coming fully into session in the morning, \nas not all the Senators are back in Washington at this hour on Monday. \nBut I know their staffs are watching the goings-on on the floor. I want \nto call everyone's attention to this IPO bill flying over here from the \nHouse of Representatives. It is not what you think it is. It is not \nwhat you have been told it is. It is flying under the guise of job \ncreation. It is flying under the guise of democratizing the credit \nmarket. It is flying under the guise of we have to do something to get \nmoney into the hands of mom-and-pop operators.\n  I said this last week. I don't think anyone has spent as much time on \nthe floor of the Senate arguing to get more credit into the hands of \nsmall business. I hope my credibility on that issue raises some \nquestions, at least, if I am on the floor saying vote against the House \nbill; do not vote for cloture on the House bill. I hope Senators can \nsupport the substitute, which I have offered in good faith with \nSenators Levin and Reed, the second ranking member on the Banking \nCommittee, and Senator Levin, who chairs the investigatory committee \nfor the entire Senate, the committee that has looked into financial \nscandal after financial scandal. And I am chair of the Small Business \nCommittee. We have come together, the three of us, to say: Wait a \nminute, slow down; this bill coming from the House, which had broad \nsupport, no doubt, is not what it looks like. It needs more work. It \nneeds more investor protections. It is a major change in the way people \ncan raise money, which is illegal now, for private companies on the \nInternet. If you want to start a company in America, you can ask your \nfriends, your parents, your children, or your neighbors--you can do a \nsmall circle of investors. But once you sort of make that known \npublicly, in a public way, such as in a radio announcement, or on a \nbillboard, or in a public way, such as on the Internet, there are rules \nand regulations you have to follow to make sure you are telling the \ntruth. Those regulations, in large measure, have been taken out of the \nHouse bill, generally.\n  Let me share with you, besides this name ``ill-advised political \nopportunity''--and look, some good people voted for the House bill, \npeople of good will, but I kind of think this bill got cobbled together \nbecause the majority on the House side can sort of put something in a \nRules Committee and that is the way it will be and, thank you, if you \nhave any opposition, the minority voice is quelled over there. That is \nthe nature of the House. But the minority should not be silent over \nhere, and our rules allow for a more full debate.\n  This is the time for the Senate to act as the Senate and slow this \ndown, cool\n\n[[Page S1778]]\n\nit off, get the right safeguards, and maybe it can be an excellent \nopportunity for changes to our financial markets. But it has to go \nthrough the process. This bill didn't even go through the Banking \nCommittee. It was going to go through the Banking Committee, and then \nthe decision was made to step on the gas, let's go for it, before it \nwent through a markup in the Banking Committee. A part of it came \nthrough our committee. We didn't even have a markup, but the two pieces \nfrom the SBA are not controversial, and we would be happy to mark up \nthe bill if given a chance. We could do it later this week.\n  Let me share with you some of the headlines. The New York Times, \nwhich, if there was any newspaper in America that understands Wall \nStreet, both its great strengths, its weaknesses--if there was any \nnewspaper that understands the financial markets, the New York Times \nwould be one of them. They said--and they are talking about the House \nbill--they said the JOBS Act is ``Paving a Path to Fraud on Wall \nStreet.''\n  We don't need to go back. We are just leaving the path to fraud. We \nare moving away from fraud. Now what are we going to do? Turn and go \nback to it?\n  The Washington Post said: ``Wall Street Credo: Ripping Out Their \nEyeballs.''\n  The PC World: `` `JOBS Act Would Revive Dot-com Abuses,' official \nclaims.''\n  Investment News: ``Job Act Merits Greater Scrutiny.''\n  Most shocking to me was the Bloomberg News: ``Small Biz JOBS Act Is a \nBipartisan Bridge Too Far: View.''\n  They wrote an excellent piece on this, which I will read some of into \nthe Record. Senator Jack Reed spoke about this. I am saying, Members, \nwhatever you have been told about this bill, please read the details \nand please read some of the very credible articles that are being \nwritten about the House bill.\n  There are good parts to it. I am a general supporter of crowdfunding, \nwhich is what I described--to make it legal for the first time in \nhistory for people to go on the Internet and raise money for private \nentities. I think the idea is a very good one. With the right \nsafeguards in place, it could be a boon to small businesses and growing \nbusinesses that sometimes are shut out of those very fancy boardrooms \nwhere decisions are made behind closed doors and in very secretive \nmeetings. I have been an advocate my whole life for opening this, so \nthat ordinary people, middle-class people, can get involved in creating \nwealth through investing, instead of it being a small club of those who \nmay go to the same school or go to the same social events and have the \nsame social network. We want to move beyond that. America is a great \nexperiment on how to create a middle class and give ordinary people the \nopportunity to create great wealth. We do that very well.\n\n  America has also been a place where we almost took down the whole \nworld financial community with us. That is how big we are, how strong \nwe are, and how careful we must be. We are not being careful; we are \nbeing too political with the House bill. We are not being careful.\n  What does Bloomberg say? They say this:\n\n       A spirit of bipartisanship is sweeping Capitol Hill, with \n     lawmakers poised to approve a package of bills aimed at \n     reducing regulatory burdens on small businesses. We wish we \n     could raise a glass. This moment has been too long in coming. \n     But the legislation it has spawned would be dangerous for \n     investors and could harm already fragile financial markets.\n\n  This is Bloomberg. Please listen. Bloomberg is not right on \neverything--no one is, no publication is, no Senator is; but this is \nBloomberg, the New York Times, and the Washington Post, and this is the \nhead of the Securities and Exchange Commission saying the bill is good \nbut it lacks investor protections that are essential for its proper \nimplementation.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       We agree that redtape can needlessly tie up small \n     companies. We also agree that security laws that bar start-\n     ups from harnessing the power of the Internet to raise funds \n     could use updating. And it makes sense to allow, as the bill \n     does, an initial public offering onramp, which could give \n     start-ups a chance to grow. But the JOBS Act goes too far. It \n     would gut many of the investor protections established just a \n     decade ago in Sarbanes-Oxley. A wave of accounting scandals \n     had upended Enron and WorldCom and destroyed nest eggs of \n     millions of Americans and upended investor confidence in Wall \n     Street.\n\n  We have to be careful. That is why the AARP sent out a strongly \nworded letter. This is one of the most powerful organizations in the \ncountry. Some of their members--the ones who were so grossly hurt by \nthe greed of Wall Street and the insatiable appetite of some of these \nlarge investment banks to make more money, because people need to make \nmore than $5 million a month. I don't know how you spend $5 million in \na month, but some people think they are entitled to make $60 million or \n$240 million a year. It is beyond comprehension. It wasn't enough for \nthem. They had to make more and more and more.\n  Millions of people whom I represent, and some in New York and in \nFlorida, lost their life savings. Are we going to go back to those \ndays, just because we want a bumper sticker that says we are about \ncreating jobs here? We are creating jobs now in America. Maybe it is \nnot fast enough for everyone, but every month the reports come out. \nLet's not rush and do something that will set us back.\n  This is what AARP said:\n\n       We are writing to reiterate our opposition to the lack of \n     investment protections in H.R. 3606.\n\n  If you vote for cloture on H.R. 3606 tomorrow, I hope when you go \nback home, the members of AARP--the largest and one of the most \npolitically powerful groups in the country--will ask you why did you \nvote on that bill? Please don't tell me it is about creating jobs. It \nis really about pulling the rug out from under investor protections, of \nwhich many older Americans who have a lifetime of savings in \ninvestments are disproportionately represented among victims of \ninvestment fraud.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       We share the concerns raised by SEC Chair Mary Schapiro, \n     the North American Securities administrator, law professors, \n     investor advocates, and others that absent safeguards \n     ensuring proper oversight, the various provisions in H.R. \n     3606 may well open the floodgates to repeat the kind of penny \n     stock and other frauds that ensnared financially \n     unsophisticated and other vulnerable investors in the past. \n     AARP urges the Senate to take a more balanced approach.\n\n  Mr. President, that is what we are trying to do, to take a balanced \napproach. I am not trying to kill the crowdfunding idea. I am not \ntrying to kill the IPO onramp idea, which is to help fast-growing \ngazelles, they call them, to grow a little before they have to bear the \nburden of some of those regulations, which, while important, can be \nburdensome. I understand that. My committee has been working for months \ncoming up with some very interesting ideas about how to get capital \ninto the hands of small businesses. It is not something that I am \nunaware of, but the House bill is not the way to go.\n  Even President Obama sent a statement. The White House sent a \nstatement that I will get in just a minute because I think it is \nimportant to see the nuances. Yes, it is true the President supported \nthe House bill. It is true some very good Democrats who are very good \nwatchdogs on this issue voted for the bill. But let me read the last \nsentence of the President's latest Statement of Administration Policy \nbecause the nuance is important.\n  The administration did say it supports the House passage of the \nbill--meaning H.R. 3606--but the last sentence says:\n\n       The administration looks forward to continuing to work with \n     the House and the Senate to craft legislation that \n     facilitates capital formation and job growth for small \n     business and provides appropriate investor protections.\n\n  The nuance is very important. The White House is signaling that while \nthey do support H.R. 3606, they would also welcome additional work to \nput investor protections into the law. I think that is good. I know \nthis President, this administration has worked hard to clean up Wall \nStreet. They have kept the automobile industry from the brink of \nfinancial collapse and have brought it back. That has restored \nconfidence in Wall Street, under great controversy and great criticism. \nI know it is one of the proudest achievements of this administration. \nSo under no circumstance would we want to go backward, not at this \ncrucial point. That is why I am afraid, if\n\n[[Page S1779]]\n\nwe don't fix this bill, that is exactly what will happen.\n  I wish I could have this in a larger format because I don't know if \nthe camera can see this, but this reflects the loss of jobs under the \nformer administration and the loss of jobs when President Obama took \noffice. Now we can see this almost reversing itself, with jobs being \ncreated in almost every month and every quarter. More than 3.9 million \nprivate sector jobs have been created in the past 24 months. And, yes, \nwe need to do more, but the House bill goes too far.\n  But don't just take my word for it; listen to the Bloomberg \neditorial, the Boston Globe op-ed against the House bill, the \nInvestment News editorials--``JOBS Act Merits Greater Scrutiny'' from \nthe Business Journal. Now, this is blog 3, but these are pretty \nreputable blogs. We just don't bring any blogs to the floor of the \nSenate. These are reputable bloggers that have received some kind of \nfollowing--``Why the JOBS Act Should Be In Trouble.'' New York Times \ncolumn: ``Paving Path to Fraud on Wall Street. JOBS Act to Rewrite the \nRules of Silicon Valley Investing.''\n  This is very interesting because my staff tells me the ``bio \ncommunity'' and the ``high-tech community'' are for this bill. I get \nthat. But this is what I don't understand, and I am quoting from one of \nthe blogs by Rafi Needleman, and he is writing as if he is in Silicon \nValley, and he is:\n\n       There is a lot of smart money looking for new places to \n     land, and these funding sources cannot only write sizable \n     checks, they can offer start-ups or other material benefits--\n     connections, tactical and strategic advice, and partnerships \n     with other start-ups in their portfolio.\n\n  So the question he is asking is, Why, basically, is it necessary to \nmove outside of these traditional sources when there is plenty of \nmoney? They are just looking for some good ideas. Throwing more money \nthrough an unregulated financial scheme is not going to create any new \nideas. It is just going to create a lot of money that could be taken \nadvantage of by very sophisticated people who understand how to take \ngood ideas and twist them into greed and fraud, if we don't have the \nright protections.\n  So there is a lot of capital out there. It is just not necessarily in \nthe right place. There is some opportunity for us to do some things. \nBut the last thing the Senate would want to do is debate this bill on \nthe floor of the Senate. This needs committee work. This bill needs to \ngo to a markup where it can be, in a few days, debated, negotiated, and \nthere can be amendments back and forth and we can fix some of the \nproblems. The last thing we need to be doing is flying a bill of this \nnature right through the Senate.\n  As I said, there has not been a jobs bill where I haven't kind of \nrushed to the floor. It may not have been perfect, but I have said: \nLook, we have to create jobs. Let's try it. Let's do it. And we have \ntried some new things. But when I saw this bill from the House was \ncoming directly to the floor without going through the Banking \nCommittee, that made me nervous. It made my political instincts stand \nup and say: Wait, wait, why are we rushing? The more I learned and the \nmore I read, it became apparent to me this bill from the House is not \nready for prime time. It is not ready to go to the President's desk for \nsignature.\n  So here we have Senator Reed, the ranking member on the Banking \nCommittee, and Senator Levin of Michigan, who has been a voice of \nreason and wisdom on financial deregulation and fraud and the scams \nthat have occurred not just on Wall Street but offshore in secret \nisland accounts where people have ripped off our citizens and then run \nfor the hills and we can't find them or run to the islands. Who knows \nabout these things? And he said: Wait a minute. What is going on here? \nSo that is why we are here.\n  I know the Senator from Michigan is here to speak, so let me wrap up \nby saying we have offered, in the spirit of trying to improve the House \nbill, a substitute. I am going to vote for the substitute. It is the \nReed-Landrieu-Levin substitute. I hope our Members and some \nRepublicans--I hope many Republicans; but if we could get a few, that \nwould be good--will vote for our substitute. If we get cloture on that \nthen we will go to a 30-hour debate on our substitute.\n\n  I want that bill to be open to amendment. I am not trying to ram \nanything through. We should be open to amendments--maybe 10 on the \nRepublican side, 10 on our side or whatever the leadership can agree to \nso that we can address some of the problems even in our own bill. We \nhad to rush so quickly to get in a substitute, there are one or two \nthings we would like to correct in our bill that have been brought to \nour attention.\n  In conclusion, if you can't vote for our substitute, please vote no \non cloture on the House bill--on the ill-advised political opportunity \nbill, or whatever they call it, the IPO bill, the JOBS Act bill, the \nonramp bill. They have a dozen names for it, but what it does is just \nwhat the New York Times said: It is a pathway to fraud.\n  We don't want to go back there. It is just what Bloomberg said. It is \nbipartisanship that we cannot raise a glass to. They said: We wish we \ncould toast it, but we cannot raise a glass. It goes too far.\n  So we have an opportunity to do something good for our markets, and \nour Presiding Officer, Senator Blumenthal, who is from the State of \nConnecticut, which has a tremendous amount of financial \nsophistication--he is well aware, as a former prosecutor, how important \nsome of these issues are. So it is important to get this right.\n  The bill, again, has come over from the House, rushed over here, and \nhas not gone through our Banking Committee. I will be happy to \nnegotiate with anyone on this floor. I am not wedded to any specific or \nparticular position on the small business pieces. They can be in \nthere--I think they are good--or we can take them out, and it can just \nbe a banking bill, although we have a lot of support for the increase \nin the SBICs and the 504 lending, which is very important to the small \nbusiness community.\n  But I feel so strongly about getting the deregulation part of this \ncorrect, I would take that out if it would help my Republican \ncolleagues to negotiate on the other part of the bill.\n  So I see Senator Levin on the Senate floor. I will turn it over to \nhim now. But, please, I am pleading with my colleagues to take a look \nat this House bill. Just read some of the details. Read some of the \ncomments of some great financial columnists, both on the left and \nright, who have written us against the House bill and urged further \nconsideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Louisiana leaves \nthe floor, I just want to commend her for the passion she has brought \nto this debate, as well as the reason and the wisdom she has brought to \nthis debate. This is a bill that is extremely complex. The House bill \ncomes over and it has had almost zero the attention it deserves because \nof the complexity in this bill. But Senator Landrieu has been a voice \nappealing to us to do what the Senate should do, which is deliberate.\n  If there has ever been a bill which cried out for deliberation, it is \nthis bill. The way it stands now, amendments are not going to be in \norder, and that is not the way we should proceed in this body. We are \nall grateful--I hope everyone is grateful--to Senator Landrieu for kind \nof blowing the whistle on the 100-mile-an-hour train that is moving \nthrough this Senate unless we stop it tomorrow and say: Slow this down. \nLet's look at the details of the provisions of this bill.\n  In the years since the financial crisis sent our economy into a \ntailspin, many of us in the Senate have sought to do what we could to \ncreate the conditions for a rebound in the job market so that American \nworkers could find the jobs they needed. We have fought, we have \ndebated, scratched, and clawed our way to do everything we could to \nboost job creation. Now before us is a bill called the Jumpstart Our \nBusiness Startups Act--the acronym being the JOBS Act. Just because you \ncan come up with an acronym which spells ``jobs'' should not lead \nanybody to believe this necessarily makes it a jobs bill. It is \nobviously a clever acronym that has been picked up by many people in \nthe media, so all of a sudden it is a jobs bill.\n  But when you look at this bill and when you look at the people who \nare in\n\n[[Page S1780]]\n\nthis field who have analyzed it, including people who are in the \ninvestment world, including the people who protect investors from fraud \nand abuse, from their perspective and the SEC's perspective and the \nCouncil of Institutional Investors' perspective, this is not a jobs \nbill. This is a bill which threatens jobs in this country.\n  Its supporters say it will create jobs. But, again, making it \npossible for an acronym to spell jobs doesn't make it a jobs bill. In \n``Alice in Wonderland,'' Humpty Dumpty could confidently declare to \nAlice: When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean. Well, \nwe don't have that luxury here in the Senate. Calling it a jobs bill \ndoesn't make it a jobs bill. And there is a rising wave of overwhelming \nconcern among those who know this area the best that the ground we are \nabout to tread on, far from helping to create jobs, is going to put \njobs in jeopardy.\n  The House bill before us would, its supporters tell us, allow \ncompanies--especially small growing companies that account for a large \nshare of the jobs created in our economy--greater access to the capital \nthey need to grow, market their products, and hire new workers. Its \nsupporters say it will create new links between investors seeking new \nopportunities and the companies that can put those investments to work.\n  For that to take place, investors need confidence that the new \nopportunities we seek to create are sound investments. But what are the \ninvestors telling us? They are telling us just the opposite. If this \nbill will help businesses attract new investors, why is the Council of \nInstitutional Investors and some of the largest pension and investment \nfunds in the Nation telling us it will frighten investors away rather \nthan attract them? If this bill will create new growth opportunities \nfor small businesses, why are business groups from the Main Street \nAlliance to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce appealing to us for changes? \nIf this bill will allow companies to access capital more easily, why \nare the current Chairman of the SEC and former SEC Chairmen of both \npolitical parties telling us this legislation will dampen capital \nformation rather than speeding it?\n  The problem is that in the guise of job creation, this legislation \nrolls back important investor protections and transparency requirements \nthat are fundamental to our capital markets. Under the legislation the \nHouse has sent us, investors will know less about the companies they \nare solicited to invest in, they will have less confidence those \ncompanies follow standard accounting practices, they will have no \nassurance that the solicitation they have just received over the \nInternet or by telephone is for a legitimate company and not for a \nboiler room fraud operation.\n  It does not have to be this way. We can remove obstacles to small \nbusiness growth without creating new opportunities for fraud. We don't \nneed to endanger jobs in the guise of helping to create jobs. Senator \nJack Reed, Senator Landrieu, Senator Brown, and I believe we can create \nnew opportunities for growing companies without creating a Wild West \nmentality in our capital markets.\n  I am now going to outline a few of the ways in which we seek to \nrepair the flaws of the House bill and enable real growth in job \ncreation.\n  Right now companies that need capital to grow and add jobs are \nallowed to sell stock in some cases without oversight by the SEC and \nunder looser legal liability rules. But in return for that reduced \noversight, the companies must sell almost exclusively to investors who \nmeet high income or asset thresholds that help to ensure they are able \nto understand and absorb the high risk of these investments. Right now, \ncompanies making these largely unregulated offerings are not generally \nallowed to offer them to the public. The House bill will allow \ncompanies to market these unregulated stock sales, known as private \nofferings, to the general public. They could advertise on billboards or \non TV or in cold calls to senior living centers, and offer them to \ninvestors regardless of the investor's ability to absorb the risk, and \nwith almost no oversight.\n  Our substitute would ensure that firms could sell these unregulated \nofferings only to investors better able to withstand the risks, and we \ndirect the SEC to develop advertising standards. These provisions in \nour substitute heed the lesson from an earlier mistake. In 1992, the \nSEC loosened rules on these unregulated stock sales but reestablished \nrestrictions 7 years later in part due to widespread fraud.\n  That is why groups such as the AARP say:\n\n       [The House] legislation represents a very considerable \n     redrawing of the lines between the public and private \n     markets, and should not be enacted without greater attention \n     to the potential risks of such an approach. We urge the \n     Senate to . . . adopt a much more narrowly targeted approach.\n\n  The State Securities Administrators say:\n\n       State securities regulators are deeply concerned that . . . \n     the Internet will be flooded with new securities offerings, \n     and . . . there will be no way for regulators--or prospective \n     investors--to reasonably determine if the particular issuer \n     is a legitimate business, or a criminal with good computer \n     skills.\n\n  There is another problem. Right now companies with more than 500 \nshareholders and $10 million or more in assets are deemed large enough \nand public enough that they must register with the SEC. Registration \nmeans they must provide the SEC and the public with regular financial \nreports and other information to help ensure that investors and \nregulators have an accurate picture of the company's finances. That is \nthe current situation. It also means that companies must comply with \naccounting and other transparency standards that help to ensure the \nintegrity of the market.\n  What does the House bill do? The House bill allows firms with up to \n2,000 shareholders--and perhaps significantly more--and with billions \nof dollars in assets to avoid registration and disclosure requirements, \nmeaning investors in even very large companies would have almost no \nmeaningful information on these firms. It would allow banks of any size \nto avoid oversight if they have fewer than 1,200 shareholders. This is \nnot a small business bill; this is a big business bill in many key \nrespects.\n  What do we do in our substitute? We ensure that large companies with \nwide public stock ownership register with the SEC, file regular \nfinancial reports, and follow standard accounting rules. We eliminate a \nloophole that allows one shareholder to hold shares for many beneficial \nowners by clarifying, as our substitute does, that when \ndetermining whether a stock is widely enough held to trigger the \ndisclosure requirements, what counts is beneficial owners, not just \nowners of record. And we do ease regulatory requirements, as does the \nHouse bill, for growing companies that use stock to recruit and \ncompensate employees by exempting them from shareholder account \nrequirements.\n\n  What do some of the outside independent viewers say about this?\n  Main Street Alliance:\n\n       Rolling back basic transparency rules, like SEC \n     registration, won't help small businesses. Instead, it will \n     tilt the playing field toward unscrupulous actors who are \n     looking to game the system.\n\n  Americans for Financial Reform:\n\n       The House bill would make it possible for companies, \n     including very large companies with a large number of \n     shareholders, to avoid making the periodic disclosures on \n     which market transparency depends.\n\n  The House bill's combination of unregulated stock offerings marketed \nto the general public, along with allowing even large, widely held \ncompanies to dodge meaningful transparency requirements, means that \nvery large companies could market their shares to the general public \nwith no meaningful oversight. They could do so without ever giving \ninvestors an accurate picture of their financial condition and without \nfollowing standard accounting practices.\n  The House bill is a recipe for widespread fraud that could undermine \nthe integrity of stock markets, frighten investors away from the \nmarket, and kill jobs instead of creating them.\n  What else exists currently that would be changed by the House bill \nand what would be corrected by our substitute? Right now, rules are in \nplace to prevent conflicts of interest in investment banks by building \na wall between research analysts who advise investors and salespeople \nwho try to convince investors to buy new stocks that they are \nunderwriting.\n  For example, at investment banks competing for the lucrative business \nof helping companies go public, the current rules help to prevent the \ninvestment banks from competing for that\n\n[[Page S1781]]\n\nbusiness by promising companies that their research analysts will give \nfavorable recommendations on the company's new stock. These rules were \nput in place based on the lessons of the dot-com bubble of the 1990s.\n  What would the House bill do? It would largely dissolve the wall, \ntear down the wall between research analysts and sales staffs for \ncompanies in advance of and up to 5 years following an initial public \noffering of stock. This has raised concern among regulators, investment \ngroups, and businesses that investment banks might issue misleading \nresearch in order to attract underwriting business.\n  What does the Chairman of the SEC say?\n\n       The House bill could return us to conflicts of interest \n     which ultimately severely harm investor confidence.\n\n  We in our substitute would keep these conflict-of-interest rules in \nplace as they currently exist.\n  What does the Chamber of Commerce say? This is called a jobs bill, \npro-business bill. This is what the Chamber says about this provision:\n\n       There may be a blurring of boundaries that could create \n     potential conflicts of interest between the research and \n     investment components of broker dealers.\n\n  The SEC Chairman, what does she say?\n\n       I am concerned that the House bill could foster a return to \n     those [conflicted] practices and cause real and significant \n     damage to investors.\n\n  What do the State Securities Administrators say? These are the folks \nin each of our States who try to protect us from fraudulent or \nerroneous representations relative to securities.\n\n       [W]eakening the standards applicable to research analysts . \n     . . could create a conflict of interest resulting in \n     devastating losses for Main Street investors.\n\n  That is our State Securities Administrators.\n  The Financial Analyst Institute:\n\n       In particular, we are concerned that the proposal to permit \n     brokerage firm analysts to write and distribute research on \n     companies whose IPO shares their firms are underwriting will \n     lead to the kind of conflicted research that decimated \n     investor confidence in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\n  In another provision in current law, companies that want to raise \nmoney by selling stock to the public must comply with accounting and \ndisclosure rules to help give investors accurate information on company \nfinances. These companies must obey standard accounting rules and have \nadequate internal controls. Many of these rules were a response to \nhigh-profile accounting frauds such as Enron and WorldCom, and some \nwere in the Dodd-Frank act in the wake of the financial crisis.\n  My Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations investigated Enron. We \nsaw what happened in the absence of these kinds of standard accounting \nrules being followed by companies. So what does the House bill do? It \ncreates a new class of company called emerging growth companies with up \nto $1 billion in annual revenues. How is that for small business, $1 \nbillion in annual revenues? It would be exempt from many of these \naccounting standards and financial disclosures. This $1 billion figure \nis so high that it would have exempted well over 80 percent of all \ncompanies that made initial public stock offerings from meaningful \ndisclosure and integrity rules in recent years. One billion dollars in \nrevenue is not anybody's reasonable definition of a small company.\n  What would we do in our substitute? We would reduce the House bill's \nrevenue exemption from $1 billion to $350 million, making it easier for \ntruly small firms to raise the money to grow, but we maintain important \ntransparency requirements for large companies. And what do the outside \nindependent folks have to say about this particular provision?\n  The Council of Institutional Investors, again representing the \nlargest investors in this country, pension funds and so forth, says:\n\n       The Council is concerned that the threshold may be too high \n     in establishing an appropriate balance between facilitating \n     capital formation and protecting investors.\n\n  The Chairman of the SEC says:\n\n       The definition of ``emerging growth company'' is so broad \n     that it would eliminate important protections for investors \n     even in very large companies.\n\n  The former SEC chief accountant, Lynn Turner, says:\n\n       The House bill's changes for companies of up to $1 billion \n     in revenues is a ``fundamental reduction in the level of \n     transparency and regulation for companies going public.''\n\n  And, finally, the issue of crowdfunding, so-called, where there are \nsmall investments by large numbers of people. Right now, the rules \ngenerally prohibit a company from raising very small amounts from \nordinary investors without significant costs. Some businesses would \nlike to attract small investments from ordinary investors by selling \nshares through the Internet through using intermediaries or funding \nportals--a practice known as ``crowdfunding.'' If done right, this \ncould be a useful tool of the Internet age that helps innovative \ncompanies find the funding they need to grow and add jobs.\n\n  But the House bill allows crowdfunding with almost no oversight or \ninvestor protections. Under their bill, companies could solicit \ninvestors through the Internet with virtually no regulatory oversight, \nliability for misstatements, transparency, or other investor \nprotections. Senior citizens, state securities regulators, and others \nworry that this will give rise to money laundering and fraud risks. One \nexpert calls it the ``Boiler Room Legalization Act.'' By allowing \ncompanies and funding intermediaries to solicit small investments with \nno oversight or accountability, the House bill essentially legalizes \nthe business model of unscrupulous boiler rooms.\n  Our bill creates new opportunities for crowdfunding but establishes \nbasic regulatory oversight, liability, and disclosure rules that will \ngive investors the confidence to participate in this promising emerging \nsource of money for growing companies.\n  What do outside groups say about crowdfunding?\n  AARP:\n\n       Crowd-funding web sites could become the new turbo-charged \n     pump-and-dump boiler room operations of the internet age. \n     Meanwhile, money that could have been invested in small \n     companies with real potential for growth would be siphoned \n     off into these financially shakier, more speculative \n     ventures. The net effect would likely be to undermine rather \n     than support sustainable job growth.\n\n  Consumer Federation of America:\n\n       Allowing direct issuer to investor solicitation over the \n     Internet, and preventing appropriate regulation of crowd-\n     funding portals, as the House bill would do, is a recipe for \n     disaster.\n\n  Professor John Coffee, who has written a textbook on this, says:\n\n       Without some changes . . ., one of these bills [which forms \n     the base text of the JOBS Act] could well be titled the \n     ``Boiler Room Legalization Act of 2011.''\n\n  Mr. President, the provisions of the House bill send the message that \nthe only way we can grow our economy and create new jobs is to lower \nthe protections that give investors confidence in financial markets. \nThe House bill we must subject investors to greater risk of fraud, that \nwe must put pension funds and church endowments at greater peril, that \nwe must endanger the financial stability of families, and indeed the \nstability of our entire economy, in order to grow.\n  We have walked this path before. Lowering our defenses to fraud and \nabuse has repeatedly brought our economy low. We lowered defenses to \nfraud in the savings and loan industry, and suffered the collapse of \nhundreds of financial institutions. We dropped defenses against fraud \nand abuse in financial statements and swaps markets, and created the \nEnron crisis. We lowered our defenses against heedless risk and \nconflicts of interest in the financial system, and created the Great \nRecession.\n  Did any of those steps help our economy grow? Did lowering those \ndefenses create a single job? There are 8.6 million reasons to believe \nthat eliminating barriers to fraud and abuse destroys jobs instead of \ncreating them--the 8.6 million Americans who lost their jobs in the \nfinancial crisis.\n  We need not make that same mistake. We need not embrace without \namendment a House bill that threatens fraud, abuse, investor doubt and \nrenewed crisis. We can embrace reforms that give small companies, the \nengine of our economy, the chance to grow without endangering the \neconomy.\n  We need not just to debate but to offer amendments to the House bill.\n\n[[Page S1782]]\n\nOur substitute is one amendment. We should not deny this Senate, which \nis supposed to be a deliberative body, the opportunity to amend the \nbill which will have such major consequences as the House bill would.\n  I hope tomorrow after we vote on our substitute, assuming it does not \npass, we will then vote on the House bill and I do hope we will not \nmake the terrible, tragic mistake of denying ourselves the opportunity \nto amend that House bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the INVEST in America Act--the Senate substitute amendment to \nH.R. 3606--that would add critical improvements in investor and market \nprotections to the bill that we received from the House.\n  In order to keep our Nation on the path to economic recovery, we must \nhelp small businesses access capital and reduce barriers for start-ups. \nHowever, we should not do so at the price of consumer safety or market \nintegrity. We must be very careful to do all we can to promote robust \ncapital investment and at the same time ensure investor protections are \nsecurely in place.\n  Many groups have voiced their staunch opposition to passing an un-\namended H.R. 3606--for fear of its effects on the investors and the \nmarket. Opponents include the: AARP, AFLCIO, AFSCME, Americans for \nFinancial Reform, Consumer Action, the Consumer Federation of America, \nPublic Citizen, The Economists' Committee for Stable, Accountable, \nFair, and Efficient Financial Reform, US PIRG, and other consumer and \ninvestor protection groups.\n  They have said that the bill ``will in fact only make it more \ndifficult for small businesses to access investment capital''--and it \n``risks exposing investors to a new round of damaging fraud and abuse, \nwhile undermining market transparency.''\n  President Obama recently urged the Senate ``to find common ground by \nsupporting the most effective aspects of the House Bill to increase \ncapital formation for growing businesses while also improving the House \nbill to ensure there are sufficient safeguards to prevent abuse and \nprotect investors.''\n  I cosponsored the substitute amendment offered by Senators Reed, \nLandrieu, and Levin because it does precisely what the President \nasked--it adds essential provisions to the House legislation.\n  Among other things, the INVEST Act amendment would: retain \nprotections put in place after the Internet stock bubble burst; ensure \nthat banks and other large companies, with lots of shareholders, are \nsubject to basic transparency, integrity, and accountability \nprotections; and reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, which provides \ncrucial funding to American businesses and supports almost 300,000 jobs \nyearly.\n  Most importantly, this amendment fulfills the original intent of this \nbill. It provides new opportunities for small businesses and \nentrepreneurs to grow by raising capital in a way that protects \ninvestors, provides financing so businesses can expand and hire more \nworkers, and encourages U.S. companies to export and compete in a \nglobal marketplace.\n  In short, it truly invests in America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nCantwell-Johnson amendment to the JOBS Act. This amendment, which \nreauthorizes the Export-Import Bank through 2015, is a critical step in \nour job-creation efforts here in Congress. We approved this bipartisan \nlegislation out of the Senate Banking Committee by voice vote in \nOctober. It is fiscally responsible, bipartisan, and will allow U.S. \nbusinesses to create jobs by leveling the playing field for American \nexporters.\n  If we do not act with urgency to pass this reauthorization, the Ex-Im \nBank will not be able to guarantee new loans starting May 31. As our \neconomy is finally showing some hopeful signs of recovery, now is not \nthe time to let partisanship tie the hands of our small business owners \nwho are ready to expand their companies and export their products.\n  For decades, the Export-Import Bank has supported job creation in \nAmerica. In fiscal year 2011, the bank supported nearly 300,000 \nAmerican jobs throughout the country and $41 billion in exports. In \nNorth Carolina in 2007, the Ex-Im Bank supported over $1.8 billion in \nexport sales by 169 companies, and 116 of those North Carolina \ncompanies are small businesses--the backbone of our economy.\n  The Ex-Im Bank has made small business growth a top priority, and \nthis is not just lipservice on their part. In conjunction with the \nbank, I have convened two global access forums in North Carolina, one \nin Charlotte and one in Greensboro, with bank President and Chairman \nFred Hochberg. We had over 400 North Carolina small business owners \nattend the workshops to learn more about exporting their products. My \nfour favorite words are ``made in North Carolina,'' and I am proud to \nwork with the Ex-Im Bank to help get that label shipped around the \nworld.\n  This bill also includes an amendment I sponsored that would add a \nrepresentative from the textile industry to the bank advisory \ncommittee. The textile industry has a rich history in North Carolina, \nwhere we have more than 1,500 textile facilities employing over 130,000 \npeople. But the U.S. textile and apparel industry has faced a lack of \nreliable supply chain financing that has caused them to fall behind. \nFortunately, the Export-Import Bank is well positioned to provide \nliquidity and financing to this industry.\n  I worked hard with my friend Chairman Johnson to include language \nthat would give textile and apparel producers a voice at this important \nagency. But whether it is a small yarn company in Sanford, NC, a \nfurniture producer in Morganton, NC, or a turbine manufacturer in \nCharlotte, just to name a few, the Export-Import Bank is truly a \nlifeline for growth for thousands of businesses that are ready to \nexpand, to hire, and to export.\n  Given the fiscal situation our country finds itself in right now, I \nwish to stress the following point for my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle and on both sides of the Capitol: The Export-Import Bank does \nnot add a dime to our deficit. It is a self-financed agency that pays \nfor itself. In fact, it more than pays for itself. Since 2005, $3.7 \nbillion has been sent to the U.S. Treasury by the Ex-Im Bank, and the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that a \nreauthorization will reduce the deficit by $900 million over 5 years.\n  We simply cannot afford to let partisan bickering hold up progress on \njob creation. The people of North Carolina didn't send me to Washington \nto sit on my hands while jobs take a backseat to partisan gamesmanship.\n  Reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank is common sense, it is \nbipartisan, it is fiscally responsible, and it is necessary for \ncontinued job growth.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Export-Import Bank \nreauthorization of 2012.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 3606, Reopening American Capital Markets to Emerging \nGrowth Companies Act of 2011, or JOBS Act, that passed in the House \nwith 390 votes. The components of this legislation have received \nbipartisan support in the House and broad bipartisan support from the \nSenate, President Obama, successful entrepreneurs, and a broad \ncoalition of startups, small and large businesses. I urge my colleagues \nto also support the amendment I offered with Senator Landrieu to \nincrease access to capital for small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n  First, I want to say a few words regarding the JOBS Act. This is a \nsolid measure that would allow more companies to access capital without \nthe burdens of unnecessary compliance. Most of us agree that well-\nintentioned regulations aimed at protecting the public and investors \nhave unintentionally placed significant burdens on the large number of \nsmaller companies. As a result, fewer high-growth entrepreneurial\n\n[[Page S1783]]\n\ncompanies are going public, and more are opting to provide liquidity by \nselling out to larger companies, thus hurting job creation. At a time \nwhen millions of Americans have been unemployed for the longest period \nin post-WWII history, we simply cannot afford to be in the way of job \ncreation.\n  The amendment I and Senator Landrieu introduced would also help small \ncompanies access capital by modifying the Small Business Investment \nCompany, SBIC, Program to raise the amount of SBIC debt the Small \nBusiness Administration, SBA, can guarantee from $3 billion to $4 \nbillion. It would also increase the amount of SBA guaranteed debt a \nteam of SBIC fund managers who operate multiple funds can borrow. The \nSBIC provisions in this amendment have bipartisan support, are \nnoncontroversial, come at no cost to taxpayers and will create jobs. We \ndo not get many bills of this kind in the Senate anymore.\n  One of the most difficult challenges facing new small businesses \ntoday is access to capital. The SBIC Program has helped companies like \nApple, FedEx, Callaway Golf, and Outback Steakhouse become household \nnames. As entrepreneurs and other aspiring small business owners well \nknow, it takes money to make money. This legislation ensures that our \nentrepreneurs and high-growth companies have access to the resources \nthey need so they can continue to drive America's economic growth and \njob creation in these challenging times. There is no reason why \nCongress should not approve this amendment to ensure capital is getting \ninto the hands of America's job creators.\n  This amendment will spur investment in capital-starved startup small \nbusinesses, which will play a critical role in leading the Nation of \nthe devastating economic downturn from which we have yet to emerge. For \nthose who may be unfamiliar, despite significant entrepreneurial demand \nfor small amounts of capital, because of their substantial size, most \nprivate investment funds cannot dedicate resources to transactions \nbelow $5 million. The Nation's SBICs are working to fill that gap, \nespecially even during these challenging times.\n  According to the SBA, over 300 SBICs have more than $17 billion of \ncapital under management. During fiscal year 2011, the SBA licensed an \nadditional 22 SBICs, which amounts to additional $840 million in \nprivate capital. Further, during fiscal year 2011 SBA issued \napproximately $1.8 billion in new debenture commitments to SBICs, a 50-\npercent increase over the 4-year average from fiscal year 2006 to \nfiscal year 2009 of $750 million. In fiscal year 2011, the SBA provided \n$2.6 billion in debenture capital to SBICs, which in turn was \ndistributed to over 1,300 small businesses, which SBA estimates \nsupported 61,000 jobs. In the most recent budget request for fiscal \nyear 2013, SBA requested $4 billion in authority for the SBIC debenture \nprogram, which operates at zero subsidy and requires no congressional \nappropriations.\n  The amendment I and Senator Landrieu introduced would also extend for \n1 year the refinancing option provided in the Small Business Jobs Act \nof 2010 to allow small business owners to use 504 loans to refinance up \nto 90 percent of existing commercial mortgages. The 504 Loan Program \nprovides approved small businesses with long-term, fixed-rate financing \nused to acquire fixed assets for expansion or modernization. According \nto the SBA, as of February 15, 2012, the $50 billion in 504 loans has \ncreated over 2 million jobs. The refinancing option in the Small \nBusiness Jobs Act authorized $7.5 billion in refinancing until \nSeptember 27, 2012. Unfortunately, because of a delay in promulgating \nregulations to enable refinancing, the program did not become \noperational until a few months ago, significantly shortening the period \nof time that business could refinance existing 504 loans. Like the SBIC \nProgram, the 504 Loan Program also comes at no cost to taxpayers, has \ncreated jobs, and will provide much needed relief to businesses for 1 \nadditional year.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned at the outset of my remarks, the SBIC \nProgram is a true job creator that does not receive any appropriated \nfunds. The 1-year extension of the refinancing for the 504 Loan Program \nwill allow businesses to retain employees, and it also comes at zero \ncost to taxpayers. There are solid measures that will help small \nbusinesses at a time when many small enterprises are struggling to keep \ntheir employees and run basic operations. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport this critical legislation as swiftly as possible, as our \nNation's capital-starved small businesses deserve no less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                          Remembering Lyn Lusi\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are given an opportunity in the Senate \nto witness many things that have an impact on our values and on our \nvotes. I have found that, of course, representing my own State and \nknowing the challenges families face from one end of the State to the \nother has really driven me in terms of my legislative agenda--the \nthings that are important to me. That is my first priority.\n  As I have traveled across the United States, I have found other \nissues that are of great magnitude and have real import when it comes \nto the lives of people across this Nation. I have also taken some time \nto visit countries overseas, knowing that the United States is part of \na world community and that even though the amount of money we may \ninvest may be small, it can have a profound impact on some of the \npoorest places on Earth.\n  It was about 6 years ago that I made my first visit to the Democratic \nRepublic of Congo. This was a part of Africa that I had never seen \nbefore, and I went to the city of Goma. Goma, in the eastern reaches of \nthe Democratic Republic of Congo, is remote from the capital of that \ncountry and has unfortunately become a site where thousands of innocent \npeople have been killed.\n  When I visited Goma, it was clear that it suffered from some of the \nworst problems of the region: poverty, obviously; disease and war; and \ntroops who left Rwanda after the genocide were living in the jungles of \nGoma. People were being preyed upon and killed, raped, mutilated. Then, \non top of all of that, in Goma sits a volcano that erupts with some \nfrequency, so as one walks through the streets and into the refugee \ncamps, one finds this dried crystalline lava that is almost like broken \nglass, people walking on it, living on it, trying to make a life in \nlittle holes dug out in the lava. It is something one never forgets and \nI have never forgotten. I went there, of course, taking a look at some \nof our important programs we deal with. The most important, of course, \nis trying to bring peace to the region.\n  One of the most serious issues in the Democratic Republic of Congo is \nthe fact that in these eastern regions are precious minerals which are \ncritical for the development of new technology. We carry in our cell \nphones minerals which are found more frequently in that part of Africa \nthan in most other places around the world. Because there is little or \nno government reach in these areas, there are people who have taken \nover the mining of these minerals and make millions of dollars off of \nthem using slave labor and terrorizing the local people, pushing them \ninto refugee camps.\n  I am working with Congressman Jim McDermott of the State of \nWashington to try to establish some standards, as well as former \nSenator Sam Brownback of Kansas. The object behind that, of course, is \nto trace the minerals so that those respectable, law-abiding companies \nin the West will not be buying these conflict minerals. We are working. \nIt is hard. The Securities and Exchange Commission is trying to \npromulgate a rule to implement something we passed in Dodd-Frank with \nSenator Brownback's leadership on a bipartisan basis.\n  My memory of Goma goes back to a specific scene and a specific visit. \nIt was more than 6 years ago. We were invited to tour a hospital. We \nwent to this hospital. And to say it was a hospital by American \nstandards--no American would agree. Searching inside the hospital, we \nfound one modern surgical suite. It was paid for by the United Nations. \nThen we went to the wards where the patients were--virtually all \nwomen--and found them two to a bed recovering from surgeries.\n  Outside the hospital, sitting on this lava bed that really covers the \ncity, along the road were dozens of women waiting for their turn. They \nare the victims of something known as obstetric fistula, which means \nthey have either been brutally attacked, sexually\n\n[[Page S1784]]\n\nattacked, or were bearing children at such an early age that it caused \ndamage to them, which has left them incontinent. Because of their \nincontinence, they were rejected by their families and neighbors and \nforced to walk hundreds of miles to sit in the roadway and pray that \nthey could get inside that hospital for a surgery to repair this \nobstetric fistula. Many of them, because of the severity of their \ninjuries, went through multiple surgeries, so they would sit on the \nroad and wait for weeks, go in for a surgery, recover, and then go to \nthe back of the line and start over for the next surgery. That was the \nreality of the hospital we visited. The scene was grim, even horrific. \nI still remember it well.\n  The reason I come to the floor today is that I made a return trip 2 \nyears ago with Senator Sherrod Brown to Goma and to look up this \nhospital--this small little oasis of hope--to try to find a handful of \ndoctors who had been there when I visited just a few years before to \nsee what had happened. I knew the hospital continued to treat \ndesperately poor and brutalized women of the region who had suffered \nbecause of brutal rape and horrific violence.\n  For two decades now, this war has gone on, which has led to these \nvictims. Regional militias have been fighting over these minerals I \nmentioned earlier, too often using rape as a weapon of war. According \nto the United Nations, the Democratic Republic of Congo is the worst \nplace on Earth to be a woman. Regional war and rape leave an estimated \n1,000 or more women assaulted every single day, so 1,000 or more rapes \nand sexual assaults every day, or 12 percent of Congolese women--one of \neight--have been victims.\n  Yet there is hope. That small hospital I saw years ago gave me hope. \nThe two people who started that hospital were Lyn Lusi and her \nCongolese husband Dr. Jo Lusi. They founded this hospital and called it \nHeal Africa. It is in one of the most forgotten and dangerous places on \nthe Earth--Goma in eastern Congo. Lyn and her husband Jo provided a \nplace of love, hope, rebirth, and healing.\n  There was a special on PBS's ``NewsHour'' recently that talked about \nHeal Africa, the hospital, and Lyn and Jo Lusi. They survive on $13 \nmillion a year--a huge sum in that part of the world but by global \nstandards or American standards hardly overwhelming. They get private \ngrants from overseas. They provide antiretroviral drugs to those \nsuffering from HIV, and they try to repair the bodies of these \ntraumatized women.\n  The PBS ``NewsHour'' special on Heal Africa showed how the hospital \nworks with the American Bar Association--and I want to give a shoutout \nto them for the work they are doing in Goma--to help rape victims \npursue justice against their attackers. The country virtually has no \njudicial system. It is the only facility offering services to an area \npopulation of 8 million people. Eight million people--I try to imagine \none hospital in metropolitan Chicago, and that is what Heal Africa is \nin Goma.\n  In a moving ``NewsHour'' interview, Lyn Lusi said:\n\n       I have no illusions that we're dealing with major issues \n     that are pulling Congo apart. There is so much evil and so \n     much cruelty, so much selfishness, and it is like darkness. \n     But if we can bring in some light, the darkness will not \n     overcome the light, and that's where faith is, if you believe \n     that. I don't think Heal Africa is going to empty the ocean, \n     but we can take out a bucketful here and a bucketful there.\n\n  That sentiment and that hope--amid such cruelty and devastation--\nsummed up Lyn Lusi's heroic work and the work of her husband.\n  As I reflect on what I saw in my first trip to Goma and what I saw \nwhen I returned, there was a dramatic change in just a few short years. \nThis Heal Africa, which was barely existing, with a handful of \nsurgeons, now has become a training hospital, with American \nuniversities taking part.\n  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton visited Goma and Heal Africa--this \nvery hospital--to focus the world's attention on the region. The \nviolence in eastern Congo is part of an ongoing conflict and about 3 \nmillion to 5 million people have died there so far--and it continues.\n  As I said, the roots of the conflict go back to the Rwandan genocide, \nthe fight over minerals, elements of the Ugandan Lord's Resistance \nArmy--this Kony fella, who now people are starting to take notice of, a \nbutcher in his own right--and elements of the Congolese Army who have \nbeen involved in human rights abuses.\n  There is a 20,000 member United Nations peacekeeping force in the \nregion. It has been there for more than 10 years. I do not know how \nthey can maintain any semblance of order without them. I salute the \nUnited Nations and those who are on the ground trying to keep a \npeaceful situation.\n  We saw sprawling refugee camps on broken lava, human rights workers \nwho bravely documented horrific sexual violence, and dire poverty and \nwarlords amid any semblance of a functional national or local \ngovernment. Stopping at Lyn and Jo Lusi's hospital was the highlight of \nthe trip.\n  When I was at Heal Africa on the second visit, I looked and saw a \nclassroom filled with doctors. In fact, standing in front of them was a \ndoctor from the University of Wisconsin. He was wearing a T-shirt which \nhad the Wisconsin Badger on it. That is how I noticed it right off the \nbat. That is where my daughter went to college. He said: Yes, these are \nall students from medical schools around the United States, coming here \nto learn and to help.\n  Today, the hospital has trained 30 young Congolese doctors and many \nother health workers. They will have an important job for many years to \ncome.\n  The reason I come to the floor is because we received sad news. Lyn \nLusi--whose picture I show here in the Chamber with her husband Jo--was \ntruly the heart and soul of Heal Africa in Goma. The two of them gave \ntheir lives for the poorest people on Earth. They struggled and \npersevered and conquered so many obstacles that many of us never ever \nsee in life.\n  We just got word this morning that Lyn passed away from cancer. I \nwished to come to the floor and remember her and the great work she has \ndone, which I am sure will be carried on by Jo her husband and all \nthose who have been inspired by our visit.\n  To think that this woman would go to one of the poorest places on \nEarth and dedicate her life to help others should inspire every single \none of us.\n  Lyn Lusi was like a mother to 400 employees of Heal Africa and to \nthousands and thousands of women, children, and even men, for whom Heal \nAfrica was their only source of quality, professional medical care.\n  Her death this weekend due to cancer is a terrible loss for Goma, it \nis a terrible loss for the Democratic Republic of the Congo and for \nAfrica, and it is a terrible loss for every single one of us.\n  We need to make certain that what she gave her life to does not end \nbut continues. We have to make certain her heroic efforts continue \nthrough her husband Jo and through all who have participated in making \nsure this lonely, tragic corner of the world is never forgotten.\n  I come to the floor to salute Lyn Lusi, her memory, her legacy, and \nher inspiration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/19/senate-section/article/S1784-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \nfamily who has built their lives around the legacy of their heritage \nbut has not turned a blind eye toward progress in their pursuit for a \nbetter future: the Mortimer family of the town of Salyersville, in \nMagoffin County, KY. Doug, his wife Sue, and their son Ritter have \nspent the greater part of their\n\n[[Page S1785]]\n\nlives investing in the future of their local community, to make it not \nonly a better place for themselves, but for all of the residents of \ntheir beloved town.\n  The Mortimer family is active in several different areas of the \nbusiness world, but they got their start in the media industry. Doug \nand Sue were photographers for WSAZ TV in Huntington, WV, for quite \nsome time. But what they found was that Huntington was too far away to \nbe covering Magoffin County news. One day when Ritter told his parents \nthat he wanted to do something ``creative'' instead of return to \nschool, it sparked a crazy idea in Sue. She thought of the potential \nthat a local TV news station could have, and she proposed her idea to \nher husband and son. They were sold. And YNT, ``Your News Today,'' took \noff.\n  Ritter is the sole proprietor of the 30-minute news show that started \nin 1998. He operates virtually every part of the show that airs every \nweekday. The family has found that the town cherishes their local news. \nRitter believes its success comes from the fact that the material his \nnews show covers can't be heard anywhere else in the world. The show \ncovers serious topics such as fatal accidents as well as happier topics \nlike Little League softball games, making it really local news for \nlocal people.\n  As the news station continues to grow, so do the other projects of \nthe innovative Mortimer family. The family opened up two restaurant \nfranchise locations, a Dairy Queen and a Lee's Famous Recipe Chicken, \non the city's new parkway. The location on the parkway was necessary to \nbring in business because of the heavy traffic flow in the area. But \nDoug and Sue remember a time when downtown Salyersville was the place \nto be. The downtown area has been slowly decaying in the town of \nSalyersville as businesses move to the parkway, downtown buildings get \nolder, and times change.\n  Sue, however, believes that downtown still has a lot more potential \nthan one may think. She has headed up a movement called Renaissance on \nMain that is devoted to renovating and restoring the historic buildings \nof the once-popular downtown area. The movement has already made major \nheadway in the downtown area, thanks to the superb leadership of Mrs. \nMortimer.\n  Whether it is delivering the news, serving up the day's meal, \nrestoring a building to its former glory, or taking wonderful \nphotographs, the Mortimers have a driving force behind every move that \nthey make, and that force is family. The good of the family is at the \nheart of every decision they have made, the greatest of these probably \nbeing the decision to stay in the small town of Salyersville despite \ntheir many chances to move away. Doug, Sue, and Ritter believe they \nhave an obligation to stay and serve the town in which they were born \nand raised, and they are saddened when young and talented residents \nmove away. The Mortimers are constantly fighting to better their \ncommunity so that young ones are motivated to take a stake in their \nheritage and invest in the future of their hometown.\n  The Mortimer family treasures the past and embraces the future. They \nhave come to understand the importance of their heritage and to respect \nthe legacy of those before them. They have also realized that change is \nnecessary, and if you embrace the future and prepare for it, you can be \nmore in control of the changes brought on by time. The Mortimer family \nis passionate about bettering their local community, providing jobs, \ndelivering information, and beautifying their surroundings--all things \nthat contribute to helping their fellow residents of Salyersville. That \nis why I would like to take the time today to give them the credit they \nmost assuredly deserve.\n  Mr. President, I would ask my Senate colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing the Mortimer family of Salyersville, KY, for honoring and \npreserving the past, as well as preparing and embracing for the future.\n  In 2011, an article was included in a publication released by the \nSoutheast Kentucky Chamber of Commerce that highlighted the many \naccomplishments of this remarkable family over the years. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Southeast Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, 2011]\n\n                The Mortimers--A Good Place To Call Home\n\n       Spending time with Salyersville's Mortimer family--Doug, \n     Sue, and their son, Ritter--is almost like being in two time \n     periods simultaneously.\n       Doug and Sue live in the same home Doug's mother's parents \n     lived in, and Ritter lives in the previous home of Doug's \n     father's parents. Doug and Sue have decorated the first floor \n     of their home with the charming period furnishings; they even \n     have a family tree on display they've created from their \n     study of Doug's North Carolina genealogy. They are \n     enthusiastic supporters of the Magoffin County Historical \n     Society and have recently bought two buildings downtown which \n     they are planning to restore.\n       Then there's Ritter. Ritter owns his own television news \n     broadcast, YNT (Your News Today), and is getting ready to \n     stream his news show online. The innovative technology of \n     today is something that was not even dreamed about in the era \n     when the homes were built. The Mortimers have seamlessly \n     embraced respect for the past and enthusiasm for the future.\n       Perhaps the most impressive dynamic among the family is \n     their obviously deep love and admiration for one another, and \n     not just among the three of them, but towards all their \n     family. When asked why, with their talent and business \n     acumen, they chose to stay in Magoffin County, Doug says \n     without hesitation, ``It's family first--nothing would matter \n     if we couldn't be near family.''\n       Sue continues, ``My siblings had left here and when we \n     married, Doug said, `Look, there's not going to be anyone \n     here to take care of our parents when they get older. I've \n     tried working away and I don't like it. It'll be hard, but I \n     think we just need to stay here,' '' she laughs. ``Whatever \n     it takes, he's going to stay here.''\n       So how did they make it in a small town in eastern \n     Kentucky? ``Sue and I have been photographers for 40 years,'' \n     Doug says, ``since just after we were married. My dad was a \n     photographer, too, so it was an outcrop of that.''\n       ``Besides photography, we've been in the restaurant \n     business about 25 years with the DQ and Lee's Famous Chicken \n     on the Parkway,'' Sue continues. ``We've tried the oil \n     business, an outcrop of my dad's business, which was always \n     boom and bust. This whole area has been a big part of our \n     success, especially our photography--it's not just our town \n     and county.''\n       Years ago, both Doug and Sue were stringers for WSAZ TV in \n     Huntington, West Virginia. ``During that time,'' Sue \n     explains, ``if something newsworthy happened here, I'd grab a \n     camera, cover the story, and stick it on a Greyhound bus to \n     Huntington. Then when the bus service stopped it finished the \n     whole thing because it wasn't worth the effort to drive it to \n     Huntington--but we still had those connections. They'd call \n     and say, `We're going to be up there next week and do three \n     or four stories. Can you set something up for us?' Well, then \n     Ritter came around one day and said, `I'm not going back to \n     school. It might sound crazy, but I know I have to do \n     something creative, and I want to stay here.' I thought, `Oh, \n     gosh, if we try something and it fails, he could go into a \n     tailspin and never find his way--that can be typical of young \n     people. What could he do that was ``guaranteed'' to succeed?' \n     Then I thought of the news thing. They both thought I was \n     crazy.''\n       Doug agrees. ``We both thought it sounded crazy, but Sue \n     was right. She knew the potential.''\n       ``Well,'' Sue explains, ``we had done videos of weddings, \n     so we had a lot of the basic equipment.''\n       When asked why he decided to pursue TV, Ritter laughs and \n     says, ``Because my mother pushed me! It really was her \n     idea.'' He continues, ``I had a camera and a VCR and a few \n     pieces of equipment and just started doing it.''\n       YNT News, referred to locally as RittTV, first aired on \n     November 2nd of 1998. It's carried on local cable network \n     Howard's Cable, which goes into Magoffin, Morgan, and Johnson \n     counties and averages 3,500 to 3,700 subscribers. The show is \n     30 minutes long and airs at 6:00 and 11:00 p.m. every \n     weekday. It is now approaching 4,000 broadcasts.\n       Sue says, ``When it started out, the local cable advertised \n     it was coming maybe the week before it started, and people \n     were already like, `When's the new show going to start?' It \n     was the buzz around here.''\n       ``I don't really know what got it off the ground,'' Ritter \n     says, ``but I think it's successful today because it's \n     material no one can see any other way. I'll cover a court \n     meeting or a child doing well in school. One family has told \n     us they have a 92-year-old grandmother who lives where she \n     can't get TV cable, so they record the show every night and \n     take it to her so she can watch the show.''\n       Ritter does it all--covers and prepares the stories for the \n     air, sells and produces the commercials, everything needed to \n     get the story on and make a living doing it.\n       ``No two days are alike,'' Ritter says, ``and that makes it \n     interesting. One day I might do a reconstruction of a fatal \n     accident. I'm also on the rescue squad, so Thursday I was up \n     helping with emergency service. Then\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\n     after that's over, I do pictures and get back to the news. \n     Another day, I'll cover a city council meeting, an ATV story, \n     the softball championship game, or someone knocking down \n     mailboxes!''\n       ``He's very versatile. He's like his daddy--he can do just \n     about anything,'' Sue says proudly. ``All the new technology \n     has made Ritter's station possible. The change from tapes has \n     allowed him to work with less manpower.''\n       The Mortimers' devotion to where they live goes beyond lip-\n     service. They are very involved with the Renaissance on Main \n     program, as well as personally investing in restoring \n     downtown Salyersville.\n       ``We bought a couple of buildings downtown that we're in \n     the process of restoring,'' Sue says. ``When Doug's parents \n     were young, they had the Tavern Restaurant, and people would \n     come and just sit and visit.\n       ``Downtown was a hopping little place then. We'd like to \n     see that again. It does make you stop and think about the \n     need to revitalize downtown.\n       ``The second floor of one of our buildings is going to be \n     the Mortimer Inn--a B without the breakfast. There's no \n     place here at all for families to stay who have sold the \n     homeplace and want to come back for a visit, or whatever \n     reason. Paintsville or Prestonsburg are the closest. So we'll \n     try it and see how it works.''\n       Doug explains, ``The first floor in one building is rented \n     to a gas company. The other--which we bought just about four \n     months ago--we haven't done much with yet. We couldn't do a \n     lot with the first as far as restoration, but the second one, \n     we may be able to take it back to the original '30s when it \n     was built; it's in good enough shape, we think, to do a true \n     restoration. It was originally a grocery store--the oldest \n     business in town--run by a woman named Grace Howard for as \n     long as she could breathe. She owned the building and lived \n     upstairs.''\n       Sue continues the story. ``Eight or 10 years ago, I put \n     together the local Renaissance on Main group and I guess I \n     took myself too seriously. When we saw the building, I \n     thought, `Oh, we can do something with that.' We put two \n     businesses on the Parkway, but they had to be there to get \n     the traffic. The strip is in the city limits, and the \n     business and restaurant taxes do help different things in the \n     city. Still, we've helped pull things out of the downtown \n     area, so maybe what we're doing now will help bring it \n     back.''\n       ``One of the greatest things downtown, I think,'' says \n     Doug, ``is the Pioneer Village, a project of the Magoffin \n     County Historical Society led by Todd Preston. It's just \n     amazing what a handful of people have done. Those are \n     original homes and schools from out in the county that have \n     been dismantled and reassembled. It's very active--open to \n     tourists. At Christmas, we have a beautiful parade, and on \n     that night the cabins are opened up, with fires in the \n     grates, and people come in with banjos. It is really nice.''\n       Sue talks further about the Renaissance on Main program. \n     ``Our headquarters are in an old stone building, probably the \n     second location of Salyersville National Bank, and they \n     donated it to Renaissance. They had already made some changes \n     on the first floor added--sheetrock and took out tin--but now \n     we've got it and we're looking at restoring it. We've gotten \n     the money to finish the second floor. Behind the building, \n     there's a garden area that we've had put in using stone from \n     a two-story, hand-carved stone drug store that was being torn \n     down. Renaissance saved all that stone and used it for the \n     garden area and will use the rest for the base of the stage \n     of a theatre.\n       ``Behind the Judicial Center, there's a mural you can see \n     on your way out of town. We raised money through donations \n     and picked out some historic locations to have painted on the \n     wall. Renaissance also did a water feature when you first \n     come into town,'' Sue finished. ``We've really worked hard.''\n       When looking at the future, it's clear to see that to the \n     Mortimers, the history and heritage of the past is an \n     important part of the future.\n       When Ritter is asked what lies ahead for him, he smiles and \n     says, ``I spend so much time getting stories, I don't have \n     much time to look down the road.''\n       Sue adds, ``He was offered a top position at a Knoxville \n     station several years ago, but moving doesn't interest him. A \n     regional station called him also--he told them, `You don't \n     have enough money.' ''\n       Doug says, ``From all of us, we couldn't imagine living \n     anywhere else--we just wouldn't. Right now, there are lots of \n     changes happening. It may not happen overnight, but \n     Salyersville and Magoffin County are only going to keep \n     getting better. It's easy for a community to lose its way, \n     but I think people are realizing they need to be involved and \n     to claim it. When young, talented people think about leaving, \n     we need to tell them, `You're really going to be sorry if you \n     leave; the bright lights of the big city aren't all they're \n     cut out to be.' They need to understand they have a sort of \n     obligation to stay around and help this region get better. \n     After all, you can travel to wherever you want--you're not \n     that far from Lexington or wherever you want to go--but this \n     is a good place to call home.''\n       ``We've taken advantage of opportunities here and we've \n     been successful and happy,'' Sue goes on. ``Take Ritter, not \n     many people his age can say `I love what I'm doing and I'm \n     making a living out of it--and I stayed home.'

Mr. Gervis Singleton of Laurel \nCounty, KY, has been established in the funeral and mortuary services \nbusiness for over 50 years. He has treated each and every family who \nhas had the unfortunate need for his services as if they were his own.\n  Mr. Singleton owns Cumberland Memorial Gardens and Mausoleum and is a \npartner, along with his son, Craig Singleton, of Singleton Embalming \nService. Gervis has experienced first-hand the grief process thousands \nof families have gone through during the death of their loved ones; his \nfather passed away when he was only 11 years old. He believes that \nmourning is a very important part of the grieving process, and he takes \npride in knowing that he is doing what he can to help them through such \ndifficult circumstances. As someone who is experienced in an area that \nis new to many of us, he is more than happy to assist the deceased's \nloved ones in whatever way he can.\n  Gervis knows that his job is very much linked to emotion, but as a \nmortician, he understands that he must block out his own emotions while \nworking on the important process of restoring the deceased individual \nto more closely resemble how their loved ones remember them in life. He \nfeels that if he can assist the family during their time of mourning, \nthat they will more likely gain closure on the loss.\n  During his half century working in the business, he has seen fads \ncome and go. Mr. Singleton remembers the day when it was almost a \nrequirement to wear all black to a funeral, a custom that he has seen \nalmost completely go away. He has also seen families transition to more \ncremations in the past few decades. Cremation is a cheaper, sometimes \nmore convenient alternative. The increase in number of cremations \nsparked an idea for Mr. Singleton, and in 1995 he built a signature \naddition to the Cumberland Memorial Gardens. The result was a 360-crypt \nmausoleum along with accommodations for 48 cremains.\n  Mr. Singleton takes a walk through his 16-acre cemetery every day, \nand reflects on the lives of the many who have passed away and are \nburied there. It is inspiring to see someone who is so involved and \ncompassionate in an industry that is an uncomfortable topic for some, \nbut still a vital service. Although the passing of loved ones is \nsomething we may prefer not to think about, it will most assuredly \nbefall upon each of us at some point in time, which is why knowing \nthere are those like Gervis to help is a comforting thought. There is a \nneed for individuals like Gervis Singleton, who are so deeply convicted \nto lend a helping hand in whatever way they can.\n  I would like to ask my Senate colleagues to join me in commemorating \nMr. Gervis Singleton. He is a fine Kentuckian who has made many a \nfamily feel comforted at a difficult time thanks to his deep respect \nfor those who have passed away.\n  Recently, an article appeared in the Laurel County-area publication, \nthe Sentinel Echo, that illustrated the contributions of Mr. Singleton \nto the people of Laurel County, KY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that said article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sentinel Echo, Sept. 5, 2011]\n\n               Singleton Takes Pride in Helping Families\n\n                          (By Magen McCrarey)\n\n       Cemeteries are citadels for those who mourn the death of a \n     lost loved one, and treating them with the ultimate respect \n     is Gervis Singleton's calling.\n       Singleton is the owner of Cumberland Memorial Gardens and \n     Mausoleum, and is partner in Singleton Embalming Service with \n     his son, Craig Singleton. He was the second born of seven \n     children. His father passed away when he was only 11 years \n     old.\n       ``I don't know if it has something to do with my father \n     passing away,'' Singleton\n\n[[Page S1787]]\n\n     said about his start in the funeral business. ``(But) I grew \n     fascinated.''\n       To embalm a body, Singleton said emotions should never play \n     a part. In order to do his job, he must turn off parts of his \n     limbic system, the primarily emotional core of his brain. \n     After 50 years of being in the funeral and embalming \n     business, he still struggles with the emotions of his job.\n       ``There are certain things you don't let in your mind. You \n     close them out,'' he said. Although, emotions play a large \n     part in one of the reasons he still finds zeal within his \n     career, comfort.\n       ``I take great pride in being able to do something that \n     makes it easier for families during those times. It's not \n     that you're going to grieve with them, although you may, to \n     some extent,'' he said. ``You are trying to help them through \n     their grief.''\n       Singleton's embalming business handles roughly 1,500 bodies \n     a year. A single body takes about three hours to embalm. In a \n     way, it's an art, he said. His team of five provides services \n     for funeral homes in northeastern Tennessee and southeastern \n     Kentucky.\n       Families may furnish Singleton with a photograph to \n     preserve the body to its original state, and they may not. \n     It's up to the embalmer to transform the unknown deceased \n     into who they were remembered as. Singleton found that some \n     facial features after death need to be improved on, and he \n     brings them back to life, visually.\n       But appearance isn't everything, especially when it comes \n     to funeral attire, he said. It's not customary anymore to \n     wear all black. Another uncustomary practice that's become \n     popular in the past 30 years is cremation, he said. ``It's a \n     growing thing, becoming more popular, and cheaper,'' he \n     added.\n       Singleton said mourning the deceased is important to gain \n     closure, not only for children but adults, too. So in 1995, \n     he built a mausoleum to accommodate 360 bodies and 48 \n     cremation ashes.\n       A Laurel County Medal of Honor recipient is buried at \n     Cumberland Memorial Gardens. There is a flag flown above the \n     grave of Carl H. Dodd, a veteran of World War II and the \n     Korean War.\n       ``It's the only site I'll allow a flag to fly,'' Singleton \n     said.\n       Every day, Singleton walks through the 16-acre cemetery \n     behind his office on south U.S. 25. About 80 individuals a \n     year are buried on the grounds that offer three reflection \n     stations and feature Little Laurel River and a wooded area \n     from behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/19/senate-section/article/S1787-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1787-S1789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BIG GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, Mark Steyn is one of the most gifted \nwriters of our time. His trenchant analysis appears regularly in \nNational Review. Steyn writes with biting humor and personal experience \nwith government censorship and has chronicled the concomitant growth in \ngovernment power and loss of freedom in Europe and North America.\n  In the March 5, 2012, issue of National Review he warns that America, \nwhich he calls the ``last religious Nation in the Western world,'' is \nin danger of going the way of European nations in replacing faith and \nfamily with the all powerful national government as the source of \neverything we need. He calls his piece ``The Church of Big \nGovernment.'' It reminds me of Barry Goldwater's warning that ``a \ngovernment big enough to give you everything you want is a government \nthat is big enough to take away everything you have.''\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the National Review, Mar. 5, 2012]\n\n                      The Church of Big Government\n\n\n           Leviathan is nibbling your religious freedom away\n\n                            (By Mark Steyn)\n\n       Discussing the constitutionality of Obamacare's \n     ``preventive health'' measures on MSNBC, Melinda Henneberger \n     of the Washington Post told Chris Matthews that she reasons \n     thus with her liberal friends: ``Maybe the Founders were \n     wrong to guarantee free exercise of religion in the First \n     Amendment, but they did.''\n       Maybe. A lot of other constitutional types in the Western \n     world have grown increasingly comfortable with circumscribing \n     religious liberty. In 2002, the Swedish constitution was \n     amended to criminalize criticism of homosexuality. \n     ``Disrespect'' of the differently orientated became \n     punishable by up to two years in jail, and ``especially \n     offensive'' disrespect by up to four years. Shortly \n     thereafter, Pastor Ake Green preached a sermon referencing \n     the more robust verses of scripture, and was convicted of \n     ``hate crimes'' for doing so.\n       Conversely, the 1937 Irish Constitution recognized ``the \n     special position of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman \n     Church as the guardian of the Faith.'' But times change. In \n     2003, the Vatican issued a ruminative document on homosexual \n     unions. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties warned Catholic \n     bishops that merely distributing the statement could lead to \n     prosecution under the 1989 Incitement to Hatred Act, and six \n     months in the slammer.\n       In Canada, Hugh Owens took out an advertisement in the \n     Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, and he and the paper wound up getting \n     fined $9,000 for ``exposing homosexuals to hatred or \n     ridicule.'' Here is the entire text of the offending \n     advertisement:\n       Romans 1:26\n       Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13\n       I Corinthians 6:9\n       That's it. Mr. Owens cited chapter and verse--and nothing \n     but. Yet it was enough for the Saskatchewan ``Human Rights'' \n     Tribunal. The newspaper accepted the fine; Mr. Owens \n     appealed. That was in 1997. In 2002, the Court of Queen's \n     Bench upheld the conviction. Mr. Owens appealed again. In \n     2006, the Court of Appeal reversed the decision. This time \n     the ``Human Rights'' Commission appealed. The supreme court \n     of Canada heard the case last autumn, and will issue its \n     judgment sometime this year--or a decade and a half after Mr. \n     Owens's original conviction. It doesn't really matter which \n     way their Lordships rule. If you were to attempt to place the \n     same advertisement with the Star-Phoenix or any other \n     Canadian paper today, they would all politely decline. So, in \n     practical terms, the ``Human Rights'' Tribunal has achieved \n     its goal: It has successfully shriveled the public space for \n     religious expression--and, ultimately, for ``exercise of \n     religion.''\n       In the modern era, America has been different. It is the \n     last religious nation in the Western world, the last in which \n     a majority of the population are (kinda) practicing believers \n     and (sorta) regular attenders of church. The ``free \n     exercise''--or free market--enabled religion to thrive. \n     Elsewhere, the established church, whether de jure (the \n     Church of England, the Church of Denmark) or de facto (as in \n     Catholic Italy and Spain), did for religion what the state \n     monopoly did for the British car industry. As the Episcopal \n     and Congregational churches degenerated into a bunch of mushy \n     doubt-ridden wimps, Americans went elsewhere. As the Lutheran \n     Church of Sweden underwent similar institutional decay, \n     Swedes gave up on God entirely.\n       Nevertheless, this distinction shouldn't obscure an \n     important truth--that, in America as in Europe, the \n     mainstream churches were cheerleaders for the rise of their \n     usurper: the Church of Big Government. Instead of the Old \n     World's state church or the New World's separation of church \n     and state, most of the West now believes in the state as \n     church--an all-powerful deity who provides day-care for your \n     babies and takes your aged parents off your hands. America's \n     Catholic hierarchy, in particular, colluded in the \n     redefinition of the tiresome individual obligation to \n     Christian charity as the painless universal guarantee of \n     state welfare. Barack Obama himself provided the neatest \n     distillation of this convenient transformation when he \n     declared, in a TV infomercial a few days before his election, \n     that his ``fundamental belief'' was that ``I am my brother's \n     keeper.''\n       Back in Kenya, his brother lived in a shack on $12 a year. \n     If Barack is his brother's keeper, why can't he shove a \n     sawbuck and a couple singles in an envelope and double the \n     guy's income? Ah, well: When the president claims that ``I am \n     my brother's keeper,'' what he means is that the government \n     should be his brother's keeper. And, for the most part, the \n     Catholic Church agreed. They were gung ho for Obamacare. It \n     never seemed to occur to them that, if you agitate for state \n     health care, the state gets to define what health care is.\n       According to that spurious bon mot of Chesterton's, when \n     men cease to believe in God, they do not believe in nothing; \n     they believe in anything. But, in practice, the anything most \n     of the West now believes in is government. As Tocqueville saw \n     it, what prevents the ``state popular'' from declining into a \n     ``state despotic'' is the strength of the intermediary \n     institutions between the sovereign and the individual. But in \n     the course of the 20th century, the intermediary \n     institutions, the independent pillars of a free society, were \n     gradually chopped away--from church to civic associations to \n     family. Very little now stands between the individual and the \n     sovereign, which is why the latter assumes the right to \n     insert himself into every aspect of daily life, including the \n     provisions a Catholic college president makes for his \n     secretary's IUD.\n       Seven years ago, George Weigel published a book called \n     ``The Cube and the Cathedral,'' whose title contrasts two \n     Parisian landmarks--the Cathedral of Notre Dame and the giant \n     modernist cube of La Grande Arche de la Defense, commissioned \n     by President Mitterrand to mark the bicentenary of the French \n     Revolution. As La Grande Arche boasts, the entire cathedral, \n     including its spires and tower, would fit easily inside the \n     cold geometry of Mitterrand's cube. In Europe, the cube--the \n     state--has swallowed the cathedral--the church. I've had \n     conversations with a handful of senior EU officials in recent \n     years in which all five casually deployed the phrase ``post-\n     Christian Europe'' or ``post-Christian future,'' and meant \n     both approvingly. These men hold that religious faith is \n     incompatible with progressive society. Or as Alastair \n     Campbell, Tony Blair's control-freak spin doctor, once put \n     it, cutting short the prime minister before he could answer \n     an interviewer's question about his religious faith: ``We \n     don't do God.''\n\n[[Page S1788]]\n\n       For the moment, American politicians still do God, and \n     indeed not being seen to do him remains something of a \n     disadvantage on the national stage. But in private many \n     Democrats agree with those ``post-Christian'' Europeans, and \n     in public they legislate that way. Words matter, as then-\n     senator Barack Obama informed us in 2008. And, as president, \n     his choice of words has been revealing: He prefers, one \n     notes, the formulation ``freedom of worship'' to ``freedom of \n     religion.'' Example: ``We're a nation that guarantees the \n     freedom to worship as one chooses.'' (The president after the \n     Fort Hood murders in 2009.) Er, no, ``we're a nation that \n     guarantees'' rather more than that. But Obama's rhetorical \n     sleight prefigured Commissar Sebelius's edict, under which \n     ``religious liberty''--i.e., the freedom to decline to \n     facilitate condom dispensing, sterilization, and \n     pharmacological abortion--is confined to those institutions \n     engaged in religious instruction for card-carrying believers.\n       This is a very Euro-secularist view of religion: It's \n     tolerated as a private members' club for consenting adults. \n     But don't confuse ``freedom to worship'' for an hour or so on \n     Sunday morning with any kind of license to carry on the rest \n     of the week. You can be a practicing Godomite just so long as \n     you don't (per Mrs. Patrick Campbell) do it in the street and \n     frighten the horses. The American bishops are not the most \n     impressive body of men even if one discounts the explicitly \n     Obamaphile rubes among them, and they have unwittingly \n     endorsed this attenuated view of religious ``liberty.''\n       The Catholic Church is the oldest continuously operating \n     entity in the Western world. The earliest recorded use of the \n     brand first appears in Saint Ignatius's letter to the \n     Smyrnaeans of circa a.d. 110--that's 1,902 years ago: \n     ``Wherever Jesus Christ is,'' wrote Ignatius, ``there is the \n     Catholic Church,'' a usage that suggests his readers were \n     already familiar with the term. Obama's ``freedom to \n     worship'' inverts Ignatius: Wherever there is a Catholic \n     church, there Jesus Christ is--in a quaint-looking building \n     with a bit of choral music, a psalm or two, and a light \n     homily on the need for ``social justice'' and action on \n     ``climate change.'' The bishops plead, No, no, don't forget \n     our colleges and hospitals, too. In a garden of sexual Eden, \n     the last guys not chowing down on once-forbidden fruits are \n     the ones begging for the fig leaf. But neither is a \n     definition of ``religion'' that Ignatius would have \n     recognized. ``Katholikos'' means ``universal'': The Church \n     cannot agree to the confines Obama wishes to impose and still \n     be, in any sense, catholic.\n       If you think a Catholic owner of a sawmill or software \n     business should be as free of state coercion as a Catholic \n     college, the term ``freedom of conscience'' is more relevant \n     than ``freedom of religion.'' For one thing, it makes it less \n     easy for a secular media to present the issue as one of a \n     recalcitrant institution out of step with popular \n     progressivism. NPR dispatched its reporter Allison Keyes to a \n     ``typical'' Catholic church in Washington, D.C., where she \n     found congregants disinclined to follow their bishops. To a \n     man (or, more often, woman), they disliked ``the way the \n     Church injects itself into political debates.'' But, if \n     contraceptives and abortion and conception and birth and \n     chastity and fidelity and sexual morality are now \n     ``politics,'' then what's left for religion? Back in the late \n     first century, Ignatius injected himself into enough \n     ``political debates'' that he wound up getting eaten by lions \n     at the Coliseum. But no doubt tut-tutting NPR listeners would \n     have deplored the way the Church had injected itself into \n     live theater.\n       Ignatius's successor bishops have opted for an ignobler \n     end, agreeing to be nibbled to death by Leviathan. Even in \n     their objections to the Obama administration, the bishops \n     endorse the state's view of the church--as something separate \n     and segregated from society, albeit ever more nominally. At \n     the airport recently, I fell into conversation with a lady \n     whose employer, a Catholic college, had paid for her to get \n     her tubes tied. Why not accept that this is just one of those \n     areas where one has to render under Caesar? Especially when \n     Caesar sees ``health care'' as a state-funded toga party.\n       But once government starts (in Commissar Sebelius's phrase) \n     ``striking a balance,'' it never stops. What's next? How \n     about a religious test for public office? In the old days, \n     England's Test Acts required holders of office to forswear \n     Catholic teaching on matters such as transubstantiation and \n     the invocation of saints. Today in the European Union holders \n     of office are required to forswear Catholic teaching on more \n     pressing matters such as abortion and homosexuality. Rocco \n     Buttiglione's views on these subjects would have been utterly \n     unremarkable for an Italian Catholic of half a century ago. \n     By 2004, they were enough to render him ineligible to serve \n     as a European commissioner. To the college of Eurocardinals, \n     a man such as Signor Buttiglione can have no place in public \n     life. The Catholic hierarchy's fawning indulgence of the \n     Beltway's abortion zealots and serial annullers is not \n     reciprocated: The Church of Government punishes apostasy ever \n     more zealously.\n       The state no longer criminalizes a belief in \n     transubstantiation, mainly because most people have no idea \n     what that is. But they know what sex is, and, if the price of \n     Pierre Trudeau's assertion that ``the state has no place in \n     the bedrooms of the nation'' is that the state has to take an \n     ever larger place in the churches and colleges and hospitals \n     and insurance agencies and small businesses of the nation, \n     they're cool with that. The developed world's massive \n     expansion of sexual liberty has provided a useful cover for \n     the shriveling of almost every other kind. Free speech, \n     property rights, economic liberty, and the right to self-\n     defense are under continuous assault by Big Government. In \n     New York and California and many other places, sexual license \n     is about the only thing you don't need a license for.\n       Even if you profoundly disagree with Pope Paul VI's \n     predictions that artificial birth control would lead to \n     ``conjugal infidelity and the general lowering of morality,'' \n     the objectification of women, and governments' ``imposing \n     upon their peoples'' state-approved methods of contraception, \n     or even if you think he was pretty much on the money but that \n     the collective damage they have done does not outweigh the \n     individual freedom they have brought to many, it ought to \n     bother you that in the cause of delegitimizing two millennia \n     of moral teaching the state is willing to intrude on core \n     rights--rights to property, rights of association, even \n     rights to private conversation. In 2009, David Booker was \n     suspended from his job at a hostel for the homeless run by \n     the Church of England's Society of St James after a late-\n     night chit-chat with a colleague, Fiona Vardy, in which he \n     chanced to mention that he did not believe that vicars should \n     be allowed to wed their gay partners. Miss Vardy raised no \n     objection at the time, but the following day mentioned the \n     private conversation to her superiors. They recognized the \n     gravity of the situation and acted immediately, suspending \n     Mr. Booker from his job and announcing that ``action has been \n     taken to safeguard both residents and staff.'' If you let \n     private citizens run around engaging in free exercise of \n     religion in private conversation, there's no telling where it \n     might end.\n       And so the peoples of the West are enlightened enough to \n     have cast off the stultifying oppressiveness of religion for \n     a world in which the state regulates every aspect of life. In \n     1944, at a terrible moment of the most terrible century, \n     Henri de Lubac wrote a reflection on Europe's civilizational \n     crisis, Le drame de l'humanisme athee. By ``atheistic \n     humanism,'' he meant the organized rejection of God--not the \n     freelance atheism of individual skeptics but atheism as an \n     ideology and political project in its own right. As M. de \n     Lubac wrote, ``It is not true, as is sometimes said, that man \n     cannot organize the world without God. What is true is that, \n     without God, he can only organize it against man.'' \n     ``Atheistic humanism'' became inhumanism in the hands of the \n     Nazis and Communists and, in its less malign form in today's \n     European Union, a kind of dehumanism in which a present-tense \n     culture amuses itself to extinction. ``Post-Christian \n     Europe'' is a bubble of 50-year-old retirees, 30-year-old \n     students, empty maternity wards . . . and a surging successor \n     population already restive to move beyond its Muslim \n     ghettoes.\n       Already, Islam commands more respect in the public square. \n     In Britain, police sniffer dogs wear booties to search the \n     homes of suspected Muslim terrorists. Government health care? \n     The Scottish NHS enjoined its employees not to be seen eating \n     in their offices during Ramadan. In the United Kingdom's \n     disease-ridden hospitals, staff were told to wear short \n     sleeves in the interests of better hygiene. Muslim nurses \n     said this was disrespectful and were granted leave to retain \n     their long sleeves as long as they rolled them up and \n     scrubbed carefully. But mandatory scrubbing is also \n     disrespectful on the grounds that it requires women to bare \n     their arms. So the bureaucracy mulled it over and issued them \n     with disposable over-sleeves. A deference to conscience \n     survives, at least for certain approved identity groups.\n       The irrationalism of the hyper-rational state ought by now \n     to be evident in everything from the euro-zone crisis to the \n     latest CBO projections: The paradox of the Church of Big \n     Government is that it weans people away from both the \n     conventional family impulse and the traditional transcendent \n     purpose necessary to sustain it. So what is the future of the \n     American Catholic Church if it accepts the straitjacket of \n     Obama's ``freedom to worship''? North of the border, motoring \n     around the once-Catholic bastion of Quebec, you'll pass every \n     couple of miles one of the province's many, many churches, \n     and invariably out front you'll see a prominent billboard \n     bearing the slogan ``Notre patrimoine religieux--c'est \n     sacre!'' ``Our religious heritage--it's sacred!'' Which \n     translated from the statist code-speak means: ``Our religious \n     heritage--it's over!'' But it's left every Quebec community \n     with a lot of big, prominently positioned buildings, and not \n     all of them can be, as Montreal's Saint-Jean de la Croix and \n     Couvent de Marie Reparatrice were, converted into luxury \n     three-quarter-million-dollar condos. So to prevent them from \n     decaying into downtown eyesores, there's a government-funded \n     program to preserve them as spiffy-looking husks.\n       The Obama administration's ``freedom to worship'' leads to \n     the same soulless destination: a church whose moral teachings \n     must be first subordinated to the caprices of the hyper-\n     regulatory Leviathan, and then, as on the Continent, rendered \n     incompatible with public office, and finally, as in that \n     Southampton homeless shelter, hounded even from private \n     utterance. This is the world the ``social justice'' bishops \n     have made. What's left are hymns and stained glass, and then, \n     in the emptiness, the mere echo:\n\n[[Page S1789]]\n\n       The Sea of Faith\n       Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore\n       Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furl'd.\n       But now I only hear\n       Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar . . .\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/19/senate-section/article/S1789-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                REMEMBERING CHAIRMAN RICHARD MILANOVICH\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the life, work, and legacy of Richard Milanovich, longtime \nchairman of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians. Chairman \nMilanovich, my good friend and California neighbor, died in Rancho \nMirage on Sunday at age 69 after a courageous fight with cancer.\n  During his quarter century as tribal chairman, Richard Milanovich \nworked tirelessly to bring prosperity and security to the Agua \nCaliente. All the while, he worked closely with surrounding communities \nand local governments to ensure that Agua Caliente's success would \nbenefit not just the tribe but also the entire Coachella Valley.\n  Richard grew up in the Palm Springs neighborhood known as Section 14, \nwhere members of the Agua Caliente dreamed of a better future. \nRichard's mother, LaVerne Saubel, was a member of the Nation's first-\never all-female tribal council. In 1957 the council successfully \nlobbied Congress to enact legislation allowing the Agua Caliente Band \nto govern itself, though it would take another 20 years for them to \ngain full control over tribal lands.\n  At age 17, Richard left home to join the Army. After serving in \nEurope, he returned to California and worked in Los Angeles as a door-\nto-door salesman, honing the persuasive powers that served him so well \nin later life. Returning to Palm Springs, he joined the tribal council \nin 1978 and began his lifetime of service to the tribe.\n  The Agua Caliente owned parcels of land all around Palm Springs, \nCathedral City, and Rancho Mirage. As a tribal councilor and then as \nchairman, Richard turned this checkerboard pattern of land ownership \ninto an asset. He forged mutually beneficial land-use agreements with \nall three local governments and then worked together to develop \ncommerce and improve infrastructure. After taking over a rundown spa in \ndowntown Palm Springs and turning it into a thriving resort, the Agua \nCaliente developed casinos and other businesses that brought prosperity \nto the tribe and hundreds of jobs to the community.\n  Chairman Milanovich became a State and national leader in business \nand public policy, but he never forgot his roots or the long-term \ninterests of his people. He worked to ensure that the Agua Caliente \npreserved its proud heritage while succeeding in the modern world and \ndiversified its interests to maintain growth and prosperity.\n  Like many other Californians, I am very sad to lose Richard \nMilanovich's voice for his tribe and for the communities he loved so \nmuch. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family, especially his wife \nMelissa and their six children, and his many friends in the Coachella \nValley and across America. He will be deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/19/senate-section/article/S1789-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING JAMES KIMO CAMPBELL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, today I honor the life of James \nKimo Campbell, a longtime resident and pillar of the Marin County \ncommunity, who passed away on February 16, 2012, due to complications \nfrom Lou Gehrig's disease. Over the years, Kimo worked with numerous \nnonprofit organizations and was a tireless advocate for a healthy \nenvironment and just world.\n  Born in Los Angeles in 1947, Kimo was raised in Hawaii, where he \nattended the Punahou School before going on to begin a career in \njournalism at the College of Marin and study history at the University \nof California at Berkeley. As a student, he was recognized by the Marin \nIndependent Journal for his outstanding journalism and later worked for \nthe Journal and several other area papers as a freelance journalist.\n  As with many of his generation, Kimo became involved in the protest \nmovement of the 1960s and was drawn to political activism that laid the \nfoundation for his later involvement in philanthropy and community \nservice. At the age of 27, Kimo Campbell was elected to the board of \ntrustees for the College of Marin and served in that capacity for the \nnext 16 years, before being named to the College of Marin Foundation's \nboard of directors, where he remained committed to supporting the \nschool's mission.\n  The time Kimo spent in Hawaii during his youth left a lasting \nimpression on him. Through his publishing company, Pueo Press, Kimo \nshared his affinity for his home State by publishing books dedicated to \nthe topic. Through the Pohaku Fund, he supported the promotion of \nenvironmental protection, social justice, and respect for the culture \nof his beloved Hawaii.\n  Kimo will be deeply missed by all of us lucky enough to have known \nhim. I send my heartfelt condolences to his wife, Kerry Tepperman \nCampbell, as well as his children, Mahealani and Kawika.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/19/senate-section/article/S1789-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1789]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING HAROLD ``HAL'' C.

In 1982, Gov. \nJerry Brown appointed him to replace me on the Marin County Board of \nSupervisors, following my election to Congress.\n  For the next 29 years, Supervisor Brown served the people of Marin \nwith extraordinary dedication and focus.

Supervisor Brown established the Marin Valentine's Ball in \n1997 as an annual auction and fundraiser to support children, families, \nand older adults in need throughout the county. Even in the face of his \nillness, Hal hosted the 16th annual ball this past February and refused \nto stop serving the people and community he had represented for \ndecades.\n  I send my deepest condolences to his family, including Gloria Brown; \nhis children, Michael and Chris; and his grandchildren.

He then served over 18 years with the U.S. Air Force with \ntours in Alaska and Turkey as a law enforcement supervisor and \npersonnel technician. He retired from Active Duty in September 1982.\n  After his military service, George worked with Black Hills Workshop \nand South Dakota Department of Social Services. He also served as a \nvocational rehabilitation and addiction counselor with the Fort Meade \nVA hospital and for the past 7 years has served in various capacities \nat the Rapid City Vet Center, including readjustment counselor and team \nleader.\n\n[[Page S1790]]\n\n  I want to commend George Whitaker for his steadfast and tireless \nservice to our Nation, first for his over 20 years of military service \nin the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force, and then for his service to \nveterans with the Department of Veterans Affairs and Vet Center. \nCountless veterans have benefitted from George's dedication and \ncommitment. Through his own military experiences and combined with his \ncounseling experiences, George has worked directly with veterans and \nservicemembers through parts of six decades. This timespan has produced \nmany wars, conflicts, and military operations and with it, changes in \nhealth services, problems, and issues that affect our military soldiers \nand veterans. George has been able to share his own experiences and \nwork with returning servicemembers as they deal with the physical and \nmental health impacts of their military experiences, as well as the \nimpacts on their families and communities.\n  George will now have more time in his retirement to enjoy hunting, \nfishing, leather crafts, and other pursuits.

Madam President, I would like to take time to \nrecognize Robin A. Douthitt, who is stepping down as Dean of the School \nof Human Ecology at the University of Wisconsin--Madison. I would also \nlike to wish her a happy birthday. As a proud alumnus of UW--Madison, \nit is an honor to congratulate Dean Douthitt on her outstanding and \nexemplary service at UW over the years.\n  For the past 12 years, Dean Douthitt has given her unwavering \ncommitment to students, faculty, staff, campus, the community, and the \nState. She began as a professor in the Consumer Science Department, was \nappointed Interim Dean of the School of Human Ecology in 1999, and was \nnamed Dean in 2001. She will be leaving a legacy of courage and \nvisionary leadership. Dean Douthitt has been called the ``People's \nDean,'' because she is always approachable and has touched the lives of \nmany of her colleagues and friends.\n  Dean Douthitt made countless contributions to the University of \nWisconsin during her service. She founded the UW Women's Faculty \nMentoring Program that has led to the university's retention of female \nfaculty and has become a model for other universities. She helped \nestablish the Nancy Denney House, a cooperative undergraduate residence \nfor single parents and their children. In recognition of her teaching \nand publishing extensive research on women's unpaid work and its social \nvalue, Dean Douthitt has been named a Vaughan Bascom Professor of Women \nand Philanthropy and a Vilas Associate in the Social Sciences.\n  Her contributions at UW do not stop there. Dean Douthitt served on \nthe UW Athletic Board, chairing its Academic Affairs Committee and \nrepresenting UW faculty to the Big Ten. She has been honored on the \nSchool of Human Ecology's Roster of 100 Women--Wall of Honor, in \nrecognition of her contributions to family, community, and her \nembodiment of the School's mission to improve the quality of human \nlife. In addition, Dean Douthitt provided vision in leading a \nsuccessful $52 million effort to renovate the School of Human Ecology's \nhistoric 1914 building and build a new addition to ensure the School's \ncontinued presence at the forefront of education, research, creative \nscholarship, and outreach in the 21st century.\n  On behalf of my constituents from the great State of Wisconsin, we \nsay a heartfelt thank you and happy birthday to Dean Robin A.

Madam President, I wish to recognize the city of \nLafayette. Southern Living magazine has named Lafayette ``South's \nTastiest Town.'' Lafayette was chosen as the winning city by nearly \n35,000 votes in the first annual competition, with more than 500,000 \nonline votes cast for the 10 finalist cities. Lafayette will be \nformally recognized in Southern Living's April issue, along with third-\nplace finisher New Orleans. In fact, both Louisiana cities combined to \nreceive nearly half the total votes, and Lafayette received almost \n200,000 votes.\n  Southern Living's top 10 towns were chosen based on a number of \ncriteria: food as a cultural identity, growth of a culinary-minded \ncommunity, diverse cuisine at a variety of price points, local \nsustainable food practices, chefs on the rise, and an abundance of \nsignificant food events. Clearly, Lafayette excels in all these \ncategories, and I am proud of this achievement.\n  Lafayette and its people are at the heart of all the great Cajun and \nCreole qualities that have made Louisiana's cuisine unparalleled. \nThroughout our State's great history, our unique culinary identity and \nlove of food have been at the center of many of family and friend \ngatherings. Louisianians take tremendous pride in the dishes that \nrepresent our culture, the traditions they symbolize about who we are, \nand the devotion to preserving our heritage.\n  It is my pleasure to congratulate the city of Lafayette on this \nhonor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/19/senate-section/article/S1790-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/19/senate-section/article/S1790-4", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/19/senate-section/article/S1790-5", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEASURES DISCHARGED\n\n  The following bill was discharged from the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs, and referred as indicated:\n\n       S. 2076.

STATES RECORD RELATING TO THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE, AND FOR OTHER \n                                PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Kirk, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nBennet, Mr. Whitehouse, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Reed of \nRhode Island) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 399\n\n       Resolved,\n\n\n                              short title\n\n       Sec. 1. This resolution may be cited as the ``Affirmation \n     of the United States Record on the Armenian Genocide \n     Resolution''.\n\n\n                                findings\n\n       Sec. 2. The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Armenian Genocide was conceived and carried out by \n     the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923, resulting in the \n     deportation of nearly 2,000,000 Armenians, of whom 1,500,000 \n     men, women, and children were killed, 500,000 survivors were \n     expelled from their homes, and the elimination of the over \n     2,500-year presence of Armenians in their historic homeland.\n       (2) On May 24, 1915, the Allied Powers of England, France, \n     and Russia, jointly issued a statement explicitly charging \n     for the first time ever another government of committing ``a \n     crime against humanity''.\n       (3) This joint statement stated that ``the Allied \n     Governments announce publicly to the Sublime Porte that they \n     will hold personally responsible for these crimes all members \n     of the Ottoman Government, as well as those of their agents \n     who are implicated in such massacres''.\n       (4) The post-World War I Turkish Government indicted the \n     top leaders involved in the ``organization and execution'' of \n     the Armenian Genocide and in the ``massacre and destruction \n     of the Armenians''.\n       (5) In a series of courts-martial, officials of the Young \n     Turk Regime were tried and convicted, as charged, for \n     organizing and executing massacres against the Armenian \n     people.\n       (6) The chief organizers of the Armenian Genocide, Minister \n     of War Enver, Minister of the Interior Talaat, and Minister \n     of the Navy Jemal were all condemned to death for their \n     crimes, but, the verdicts of the courts were not enforced.\n       (7) The Armenian Genocide and these domestic judicial \n     failures are documented with overwhelming evidence in the \n     national archives of Austria, France, Germany, Great Britain, \n     Russia, the United States, the Vatican and many other \n     countries, and this vast body of evidence attests to the same \n     facts, the same events, and the same consequences.\n       (8) The United States National Archives and Record \n     Administration holds extensive and thorough documentation on \n     the Armenian Genocide, especially in its holdings under \n     Record Group 59 of the United States Department of State, \n     files 867.00 and 867.40, which are open and widely available \n     to the public and interested institutions.\n       (9) The Honorable Henry Morgenthau, United States \n     Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1913 to 1916, organized \n     and led protests by officials of many countries, among them \n     the allies of the Ottoman Empire, against the Armenian \n     Genocide.\n       (10) Ambassador Morgenthau explicitly described to the \n     Department of State the policy of the Government of the \n     Ottoman Empire as ``a campaign of race extermination,'' and \n     was instructed on July 16, 1915, by Secretary of State Robert \n     Lansing that the ``Department approves your procedure . . . \n     to stop Armenian persecution''.\n       (11) Senate Concurrent Resolution 12, 64th Congress, agreed \n     to February 9, 1916, resolved that ``the President of the \n     United States be respectfully asked to designate a day on \n     which the citizens of this country may give expression to \n     their sympathy by contributing funds now being raised for the \n     relief of the Armenians,'' who at the time were enduring \n     ``starvation, disease, and untold suffering''.\n       (12) President Woodrow Wilson concurred and also encouraged \n     the formation of the organization known as Near East Relief, \n     chartered by the Act of August 6, 1919, 66th Congress (41 \n     Stat. 273, chapter 32), which contributed some $116,000,000 \n     from 1915 to 1930 to aid Armenian Genocide survivors, \n     including 132,000 orphans who became foster children of the \n     American people.\n       (13) Senate Resolution 359, 66th Congress, agreed to May \n     11, 1920, stated in part that ``the testimony adduced at the \n     hearings conducted by the sub-committee of the Senate \n     Committee on Foreign Relations have clearly established the \n     truth of the reported massacres and other atrocities from \n     which the Armenian people have suffered''.\n       (14) The resolution followed the April 13, 1920, report to \n     the Senate of the American Military Mission to Armenia led by \n     General James Harbord, that stated ``[m]utilation, violation, \n     torture, and death have left their haunting memories in a \n     hundred beautiful Armenian valleys, and the traveler in that \n     region is seldom free from the evidence of this most colossal \n     crime of all the ages''.\n       (15) As displayed in the United States Holocaust Memorial \n     Museum, Adolf Hitler, on ordering his military commanders to \n     attack Poland without provocation in 1939, dismissed \n     objections by saying ``[w]ho, after all, speaks today of the \n     annihilation of the Armenians?'' and thus set the stage for \n     the Holocaust.\n       (16) Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term ``genocide'' in \n     1944, and who was the earliest proponent of the United \n     Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \n     Crime of Genocide, invoked the Armenian case as a definitive \n     example of genocide in the 20th century.\n       (17) The first resolution on genocide adopted by the United \n     Nations at Mr. Lemkin's urging, the December 11, 1946, United \n     Nations General Assembly Resolution 96(1), and the United \n     Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \n     Crime of Genocide recognized the Armenian Genocide as the \n     type of crime the United Nations intended to prevent and \n     punish by codifying existing standards.\n       (18) In 1948, the United Nations War Crimes Commission \n     invoked the Armenian Genocide, ``precisely . . . one of the \n     types of acts which the modern term `crimes against humanity' \n     is intended to cover,'' as a precedent for the Nuremberg \n     tribunals.\n       (19) The Commission stated that ``[t]he provisions of \n     Article 230 of the Peace Treaty of Sevres were obviously \n     intended to cover, in conformity with the Allied note of 1915 \n     . . . , offenses which had been committed on Turkish \n     territory against persons of Turkish citizenship, though of \n     Armenian or Greek race. This article constitutes therefore a \n     precedent for Article 6c and 5c of the Nuremberg and Tokyo \n     Charters, and offers an example of one of the categories of \n     `crimes against humanity' as understood by these \n     enactments''.\n       (20) On May 28, 1951, in a written statement submitted to \n     the International Court of Justice concerning the Convention \n     on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, \n     the United States Government stated, ``The Genocide \n     Convention resulted from the inhuman and barbarous practices \n     which prevailed in certain countries prior to and during \n     World War II, when entire religious, racial and national \n     minority groups were threatened with and subjected to \n     deliberate extermination. The practice of genocide has \n     occurred throughout human history. The Roman persecution of \n     the Christians, the Turkish massacres of Armenians, the \n     extermination of millions of Jews and Poles by the Nazis are \n     outstanding examples of the crime of genocide. This was the \n     background when the General Assembly of the United Nations \n     considered the problem of genocide. Not once, but twice, that \n     body declared unanimously that the practice of genocide is \n     criminal under international law and that States ought to \n     take steps to prevent and punish genocide.''.\n       (21) House Joint Resolution 148, 94th Congress, adopted on \n     April 8, 1975, resolved, ``That April 24, 1975, is hereby \n     designated as `National Day of Remembrance of Man's \n     Inhumanity to Man', and the President of the United States is \n     authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon \n     the people of the United States to observe such day as a day \n     of remembrance for all the victims of genocide, especially \n     those of Armenian ancestry . . .''.\n       (22) President Ronald Reagan, in proclamation number 4838, \n     dated April 22, 1981 (95 Stat. 1813), stated that, in part \n     ``[l]ike the genocide of the Armenians before it, and the \n     genocide of the Cambodians, which followed it--and like too \n     many other persecutions of too many other people--the lessons \n     of the Holocaust must never be forgotten''.\n       (23) House Joint Resolution 247, 98th Congress, adopted on \n     September 10, 1984, resolved, ``That April 24, 1985, is \n     hereby designated as `National Day of Remembrance of Man's \n     Inhumanity to Man', and the President of the United States is \n     authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon \n     the people of the United States to observe such day as a day \n     of remembrance for all the victims of genocide, especially \n     the one and one-half million people of Armenian ancestry . . \n     .''.\n       (24) In August 1985, after extensive study and \n     deliberation, the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention \n     of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities voted 14 to 1 \n     to accept a report entitled ``Study of the Question of the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,'' which \n     stated that ``[t]he Nazi aberration has unfortunately not \n     been the only case of genocide in the 20th century. Among \n     other examples which can be cited as qualifying are . . . the \n     Ottoman massacre of Armenians in 1915 1916''.\n       (25) This report also explained that ``[a]t least \n     1,000,000, and possibly well over half of the Armenian \n     population, are reliably estimated to have been killed or \n     death marched by independent authorities and eye-witnesses. \n     This is corroborated by reports in United States, German and \n     British archives and of contemporary diplomats in the Ottoman \n     Empire, including those of its ally Germany''.\n       (26) The United States Holocaust Memorial Council, an \n     independent Federal agency,\n\n[[Page S1793]]\n\n     unanimously resolved on April 30, 1981, that the United \n     States Holocaust Memorial Museum would include the Armenian \n     Genocide in the Museum and has since done so.\n       (27) Reviewing an aberrant 1982 expression (later \n     retracted) by the Department of State asserting that the \n     facts of the Armenian Genocide may be ambiguous, the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1993, \n     after a review of documents pertaining to the policy record \n     of the United States, noted that the assertion on ambiguity \n     in the United States record about the Armenian Genocide \n     ``contradicted longstanding United States policy and was \n     eventually retracted''.\n       (28) On June 5, 1996, the House of Representatives adopted \n     an amendment to House Bill 3540, 104th Congress (the Foreign \n     Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \n     Appropriations Act, 1997), to reduce aid to Turkey by \n     $3,000,000 (an estimate of its payment of lobbying fees in \n     the United States) until the Government of Turkey \n     acknowledged the Armenian Genocide and took steps to honor \n     the memory of its victims.\n       (29) President William Jefferson Clinton, on April 24, \n     1998, stated: ``This year, as in the past, we join with \n     Armenian-Americans throughout the nation in commemorating one \n     of the saddest chapters in the history of this century, the \n     deportations and massacres of a million and a half Armenians \n     in the Ottoman Empire in the years 1915 1923.''.\n       (30) President George W. Bush, on April 24, 2004, stated: \n     ``On this day, we pause in remembrance of one of the most \n     horrible tragedies of the 20th century, the annihilation of \n     as many as 1,500,000 Armenians through forced exile and \n     murder at the end of the Ottoman Empire.''.\n       (31) President Barack Obama, on April 24, 2010, explicitly \n     employed the expression Meds Yeghern, a term used by \n     Armenians to reference the Armenian Genocide. The statement \n     reads in part: ``On this solemn day of remembrance, we pause \n     to recall that 95 years ago one of the worst atrocities of \n     the 20th century began. In that dark moment of history, \n     1,500,000 Armenians were massacred or marched to their death \n     in the final days of the Ottoman Empire. . . .

Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Coburn) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by her to the bill H.R. 3606, to \nincrease American job creation and economic growth by improving access \nto the public capital markets for emerging growth companies; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n  TITLE __--FREEDOM FROM RESTRICTIVE EXCESSIVE EXECUTIVE DEMANDS AND \n                            ONEROUS MANDATES\n\n     SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Freedom from Restrictive \n     Excessive Executive Demands and Onerous Mandates Act of \n     2012''.\n\n     SEC. _02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A vibrant and growing small business sector is critical \n     to the recovery of the economy of the United States.\n       (2) Regulations designed for application to large-scale \n     entities have been applied uniformly to small businesses and \n     other small entities, sometimes inhibiting the ability of \n     small entities to create new jobs.\n       (3) Uniform Federal regulatory and reporting requirements \n     in many instances have imposed on small businesses and other \n     small entities unnecessary and disproportionately burdensome \n     demands, including legal, accounting, and consulting costs, \n     thereby threatening the viability of small entities and the \n     ability of small entities to compete and create new jobs in a \n     global marketplace.\n       (4) Since 1980, Federal agencies have been required to \n     recognize and take account of the differences in the scale \n     and resources of regulated entities, but in many instances \n     have failed to do so.\n       (5) In 2009, there were nearly 70,000 pages in the Federal \n     Register, and, according to research by the Office of \n     Advocacy of the Small Business Administration, the annual \n     cost of Federal regulations totals $1,750,000,000,000. Small \n     firms bear a disproportionate burden, paying approximately 36 \n     percent more per employee than larger firms in annual \n     regulatory compliance costs.\n       (6) All agencies in the Federal Government should fully \n     consider the costs, including indirect economic impacts and \n     the potential for job loss, of proposed rules, periodically \n     review existing regulations to determine their impact on \n     small entities, and repeal regulations that are unnecessarily \n     duplicative or have outlived their stated purpose.\n       (7) It is the intention of Congress to amend chapter 6 of \n     title 5, United States Code, to ensure that all impacts, \n     including foreseeable indirect effects, of proposed and final \n     rules are considered by agencies during the rulemaking \n     process and that the agencies assess a full range of \n     alternatives that will limit adverse economic consequences, \n     enhance economic benefits, and fully address potential job \n     loss.\n\n     SEC. _03. INCLUDING INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT IN SMALL ENTITY \n                   ANALYSES.\n\n       Section 601 of title 5, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) the term `economic impact' means, with respect to a \n     proposed or final rule--\n       ``(A) the economic effects on small entities directly \n     regulated by the rule; and\n       ``(B) the reasonably foreseeable economic effects of the \n     rule on small entities that--\n       ``(i) purchase products or services from, sell products or \n     services to, or otherwise conduct business with entities \n     directly regulated by the rule;\n       ``(ii) are directly regulated by other governmental \n     entities as a result of the rule; or\n       ``(iii) are not directly regulated by the agency as a \n     result of the rule but are otherwise subject to other agency \n     regulations as a result of the rule.''.\n\n     SEC. _04. JUDICIAL REVIEW TO ALLOW SMALL ENTITIES TO \n                   CHALLENGE PROPOSED REGULATIONS.\n\n       Section 611(a) of title 5, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``603,'' after ``601,'';\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by inserting ``603,'' after ``601,'';\n       (3) by striking paragraph (3) and inserting the following:\n       ``(3) A small entity may seek such review during the 1-year \n     period beginning on the date of final agency action, except \n     that--\n       ``(A) if a provision of law requires that an action \n     challenging a final agency action be commenced before the \n     expiration of 1 year, the lesser period shall apply to an \n     action for judicial review under this section; and\n       ``(B) in the case of noncompliance with section 603 or \n     605(b), a small entity may seek judicial review of agency \n     compliance with such section before the close of the public \n     comment period.''; and\n       (4) in paragraph (4)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``, and'' and \n     inserting a semicolon;\n       (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(C) issuing an injunction prohibiting an agency from \n     taking any agency action with respect to a rulemaking until \n     that agency is in compliance with the requirements of section \n     603 or 605.''.\n\n     SEC. _05.
