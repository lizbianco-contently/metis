Madam President, we have before us today an extremely \nimportant piece of legislation. It is called the America Invents Act of \n2011. The reason I emphasize 2011 is because it has been almost 60 \nyears since we had the last meaningful reforms of the Nation's patent \nsystem. We have tried on many occasions in recent years to get this \nbill on the Senate floor. The Judiciary Committee has reported out a \nnumber of bills over the years, and we have taken no action here on the \nSenate floor for a number of reasons. But it is now on the floor. There \nare a couple of issues to which our attention will be directed.\n  I have received calls from a number of Senators who have amendments \nthey want to offer that are in relation to this bill, only two of which \nI think are really meaningful, but I am sure there are others. I hope \nwe can move through this. One of the first amendments filed is one that \nhas nothing to do with patent reform, and we will dispose of that.\n  I think it is important to understand that this bill, if we do it \nright, will create millions of jobs. Some estimates suggest literally \nmillions of new jobs could be created through this reform. Not every \npatent creates a job or generates economic value. Some are worth\n\n[[Page S1024]]\n\nthousands of jobs. Jack Kilby's 1959 patent for the semiconductor is an \nexample of that, as well as Steve Wozniak's patent for a personal \ncomputer in 1979. So it is impossible to predict how many new jobs or \neven industries may lie buried within the Patent Office backlog, but \nthere are thousands of backlogged patent applications there that we \nhave to dispose of. I hope we can work toward getting this done.\n  We have issues the Republican leader and I have worked on to move \nforward, and the first issue at hand that deals with funding the \ngovernment is the CR. We are looking to try to figure out a way to do \nthe short-term CR. The President has said--and we will hear this from \nhim rather than from us--that we can't continue to have these short-\nterm CRs, so we are working to see if we can find a way of funding the \ngovernment in the foreseeable future. The way that is going to be done \nis on a bipartisan basis. We hope that will be the case. No one \nbenefits from a shutdown of the government, partial or otherwise.\n  I look forward to our work on this bill. Until we have something to \nwork on--the House is going to pass a short-term CR today. Until we \nactually have something to work on, we need to focus our attention on \nthis patent bill which is so very important. I have introduced a \nrevenue measure that we could work off of. We also have--and I just \nrule XIV'd--a second reading on a matter for the continuing resolution. \nIt is H.R. 1, the one that comes from the House. I think it is pretty \nclear that won't pass, but it shows we are trying to move forward. The \nHouse is going to act on something today. I have placed my revenue \nmeasure on the floor, indicating to the Republican leader my intentions \nof moving forward on that. So it is important that we work together to \nget this done. The current funding for the government runs out this \nFriday.\n  I look forward to everyone working hard on the patent bill. When we \nare in a position to move forward on funding the government past March \n4, we will move forward on that just as rapidly as we can, and we know \nwe have to do it this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/01/senate-section/article/S1024-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, later today the House of \nRepresentatives will take an important vote. At bottom, it is a vote on \nwhether lawmakers in Washington should continue to be exempt from the \nrules.\n  Over the past 2 years, millions of Americans have lost jobs and \nhomes. Tragically, many have stopped looking for work altogether. They \nthink the situation won't improve. When one considers how Democrats in \nWashington have responded to this historic jobs crisis, it is no \nwonder. For 2 years, Democrats in Washington have pushed one proposal \nafter another that has kept the economy from growing and stifled the \ncreation of good private sector jobs. They have tried to tax energy \nconsumption. They have picked winners and losers in industry. They have \nhandcuffed small business owners with a mountain of stifling \nregulations, including a health care bill that nonpartisan experts \npredict could lead to hundreds of thousands of more lost jobs. Earlier \nthis month, at a time when economists say rising gas prices could delay \nan economic recovery even longer, Democrats proposed--get this--a \nchange in the current tax laws that would amount to a new tax on \neveryone who drives a car or truck in America--a minivan tax.\n  While the American people have been begging lawmakers to remove the \nburdens of government so they can do the work of growing the economy \nand creating private sector jobs, Democrats in Washington have been \nfocused single-mindedly on growing government instead. In order to do \nit, they have basically exempted themselves from the rules. They have \nsaid that while the rest of the country has had to tighten its belt in \na down economy, Washington can continue on its spending binge in order \nto grow the government. They have said that while American families \nhave had to pay off their credit cards, Washington can continue to rack \nup debt. They have said that while most Americans struggle to make ends \nmeet, they don't have to. That is what this afternoon's vote in the \nHouse is all about.\n  This bill should not be controversial. It has only become \ncontroversial because Democratic leaders in Congress have resisted \nevery effort--every effort--to rein in their spending bills. This bill \nproposes to cut spending for the next 2 weeks by $4 billion, and they \nhave fought it tooth and nail. They refuse to admit that Washington has \na spending problem. But the verdict is in. For 2 years, Democrats in \nWashington have spent trillions more than we had in the Treasury. And \nif expanding the size and scope of government was the goal, it was a \nbig success. But if helping the economy and helping people find jobs \nwas the goal, it has been a disaster. What has $3 trillion more in debt \ngotten us? Three million more lost jobs.\n  Tonight's vote is an opportunity for House Democrats to admit the \nstatus quo isn't working. It is a chance to take a small first step \ntoward growing the economy and helping create jobs. Then, later this \nweek, Democrats in the Senate will have the same opportunity to show \nthat they get it. Americans are watching. They want us to acknowledge \nthat we need to play by the same rules they do. They want us to tighten \nour belts, too, and show we are in this together.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Thank you very much. Senator Reid has told me I have 30 \nminutes, so I will start that at this time.\n  We are in a very difficult time right now because we are getting out \nof the deepest recession since the Great Depression. If we go back and \nlook at the headlines when our President was inaugurated, we see the \npace of job loss and we see what happened to credit and we see what \nhappened to the auto industry and we see what happened to the stock \nmarket--we eventually lost about 50 percent from its highs. We are now \nin a situation where we have this economic recovery starting, but the \njobs are not coming as fast as we want.\n  We don't want to do anything which threatens that economic recovery, \nwhich threatens our families and threatens the middle class. This is \nnot the time to hurt the middle class. What we see in Wisconsin is the \nmiddle class finally saying to the Governor there: Look, be fair to us. \nWe are willing to give up pay, we are willing to pay more for our \nbenefits, but don't destroy our ability to have a say in our lives.\n  So as this economic recovery plays out, we have to deal with deficits \nthat have come about because of this terrible recession, fewer revenues \ncoming in to the Federal Government, more people calling on programs to \nhelp them with unemployment insurance and food stamps and things they \nneed to stay alive. We have to deal with our deficit, there is no \nquestion about that. We have to do it like grownups. We\n\n[[Page S1025]]\n\nhave to do it with common sense. We don't want to take a meat ax to \nthis recovery and wind up losing jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  This last election was all about jobs. I was out there, so I can tell \nyou. My Republican opponent, every day, said: Senator Boxer, where are \nthe jobs? Where are the jobs? That was a legitimate question. I \nanswered it this way: It is taking too long to get these jobs back \nwhere they should be, but I am going to fight every day for jobs. When \nI see a proposal that will threaten jobs, I am going to talk about it.\n  I am going to get to the Republican proposal for the rest of this \nyear, the 2011 budget proposal, which experts such as Mark Zandi, a \nRepublican expert who advised Republican candidates--he advised John \nMcCain. He said, as well as Goldman Sachs, that if you pass the \nRepublican budget plan, you endanger 700,000 jobs. So what do we do? We \nhave to cut spending, yes. We have to do it wisely. We have to sit \ntogether and discuss it, not say: My way or the highway; here is the \nbill, don't talk to me.\n  I think it is important, as we hear the majority leader address his \ncomments to the Democratic side, to address some comments to the \nRepublican side. When George Bush was elected President, President Bill \nClinton handed him a $236 billion budget surplus. I am proud to say I \nserved at that time, and I voted for the Democratic budget, the Clinton \nbudget. What did it accomplish? Quite a bit. Not only a balanced budget \nbut a surplus. There were those on the other side calling for an \namendment to the Constitution for a balanced budget. We said: We don't \nneed an amendment; we just need to balance the budget in a wise way, \nand we did it. We cut out unnecessary spending, but we invested where \nit created jobs. Guess what. We said to the upper income people of $1 \nmillion or more: You have to pay your fair share. They were willing and \nable to do it, and we created not only surpluses in the Federal \nGovernment but 23 million new jobs.\n  Let me say that again. We created a surplus--not only a balanced \nbudget surplus but 23 million new jobs. Now the Republicans take over, \nand when George Bush leaves office, he created 1 million jobs in 8 \nyears, compared to 23 million. Guess what. He left us a $1.3 trillion \ndeficit. I say to my friends here, he left the wars off budget, so it \nwas even way higher than that. He didn't put the two wars on the \nbudget.\n  President Obama, last year, created more jobs than George Bush did. \nPresident Obama created, in 2010, 1.1 million new jobs. So the new jobs \nunder President Obama in 2010 equal the net jobs of George Bush after 8 \nyears. President Obama inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit from George \nBush, who created that from a surplus. It is important we follow this. \nGeorge Bush created 1 million jobs net compared to 23 million jobs \nunder Bill Clinton, and President Obama inherited the worst recession \nsince the Great Depression--700,000 jobs a month lost, panic on Wall \nStreet, you name it, the auto industry going out. We would have been \nthe only leader in the industrialized world not to have an auto \nindustry.\n  It is fair to say things have stabilized. The auto industry had the \nbest year in a long time. The money we loaned to the banks has been \npaid back. But we have more to do. The deficit is up to $1.6 trillion \nnow because the wars are now on the budget, because we still haven't \nmade up for the revenues we lost, and the jobs are coming back too \nslowly.\n  This is where we stand. We have to pass a budget for the remainder of \nthis year, and Democrats are saying let's do it wisely. We will cut, \ncut, cut, and we have a list of cuts we can go over. We cut $40 billion \nfrom the President's 2011 budget. The Republicans cut $100 billion from \nthe President's budget. So, surely, between the 40 we cut and the $100 \nbillion they cut, we can meet and solve this problem. I would like us \nto do it right now--sit down in good faith and get it done and scratch \nany of the cuts that hurt our children, scratch the cuts that hurt our \nwomen's health, scratch the cuts that are essentially political--I will \ngo into those later--and come up with the cuts that don't threaten \nhundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  Here is the deal. There is still talk and fear about a government \nshutdown. Every time we think we have passed the point, there comes \nanother article. Today in the Washington Post there is this article. I \nask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 1, 2011]\n\n     With Government Shutdown Looming, Freshmen Are the Wild Cards\n\n              (By David A. Fahrenthold and Philip Rucker)\n\n       In just two months, a freshman class of Republicans has \n     found a way to run the House.\n       These 87 new members--who otherwise might have become foot \n     soldiers for party bosses, or jittery pawns of their home-\n     town tea party groups--have instead coalesced into a bloc \n     with its own ideas and a headstrong sense of its muscle.\n       As Republicans and Democrats try to cut a short-term budget \n     deal this week--and a more permanent one in coming weeks--the \n     freshmen are the wild card. They have the power to derail the \n     whole process. Again.\n       But even their own leaders don't know if they will.\n       The freshmen's willingness to do things their way stems \n     from their hyper-confident vision of themselves, revealed in \n     interviews in recent days with more than 30 members of the \n     group. Many described their job as a ``calling,'' a sense \n     that their grandchildren, their country or their God needed \n     them to make hard decisions to right the government's \n     finances.\n       ``We may be the last opportunity,'' said Rep. Michael G. \n     Grimm (N.Y.), a former FBI agent.\n       But now, the difficult part.\n       In the escalating budget fight--and other battles to come--\n     the freshmen will face the capital's hardest kind of \n     decision: how to compromise on the issue they care about the \n     most.\n       How much ground will the freshmen give before they defy the \n     Senate and risk a government shutdown?\n       ``I don't know,'' Rep. Joe Walsh (Ill.) said when asked how \n     the newcomers would react if the Democratic-controlled Senate \n     offered a spending bill with fewer cuts than theirs. '1 don't \n     know. I don't know. And I think most freshmen don't know.''\n       This class of Republican freshmen--the largest for either \n     party in at least six decades--includes nine women and 78 \n     men. Their views are not all the same: Some have called for a \n     more nuanced approach to spending cuts, while others have \n     insisted that the House's bare-bones budget was not bare \n     enough.\n       Many can recount the moment they realized they were mad \n     enough to run for Congress.\n       Rep. Alan Nunnelee (Miss.) said that he was happy as a \n     state legislator, and that he had resisted previous efforts \n     to draft him as a candidate. Then, on March 27, 2009, he \n     learned he was going to be a grandfather.\n       ``What I saw happening in Washington really was endangering \n     the freedom'' his new grandson would have,Nunnelee said. ``I \n     had a moral obligation to do something about it.''\n       Rep. Blake Farenthold (Tex.) was a talk-radio host, one of \n     more than three dozen freshmen who had never held an elected \n     office.\n       ``I really feel like I was called to run for office at this \n     time,'' he said. ``A whole bunch of things all came together \n     at once. . . . I can't credit that to anything but divine \n     intervention.''\n       With that kind of back story, the freshmen said they \n     wouldn't play the role of Congress's rookies. Instead of \n     being taught by longtime lawmakers, many said, they wanted to \n     teach.\n       ``When you say, `We need to listen to the American people,' \n     that's us,'' said Rep. Kevin Yoder (Kan.), a former state \n     legislator.\n       This group--which represents about one-third of the \n     Republicans in the House--showed its muscle last month, in a \n     series of private meetings with House Speaker John A. Boehner \n     (Ohio) and other GOP leaders.\n       At issue was how deep to cut spending in a ``continuing \n     resolution'' to fund the government for the remaining seven \n     months of this fiscal year. During the midterm campaign, \n     Republicans had pledged to cut $100 billion over a year.\n       But the leadership presented a number equal to seven-\n     twelfths of $100 billion.\n       The math worked. But, freshmen say, the politics didn't.\n       ``We felt like we told the people that we would do $100 \n     billion,'' said Rep. Trey Gowdy (S.C.), a former prosecutor. \n     ``And when you start using the words `pro-rata' or `There's \n     seven months left in the budget'--as a prosecutor, when \n     you're explaining, you're losing.''\n       The leadership agreed, without much of a fight, and went \n     back to make additional reductions. In Congress's world of \n     tradition and seniority, the tail had officially wagged the \n     dog.\n       But from here on out, it will be harder to be Congress's \n     heroes.\n       Many of the freshmen say they want to consider changes to \n     Medicare, Social Security and other entitlement programs, \n     which have been political land mines in the past. And Senate \n     Democrats and the White House probably will stop many of \n     their proposals cold.\n       ``We may not make it. Honestly. It may blow up in our face \n     as well,'' said Rep. James\n\n[[Page S1026]]\n\n     Lankford (Okla.), who previously directed a Christian youth \n     camp. ``At some point, somebody's going to stand up and say, \n     `We cannot keep doing this.' ''\n       This is a key part of the story the freshmen tell about \n     themselves: that they don't mind turning some people off, or \n     even losing reelection.\n       ``I cannot tell you how liberating it is,'' Gowdy said. \n     ``The job just doesn't mean that much to me. I'm loyal to my \n     word, and in the end I think that's what I'll be judged on.''\n       But the election is still 21 months away. In that time, \n     historians say, the freshmen will find it more and more \n     difficult to hold on to their sense of exceptionalism--that \n     they can be in Washington, but not of it.\n       ``Their principal vulnerability is that--having been \n     elected--they will be seen as politicians. No matter what. By \n     definition, they are politicians,'' said Ross K. Baker of \n     Rutgers University. Baker said that means making complicated \n     decisions that are hard to explain to voters.\n       ``The alternative, of course, is to be voices in the \n     wilderness,'' Baker said--uncompromised, but also irrelevant.\n       But the fallout from their hard decisions will not come \n     just at the election.\n       Last week, as freshmen went home to their districts for \n     town hall meetings, Rep. Robert T. Schilling (Ill.) could \n     already feel it in the pit of his stomach.\n       ``He who turns a blind eye will get many a curse,'' said an \n     angry Clara Caldwell, 81, quoting Proverbs at Schilling's \n     town hall meeting in Moline, Ill. She was criticizing him for \n     voting to cut funding for Head Start programs.\n       Last year, Schilling was making pies at Saint Giuseppe's \n     Heavenly Pizza, the restaurant he owns just a few blocks \n     away. On this night, he received applause and criticism from \n     a standing-room crowd. Schilling tried reasoning with the \n     critics: ``Lots of people say, `We need cuts.' But everybody \n     in the room says, `Don't cut my stuff.' ''\n       He tried conciliation, on the subject of an Amtrak project \n     in the district, which he'd voted to cut. ``The Amtrak will \n     probably end up happening someday,'' Schilling said.\n       And he tried, in a quiet way, to ask for sympathy. ``The \n     stress that's out there is just unbelievable,'' he said, \n     meaning in Washington.\n       It isn't just in Washington. ``Your stomach kind of knots. \n     Your mouth's dry. I went through a whole bottle of water in \n     there,'' Schilling said after the town hall meeting, walking \n     to his car. Good to get used to it, he said. ``It's not going \n     to get any better. We're on a mission.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. It says this on the front page: ``With shutdown looming, \nGOP freshmen are wild cards.'' When you ask the Republican Members of \nthe House where this is going, they say they don't know. The government \ncould shut down; we don't know. Later, I will go into what happened the \nlast time the government shut down. I will not do that at this moment.\n  I talked to Senator Casey, my good colleague and a great leader in \nthe Senate, about an anomaly in the law that protects Members of \nCongress from getting their pay shut down in the case of a government \nshutdown, when the vast majority of Federal workers will not get paid. \nHe and I agree there is something wrong with this system. It is not \nfair. If we fail to keep this government operating, which is our basic \nresponsibility, to keep the checks flowing to Social Security \nrecipients, to veterans with disabilities, to make sure we don't harm \nthe private sector contractors and workers--if we don't do that, we \ndon't deserve to get our pay.\n  We put together a bill that says, in the case of a government \nshutdown, Members of Congress and the President must be treated the \nsame way as other Federal employees--and, by the way, not get back our \npay retroactively. It touched a chord with several colleagues. We have \nthe bill written, and we have sent it to the Republican side and the \nDemocratic side. My understanding is, it has passed the Democratic side \nvia hotline, and the Republicans are looking at it now. The cosponsors \nare Senators Boxer, Casey, Manchin, Tester, Nelson of Nebraska, Bennet, \nWarner, Wyden, Coons, Harkin, Hagan, Menendez, Stabenow, Merkley, and \nRockefeller.\n  We feel we have the support of the people. We are hopeful we will \navert a government shutdown because it is bad for our country, bad for \nour families, bad for our States, and there is no need to have one. But \nif we do have one, we don't want to have Members of Congress go home, \nget their pay, and not even have to pay a price or sacrifice or \nanything else while other families are sacrificing. We hope our \nRepublican friends will agree with us and, if they do, we are going to \nsend it over tonight. We are not asking unanimous consent now, but we \nwill at 4 o'clock. If they can go forward, we will send this over to \nSpeaker Boehner in the hopes it will breeze through the House.\n  In case of a government shutdown, which we hope will be averted, we \nhope we are treated the same as Federal employees and that we are not \ngetting our paychecks when others are not.\n  With that, I will yield the floor to Senator Casey for as long as he \nwould like.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I wish to take a couple moments to \nexpress my gratitude, and I think people across the country--if we can \nget this done--will express their gratitude as well. At a time when the \neconomy is still recovering--and there is good news that the recovery \nis moving at a faster rate than it was 1 year ago or certainly than 6 \nmonths ago. I wish to talk about that for a moment.\n  I express my gratitude to Senator Boxer for her leadership on this \nissue. All we are saying together--as she did in the mid-1990s, when \nthis came up at the time of that shutdown--is, Members of Congress have \nto play by the same rules as everyone else who depends upon the Federal \nGovernment for a program or their pay; that we will play by the same \nrules. I commend Senator Boxer for her leadership, as she demonstrated \nall those years ago, when at the time it passed, but it was taken out \nin a conference committee. I believe, if Members of Congress are going \nto be deciding whether the government continues to operate or whether \nit shuts down, they have to play by the same set of rules.\n  I mentioned the economy because this has a direct connection to why \nwe are discussing this today. We have, as I said, a recovering economy. \nIn Pennsylvania, there is data to show that. I know in California the \nunemployment rate has been high. It was high for a long period of time \nin Pennsylvania. It is still high but, in a relative sense, lower than \na lot of places. We are at 8.5 percent in our State. That translates \ninto 538,000 people out of work, which is an incredibly high number. I \nwill say this. That number was higher this past summer. We were \napproaching 600,000 people out of work. We were below 540,000 at last \ncount. I hope we are still moving in that direction when we see the \nmonthly numbers again.\n  We have a recovering economy. We also have very high deficits and \ndebt. The American people are worried about that, justifiably. I have \nno doubt that when we continue to work together in the Senate--and I \nhope it happens in the House as well--we can come to a consensus about \nthe 2011 budget, which is where most of the attention is now, and the \n2012 budget but also, longer term, about how we pay for essential \nservices, create jobs, and reduce deficit and debt.\n  Along the way, if Members of Congress are going to vote for a \nshutdown, they should not be paid their salary while that shutdown is \nin effect. It is about basic values such as accountability, not having \none set of rules for Members of Congress and another set of rules for \nthe American people. It is also about playing by the rules. We have to \nplay by the same rules that we vote to attach to what happens in the \nFederal Government. Finally, I think it is about restoring or beginning \nto restore some of the basic trust we hope the American people will \nhave in their government. That trust, that faith that keeps our \ndemocracy together, can be badly broken if we have Members of Congress \nwho vote for a shutdown but are still getting their pay after the \nshutdown is in effect.\n  Finally, it is about a basic value called fairness. People expect us \nto be fair. We cannot say to the American people that a Member of \nCongress is voting to shut down the government, with all the \nimplications of that and the instability that would create, but then in \nthe same breath say we still want to get the pay we have as Federal \nemployees. So it is good accountability, trust, and fairness.\n  I commend Senator Boxer for, once again, showing the leadership she \ndemonstrated in the mid-1990s on this issue and again making it very \nclear we are going to do everything we can to live by the same rules. \nIf there is a shutdown, our pay should be shut down.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, how much time remains?\n\n[[Page S1027]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twelve minutes 45 seconds remain.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for working hard on \nthis piece of legislation. It is very simple.\n  No budget, no pay. That is it. We cannot have no function of \ngovernment more important than passing a budget and keeping us going. \nThe people have a right to expect that we will do our work.\n  Social Security checks, if there is a shutdown, may not arrive on \ntime. Veterans may not receive the benefits they have earned. Passports \nmay not be issued. Superfund sites will not be cleaned up, and those \nare dangerous. Oil wells should be inspected. We see what happens when \nwe do not do the functions of government; we pay, our people pay. \nExport licenses must be granted. Troops must be paid. Failing to keep \nthe government open because of politics or because no one wants to \nlisten to the other side and meet in the middle is a failure. All we \nare saying is treat Members of Congress and the President the same as \nother Federal employees. And no retroactive, back pay either.\n  The bigger issue is the one I touched on; that is, what is the right \nway to approach this deficit problem. Clearly, we have to do it \nresponsibly. Clearly, the American people want us to reduce this \ndeficit. I want to reduce it. I have to say very proudly, not only did \nwe reduce it under Bill Clinton but we had surpluses. This is the only \ntime we ever had a surplus--a Democratic administration. OK? That is \nit. I do not need lectures from the other side of the aisle. Show me a \ntime when they balanced the budget. They do not have one to show me.\n  They can show me the record under George W. Bush and George Herbert \nWalker Bush: deficits, deficits, deficits, deficits. And under George \nBush, job losses. Over the entire 8 years, there were 1 million net new \njobs compared to 23 million under Bill Clinton. What a record.\n  Let's do this the way we know it should be done, which is a balanced \napproach. Cut spending where it is wasteful, where it is useless, where \nit is dumb to spend money. Spend it where it makes sense--on our kids.\n  The things my colleagues in the House did without one Democratic vote \nare shocking. The experts tell us we could lose between 700,000 and 1 \nmillion jobs--between 700,000 and 1 million jobs--if we go with their \npackage. They need to sit and talk with us. Let's reason together.\n  They cut $100 billion off the President's budget. We have already cut \n$40 billion. Let's meet in the middle. But let's not threaten as many \nas 1 million jobs.\n  Moody's estimates their budget would destroy 700,000 jobs. Goldman \nSachs says their plan would cut economic growth by as much as 2 percent \nby the end of the year. It is inconceivable, after they ran around in \nthis last election saying: Where are the jobs? Where are the jobs?--\nthat is all I heard. And it was a good point. But it is inconceivable \nthey would turn their backs on jobs and now focus on the deficit as if \nthat is the only issue we have to worry about.\n  Again, when President Obama took office, the economy was heading off \na cliff. I will never forget the Republican Secretary of the Treasury, \nHank Paulson, looking straight in my eyes--and that was hard because he \nis 7 feet tall and I am a little under 5 feet; he is not 7 feet tall, \nbut to me he looks like 7 feet tall--and saying: Senator, capitalism is \non the brink of collapse. We may see the collapse of capitalism.\n  I remember back to the debates when one of my Republican colleagues \nsuggested nationalizing the banks. President Obama said: No, we are not \ngoing there. We are going to have to figure out a way. Yes, we did lend \nthem money and it was an awful vote and I hated every minute of it. The \nbanks paid back every penny.\n  The auto industry--oh, my colleagues said, we cannot help the auto \nindustry. Oh, yes, we did. We did not want to be the only Western Power \nthat did not have an automobile industry. It is important to our \nnational defense. We stabilized the auto industry, we have stabilized \nthe financial industry, we approved tax cuts for the middle class, and \nwe made investments in infrastructure.\n  Yes, it is true, George Bush took a big surplus and turned it into a \n$1.3 trillion deficit. The deficit now is $1.6 trillion as we struggle \nout of this economic mire and put the wars on the budget.\n  By the way, ending the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq over 10 years \ncould get us $1.1 trillion. I have not heard any of my Republican \nfriends go there at all with that. We need to do that. They are just \nlooking at one small part of the budget.\n  I have to tell you from my heart what I think they did over there. \nThey cut $100 billion off the President's budget. We cut $41 billion \noff the President's budget. This is what they did: I believe they used \ndeficit reduction as an excuse to carry out political vendettas against \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. They not only took a meat axe to \nthat budget, but they ordered the EPA--they said they cannot protect \nfamilies from pollution from cement plants. They cannot do that. That \nmeans our people will be exposed to mercury. They said they cannot \nenforce the Clean Air Act when it comes to carbon pollution. Imagine, \nthey do not dare just come here and say: Let's repeal the Clean Air \nAct. They go around the back door using the budget as a political \nvendetta tool.\n  They said: Let's stop our improvements in food safety. I have to say, \nnot one person in my home State ever came up to me--I do not care if \nthey are Republican, Independent, or Democrat--and said: Senator, the \ntwo things I want when you get back is to give me dirty air and give me \npoisoned food. I need more contamination in my food.\n  I cannot believe this. We just did a great bill, and they slashed the \nmoney for food safety. Tell me how that makes America stronger. Tell \nme, when we know how many people die of illness from contaminated food.\n  They did a political vendetta against family planning, which is going \nto lead to more abortions if it goes through. It is not going to go \nthrough because we are not going to let them stop ensuring that \nAmerican women in this day and age--they are not going to tell my \npeople in California they cannot have access to contraception. Yet they \ncut every penny from Planned Parenthood in a clear, I believe, \nunconstitutional political vendetta.\n  Madam President, 5 million men and women get the services of Planned \nParenthood. They get tested for STDs, AIDS, cancer screenings--all of \nthat. And a lot of women use Planned Parenthood clinics as their first \nline of health care. This is 2011. We are not going back to the dark \ndays when women died because they did not have health care. We cannot. \nWe cannot do it.\n  Drop the political vendettas. Come to the table and let's find the \ncuts that make sense. Put a little more faith in your Democratic \ncolleagues since we are the only ones who balanced the budget and \ncreated a surplus and 23 million jobs. I do not need to hear lectures \nabout that. They can talk all they want. The last balanced budget was \nunder Bill Clinton. The last surplus was under Bill Clinton. The last \ngreat economic growth was under Bill Clinton.\n  Our President gets it. That is why he tackles this deficit over a \nperiod of time and gets it down to $600 billion by 2015. Maybe we can \ndo more. I am ready to do more, and we will do more if we have an \neconomic recovery. We will not if we lose another 1 million jobs and \nhave another 1 million people getting help from us rather than having \njobs and keeping their homes.\n  What other vendettas? This one, the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting. Somebody said that 4 hours of the war in Afghanistan \nwould be equal to the cut they made to public broadcasting--4 hours of \nthe war in Afghanistan. America should be proud of the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting. We go toe to toe with the BBC. Great Britain funds \n100 percent of the BBC. We fund 15 percent of public broadcasting. But \nnow they want to zero it out. A vendetta against Elmo.\n  They have a vendetta against health reform. The President is right. \nIn our bill we say the States can do another plan. Let's push that up \nto 2014. Do not go back to the days when 62 percent of all bankruptcies \nwere linked to a health care crisis.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n\n[[Page S1028]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 1 minute 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, they have a vendetta against clean \nenergy. I guess they want to keep dependence on foreign oil. I do not \nand my people do not. We do not enjoy $5-a-gallon gas, which is where \nit is heading maybe because of the unrest in the Middle East. We need \nalternatives--clean cars, cars that go 50, 60 miles a gallon or do not \nneed any gas at all. Oh, they cut that.\n\n  They cut Head Start. Our little kids will not have Head Start. What \nare they doing? It makes no sense. Every dollar we put into early \nchildhood education saves $10. What are they doing? And Pell grants.\n  There are so many other ways to proceed. Do you know, if we just \nlooked at the tax loopholes given to corporations who ship jobs \noverseas, it is over $140 billion over 10 years? Let's take a look at \nthat. Let's take a look at the billionaires. Why do we have to ask \nlittle kids to give up a slot in Head Start and get that Head Start \nthey need? Why do we have to ask our teenagers to give up on going to \ncollege? That is what their budget does for no reason at all.\n  Let's avert a government shutdown by coming together. I am willing to \nmove in their direction. They have to be willing to move to mine. \nAgain, they cut $100 billion off the President's budget. We cut $40 \nbillion. Let's meet in the middle.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more \nseconds, and then I will yield to my friend.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, in conclusion, let's meet in the middle. \nLet's put this 2011 budget issue behind us quickly. Let's move on to \nlong-term deficit reduction and job creation. If we fail, let's not get \npaid for our work here.\n  This afternoon I will be back to ask unanimous consent: No budget, no \npay.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of my \nfriend, the Senator from California. We have to be serious about the \ncountry's debt. Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, says the debt is our biggest national security threat.\n  Anyone in my State who looks at what we are spending in Washington is \nastonished. We are spending, this year, $3.7 trillion. We are \ncollecting $2.2 trillion. The House of Representatives has said: Let's \ntake a step--a serious step--toward dealing with that debt. I applaud \nthem for that. That number is a number that we on the Republican side \ntry to support in the Senate. We might have our own priorities within \nthat reduced number, but we need to get serious about the entire \nproblem of America's debt.\n  It also goes directly to the problem of jobs we have in our country \ntoday. The last Democratic Congress and the President's policies have \nthrown a big wet blanket on private sector job creation in America. One \nof the biggest parts of the wet blanket is the big debt. According to \neconomists, it costs us 1 million jobs a year. The big debt creates the \npotential for higher interest rates. That makes it harder to create \njobs. It soaks up capital. It could be used to create jobs. It creates \nuncertainty. It creates a lack of confidence.\n  There is a lot of spirit in this Senate to find a consensus on how to \ndeal with the debt. I want to be one who does that. I look forward to a \nserious discussion of those efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/01/senate-section/article/S1028-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                A NEW MARSHALL PLAN FOR THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, in Jerusalem last week during a \nprivate meeting with U.S. Senators, the Prime Minister of Israel \nsuggested creating a new Marshall Plan to help the people of Middle \nEastern countries who are struggling to gain more freedom. I was one of \nthe Senators in that meeting.\n  In one important way, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal is \ndifferent from the plan that helped rebuild Western Europe after World \nWar II. Its funding would not come from the U.S. Government but from \nprivate gifts and foundations worldwide. Instead of the money going for \nrebuilding bombed out industrial plants and roads as it did after World \nWar II, it would more likely be spent in the Middle East now on \nschools, on health clinics, and on clean water.\n  Fundamentally, though, the plans are very similar. Both GEN George C. \nMarshall in 1947 and Prime Minister Netanyahu today proposed helping \nadversaries as well as allies. Both aim to relieve hunger, poverty, \ndesperation, and chaos. Both proposals are based squarely on self-\ninterest, as antidotes to the spread of philosophies unfriendly to \ndemocracy: communism in the case of postwar Europe and militant Islam \nin the Middle East today.\n  In both cases, applicants for the money would write their own plans. \nIn 1948, 16 nations met in Paris to develop the Marshall plan. \nPresident Truman then submitted it for approval to the Congress. Most \nof the money was distributed by grants that did not have to be repaid.\n  The first Marshall plan was short term, from 1948 to 1952, and so \nshould be this new Marshall plan. The goal is not to create \ndependencies but to help people stand on their own.\n  There are some important differences between the idea of the Marshall \nplan after World War II and Prime Minister Netanyahu's proposal for the \nMiddle East. The new Middle East Marshall plan would cost much less. \nThe original Marshall plan spent between $115 billion and $130 billion \nin today's dollars over those 4 years. If a Middle Eastern plan \ncarefully distributed a few billion dollars over 5 years it could have \nan enormous impact.\n  The Marshall plan started out after World War II buying food and fuel \nand ended up rebuilding bombed-out industrial plants, roads, and other \ninfrastructure. In addition to schools and clinics, a Middle Eastern \nMarshall plan is more likely to spend money on, for example, a corps of \nyoung people who are paid a subsistence wage to strengthen their own \ncountry.\n  Marshall plan money went to 16 European governments. Money for a \nMiddle Eastern plan should probably be distributed through non-\ngovernmental organizations.\n  After World War II, there was a clear effort to impose on Europe and \nJapan the American model. We should have learned by now that the path \nto democracy in the Middle East is more likely to be uniquely Middle \nEastern. The original Marshall plan was paid for mostly by United \nStates taxpayers. Money for this new plan should come from around the \nworld, mostly from private gifts.\n  The first Marshall plan was used mostly for purchase of goods from \nthe United States. Today, those goods would be purchased from around \nthe world.\n  What are the next steps? First, a coalition of foundations should \nstep forward and announce its willingness to consider proposals from \nEgypt and other Middle Eastern countries that would assist a transition \nto a more democratic form of government.\n  Second, the first grants should be quickly approved, probably to non-\ngovernmental organizations already in place. The original Marshall plan \nmoved slowly. In this age of instant communication, freedom fighters \nexpect immediate results. Some evidence of improvement in their lives \ncould help sustain a movement toward democracy against the lure of \nmilitant Islam.\n  An early State Department memorandum compared General Marshall's \nproposal to a flying saucer: ``Nobody knows what it looks like, how big \nit is, or whether it really exists.'' Prime Minister Netanyahu's \nproposal also is usefully vague, with details to be filled in later by \napplicants for grants. But shouldn't it be enough simply to propose \nhelping people struggling for freedom based upon the hard-eyed belief \nthat their success will benefit other Democratic countries, including \nthe United States and Israel?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/01/senate-section/article/S1028-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1028-S1029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID KEARNS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, in Rochester, NY, today and tomorrow, \nfamily and friends are celebrating the life of David Kearns, who died a \nfew days ago at age 80.\n\n[[Page S1029]]\n\n  David Kearns was the former chief executive officer of the Xerox \nCorporation who, during the 1980s, led that corporation to win back the \ncopying market from the Japanese. Along the way, he found time to \nbecome America's most effective business leader who was a champion of \neducation reform, especially for pushing new technology into schools. \nHe served as Deputy Education Secretary under the first President Bush \nwhile I was the Secretary of Education in 1991, 1992 and 1993.\n  I remember first meeting David Kearns in 1990, when I was president \nof the University of Tennessee and had my office in Knoxville. He came \ninto my office, and on the way he said hello to every single person in \nthe outer office, and every single other person he met while I was \nthere. And he remembered every single one of their names. I didn't \nforget that, and they didn't forget him. When David Kearns left the \nUniversity of Tennessee from that visit I bought his book about \neducation reform and read it.\n  Later that year, President Bush called me and asked me to become his \nEducation Secretary. I asked the President if I could put together my \nown team, subject to his approval, and then if we could put together \nour own plan, subject to his approval. Those were two of the smartest \nquestions I ever asked, because that meant I didn't have to go through \nthe White House staff to get the team cleared or the policy cleared. I \ncould go directly to the President. And as soon as I had that \npermission, I called David Kearns and asked him if he would be willing \nto be the Deputy Secretary of Education in the U.S. Department of \nEducation.\n  I knew it would be hard to persuade him to do so. He was at the peak \nof his career. He had just retired as one of America's best known \nbusiness leaders. His friends said: Why in the world would you go into \nthe government and subject yourself to all that abuse and take a \nsecondary position in a minor department? I asked President Bush to \ncall David Kearns and recruit him, and he did, appealing to his \npatriotism. They both served in World War II.\n  David had such a passion for education, he came on board, and it was \nterrific that he did. It was a privilege to work with such an \naccomplished executive. Employees in the Department of Education loved \nhaving him around. Having him there helped recruit a distinguished team \nof leaders for the Department and we put together what we thought, over \n2 years, was a pretty impressive program working with President Bush.\n  Some of the ideas sound very familiar today, especially to former \nGovernors. One idea was break-the-mold schools. Today we call them \ncharter schools, or start-from-scratch schools. The thought was to have \none in each congressional district--535 of them--funded by $1 million \nof seed money from the Federal Government.\n  To support those schools, we created a new American Schools \nDevelopment Corporation, and with David's leadership raised $70 million \nin private capital for that. That attracted hundreds of design teams \nfrom around the country with ideas for how to create better schools. \nPresident Bush hosted a number of America's business leaders at Camp \nDavid to help make that happen.\n  We worked with Diane Ravitch to create an effort to implement \nstandards for the national education goals that President Bush had \nhelped to set in 1987 with the Nation's Governors. These were the goals \nfor math, science, history, English, and geography, and we took \nimportant steps toward that. Today, the common standards States are \nadopting owe some of their beginnings to those efforts.\n  We established commissions to look at extending the school day. We \npushed for technology in the schools. The President proposed in 1992 a \nGI bill for kids, which would give scholarships to poor kids so they \ncould choose any school, public or private or religious, so they could \nhave more of the same choices of good schools that kids with money had.\n  By the time we left in 1993, every State in America had their own \nversion of America 2000--it was Tennessee 2000 or New Hampshire 2000 or \nKansas 2000--moving toward the educational goals community by \ncommunity. None of that would have happened without David Kearns' \nenthusiasm, skill, and leadership.\n\n  In 1992, during a riot over Rodney King in Los Angeles, President \nBush sent David to represent him. David had a strong background in \ncivil rights. While he was there, he telephoned me and said: This is \nthe hardest phone call I have ever had to make. I have cancer. He had \njust discovered he had cancer of the sinus. When he came back, he had \nan operation and the operation gradually destroyed his eyesight.\n  That was 20 years ago, but it didn't stop David Kearns. During that \ntime, he created the Kearns Center for Leadership at the University of \nRochester, where he graduated and served as trustee for many years. \nThen to help him get around, because he couldn't see, or could barely \nsee, he invited a young man each year to go with him and help him see \nand do what he needed to do. For those young men--nearly 20 over the \nlast 20 years--that has been a remarkable opportunity to be in the \npresence of one of America's great mentors at an early stage in their \nlives.\n  Everyone who knew David Kearns admired him and loved him. A few days \nago, I spoke with Shirley Kearns, David's wife of 56 years, and \nreminded her of what she already knows: how much David's friendship \nmeant to me. Honey and I will be thinking of them today and tomorrow in \nRochester. We will be thinking about Shirley, their 4 daughters, 2 \nsons, and 18 grandchildren.\n  For me, one story sums up David Kearns' life better than others. I \nthink back to 1995, when I was in Utah. I was trying to persuade \nRepublicans that I was their natural nominee for President of the \nUnited States. I wasn't successful in that, but I was enthusiastic \nabout it. I had made to a Republican group what I thought was an \nespecially good speech. During the speech, I talked about my work in \nthe U.S. Department of Education and I talked about David Kearns--about \nhis leadership and about how he helped do all the things I have just \nmentioned. After the speech, an enthusiastic Republican lady came up to \nme and said: That was a wonderful speech. Thank you very much, I said. \nNow I know who should be President, she said. Well, thank you, I said. \nShe smiled and said: David Kearns. That was the opinion that she and I \nand almost everyone who met him had of David Kearns, whose 80 years in \nthis country have been very special.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to take a moment in this Chamber to \nhonor the passing of the last doughboy, Mr. Frank Buckles, the last of \nthose World War I veterans. Mr. Buckles was America's last living World \nWar I veteran and he died Sunday in West Virginia. His death came 1 \nmonth after his 110th birthday, which he celebrated on February 1 with \nhis family.\n  Frank Buckles was dedicated to serving his country at all cost. He \nenlisted in the U.S. Army when he was only 16 years old. Throughout the \nGreat War, Mr. Buckles proved himself to be a brave soldier. He served \non the RMS Carpathia, drove ambulances and motorcycles in France and \nEngland, and escorted prisoners of war back to Germany.\n  Mr. Buckles lived to see our country at war several more times in his \nlife. He even survived as a prisoner of war during World War II. He had \nbeen captured while working for a shipping company in the Philippines.\n\n  As a soldier and as a civilian, Mr. Buckles lived a life defined by \nhard work, love of country, and a sense of duty to his fellow citizens. \nHis passing marks the loss of a generation that shared those same \nvalues, a generation that built America into the country it is today. \nMy thoughts go out to his family.\n  It is also important we recognize that Mr. Buckles' death is an \nimportant moment for all of America. Our country should come together \nto honor Mr. Buckles and an entire generation that has done so much to \nbuild a world where democracy and freedom are celebrated values. This \nis the reason that I\n\n[[Page S1030]]\n\ncosponsor, with my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, a \nresolution I hope our colleagues will support unanimously, to allow \nthis last in a generation of heroes to be recognized by the Congress of \nthe United States, either in a service or by lying in honor in the \nRotunda, a privilege that is held for very few but one that I think \nrises to the occasion of the last hero of a generation, an individual \nand a generation that played such a part in the values of this country. \nWe will have an opportunity to celebrate the life of this man, but, \nmore importantly, to cherish the fruits of his commitment to those \nfreedoms and those liberties that are protected still today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 23, which the clerk will report \nby title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 23) to amend title 35, United States Code, to \n     provide for patent reform.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Leahy amendment No. 114, to improve the bill.\n       Vitter/Toomey amendment No. 112, to require that the \n     government prioritize all obligations on the debt held by the \n     public in the event that the debt limit is reached.\n       Bennet amendment No. 116, to reduce the fee amounts paid by \n     small entities requesting prioritized examination under \n     Three-Track Examination.\n       Bennet amendment No. 117, to establish additional USPTO \n     satellite offices.\n       Lee amendment No. 115, to express the sense of the Senate \n     in support of a balanced budget amendment to the \n     Constitution.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, yesterday the Senate began debating the \nAmerica Invents Act. We adopted the committee amendments, and we \nproceeded to have five additional amendments offered to the bill. This \nmorning I will be offering a managers' amendment, along with the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, that incorporates \nadditional improvements being made at the suggestions of Senator \nCoburn, Senator Schumer, Senator Coons, Senator Bennet, and others.\n  When we adopt this managers' amendment, I believe we will move very \nclose to a consensus bill the Senate can and should pass to help create \ngood jobs, encourage innovation, and strengthen our recovery and \neconomy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Statement \nof Administration Policy from the Obama administration and the Edward \nWyatt article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n                    s. 23--patent reform act of 2011\n\n       (Sen. Leahy, D-Vermont, and 11 cosponsors, Feb. 28, 2011)\n\n       The Administration supports Senate passage of S. 23. As a \n     whole, this bill represents a fair, balanced, and necessary \n     effort to improve patent quality, enable greater work sharing \n     between the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) \n     and other countries, improve service to patent applicants and \n     the public at the USPTO, and offer productive alternatives to \n     costly and complex litigation.\n       By moving the United States to a first-to-file system, the \n     bill simplifies the process of acquiring rights. This \n     essential provision will reduce legal costs, improve \n     fairness, and support U.S. innovators seeking to market their \n     products and services in a global marketplace. Further, by \n     providing authority for the USPTO to establish and adjust its \n     fees to reflect changes in costs, demand, and workload, the \n     bill would enhance productivity--reducing delay in the patent \n     application process--and ensure full cost recovery at no \n     taxpayer expense. Senate passage of this bill is consistent \n     with the Administration's commitment to support and encourage \n     innovation that leads to improved competiveness, economic \n     prosperity, and job growth--without adding a penny to the \n     deficit.\n       Finally, the Administration understands that several \n     stakeholders have suggested that the provisions on damages \n     and venue are no longer needed in the legislation in light of \n     recent court decisions in these areas. The Administration \n     would not object to removal of these provisions from the \n     final version of the legislation.\n       The Administration looks forward to continuing to work with \n     the Congress to craft patent reform legislation that reflects \n     sound policy and meets the needs of the Nation's innovators.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      U.S. Sets 21st-Century Goal: Building a Better Patent Office\n\n                    (By Edward Wyatt, Feb. 20, 2011)\n\n       Washington.--President Obama, who emphasizes American \n     innovation, says modernizing the federal Patent and Trademark \n     Office is crucial to ``winning the future.'' So at a time \n     when a quarter of patent applications come from California, \n     and many of those from Silicon Valley, the patent office is \n     opening its first satellite office--in Detroit.\n       That is only one of the signs that have many critics saying \n     that the office has its head firmly in the 20th century, if \n     not the 19th.\n       Only in the last three years has the office begun to accept \n     a majority of its applications in digital form. Mr. Obama \n     astonished a group of technology executives last year when he \n     described how the office has to print some applications filed \n     by computer and scan them into another, incompatible computer \n     system.\n       ``There is no company I know of that would have permitted \n     its information technology to get into the state we're in,'' \n     David J. Kappos, who 18 months ago became director of the \n     Patent and Trademark Office and undersecretary of commerce \n     for intellectual property, said in a recent interview. ``If \n     it had, the C.E.O. would have been fired, the board would \n     have been thrown out, and you would have had shareholder \n     lawsuits.''\n       Once patent applications are in the system, they sit--for \n     years. The patent office's pipeline is so clogged it takes \n     two years for an inventor to get an initial ruling, and an \n     additional year or more before a patent is finally issued.\n       The delays and inefficiencies are more than a nuisance for \n     inventors. Patentable ideas are the basis for many start-up \n     companies and small businesses. Venture capitalists often \n     require start-ups to have a patent before offering financing. \n     That means that patent delays cost jobs, slow the economy and \n     threaten the ability of American companies to compete with \n     foreign businesses.\n       Much of the patent office's decline has occurred in the \n     last 13 years, as the Internet age created a surge in \n     applications. In 1997, 2.25 patents were pending for every \n     one issued. By 2008, that rate had nearly tripled, to 6.6 \n     patents pending for every one issued. The figure fell below \n     six last year.\n       Though the office's ranks of patent examiners and its \n     budget have increased by about 25 percent in the last five \n     years, that has not been enough to keep up with a flood of \n     applications--which grew to more than 2,000 a day last year, \n     for a total of 509,000, from 950 a day in 1997.\n       The office, like a few other corners of the government, has \n     long paid its way, thanks to application and maintenance \n     fees. That income--$2.1 billion last year--has made it an \n     inviting target for Congress, which over the last 20 years \n     has diverted a total of $800 million to other uses, rather \n     than letting the office invest the money in its operations.\n       Applications have also become far more complex, said \n     Douglas K. Norman, president of the Intellectual Property \n     Owners Association, a trade group mainly of large technology \n     and manufacturing companies.\n       ``When I was a young patent lawyer, a patent application \n     would be 20 to 25 pages and have 10 to 15 claims,'' Mr. \n     Norman said. A claim is the part of the patent that defines \n     what is protected. ``Now they run hundreds of pages, with \n     hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of claims.''\n       Lost in the scrutiny of the office's logjam, however, was \n     the fact that the number of patents issued reached a record \n     last year--more than 209,000, or 29 percent more than the \n     average of 162,000 a year over the previous four years. \n     Rejections also hit a high of 258,000--not a measure of \n     quality, Mr. Kappos said, but a sign of greater efficiency.\n       Between the backlog of 700,000 patents awaiting their first \n     action by an examiner and the 500,000 patents that are in \n     process, a total of 1.2 million applications are pending.\n       Sitting in his suburban Virginia office, not far from a \n     model of the light bulb Edison presented for patent in \n     November 1879 (which was approved two and a half months \n     later), Mr. Kappos proudly ticked off figures that he said \n     proved the agency was heading in the right direction.\n       The backlog has actually declined about 10 percent from a \n     peak of 770,000 at the end of 2008.\n       ``We were able to work a 13-month year last year,'' he \n     said, referring to the productivity increase in 2010 over \n     2009. ``We are processing a far larger workload with the same \n     number of examiners.''\n       Still, Mr. Kappos wants to add more than 1,000 examiners in \n     each of the next two years, a 30 percent increase. Mr. \n     Obama's 2012 budget calls for a 28 percent increase in \n     spending, to $2.7 billion, over 2010. In two consecutive \n     sessions, Congress has defeated a\n\n[[Page S1031]]\n\n     bill that would allow the patent office to keep all of the \n     fees it collects. While another similar effort is under way, \n     a big staffing increase will not be easy in a climate of \n     cuts.\n       Mr. Kappos, a former electrical engineer and lawyer who \n     joined the patent office in 2009 after 27 years at I.B.M., \n     has improved relations with the union representing patent \n     examiners. He and the union agreed on performance evaluation \n     measures last year, the first time in 5o years that the \n     yardsticks had been revised.\n       ``I give David Kappos a good deal of credit for seeing \n     where the problems have been and being willing to address \n     them,'' said Robert D. Budens, president of the union, the \n     Patent Office Professional Association. ``I think it's a \n     little early to see the full extent of the changes. But we \n     have seen an increase in morale and a decrease in attrition, \n     which is now almost the lowest it's been since I came here'' \n     in 1990.\n       Patent applications come from all over the United States, \n     and the office has forgone satellite offices--until now. Last \n     year, the office announced it would put about 100 examiners \n     in Detroit. Some prominent lawmakers from Michigan have \n     worked on patent issues, including Representative John \n     Conyers Jr., a Detroit Democrat who, when the decision was \n     made, was chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which \n     oversees patents.\n       Mr. Kappos said he chose Detroit because it had large \n     communities of patent lawyers and agents, nearby universities \n     and transportation centers, and relatively low costs of \n     living and real estate. ``Detroit has long been an innovation \n     center,'' he said. ``It's undervalued, and that is where we \n     want to invest.'' He said it would also attract a work force \n     with more varied skills.\n       Mr. Kappos is also pushing an initiative that would charge \n     patent applicants a higher fee to guarantee that their \n     applications will receive a ruling within a year. But that \n     initiative and others are not enough, said Paul R. Michel, \n     who recently retired as chief judge for the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, the \n     main forum for patent appeals.\n       ``The office can't be made efficient in 18 months without a \n     vast increase in finances,'' said Mr. Michel, who has made \n     evangelizing for an overhaul of the office a pet cause. \n     ``Small efficiency improvements will only make a small \n     difference in the problem.''\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank all of those with the administration who worked on \nthe matter, and particularly Secretary Locke, Director Kappos of the \nPatent and Trademark Office, and former Secretary Daley, now Chief of \nStaff at the White House.\n  The statement describes the bill as representing a fair, balanced, \nand necessary effort to improve patent quality. It concludes: ``Senate \npassage of this bill is consistent with the Administration's commitment \nto support and encourage innovation that leads to improved \ncompetitiveness, economic prosperity, and job growth--without adding a \npenny to the deficit.''\n  It also notes that transition to a first-to-file system simplifies \nthe process of acquiring rights and describes it as an ``essential \nprovision [to] reduce legal costs, improve fairness, and support U.S. \ninnovators seeking to market their products and services in a global \nmarketplace.''\n  I agree. I believe it should help small and independent inventors. On \nPresident's Day, just over a week ago, the New York Times included an \narticle on its front page entitled ``U.S. Sets 21st-Century Goal: \nBuilding a Better Patent Office.''\n  That is what we are trying to do with our bill, the bipartisan Leahy-\nGrassley-Hatch Patent Reform Act or, as it has become known, the \nAmerica Invents Act. We have to reform our patent office and our patent \nlaws. They have not been updated for 60 years. We have to help to \ncreate good jobs, encourage innovation, and strengthen our economy.\n  The reporter notes the growth in patent applications to more than \n2,000 a day last year. That is not a typographical error--2,000 a day \nlast year. A record 209,000 patents were issued in 2010. But there \nremains a backlog of 700,000 patents awaiting initial action at the \nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office, and another 500,000 being processed. \nThat is 1.2 million applications in the pipeline. Among them could be \nthe next medical miracle, the next energy breakthrough, the next leap \nin computing ability, the next killer app. We should all do what we can \nto help PTO Director Kappos and the dedicated women and men of the PTO \nto modernize and reform.\n  It makes no sense that it takes 2 years for an inventor to get an \ninitial ruling on his or her patent application, then another year or \nmore to get the patent.\n  As New York Times reporter Edward Wyatt notes:\n\n       The delays and inefficiencies are more than a nuisance for \n     inventors. . . . [P]atent delays cost jobs, slow the economy, \n     and threaten the ability of American companies to compete \n     with foreign businesses.\n\n  We are not going to be the leader we are today if we allow that to \ncontinue. But the Senate has before it bipartisan legislation that can \nlead to long-needed improvements in our patent laws and system. We \nshould be focused on it and moving ahead to pass it without delay. It \nis a measure that can help facilitate invention, innovation, and job \ncreation, and do so in the private sector. This can help everyone from \nstartups and small businesses to our largest cutting-edge companies.\n  This is the time for the Senate to serve the interests of the \nAmerican people by concentrating on the important legislation before \nus. We should not be distracted. It is a bipartisan bill. We should not \nbe diverted into extraneous issues but focus our debate on those few \namendments that Senators feel need to be debated to perfect this bill \nand which are germane to this bill.\n  I mentioned in my opening statement the anticipated amendment on fee \ndiversion. I appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Oklahoma to end \npatent fee diversion. It is a reform that Senator Hatch and I have long \nsupported. I appreciated him working with me and withholding his \namendment during committee consideration. So we are incorporating his \namendment in the managers' amendment.\n  We also incorporate in the managers' amendment an amendment from \nSenator Schumer that concerns business method patents. We provide a \nprocess for their reexamination by the Patent and Trademark Office. \nThis would also improve patent quality.\n  We incorporate suggestions from Senator Bennet and Senator Coons to \nremove certain damages and venue provisions that are no longer \nnecessary in light of recent court decisions. The administration noted \nin its statement that it would not object to the removal of these \nprovisions.\n  Senator Bennet came forward last night with sound amendments that he \nexplained. They are included in this amendment, along with the change \nto the definition of a ``microentity'' made at the suggestion of the \nmajority leader, and my amendment to conform the name of the \nlegislation to the America Invents Act. I hope we adopt this amendment \nwithout delay.\n  I understand there may be Senators who do not agree with the first-\nto-file reform to update and simplify our system. If they intend to \nbring an amendment, they should do so without delay. We should be able \nto complete action on this bill today or tomorrow. Then the Senate can \nturn its full attention to another important matter, the funding \nresolution needed to be enacted this week by Congress. What we should \nnot do is delay or sacrifice the job-creating potential of this bill to \na side debate about the debt limit or whether we amend the Constitution \nof the United States. Those are debates I will be happy to have in \ntheir own right. We must not allow other countries around the world to \nhave such a competitive advantage because we are too slow in moving on \nthis bill.\n  The bipartisan American Invents Act is too important to be turned \ninto a mere vehicle to launch speeches and debates about pet causes. It \nis not the bill to have debates about whether if the United States were \nto reach its debt ceiling, the government should favor paying creditors \nsuch as China before meeting its other obligations to the American \npeople.\n  That theoretical debate has nothing to do with the patent reforms in \nthis bill, and there will be a bill that you can have the debate on if \nyou want. In fact, this bill is one that does not spend taxpayers' \nmoney or raise the debt one dollar. Accordingly, I will ask the support \nof our lead Republican sponsors and the bipartisan Senate leadership to \npromptly table extraneous amendments so we can complete our work on \nthis legislation and serve the interests of the American people.\n  I have a managers' amendment. I described part of it already. I will \nsend it to the desk and ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside and this be considered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the America \nInvents Act. To put it simply, this bill, the America Invents Act, is \nabout creating jobs. It is about protecting and promoting American \ningenuity and giving American ideas the opportunity to become American \nproducts. The America Invents Act is about restoring American \ncompetitiveness and leadership in our global economy.\n  America has been at the forefront of global innovation throughout our \nNation's great history. We invented the lightning rod, the cotton gin, \nthe mechanical reaper and thresher. Thomas Edison, perhaps the most \nnoted American inventer, invented the electric light, electric power \ntransmission, the motion picture camera, the phonograph, and x-ray \nphotography. The transistor, carbon fiber, GPS, Kevlar, recombinant \nDNA, the personal computer, and the Internet are all American \ninventions as well. Even more recently, American companies have \ninvented the iPod and the iPhone and the Segway.\n  Inventors in Delaware and across America are right now working on \ncritical advances in wind turbines, fuel cell technology, and electric \ncars. These technical innovations and so many others have improved our \nstandard of living and spurred job growth, giving rise to entire \nindustries that would not have been possible without the advancements \nof applied science.\n  I believe innovation will be key to reigniting the American \nmanufacturing sector as well.\n  As low-skilled jobs have moved offshore, the only solution is to \ncreate highly skilled jobs here to replace them. These jobs will be \nfounded on American ideas and advancements.\n  In today's high tech world, however, the cost of innovation can be \nhigh. In my home State of Delaware, DuPont invests about $1.3 billion \nannually in research and development. Nationwide, according to the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development, U.S. companies \ninvest over $370 billion in R each year. In the pharmaceutical \nindustry, which is also important to my home State, experts estimate \nthat each new drug requires an initial investment of between $800 \nmillion and $2 billion.\n  Innovation is absolutely critical to the continued growth of our \nNation.\n  Our Founding Fathers recognized that investment in innovation will \nnot occur without a system of patent rights to allow inventors to reap \nthe fruits of their labor, and they placed with the Congress the \nauthority to provide for the issuance of patent rights.\n  Article 1, section 8, clause 8 states that Congress shall have the \npower:\n\n       To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by \n     securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the \n     exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.\n\n  However complicated applied sciences were in 1836, when Congress \nestablished the forerunner to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, \nthey are infinitely more complicated today. Never has PTO been more \ncentral to ensuring that the system of nationwide patents contemplated \nby our Founding Fathers is possible today. PTO must have clear, \nobjective guidelines that enable an applicant to predict whether his or \nher application will be approved. That application process must move \nexpeditiously. At the end of that process, when PTO issues a patent, \nthe inventor and the industry must have confidence that the patent is \nof good quality and will provide good defense against future \nchallenges.\n  In recent years, however, PTO has fallen short of these objectives. \nToday, a patent applicant must wait over 2 years before an examiner \nfirst picks up that application. Two years. At this moment, more than \n700,000 applications simply sit at PTO awaiting consideration. Each one \nof those applications represents an idea that could create a job or 10 \njobs or 100 or 1,000. If you file a patent application at PTO today, \nyou can expect to wait just over 3\\1/2\\ years for an initial \ndisposition. Should PTO make an error in their examination, it would \ntake about 3 more years to appeal it.\n  In a world in which startup companies depend on patents to secure \nventure capital and other funding, these times are just too long. While \nPTO Director Kappos has achieved some success and has begun to right \nthe ship at PTO, he simply cannot accomplish acceptable reform without \nour action.\n  The America Invents Act takes a number of steps to improve the \nefficiency with which this country handles\n\n[[Page S1033]]\n\npatents, all of them designed to make the U.S. more competitive in the \nglobal economy.\n  First, the America Invents Act will give PTO the tools it needs to \naddress the unacceptably long backlog of patent applications. In \nFebruary 2009, despite an increasing need for qualified patent \nexaminers, PTO instituted a hiring freeze. PTO is a user-fee supported \norganization and so it should be able to pass through the costs of \nstaffing needs to patent applicants. This bill would finally give the \nPTO the authority to set its own fees rather than having to wait for an \nact of Congress to do so.\n  Another source of the backlog is the issue of patent fee diversion. \nCurrently, the fees paid by applicants for the purpose of funding the \ncosts of patent examination can be diverted away from PTO to the \nTreasury without justification. Patent fee diversion cripples the \nability of PTO to do its job and is essentially a tax on innovation. In \nthe past 20 years, more than $800 million have been diverted from PTO \nand though in recent years almost no money has been diverted thanks to \nthe determined leadership of my colleague, Senator Mikulski, PTO \nfunding should never depend on shifting political fortunes. Even in \ntimes of political favor, the mere possibility of fee diversion is \nharmful because it robs PTO of the ability to plan with confidence that \na varying workload will be matched by funding.\n  This bill does not currently address the issue of patent fee \ndiversion, but that is something that I and others are working to \nchange. Ending fee diversion is perhaps the single most effective thing \nthat we can do to empower PTO to reduce the patent backlog over the \nlong term. That is why I look forward to supporting Dr. Coburn's \namendment, which would ensure that PTO has access to the fees that it \ncharges, subject to continuing congressional oversight, of course.\n  The second thing the America Invents Act does to make the United \nStates more competitive is to improve the predictability and accuracy \nof the patent examination process. By transitioning to a ``first to \nfile'' system, this bill brings the U.S. into line with the rest of the \nworld. Under ``first to file,'' PTO's task of determining the priority \nof a patent application will be more straightforward because patent \npriority will depend on objective, public facts, rather than on secret \nfiles. To smaller inventors who are concerned that ``first to file'' \nwill allow large companies to beat them out in a race to the patent \noffice, this bill contains important protections for all inventors. \nEven under ``first to file,'' an inventor's patent priority is \nprotected for a year if he or she is the first to publicly disclose an \ninvention.\n  Not only does the America Invents Act make the patent process fairer \nto inventors, but it will actually improve the quality of patents \nissued by the PTO by leveraging the knowledge of outside parties. This \nbill permits third parties to provide submissions regarding prior art \nbefore a patent is issued, enhancing the ability of examiners to \ndetermine whether an application is for a truly innovative idea worthy \nof the protection of a patent.\n  The bill takes another step toward improving patent quality by \nchanging the way the issuance of patents can be challenged. The America \nInvents Act introduces a 9-month post-grant review process during which \nthird parties can challenge a patent on any grounds. When you combine \nthe new pre-issuance submission process and the new post-grant review \nprocess, what you get is a more rigorous and more thorough vetting of \npatent applications.\n  We will get stronger, higher quality patents because of the America \nInvents Act.\n  Chairman Leahy, along with his Republican cosponsors Senators Hatch, \nKyl and Sessions, deserve enormous credit for the bill that was \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary committee just 4 weeks ago. The \nAmerica Invents Act reflects years of hard-fought negotiations between \nthe affected stakeholders.\n  At a time when bipartisanship is too frequently a platitude than \nactual process, it should be noted that the America Invents Act shares \nwide bipartisan support. Senators from both parties worked together on \nthe bill we consider today, and both sides of the aisle should be proud \nof what we accomplished.\n  I applaud Leaders Reid and McConnell for their commitment to the open \namendment process. Despite the broad agreements that have been reached \nso far, the Senate can and should consider suggestions to change the \nbill. I know that I will support Dr. Coburn's amendment on fee \ndiversion. I also hope that the Senate will accept an amendment that I \nhave filed which would remove the section of the bill dealing with \nvenue.\n  While venue-shopping is a serious problem, the current language in \nthe bill risks stunting the development of case law, which has begun to \naddress the problem of plaintiffs' manufacturing venue in districts \nthat have a reputation of being hospitable for patent suits. In fact, \ncompanies such as Oracle and HP, while they initially supported \nlegislative reform of venue, now fear that this provision will do more \nharm than good. I look forward to debating all of these amendments in \nthe future.\n  Let me conclude my remarks on S. 23 by renewing my call to my fellow \nSenators to carefully consider and support this legislation. The \nAmerica Invents Act is complicated and the subject matter may seem \ndaunting, but I believe it is critical to protecting American \ninnovation and defending American competitiveness.\n  The playing field for economic innovation has never been more \ncrowded. The United States faces rivals growing in strength and number, \nwhich is why our government should be encouraging innovation, not \nstifling it.\n  The America Invents Act will create jobs in Delaware and throughout \nthe United States by removing some of the administrative roadblocks \ncurrently preventing inventors from becoming successful entrepreneurs. \nThis bill will improve the speed, quality and reliability of the Patent \nand Trademark Office and it will ensure that America retains its place \nin the world as the leader of invention and innovative thinking.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 123\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up the Kirk-Pryor amendment No. 123.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do not \nintend to object, my understanding is the Senator from Illinois will \noffer his amendment and then will not object to his amendment then \nbeing set aside and we go back to the managers' amendment; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. KIRK. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I will not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Kirk], for himself and Mr. \n     Pryor, proposes an amendment numbered 123.\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide a fast lane for small businesses within the U.S. \n    Patent and Trademark Office to receive information and support \n                    regarding patent filing issues)\n\n       On page 104, between lines 22 and 23, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 18. PATENT OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM FOR SMALL BUSINESS \n                   CONCERNS.\n\n       Subject to available resources, the Director may establish \n     in the United States Patent and Trademark Office a Patent \n     Ombudsman Program. The duties of the Program's staff shall \n     include providing support and services relating to patent \n     filings to small business concerns.\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, the Kirk-Pryor amendment seeks to assist \nsome of our greatest innovators by providing a fast lane within the \nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office for small businesses to receive \ninformation and assistance regarding their patent applications.\n\n[[Page S1034]]\n\n  Small businesses are the economic engine of the American economy. \nAccording to the Small Business Administration, small businesses employ \njust over half of all private sector employees and create over 50 \npercent of our nonfarm GDP. Illinois alone is home to 258,000 small \nemployers and more than 885,000 self-employers.\n  Small businesses are helping to lead the way on American innovation. \nThese firms produce 13 times more patents per employee than large \npatenting firms, and their patents are twice as likely to be among the \nmost cited among all patents. Small business breakthroughs led to the \ndevelopment of airplanes, FM radio, and the personal computer. \nUnfortunately, the share of small-entity patents is declining, \naccording to a New York University researcher.\n  While S. 23 takes great strides in reforming our patent system, it \ncan still be daunting for a small business owner or inventor to obtain \na patent. In many instances, the value of a patent is what keeps that \nnew small business afloat.\n  It is vital for America's future competitiveness, her economic \ngrowth, and her job creation that these innovators spend their time \ndeveloping new products and processes that will build our future, not \nwading through government redtape. Our amendment would help small firms \nnavigate the bureaucracy by establishing the U.S. Patent and Trademark \nOffice Ombudsman Program to assist small businesses with their patent \nfiling issues. The provision was first conceived as part of the Small \nBusiness Bill of Rights, which I introduced in the House, to expand \nemployment and help small businesses grow. The Small Business Bill of \nRights and this amendment are endorsed by the National Federation of \nIndependent Business. I am proud to have this as part of a 10-point \nplan to be considered here in the Senate.\n  I wish to thank Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas, who is the lead \nDemocratic cosponsor of this amendment. He is a strong and consistent \nsupporter of small business, and I appreciate his partnership on this \nimportant program. I also thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member \nGrassley and their staffs for working with us on this amendment and for \npreserving this critical legislation.\n  Our Founding Fathers recognized the importance of a strong patent \nsystem that protects and incentivizes innovators. I look forward to \nsupporting S. 23, which will provide strong intellectual property \nrights to further our technological advancement.\n  In sum, we should help foster innovation by protecting innovators, \nespecially small business men and women, and I urge adoption of the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, it is a great privilege and honor for me \nto be able to represent the big, wonderful, diverse Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania in the Senate. Pennsylvania is a wonderful State. It has a \nterrific range of great attributes. It has big, bustling cities such as \nPhiladelphia and Pittsburgh at opposite ends; has all throughout the \nCommonwealth beautiful, historical boroughs such as Emmaus and \nGettysburg. We go from the banks of the Delaware all the way to the \nshores of Lake Erie.\n  In a State this big, of course, we have a wide range of very vital \nindustries. We have old industries that we have had for a long time and \nare still very important employers: agriculture, coal, steel, and many \nothers. We are a big manufacturing State, manufacturing goods of all \nkinds. We have a huge service sector, especially in the fields of \neducation, medicine, finance, tourism, and many others. We have some \nrelatively new and very exciting industries in our Commonwealth that I \nam very hopeful will lead to an acceleration of job growth soon. I am \nthinking in particular of the natural gas and the Marcellus shale. I am \nthinking of the life sciences, all across the Commonwealth, especially \nin greater Philadelphia and greater Pittsburgh as well as in points in \nbetween. The medical device sector and pharmaceutical industries are \noffering some of the most exciting opportunities for economic growth \nanywhere in the Commonwealth.\n  So when I think about the diversity and the strength of our \nCommonwealth, I am convinced that Pennsylvania's best days are ahead of \nus.\n  That said, despite all of the underlying strengths and advantages we \nhave, we have an economy that is struggling. We have job creation that \nis far too slow. As I said repeatedly throughout my campaign for the \nSenate seat and as I have said since then, I think there are two vital \npriorities that we need to focus on first and foremost here in \nWashington. The first is economic growth and the job creation that \ncomes with it, and the second is restoring fiscal discipline to a \ngovernment that has lost all sense of fiscal discipline. These two, of \ncourse, are closely related. We will never have the kind of job growth \nwe need and we deserve until we get our fiscal house in order.\n  But I look at them as separate issues. I think they should be at the \ntop of our priority list. I am absolutely convinced we can have \nterrific economic growth, terrific job growth. We can have the \nprosperity we have been looking for.\n  In fact, it is actually inevitable if the Federal Government follows \nthe right policies, remembering first and foremost that prosperity \ncomes from the private sector, it does not come from government itself, \nbut that government creates an environment in which the private sector \ncan thrive and create the jobs we so badly need. I would argue that the \ngovernment does that by doing four things and doing them well.\n  The first is to make sure we have a legal system that respects \nproperty rights, because the clear title and ownership and ability to \nuse private property is the cornerstone of a free enterprise system.\n  It requires, second, that the government establish sensible \nregulations that are not excessive, because excessive regulation--and \nfrankly we have seen a lot of excessive regulation recently--too much \nregulation always has unintended consequences that curb our ability to \ncreate the jobs we need.\n  A third thing a government always needs to do is provide a stable \ncurrency, sound money, because debasing one's currency is the way to \nruin, not the way to prosperity.\n  Fourth, governments need to live within their means. They cannot be \nspending too much money and they cannot have taxes at too high a level.\n  It is so important that government spending remain limited and, \nfrankly,\n\n[[Page S1035]]\n\nmuch less than we have today, for several reasons. One, of course, \ngovernment spending is the political allocation of capital rather than \nthe allocation of free people and a free economy. The political \nallocation is always less efficient than that of men and women engaging \nin free enterprise.\n  Secondly, the reason too much spending is problematic is because it \nultimately always has to be paid for with higher taxes. Higher taxes \nclearly impede economic growth and prevent job creation. They do that \nin many ways, not the least of which is diminishing the incentives to \nmake investments, to take risks, to launch new enterprises, to hire new \nworkers.\n  I would argue that of these four priorities, the government is not \ndoing such a great job. The failure is most egregious when it comes to \nthe level of spending that has recently developed in this town. The \nrecent surge in spending amounts to about a 25-percent increase in the \nsize of the government virtually overnight.\n  The government is now spending--this Federal Government alone--fully \n25 percent of our entire economic output. Frankly, this huge surge in \nspending has not worked. The unemployment rate has stayed near to 10 \npercent, our deficits are now over $1\\1/2\\ trillion in a single year. \nThat is more than 10 percent of our entire economy.\n  Of course, when you run annual deficits where you are spending more \nthan you bring in, that shortfall is made up for with new borrowings. \nSo we have been adding to our debt at what I think is an alarming pace. \nI would argue that this mounting debt is already today costing us job \ngrowth. It is costing us jobs because it creates a tremendous \nuncertainty in our economic future when we are not on a sustainable \nfiscal path. That uncertainty itself discourages entrepreneurs and job \ncreators from doing the kinds of things we need.\n  The risks are very real. History is replete with examples of \ncountries that have accumulated too much debt. Frankly, it never ends \nwell. Very often it leads to very high rates of inflation. It can lead \nto much higher interest rates, which can have a crippling effect on job \ngrowth. It can even lead to financial disruptions which can be very \nharmful, as we have recently seen.\n  With the recent acceleration in the size of our deficits and the \nincrease in our debts, we are now rapidly closing in on the statutory \nlimit to the amount of money that the Federal Government is permitted \nto borrow under law. That is an amount of over $14 trillion, but the \ntruth is we are rapidly closing in on that limit. We will get there \nfairly soon.\n  The administration has suggested that we ought to, here in Congress, \nvote to raise that limit with no conditions attached. I have to tell \nyou I think it is a very bad idea. This brings to mind the case of a \nfamily that is routinely living beyond their means. They routinely are \nspending more than their income and making up for the difference by \nrunning up to the limit on their credit cards. When this family reaches \nthe limit on all of the credit cards they have, who thinks it is a good \nidea to give them another credit card?\n  I think most folks in Pennsylvania think it is probably time to \nreexamine the spending and look at the real problem that has gotten the \nfamily in this situation. I think that is where we are as a government. \nI think we need to fundamentally reexamine the spending we have been \nengaged in.\n  I will say clearly, I think failure to raise the debt limit promptly \nupon reaching it is not optimal and it would be very disruptive. I hope \nthat does not come to pass. But I happen to think the most \nirresponsible thing we could do is simply raise this debt limit and run \nup even more debt without making changes to the problems that got us \ninto this fix.\n  Specifically what I think we need to do is have real cuts in \nspending--now, not later, not at some distant hypothetical point in \ntime in the future but now. That is one.\n  Second, I think we need real reform in the spending process, reform \nin the way Congress goes about its business, because the process is \npart of what has gotten us here.\n  I wish to see a balanced budget amendment, one with real teeth, one \nthat requires our books to be balanced, one that limits the total \nspending to a reasonable percentage of our economy, and one that makes \nit harder to raise taxes. I think that would be a very good \ndevelopment. But that will take several years, at best, if we can get \nthat implemented. Of course, all of the States have to agree.\n  In the meantime, I would hope we could have statutory spending caps, \nlimits to how much the Federal Government can spend, and a mechanism \nthat would redress the problem if for some reason we exceeded those \nlimits.\n  As we have had this debate over whether we should attach these \nconditions to raising the debt limit, some have suggested this is a \nvery dangerous discussion to have, because failure to immediately raise \nthe debt limit, some have suggested, amounts to a default on our \nTreasury securities, on the borrowings we have already incurred.\n  That is not true. I think it is irresponsible to suggest that. The \nfact is the ongoing revenue from taxes that will be collected whether \nor not we immediately raise the debt limit--the ongoing revenue is more \nthan 10 times all the money needed to stay current on our debt service. \nIn fact, in the last 20 years, there have been four occasions when we \nhave reached the debt limit without immediately raising it, and we \nnever defaulted on our debt. This country never will. So I do not think \nwe should have a discussion about something that is not going to \nhappen. But since some in the administration have raised the specter of \na default, I have introduced legislation that would clearly take that \nrisk off the table entirely. My bill is called the Full Faith and \nCredit Act. It simply says, in the event we reach the debt limit \nwithout having raised it, it instructs the Treasury to make sure the \ndebt service is the top priority. This guarantees that we would not \ndefault on our Treasuries, we would not create a financial crisis of \nany kind, and maybe, more importantly, it would be a great reassurance \nto the millions of Americans who have lent this government their money, \nthe millions of Americans who hold Treasury bonds in their IRAs, their \n401(k)s, their pension plans.\n  The retirees who live in Allentown, PA, who have lived modestly, \nsaved money, and with their retirement savings have invested in the \nU.S. Treasury, I think those folks deserve the peace of mind of knowing \nthat the first priority is going to make sure we honor the obligations \nand stay current on our debts.\n  I want to take a moment to thank Senator Vitter, because yesterday he \ncame down to the floor and introduced my legislation as an amendment to \nthe current patent reform bill. I hope we will be able to soon pass my \namendment. I hope we will soon get to a vote here on the Senate floor. \nThe real reason is, I want to remove this false specter of a default on \nour debt, so we can have an honest debate over how we are going to get \nspending under control--what kind of spending cuts we are going to have \nright now, and what kind of reforms we are going to make to the process \ngoing forward.\n  I do not think we can kick this can down the road anymore. We have \nbeen doing that for a long time. As I said earlier, it never ends well \nwhen governments continue taking on too much debt. Nobody here that I \nknow wants to see a government shutdown. Nobody wants to see the \ndisruption that would come from failing to raise the debt limit at some \npoint. But nor can we proceed with business as usual.\n  All across Pennsylvania I hear every day when I am back home how \nimportant it is that this government learn to live within its means as \nPennsylvania businesses and families have done.\n  Let me close by saying I still remain absolutely convinced we can \nhave a terrific economic recovery. We can have a booming economic \ngrowth and the tremendous job creation that goes with it. It is \noverdue, but it can still arrive if we pass the kind of policies that \ncreate the right environment.\n  I am convinced the 21st century will be another great American \ncentury and Pennsylvania will be at the forefront.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to extend my congratulations to \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania for his initial speech, including his \ncomments about his important amendment, which is actually pending to \nthe patent bill\n\n[[Page S1036]]\n\nwhich hopefully we will have an opportunity to vote on in the very near \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am soon going to ask for a vote on the \nLeahy-Grassley-Kyl managers' amendment. It resolves a number of issues \nin the bill, including fee diversion and business method patents \ndamages, venue issues. Senators Coburn, Schumer, Bennet, Whitehouse, \nCoons, and others worked with us on those issues. I would like to vote \non that and then go to the amendment offered yesterday by Senator \nBennet on satellite patent offices, with a modification, as well as the \nmodified amendment offered by Senator Kirk and Senator Pryor on \nombudsman. If we can do that, we can get much of this finished. But \nwhile I am waiting for the--just so everybody will know, I am going to \nask for a vote on that very soon. But I am waiting for the ranking \nmember to come back.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Minnesota, and I yield to \nher.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, first, I commend Chairman Leahy and the \nentire Judiciary Committee for their work on this bill. The chairman \nhas endured so many ups and downs and different versions, and we would \nnot be here today if not for him.\n  I rise to speak in support of the America Invents Act, a bill to \noverhaul our patent system, which plays such a critical role in our \neconomy. It is one of the main reasons America has been able to \nmaintain its competitive edge.\n  The Commerce Department estimates that up to 75 percent of the \neconomic growth in our Nation since World War II is due to \ntechnological innovation--innovation made possible by a patent system \nthat protects the rights to that innovation.\n  I have seen the importance and success of the patent system firsthand \nin Minnesota, which has brought the world everything from the pacemaker \nto the Post-it note. In Minnesota, we know how important the patent \nsystem is to our economy. We rank sixth in the Nation in patents per \ncapita and have the second highest number of medical device patents \nover the last 5 years. Companies such as 3M, Ecolab, and Medtronic are \nwell-known leaders in innovation, but Minnesota also supports \ninnovative small businesses such as NVE Corporation and Arizant \nHealthcare. We are now first per capita, in fact, for Fortune 500 \ncompanies in our State, and that is in large part because of \ninnovation. So many of these companies started small, invented \nproducts, and got patents which were protected. People weren't copying \ntheir products, and they were able to grow and produce jobs in our \ncountry.\n  Having a patent system that works for small business is particularly \ncritical to creating jobs in America. But our patent laws haven't had a \nmajor update since 1952. The system is outdated and has become a burden \non our innovators and entrepreneurs. Because of these outdated laws, \nthe Patent and Trademark Office faces a backlog of over 700,000 patent \napplications and too often issues low-quality patents. One of these \n700,000 patents may be the next implantable pacemaker or new therapy \nfor fighting cancer, but it just sits in that backlog.\n  Our current system also seems stacked against small entrepreneurs. I \nhave spoken to small business owners and entrepreneurs across our State \nof Minnesota who are concerned with the high cost and uncertainty of \nprotecting their inventions. For example, under the current system, \nwhen two patents are filed around the same time for the same invention, \nthe applicants must go through an arduous and expensive process called \nan interference to determine which applicant will be awarded the \npatent. Small inventors rarely, if ever, win interference proceedings \nbecause the rules for interference are often stacked in favor of \ncompanies with deep pockets. This needs to change.\n  Our current patent system also ignores the realities of the \ninformation age in which we live.\n  In 1952, back when the patent bill came about, the world wasn't as \ninterconnected as it is today. There was no Internet. People didn't \nshare information the way they do in this modern age. They had party \ntelephone lines then. In 1952, most publicly available information \nabout technology could be found in either patents or scientific \npublications. So patent examiners only had to look to a few sources to \ndetermine if the technology described in a patent application was both \nnovel and nonobvious.\n  Today, as we all know, there is a vast amount of information readily \navailable everywhere you look.\n  It is unrealistic to believe a patent examiner would know all of the \nplaces to look for this information, and even if the examiner knew \nwhere to look, it is unlikely he or she would have the time to search \nall of these nooks and crannies. The people who know where to look are \nthe other scientists and innovators who also work in the field. But \ncurrent law doesn't allow participation by third parties in the patent \napplication process despite the fact that third parties are often in \nthe best position to challenge a patent application. Without the \nbenefit of this outside expertise, an examiner might grant a patent for \ntechnology that simply isn't a true invention--it is simply not an \nactual invention--and these low-quality patents clog the system and \nhinder true innovation.\n  Our Nation can't afford to slow innovation anymore. While China is \ninvesting billions in its medical technology sector, we are still \nbickering about regulations. While India encourages invention and \nentrepreneurship, we are still giving our innovators the runaround, \nplaying a game of red light/green light with the R tax credit.\n  America can no longer afford to be a country that churns money and \nshuffles paper, a country that consumes, imports, and spends its way \nthrough huge trade deficits. We need to be a nation that makes things \nagain, that invents stuff, that exports to the world, a country where \nyou can walk into any store on any street in any neighborhood, purchase \nthe best goods, and be able to turn it over and see the words ``Made in \nthe USA.''\n  In the words of New York Times columnist and Minnesota native Tom \nFriedman, we need to be focusing on ``nation building in our own \nNation.'' Well, as innovators and entrepreneurs across Minnesota have \ntold me, our country needs to spawn more of them. The America Invents \nAct would do just that.\n  First, the American Invents Act increases the speed and certainty of \nthe patent application process by transitioning our patent system from \na first-to-invent system to a first-inventor-to-file system. This \nchange to a first-inventor-to-file system will increase predictability \nby creating brighter lines to guide patent applicants and Patent Office \nexaminers. By simply using the filing date of an application to \ndetermine the true inventor, the bill increases the speed of the patent \napplication process, while rewarding novel, cutting-edge innovations.\n  To help guide investors and inventors, this bill allows them to \nsearch the public record to discover with more certainty whether their \nidea is patentable, helping eliminate duplication and streamlining the \nsystem. At the same time, the bill still provides a safe harbor of a \nyear for inventors to go out and market their inventions before having \nto file for their patents. This grace period is one of the reasons our \nNation's top research universities, such as the University of \nMinnesota, support this bill. The grace period protects professors who \ndiscuss their inventions with colleagues or publish them in journals \nbefore filing their patent application. The grace period will encourage \ncross-pollination of ideas and eliminate concerns about discussing \ninventions with others before a patent application is actually filed.\n  Moreover, this legislation helps to ensure that only true inventions \nreceive protection under our laws. By allowing third parties to provide \ninformation to the patent examiner, the America Invents Act helps \nbridge the information gap between the patent application and existing \nknowledge.\n  The legislation also provides a modernized, streamlined mechanism for \nthird parties who want to challenge recently issued, low-quality \npatents that\n\n[[Page S1037]]\n\nshould never have been issued in the first place. Eliminating these \npotentially trivial patents will help the entire patent system by \nimproving certainty for both users and inventors.\n  The legislation will also improve the patent system by granting the \nU.S. Patent and Trademark Office the authority to set and adjust its \nown fees. Allowing the Office to set its own fees will give it the \nresources to reduce the current backlog and devote greater resources to \neach patent that is reviewed to ensure higher quality patents.\n  The fee-setting authority is why IBM, one of the most innovative \ncompanies around--by the way, the host of the ``Jeopardy''-winning \nWatson--well, the IBM facility there that actually developed Watson was \nin Rochester, MN. In fact, IBM, which has its facilities in Rochester \nand the Twin Cities, as well as many other places in this country, was \ngranted a record 5,896 patents in 2010. IBM supports this bill. It \nallows the Patent Office to set its own fees and run itself like a \nbusiness, and that is good for companies such as IBM, as well as for \nsmall entrepreneurs.\n  Mr. President, as chair of the Subcommittee on Competitiveness, \nInnovation, and Export Promotion, I have been focused on ways to \npromote innovation and growth in the 21st century. Stakeholders from \nacross the spectrum agree that this bill is a necessary step to ensure \nthat the United States remains a world leader in developing innovative \nproducts that bring prosperity and happiness to those in our country. \nGlobalization and technological advancement have changed our economy. \nThis legislation will ensure that our patent system truly rewards \ninnovation in the 21st century. Our patent system has to be as \nsophisticated as those who are inventing these products and those who \nat times are trying to steal their ideas. That is what this is about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 121, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

BUDGETARY EFFECTS.\n\n       The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of \n     complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of 2010, shall \n     be determined by reference to the latest statement titled \n     ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act, \n     submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the \n     Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, provided that such \n     statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are prepared to go to a rollcall vote on \nthis right now. I don't see the ranking member. As a courtesy, I am \nwilling to wait a few more minutes before calling for the vote. While \nwe are waiting for my friend, the distinguished Senator from Iowa, I \nwill note that what we are talking about is bipartisan legislation; it \nis supported by both business and labor.\n  People ask whether Congress can work together and whether, with all \nthe problems facing America, Republicans and Democrats can come \ntogether to get work done, make things work, and do things that can \nmake America stronger and more competitive in the world. This is a bill \nthat does that. That is why we have a broad group of cosponsors in both \nparties across the political spectrum. It enables us to actually do \nsomething.\n  We have a decades-old patent system, which may have made sense in the \ntime when you had patents that might not be superseded by new \ninventions for years. Now they can be superseded the day they come in. \nThat is why we have 700,000 patents applications waiting to be \nprocessed. It is also why countries such as China and others are \nbeginning to surpass us in their innovation, because we have been slow \nto catch up. We are in a situation where we are unable to compete with \nthe rest of the industrialized nations. Their patent laws are ahead of \nours. So this is a case where we in America have a chance to catch up. \nWe do it without adding a cent to the deficit, but we also create jobs. \nEvery major manufacturer in this country and inventors have said this \nis where we will create jobs.\n  I look at it, of course, with the point of view that my little State \nof Vermont on a per capita basis has more patents than any other State. \nWe even had more than some States larger than ours. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer comes from a State that has spent a great deal of \ntime and effort on innovation and is one of the leaders in the number \nof patents, especially in the high-tech area, in this country. But the \npatents don't help us compete unless we are able to move with them. We \nin Vermont have a long history of innovation and invention. The first \npatent in the United States was signed by George Washington after being \ncleared by Thomas Jefferson and granted to a Vermonter.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an issue that is very \nimportant to me. The immediate subject I am going to address is an \namendment I am going to propose to our pending patent reform \nlegislation. This amendment calls upon the Senate to get the sense of \nthe Senate that we need a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution.\n  As I prepared for this day, I reviewed the maiden speeches of a \nnumber of Senators who served in this august body, and I have seen a \nconsistent theme in the speeches that have been given over the course \nof the last 50 or 60 years. Over and over, they address spending. These \nissues have spilled over, Congress after Congress, until the point we \nhave reached today, the point at which our national debt stands at an \nastounding figure, close to $15 trillion.\n  As I like to say, $15 trillion is a lot of money. A lot of people do \nnot make $15 trillion in a whole year. Even when you divide $15 \ntrillion by 300 million Americans, you are left with a figure of about \n$50,000 a head. This is not an inconsequential number.\n  This is not a problem any of us created. It is a problem each of us \ninherited. Yet it is a problem I think none of us wants to leave to our \nsuccessors. It is a problem that requires us to do something different \nthan we have done in the past, and by this I mean I think we need \nprocedural, structural, and indeed constitutional reform. We need to \nput Congress in a straitjacket because we have been unwilling or unable \nin the past to make the difficult spending decisions that have to be \nmade.\n  In the past, there has been a great debate between, on the one hand, \nsome Republicans who have been unwilling to cut some programs, to \nconsider in any context cuts in the area of, say, national defense; you \nhave had others, perhaps from the other party, who have been unwilling \nto consider any cuts to any entitlement program. But we are now faced \nwith a scenario in which both sides of the aisle can understand that \nour perpetual deficit spending habit places in jeopardy every single \naspect of the operations of the Federal Government.\n  To paint one scenario, I would like to point out that the budget \nprojections produced by the White House just a couple weeks ago \npredicted, based on a fairly optimistic set of projections, that over \nthe next 10 years we will acquire enough new debt that, when added to \nour existing debt, will cause us to be spending almost $1 trillion \nevery single year just on interest on our national debt. To put that in \nperspective, $1 trillion is more than we currently spend on Social \nSecurity in an entire year. It is more than we currently spend on \nMedicare and Medicaid combined in an entire year. It is significantly \nmore than we spend on national defense in any year. This $1 trillion \nnumber is one that could actually be much larger if some of these \nprojections turn out not to be correct.\n  We now face a moment when both liberals and conservatives, \nRepublicans and Democrats, regardless of what they most want to protect \nin their Federal Government, have to realize that what we most want to \nprotect is placed in grave jeopardy by our current spending practices.\n  I am troubled by the fact that as we approach debate surrounding a \ncontinuing resolution this week, a continuing resolution that is likely \nto operate for just a few weeks to keep the Government funded, we are \nstill talking about adding, on an annualized basis, to our national \ndebt at a rate exceeding $1.5 trillion a year. I think the American \npeople deserve better. I know they demand better.\n  Some of the things we saw in the 2010 election cycle portend \nsomething much greater for what we are going to see in the 2012 \nelection cycle. The polls support the fact that what we can see from \nthe 2010 election cycle is that Americans want Congress to balance its \nbudget. They want us to do something more than just talking about it. \nThey want us to put ourselves in a straitjacket.\n\n[[Page S1040]]\n\n  Benjamin Franklin used to say: He will cheat without scruple who can \nwithout fear. I think the congressional corollary to that might be that \nCongress, which can continue to engage in perpetual deficit spending, \nwill continue to do so unless or until they are held accountable by the \npeople or required by that Congress to put itself in a straightjacket. \nThat is the straightjacket we need. That is why I am proposing this \namendment so, at a minimum, before this patent reform legislation, \nwhich I support wholeheartedly, moves forward, we can all agree as \nMembers of this body that we need a constitutional amendment to keep us \nfrom doing what is slowly killing the economy of the United States and \ngradually mounting a severe challenge, an existential threat to every \nFederal program that currently exists.\n  I invite each of my colleagues to vote for and support this amendment \nand to support S.J. Res. 5, a constitutional amendment I have proposed \nthat would put Congress in this type of straitjacket.\n  Here is, in essence, what S.J. Res. 5 says: If adopted by Congress by \nthe requisite two-thirds margins in both Houses and approved by the \nStates, three-fourths of them as required by article V of the \nConstitution, it would tell Congress it may not spend more than it \nreceives in a given year, it may not spend more than 18 percent of GDP \nin a year, it may not raise taxes, and it may not raise the national \ndebt ceiling without a two-thirds supermajority vote in both Houses of \nCongress. That is the kind of permanent binding constitutional measure \nI think we need in order to protect the government programs we value so \nhighly and upon which 300 million Americans have come to depend, in one \nway or another.\n  I urge each of my colleagues to support this amendment and to support \nS.J. Res. 5.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Patent Reform \nAct of 2011, which I understand will be retitled as the ``America \nInvents Act.''\n  When this bill was marked up in the Judiciary Committee in 2007 and \nagain in 2009, I voted against it, and I submitted minority views to \nthe committee report for the bill. In the 2009 committee report, \nSenators Russ Feingold and Tom Coburn joined me in identifying a set of \nissues that we felt needed to be addressed before the bill was ready \nfor consideration by the full Senate. Chief among these were concerns \nabout the bill's system of postissuance administrative review of \npatents. Senior career staff at the Patent Office had expressed deep \nmisgivings about the office's ability to administer this system. In \nresponse, at the conclusion of the 2009 mark up, Chairman Leahy pledged \nto invite the Patent Office to work with the committee to address these \nconcerns and to try to develop a system that the office would be able \nto administer.\n  Chairman Leahy carried through on his pledge and held those meetings \nlater that year. As a result, important changes were made to the bill, \neventually resulting in a managers' amendment that was announced in \n2010 by Chairman Leahy and then-Ranking Member Sessions. The 2010 \nmanagers' amendment, which is also the basis of the present bill, \nsubstantially addressed all of the concerns that Senators Feingold and \nCoburn and I raised in the 2009 Minority Report. As a result, I became \na cosponsor of that amendment, and am proud to cosponsor and support \nthe bill that is before us today.\n  I will take a few moments today to describe the key changes that led \nto the 2010 breakthrough on this bill. But first, I would like to \naddress an important aspect of the bill that has recently become the \nsubject of some controversy. This is the bill's change to a first-\ninventor-to-file patent system.\n  About two-thirds of the present bill has never been controversial and \nhas been included in all of the various iterations of this bill ever \nsince the first patent reform act was introduced in 2005 by Mr. Lamar \nSmith, who was then the chairman of the House Intellectual Property \nSubcommittee. Mr. Smith's 2005 bill, H.R. 2795, included the following \nproposals: it switched the United States from a first-to-invent patent \nsystem to a first-inventor-to-file system. The Smith bill enacted \nchapter 32 of title 35, creating a first-window, post-grant opposition \nprocedure. It authorized third parties to submit and explain relevant \nprior art to the Patent Office with respect to an application before a \npatent is issued. The Smith bill amended the inventor's oath, and \nexpanded the rights of assignees to prosecute a patent application \nunder section 118. And it also eliminated subjective elements from the \npatent code, and included the first proposal for creating derivation \nproceedings. All of these elements of Mr. Smith's original 2005 bill \nare retained in the bill that is before us today, and are, in fact, the \nmost important parts of the bill. And, until recently, these provisions \nhad not proven controversial.\n  After the announcement of the 2010 managers' amendment, however, \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee began to hear more from critics of \nthe bill's move to a first-to-file system. Under current law's first-\nto-invent system, a patent applicant or owner has priority against \nother patents or applications, or against invalidating prior art, if he \nconceived of his invention before the other inventor conceived of his \ninvention or before the prior art was disclosed. Under the first-to-\nfile system, by contrast, the same priority is determined by when the \napplication for patent was filed. Whichever inventor files first has \npriority, and third-party prior art is measured against the filing \ndate, and is invalidating if it disclosed the invention before the date \nwhen the application was filed, rather than the date when the invention \nwas conceived.\n  In commentary that was published on Sunday, February 27, Mr. Gene \nQuinn, the writer of the IP Watchdog Web site, made some worthy points \nabout the present bill's proposed move to a first-to-file system. \nResponding to critics of first to file, Mr. Quinn first noted that: in \npractical effect, we already have a first inventor to file system. For \nexample, since the start of fiscal year 2005 on October 1, 2004, there \nhave been over 2.9 million patent applications filed and only 502 \nInterferences decided. An Interference Proceeding occurs when multiple \ninventors file an application claiming the same invention, and is the \nhallmark of a first to invent system . . . . On top of the paltry 502 \nInterferences over nearly 7 years, a grand total of 1 independent \ninventor managed to demonstrate they were the first to invent, and a \ngrand total of 35 small entities were even involved in an Interference.\n  In other words, as Mr. Quinn notes, although the first-to-invent \nsystem is supposed to help the little guy, over the last seven years, \nonly one independent inventor has managed to win an interference \ncontest and secure the benefits of the first to invent system. And \nagain, this is out of nearly 3 million patent applications filed over \nthis period.\n  Mr. Quinn's comments also debunk the notion that an interference \nproceeding is a viable means of securing first-to-invent rights for \nindependent and other small inventors. He notes that:\n\n       On top of this, the independent inventors and small \n     entities, those typically viewed as benefiting from the \n     current first to invent system, realistically could never \n     benefit from such a system. To prevail as the first to invent \n     and second to file, you must prevail in an Interference \n     proceeding, and according to 2005 data from the AIPLA, the \n     average cost through an interference is over $600,000. So \n     let's not kid ourselves, the first to invent system cannot be \n     used by independent inventors in any real, logical or \n     intellectually honest way, as supported by the reality of the \n     numbers above. . . . [F]irst to invent is largely a ``feel \n     good'' approach to patents where the underdog at least has a \n     chance, if they happen to have $600,000 in disposable income \n     to invest on the crap-shoot that is an Interference \n     proceeding.\n\n  Obviously, the parties that are likely to take advantage of a system \nthat costs more than half a million dollars to utilize are not likely \nto be small and independent inventors. Indeed, it is typically major \ncorporations that invoke and prevail in interference proceedings. The \nvery cost of the proceeding alone effectively ensures that\n\n[[Page S1041]]\n\nit is these larger parties that benefit from this system. In many \ncases, small inventors such as start ups and universities simply cannot \nafford to participate in an interference, and they surrender their \nrights once a well-funded party starts such a proceeding.\n  Mr. Quinn's article also responded to critics who allege that the \npresent bill eliminates the grace period for patent applications. The \ngrace period is the one-year period prior to filing when the inventor \nmay disclose his invention without giving up his right to patent. Mr. \nQuinn quotes the very language of this bill, and draws the obvious \nconclusion:\n\n       Regardless of the disinformation that is widespread, the \n     currently proposed S. 23 does, in fact, have a grace period. \n     The grace period would be quite different than what we have \n     now and would not extend to all third party activities, but \n     many of the horror stories say that if someone learns of your \n     invention from you and beats you to the Patent Office, they \n     will get the patent. That is simply flat wrong.\n\n  Mr. Quinn is, of course, referring to the bill's proposed section \n102(b). Under paragraph (1)(A) of that section, disclosures made by the \ninventor, or someone who got the information from the inventor, less \nthan 1 year before the application is filed do not count as prior art. \nAnd under paragraph (1)(B), during the 1-year period before the \napplication is filed, if the inventor publicly discloses his invention, \nno subsequently disclosed prior art, regardless of whether it is \nderived from the inventor, can count as prior art and invalidate the \npatent. This effectively creates a ``first to publish'' rule that \nprotects those inventors who choose to disclose their invention. An \ninventor who publishes his invention, or discloses it at a trade show \nor academic conference, or otherwise makes it publicly available, has \nan absolute right to priority if he files an application within one \nyear of his disclosure. No application effectively filed after his \ndisclosure, and no prior art disclosed after his disclosure, can defeat \nhis application for patent.\n  These rules are highly protective of inventors, especially those who \nshare their inventions with the interested public but still file a \npatent application within a year. These rules are also clear, \nobjective, and transparent. They create unambiguous guidelines for \ninventors. An inventor who wishes to keep his invention secret must \nfile an application promptly, before another person discloses the \ninvention to the public. And an inventor can also share his invention \nwith others. If his activities make the invention publicly available, \nhe must file an application within a year, but his disclosures also \nprevents any subsequently disclosed prior art from taking away his \nright to patent. The bill's proposed section 102 also creates clear \nguidelines for those who practice in a technology. To figure out if a \npatent is valid against prior art, all that a manufacturer needs to do \nis look at the patent's filing date and figure out whether the inventor \npublicly disclosed the invention. If prior art disclosed the invention \nto the public before the filing date, or if the inventor disclosed the \ninvention within a year of filing but the prior art predates that \ndisclosure, then the invention is invalid. And if not, the patent is \nvalid against a prior-art challenge.\n  Some critics of the first-to-file system also argue that it will be \nexpensive for inventors because they will be forced to rush to file a \ncompleted application, rather than being able to rely on their \ninvention date and take their time to complete an application. These \ncritics generally ignore the possibility of filing a provisional \napplication, which requires only a written description of the invention \nand how to make it. Once a provisional application is filed, the \ninventor has a year to file a completed application. Currently, filing \na provisional application costs $220 for a large entity, and $110 for a \nsmall entity.\n  One of Mr. Quinn's earlier columns, on November 7, 2009, effectively \nrebuts the notion that relying on invention dates offers inventors any \nsubstantial advantage over simply filing a provisional application. As \nhe notes:\n\n       If you rely on first to invent and are operating at all \n     responsibly you are keeping an invention notebook that will \n     meet evidentiary burdens if and when it is neces-\n     sary to demonstrate conception prior to the conception of the \n     party who was first to file. . . .\n       [Y]our invention notebook or invention record will detail, \n     describe, identify and date conception so that others skilled \n     in the art will be able to look at the notebook/record and \n     understand what you did, what you knew, and come to the \n     believe that you did in fact appreciate what you had. If you \n     have this, you have provable conception. If you have provable \n     and identifiable conception, you also have a disclosure that \n     informs and supports the invention. . . . [And] [i]f the \n     notebook provably demonstrates conception, then it can be \n     filed as a provisional patent application at least for the \n     purpose of staking a claim to the conception that is detailed \n     with enough specificity to later support an argument in a \n     first to invent regime.\n\n  In other words, the showing that an inventor must make in a \nprovisional application is effectively the same showing that he would \nhave to make to prove his invention date under the first-to-invent \nsystem. A small inventor operating under first-to-invent rules already \nmust keep independently-validated notebooks that show when he conceived \nof his invention. Under first-to-file rules, the only additional steps \nthat the same inventor must take are writing down the same things that \nhis notebooks are supposed to prove filing that writing with the Patent \nOffice, and paying a $110 fee.\n  Once the possibility of filing a provisional application is \nconsidered, along with this bill's enhanced grace period, it should be \nclear that the first-to-file system will not be at all onerous for \nsmall inventors. And once one considers the bill's clean, clear rules \nfor prior art and priority dates, its elimination of subjective \nelements in patent law, its new proceeding to correct patents, and its \nelimination of current patent-forfeiture pitfalls that trap legally \nunwary inventors, it is clear that this bill will benefit inventors \nboth large and small.\n  Allow me to also take a moment to briefly describe the concerns that \nSenators Feingold and Coburn and I raised in our 2009 Minority Report, \nand how the present bill addresses those concerns.\n  Senators Feingold and Coburn and I proposed that the bill impose a \nhigher threshold showing for instituting an inter partes, or post-grant \nreview. This had long been a top priority for the Patent Office, both \nunder the previous administration and under the current one. The Patent \nOffice made clear that a higher threshold is necessary to weed out \nmarginal challenges and preserve the office's own resources, and that a \nhigher threshold would also force parties to front-load their cases, \nallowing these proceedings to be resolved more quickly. The present \nbill imposes higher thresholds, requiring a reasonable likelihood of \ninvalidity for inter partes review, and more-likely-than-not invalidity \nfor post-grant review.\n  Senators Feingold and Coburn and I also recommended that the Patent \nOffice be allowed to operate inter partes reexamination as an \nadjudicative proceeding, where the burden of proof is on the challenger \nand the office simply decides whether the challenger has met his \nburden. The present bill makes this change, repealing requirements that \ninter partes be run on an examinational model and allowing the PTO to \nadopt an adjudicative model.\n  The 2009 Minority Report also recommended that the bill restrict \nserial administrative challenges to patents and require coordination of \nthese proceedings with litigation. We also called for limiting use of \nex parte reexamination to patent owners, noting that allowing three \ndifferent avenues for administrative attack on patents invites serial \nchallenges. The present bill does coordinate inter partes and post-\ngrant review with litigation, barring use of these proceedings if the \nchallenger seeks a declaratory judgment that a patent is invalid, and \nsetting a time limit for seeking inter partes review if the petitioner \nor related parties is sued for infringement of the patent. The present \nbill does not, however, bar the use of ex parte reexamination by third \nparties. The Patent Office and others persuaded me that these \nproceedings operate reasonably well in most cases and are not an undue \nburden on patent owners. The present bill does, however, impose limits \non serial challenges that will also restrict the use of ex parte \nreexamination. The bill's enhanced administrative estoppel will \neffectively bar a third party or related parties from invoking ex parte \nreexamination against a patent if that third party has already employed \npost-grant or inter partes review against that patent.\n\n[[Page S1042]]\n\nAlso, the bill allows the Patent Office to reject any request for a \nproceeding, including a request for ex parte reexamination, if the same \nor substantially the same prior art or arguments previously were \npresented to the Office with respect to that patent.\n  Senators Feingold and Coburn and I also recommended that the PTO be \nallowed to delay implementation of post-grant review if the office \nlacks the resources to implement that new proceeding. The present bill \nincludes a number of safeguards that are the product of discussions \nwith the PTO. Among other things, the present bill authorizes a ramp-up \nperiod, allowing the office to limit the number of proceedings that can \nbe implemented during the first 4 years after the new proceeding \nbecomes effective.\n  The 2009 Minority Report also recommended that treble damages be \npreserved as a meaningful deterrent to willful or calculated \ninfringement of a patent. The present bill does so, eliminating the \nrestrictive three-buckets approach and broad safe harbors that appeared \nin the bill in 2009. The report also recommended that the bill remove \nsubjective elements from patent law, such as the various deceptive-\nintent elements throughout the code and the patent-forfeiture \ndoctrines. The present bill effectively makes both changes. In fact, \nthe 2007 bill had already been modified in mark up to eliminate the \npatent forfeiture doctrines, a point elucidated in that year's \ncommittee report and confirmed by a review of the relevant caselaw.\n  This last point should also help address a question that Mr. Quinn \nraised in his column on Sunday regarding proposed section 102(b)'s use \nof the word ``disclosure,'' and whether it covers public use or sale \nactivities of the inventor. I would have thought that the meaning of \nthe word would be clear: a disclosure is something that makes the \ninvention available to the public--the same test applied by section \n102(a) to define the scope of relevant prior art. And ``available to \nthe public'' means the same thing that ``publicly accessible'' does in \nthe context of a publication. Subject matter makes an invention \npublicly accessible or available if an interested person who is skilled \nin the field could, through reasonable diligence, find the subject \nmatter and understand the invention from it. Obviously, Congress would \nnot create a grace period that is narrower in scope than the relevant \nprior art. Thus for example, under this bill, any activity by the \ninventor that would constitute prior art under section 102(a)(1) would \nalso invoke the grace period under section 102(b)(1). As a result, the \ninventor would be protected against his own activities so long as he \nfiles within a year, and under the bill's ``first to publish'' \nprovisions, he would also be protected by any other person's disclosure \nof the invention, regardless of whether he could prove that the other \nperson derived the invention from him.\n  The present bill is the product of almost a decade of hard work, \nincluding three Judiciary Committee mark ups, and the untold hours of \nwork by Mr. Smith and other members of the House of Representatives \nthat led to the introduction of the Patent Reform Act of 2005, the \nfoundation of today's bill. This is a bill that will protect our \nheritage of innovation while updating the patent system for the current \ncentury. It will fix problems with current administrative proceedings, \ncreate new means for improving patent quality, and will generally move \nus toward a patent system that is objective, transparent, clear, and \nfair to all parties. I look forward to the Senate's passage of this \nbill and its enactment into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Gene Quinn's columns of February 27, \n2011, and November 7, 2009, with corrections of a few typos and \nenhancements of punctuation, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senate To Vote on Patent Reform, First To File Fight Looms\n\n(By Gene Quinn, President & Founder of IPWatchdog, Inc., Feb. 27, 2011)\n\n       It appears as if the time has finally arrived for an up or \n     down vote on patent reform in the United States Senate. It \n     has been widely reported that the full Senate will take up \n     patent reform upon returning from recess this week, and it is \n     now believed by many on the inside that the Senate will take \n     up patent reform on Monday, February 28, 2011, the first day \n     back. Some are even anticipating that the Senate will vote on \n     patent reform bill S. 23 late in the day on Monday, February \n     28, 2011. See ``Crunch Time: Call Your Senators on Patent \n     Reform.'' That would seem exceptionally quick, particularly \n     given the rancorous issues and Amendments still to be \n     presented, but nothing will surprise me.\n       As we get closer to a vote in the Senate the rhetoric of \n     those for and against patent reform is heating up to a fever \n     pitch. The big fight, once again, is over first to file, with \n     battle lines drawn that run extremely deep. Senator Diane \n     Feinstein (D-CA) is expected to file an Amendment stripping \n     the first to file provisions, which could be supported by \n     Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV).\n       Before tackling the first to file issue I would like to \n     point out that regardless of whether first to file is \n     supported or opposed, everyone, and I do mean everyone, \n     unanimously agrees that the USPTO should be allowed to keep \n     the fees it collects to reinvest in the agency and to do the \n     work promised. An overwhelming majority also seem to support \n     giving the USPTO fee setting authority. Fee setting authority \n     is present in S. 23 (see Section 9) and Senator Tom Coburn \n     plans to introduce an Amendment that would once and for all \n     eliminate fee diversion and let the USPTO keep the fees it \n     collects. So while there is argument about first to file, \n     hopefully we won't lose sight of the fact that most everyone \n     is on the same team relating to fixing the USPTO.\n       With respect to first to file, in practical effect, we \n     already have a first inventor to file system. For example, \n     since the start of fiscal year 2005 on October 1, 2004, there \n     have been over 2.9 million patent applications filed and only \n     502 Interferences decided. An Interference Proceeding occurs \n     when multiple inventors file an application claiming the same \n     invention, and is the hallmark of a first to invent system \n     because it is possible in the United States to file a patent \n     application second and then be awarded the patent if the \n     second to file can demonstrate they were the first to invent. \n     On top of the paltry 502 Interferences over nearly 7 years a \n     grand total of 1 independent inventor managed to demonstrate \n     they were the first to invent, and a grand total of 35 small \n     entities were even involved in an Interference. A small \n     entity can be an independent inventor, university, non-profit \n     or a company with 500 or fewer employees. Thus, we have a de \n     facto first to file system and the ``first to invent'' system \n     that supposedly favors independent inventors is \n     overwhelmingly dominated by large companies with over 500 \n     employees. See chart below.\n\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      2005         2006         2007         2008         2009         2010        2011*        Total\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFilings.........................................       381797       417453       468330       496886       486499       509367       153997      2914329\nAllowances......................................       151077       162509       184376       182556       190122       233127        93390      1197157\nInterferences decided...........................           96          107           95           74           63           50           17          502\nJunior party winners............................           18           15           21           25           14           17            3          113\nSmall entity winners............................            7            2            3            6            1            5            1           25\nIndependent Inventor winners....................            0            0            1            0            0            0            0            1\nSmall Entity losers.............................            1            2            2            2            1            2            0           10\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       On top of this, the independent inventors and small \n     entities, those typically viewed as benefiting from the \n     current first to invent system, realistically could never \n     benefit from such a system. To prevail as the first to invent \n     and second to file you must prevail in an Interference \n     proceeding, and according to 2005 data from the AIPLA the \n     average cost through an interference is over $600,000. So \n     let's not kid ourselves, the first to invent system cannot be \n     used by independent inventors in any real, logical or \n     intellectually honest way, as supported by the reality of \n     the numbers above. So first to invent is largely a ``feel \n     good'' approach to patents where the underdog at least has \n     a chance, if they happen to have $600,000 in disposable \n     income to invest on the crap-shoot that is an Interference \n     proceeding.\n       I will acknowledge, however, that one of the best arguments \n     I have seen against first to file was prepared by Hank \n     Nothhaft, President & CEO of Tessera and a frequent \n     contributor to IPWatchdog.com. In his op-ed in The Hill Hank \n     concludes by asking: ``Why risk that by weakening the \n     incentives for startups?'' As I can point to the fact that we \n     have a de facto first to file system already, Hank and others \n     can say--so why the need for change? I readily acknowledge \n     that the small ``c'' conservative thing to do, which I \n     normally promote, would be to do nothing\n\n[[Page S1043]]\n\n     and keep the status quo. That is a fine argument, but it \n     would keep the USPTO devoting precious resources on a complex \n     Interference system that really mirrors a first to file \n     system anyway. Of course, if patent reform gives the USPTO \n     fee setting authority and an end to fee diversion, then the \n     resources problem isn't nearly the concern and Congress could \n     layer on responsibilities for the Patent Office and Team \n     Kappos could deliver and still reduce the backlog.\n       Some others who challenge the first to file changes in the \n     patent reform bill say the Interference analysis above is \n     misplaced because first to file is not about whether the \n     first to invent will obtain the patent. As illogical as that \n     sounds, they have a point. Notice, however, that the \n     Interference data does clearly demonstrate there is no need \n     whatsoever for a first to invent system in the United States. \n     Thus, many who challenge the first to file system don't seem \n     to question that first to file is acceptable, but they do not \n     like the loss of the familiar 12 month grace period.\n       The truth is, however, that relying on a 12 month grace \n     period is extremely dangerous, but it does have its place. As \n     Bryan Lord correctly explains in ``Crunch Time: Call Your \n     Senators on Patent Reform,'' many start-up companies rely on \n     the grace period, which is critical ``to companies that rely \n     upon external collaborations or have comparatively limited \n     resources.'' There is absolutely no argument with the fact \n     that a grace period does factor into the equation for small \n     businesses and start-up companies that are strapped for cash \n     and already need to make choices about how much, and which, \n     innovations to protect. I also like Lord's questioning the \n     rush to harmonize. I always like to point out that \n     harmonization is fine, but why can't we do what makes for a \n     good system and not just what everyone else does. Let's \n     harmonize what the world does better and let's lobby the \n     world to adopt what our system clearly gets right.\n       Having said all of this, there is absolutely no reason why \n     we cannot move from a first to invent system to a first \n     inventor to file system that would still retain a real and \n     substantial grace period and still retain the right for \n     patent applicants to swear behind references to demonstrate \n     an earlier date of invention, at least with respect to pieces \n     of prior art that are not the progeny of earlier filed patent \n     applications.\n       Regardless of the disinformation that is widespread, the \n     currently proposed S. 23 does, in fact, have a grace period. \n     The grace period would be quite different than what we have \n     now and would not extend to all third party activities, but \n     many of the horror stories say that if someone learns of your \n     invention from you and beats you to the Patent Office, they \n     will get the patent. That is simply flat wrong.\n       As it stands now, the currently proposed 102 in S. 23 says, \n     in relevant part:\n\n     Sec. 102. CONDITIONS FOR PATENTABILITY; NOVELTY\n\n       (a) Novelty; Prior Art.--A person shall be entitled to a \n     patent unless--\n       (1) the claimed invention was patented, described in a \n     printed publication, or in public use, on sale, or otherwise \n     available to the public before the effective filing date of \n     the claimed invention; or\n       (2) the claimed invention was described in a patent issued \n     under section 151, or in an application for patent published \n     or deemed published under section 122(b), in which the patent \n     or application, as the case may be, names another inventor \n     and was effectively filed before the effective filing date of \n     the claimed invention.\n       (b) Exceptions.--\n       (1) Disclosures made 1 year or less before the effective \n     filing date of the claimed invention.--A disclosure made 1 \n     year or less before the effective filing date of a claimed \n     invention shall not be prior art to the claimed invention \n     under subsection (a)(1) if--\n       (A) the disclosure was made by the inventor or joint \n     inventor or by another who obtained the subject matter \n     disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint \n     inventor; or\n       (B) the subject matter disclosed had, before such \n     disclosure, been publicly disclosed by the inventor or a \n     joint inventor or another who obtained the subject matter \n     disclosed directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint \n     inventor.\n       Looking at the proposed 102(b), it becomes clear that \n     despite the claims of critics, there is a grace period within \n     S. 23. I find it sad, yet amusing, that some who challenge \n     the bill simply refuse to quote 102(b), and even outright \n     claim ``there is no grace period.'' Obviously, there is a \n     grace period.\n       The proposed 102(b) seeks to eliminate from the universe of \n     prior art disclosures made by the inventor or which owe their \n     substance to the inventor. So if the inventor discloses his \n     or her invention less than a year before filing a patent \n     application, the patent can still be awarded. If someone \n     learns of the invention from the inventor and discloses less \n     than a year before filing a patent application, the patent \n     can likewise still be awarded. What is notably missing here \n     are several things. First, a definition for ``disclosure.'' \n     Second, an exception that applies to third-party activities \n     where the third party acted without learning of information \n     from the inventor but yet did not file a first application \n     themselves. So the grace period set up by proposed 102(b) \n     excepts disclosures (whatever they are) made by or through an \n     inventor less than 1 year before the inventor files, but does \n     not extend to disclosures (whatever they are) made by others \n     less than 1 year before the inventor files.\n       The proposed 102(b) is a departure from the current law of \n     novelty. Nevertheless, it is simply wrong to claim there is \n     no grace period in an attempt to manipulate independent \n     inventors, small businesses and others to support elimination \n     of first to file.\n       In any event, under the current 102(b), a patent applicant \n     is entitled to a patent unless--the invention was patented or \n     described in a printed publication in this or a foreign \n     country or in public use or on sale in this country, more \n     than one year prior to the date of the application for patent \n     in the United States . . .\n       Under current 102(b) an inventor can create their own bar \n     to patentability as a result of activity such as publication, \n     public use in the U.S. or sale in the U.S. if it occurs more \n     than 1 year before a U.S. patent application is filed. A bar \n     can likewise be created if a third party, either known or \n     unknown to the inventor, engages in the same activity more \n     than one year before a U.S. patent application is filed. What \n     this necessarily means, and has long been interpreted to \n     mean, is that a patent can be awarded so long as the \n     invention has not been patented, published, on public use in \n     the U.S. or on sale in the U.S. for more than 1 year. The \n     current 102(b) provides a solid grace period that applies \n     across the board, the proposed 102(b) does not.\n       Independent inventors and start-ups are rightly concerned \n     about whether they will be able to enjoy a grace period \n     relative to third party activities. They are rightly \n     concerned to wonder whether the term ``disclosure'' in 102(b) \n     would mean that the exception applied to their own public use \n     or sale activities, which is anything but clear. Inventors \n     and start-ups are also rightly concerned about whether they \n     will be able to swear behind and prove prior inventorship \n     relative to prior art not associated with an earlier filed \n     patent application. In short, I see no reason why we cannot \n     have a first inventor to file system that does away with \n     Interference proceedings, awards patents to the first \n     inventor who files a patent application, but which also \n     preserves a 12 month grace period under current law.\n       Of course, if first to file as stated in 102(b) becomes the \n     law of the land, it will encourage independent inventors to \n     do exactly what they should do, which is file patent \n     applications earlier in the process. I hear the most \n     ridiculous strategies from independent inventors who almost \n     universally don't understand the requirements to prove they \n     were the first to invent, see ``Much Ado About Nothing,'' so \n     a simpler system that they can understand will no doubt \n     benefit them. Small businesses and start-ups should likewise \n     file earlier in the process, and frankly that is why there is \n     so much opposition to first to file.\n       Small businesses and start-up companies do need a grace \n     period to try and figure out what to pursue, and the proposed \n     grace period should keep much of the law in its place [but] \n     will not be as widespread as currently enjoyed. While \n     resources are always limited with start-ups, I think they \n     incorrectly argue that there is an over-burdensome cost in \n     terms of both money and time associated with filing \n     provisional patent applications to preliminarily protect \n     rights. In fact, I have offered to demonstrate just how the \n     preparation and filing of streamlined provisional patent \n     applications can be accomplished to many of those making the \n     argument that it is too costly and time consuming to prepare \n     quality provisional patent applications. As yet I have had no \n     takers. So if cost and time are such concerns, why aren't \n     they willing to consider a better, faster, cheaper way?\n       I think Bryan Lord's call to reach out to your Senators is \n     absolutely the right thing to do. Get involved and be heard!\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Much Ado About Nothing Over First To File\n\n (By Gene Quinn, President & Founder of IPWatchdog, Inc., Nov. 7, 2009)\n\n       Just about 24 hours ago I posted an article relating to my \n     changing position with respect to first to file, and already \n     there is something of a firestorm. I understand there are \n     those who feel I have abandoned them and adopted a naive view \n     of the world. But excuse me for recognizing the new tone and \n     identifiable actions taking place at 600 Dulany Street. Yes, \n     I have been an ardent supporter of first to invent for years, \n     but I have been questioning my views for some time, as I \n     speak with attorneys, inventors and others. Then several \n     things recently caused me to realize the benefits of first to \n     file for the independent inventor community, and then I heard \n     USPTO Director David Kappos explain that in 2007 only 7 cases \n     were decided in favor of an individual who invented first and \n     filed second. Kappos explained, ``we already have a de facto \n     first to file system.'' All this arguing for 7 cases? Cases \n     where once the rule changes, behaviors will change to the \n     point where some, perhaps most, or even all of those 7 cases \n     will never happen again because everyone will know they need \n     to file rather than wait. On top of that, it is inarguably \n     good, correct, legally sound and business-appropriate advice \n     to file sooner rather than later.\n       In a spirited comment chain associated with the \n     aforementioned first to file article many supporters of first \n     to invent are coming out in force, and they don't even \n     realize they are making arguments that hardly support their \n     position and in fact support the\n\n[[Page S1044]]\n\n     exact opposite position. I would like to address several \n     here.\n       First, it seems that many believe it is not appropriate to \n     file provisional patent applications because many of the \n     applications that are filed are inadequate and insufficient. \n     It has been brought up that an appropriate and good \n     provisional patent application needs to be identical to a \n     nonprovisional patent application, perhaps without having \n     been spell-checked. Obviously this is a gross overstatement \n     of the law, and not correct. It is true that a provisional \n     patent application needs to be as complete as a \n     nonprovisional patent application in terms of disclosure, but \n     nothing more. There are no formalities that need to be met, \n     and it is the substance that matters. Nonprovisional patent \n     applications exalt form over substance in large part, but a \n     good provisional patent application needs to focus on \n     substance. Whatever someone of skill in the art would \n     understand to be described and disclosed has been described \n     and disclosed. So those who think they need to write a \n     nonprovisional patent application and file it as a \n     provisional are overstating, don't understand the law or have \n     not developed a sophisticated strategy. But don't vilify \n     those who do understand the law, business realities and have \n     developed fundamentally sound strategies.\n       Second, there seems to be a belief that first to invent can \n     be relied upon while provisional patent applications are \n     inappropriate to rely upon if an invention matters. But what \n     exactly does this mean? If you rely on first to invent and \n     are operating at all responsibly you are keeping an invention \n     notebook that will meet evidentiary burdens if and when it is \n     necessary to demonstrate conception prior to the conception \n     of the party who was first to file. You are also keeping an \n     invention record that will demonstrate diligence as well, but \n     let's focus on the substance of what is in the notebook or \n     record for a moment. Appropriate notebooks and/or invention \n     records will be able to identify conception and when it \n     occurs. Of course you never want to box yourself in when you \n     present evidence to say a date certain was the date of \n     conception, but you had better have an appropriate record for \n     if and when it does matter, as it did in Oka v. Youssefyeh, \n     where the senior party and junior party both were able to \n     prove the same date of conception. Ultimately the Federal \n     Circuit said any ties go to the senior party, so it is not \n     fanciful to identify an oddball fact pattern where actual \n     dates matter. Here is a real case, and given the extremely \n     limited number of interference proceedings even one case is a \n     statistically relevant sample.\n       Now, if you are relying on first to invent and keeping the \n     records that you should be keeping, your invention notebook \n     or invention record will detail, describe, identify and date \n     conception so that others skilled in the art will be able to \n     look at the notebook/record and understand what you did, what \n     you knew, and come to the believe that you did in fact \n     appreciate what you had. If you have this, you have provable \n     conception. If you have provable and identifiable conception, \n     you also have a disclosure that informs and supports the \n     invention. It is pure folly to suggest that a provisional \n     patent application, albeit perhaps not as formally structured \n     as a nonprovisional patent application, is a waste of time \n     but also believe that the cryptic notes of an engineer or \n     scientist are superior and even preferable. If the notebook \n     provably demonstrates conception then it can be filed as a \n     provisional patent application at least for the purpose of \n     staking a claim to the conception that is detailed with \n     enough specificity to later support an argument in a first to \n     invent regime.\n       Finally, let me address the matter of what gets included in \n     a typical invention notebook or invention record. It is \n     almost unbelievable for me to hear patent attorneys state \n     that they prefer the notes of inventors, scientists and \n     engineers with respect to detailing and describing conception \n     over a provisional patent application. Every patent attorney \n     and patent agent knows the level of detail that is provided \n     by inventors, even those who work for large corporations. The \n     invention disclosures are as a rule laughably inadequate. One \n     paragraph passes for a ``complete'' explanation of the \n     invention. The truth is that patent attorneys are typically \n     given very little from an inventor at the beginning of the \n     process. In fact, inventors give such little information that \n     at times the true inventor on the patent application that is \n     actually filed should really be the patent attorney, not the \n     inventor. That is obviously not always the case, but this is \n     the big joke in the patent attorney community. Getting \n     information from inventors is a little like herding cats. \n     They are creative and they understand their invention, and \n     they seem to universally believe that cryptic information \n     ought to suffice. Remember, the goal is not to explain the \n     invention so that the inventor understands, the goal is to \n     explain the invention so that those who are not the \n     inventor understand.\n       It borders on the absurd to prefer cryptic invention notes \n     and invention records over provisional patent applications \n     that are drafted by an attorney or agent who understands the \n     legal requirements for providing an enabling disclosure that \n     also satisfies the written description requirement. It also \n     strikes me as particularly odd to say that those with nothing \n     more than an idea will not have any time to figure out the \n     particulars required to describe their invention. Why exactly \n     are we worried that those without an invention may be \n     impacted by first to file? They are already negatively \n     impacted under first to invent because they have not yet \n     invented and have no conception.\n       Most are undoubtedly familiar with the 80-20 rule, which \n     goes something like this--it takes 20% of the time to \n     complete 80% of the project, and the remaining 20% of the \n     project takes 80% of the time to complete. That is true \n     certainly with respect to software, which is my area of \n     expertise, and it is true for many other areas of invention. \n     It also happens to be true for writing patent applications as \n     well, at least if you think outside the box and adopt a \n     business friendly approach to writing patent applications, \n     mining inventions, and identifying open space that can be \n     filed. I realize that somewhere between 70-80% of patent \n     attorneys and patent agents start by writing the claims, and \n     then write the specification. I do it the other way, and I \n     can't for the life of me understand those who write claims \n     first. It is not wrong, just a different approach, but not \n     the way I think.\n       I write text and then translate into claim language, which \n     I find much easier to do. By doing this, and starting with a \n     thorough patent search, patentability assessment, some \n     mapping, and working with the inventor to continually refine \n     understanding of what is most unique compared with the prior \n     art, I am able to identify the base target, describe it in \n     English, layer on specifics that take the form of alternative \n     embodiments and versions and ultimately create an \n     extraordinarily detailed specification that will support a \n     multitude of claims. To do this takes about 20% of the time. \n     The remaining 80% of the time is spent explaining how hip \n     bone 15 is connected to thigh bone 18, writing sets of \n     claims, and going back to continue to expand upon the \n     disclosure to continually mine new areas and expand scope. I \n     do not support filing crappy provisional patent applications, \n     and it doesn't mean that a provisional patent application \n     cooperatively created between inventor and patent attorney is \n     ``easy to get around'' or at all inferior compared to an \n     invention notebook or invention record.\n       Stop looking at first to file as a curse. It is an \n     opportunity for inventors, small businesses and start-ups \n     that are willing to see opportunity rather than obstacles. \n     Venture capitalists who are savvy and willing to explore new \n     methods and models for protecting early-stage technologies \n     will be handsomely rewarded. Savvy independent inventors, \n     closely held businesses and businesses that are ordered to \n     take direction from venture capitalists or lose funding will \n     clean up, and clean up big. And for crying out loud, when \n     only 7 cases out of nearly 500,000 applications a year change \n     as a result of first to file versus first to invent, there is \n     no way that first to file will cripple the economy or cost \n     jobs.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I would urge my colleagues to fully participate in this \ndebate, come to the floor with any questions or comments they have, and \nat the end of this process Chairman Leahy will finally be rewarded with \na bill that will bear his imprimatur and support, a bill that will be \nextraordinarily important to the future well-being of the people of the \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator has been involved in this right \nfrom the beginning. We have worked at having a bill that would be in \nthe best interests of the Senate under both Republicans and Democrats \nacross the political spectrum. We have worked very closely together.\n  We run the risk of countries in Asia and Europe out-innovating the \nUnited States, and the patent systems in other countries are well ahead \nof us. If we want to compete, as I know the Senator from Arizona does, \nand I know I do, we want to have the best tools to compete. I believe \nAmericans can compete with any country in the world, but they should at \nleast have the tools to do it and be able to play--it becomes almost a \nclich, but we have to play on a level playing field. This will allow us \nto do that.\n\n  I compliment the Senator from Arizona for the way he has worked in \nhis constant efforts in the committee, the public meetings, but that is \nthe tip of the iceberg; it is the hundreds of hours of behind-the-\nscenes working to reach where we are. So I hope sometime in the next \nfew minutes or so we can at least vote on the managers' package and \nthen get going with the bill, because this is something that can be \nvoted on, can be passed. We have been working, as the Senator from \nArizona knows, very closely with our counterparts in the other body. I \nknow Chairman Smith would like to move quickly. We could have a bill on \nthe President's desk in a relatively short time.\n  I thank the Senator for his kind words.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the chairman of the committee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 112\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask for regular order on the Vitter \namendment.\n\n[[Page S1045]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thought the amendment pending is the \nmanagers' amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana has just \ncalled for the regular order with respect to his amendment.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 112, As Modified\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I now send a modification to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. FULL FAITH AND CREDIT ACT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Full \n     Faith and Credit Act''.\n       (b) Prioritize Obligations on the Debt Held by the \n     Public.--In the event that the debt of the United States \n     Government, as defined in section 3101 of title 31, United \n     States Code, reaches the statutory limit, the authority of \n     the Department of the Treasury provided in section 3123 of \n     title 31, United States Code, to pay with legal tender the \n     principal and interest on debt held by the public shall take \n     priority over all other obligations incurred by the \n     Government of the United States.\n       (c) Prioritize Payment of Social Security Benefits.--\n     Notwithstanding subsection (b), in the event that the debt of \n     the United States Government, as so defined, reaches the \n     statutory limit, the authority described in subsection (b) \n     and the authority of the Commissioner of Social Security to \n     pay monthly old-age, survivors', and disability insurance \n     benefits under title II of the Social Security Act shall be \n     given equal priority over all other obligations incurred by \n     the Government of the United States.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I will be happy to explain the context \nto the chairman of the committee.\n  This modification simply merges what was previously a separate Toomey \namendment and a separate Vitter amendment. We had hoped to have votes \non those as a first-degree and second-degree amendment. That wasn't \npossible, so this is a merged amendment. Let me explain what this \namendment does.\n  The basis of this amendment is Senator Toomey's Full Faith and Credit \nAct. It is very important. It simply says if we ever as a country reach \nour debt ceiling, then even if we go beyond the debt ceiling, we will \nuse all the tools available to the Treasury Secretary to continue for \nas long as possible to pay to make good on U.S. debt, we are not going \nto immediately default on U.S. debt.\n  There have been a lot of scare tactics, in my opinion, suggesting \nthat if we ever reach that day of bumping up against our statutory debt \nceiling, the very next day, the very next hour, the United States would \ndefault on its debt--not make good on our obligations of the U.S. \nTreasury. That isn't true. It doesn't have to be true. This important \nreform will ensure that it is not true. We get far more revenue into \nthe U.S. Treasury than has to be spent simply to service the debt. So \nthe underlying Toomey bill, which is the heart of this amendment, says \nwe will make good on those obligations. They will be the top priority.\n  The original Vitter amendment, which is now merged together with the \nToomey amendment, says the exact same thing with regard to Social \nSecurity payments. I am sure we would all agree that seniors on fixed \nincomes depend on their Social Security checks. So the Vitter part of \nthis now merged Toomey-Vitter amendment says we will honor Social \nSecurity payments in the same status as debt payments and we will use \nFederal revenues first for those purposes before we do anything else. \nWhat that means is, if we ever do bump up on the debt ceiling, we would \nnot stop Social Security checks the next day. We would not stop Social \nSecurity checks the next month. We could have many weeks--probably a \nfew months--honoring all of those commitments in the areas of Social \nSecurity and debt on U.S. Treasury notes.\n  So that is the purpose of this now merged Toomey-Vitter amendment. We \nare not suggesting that it is necessarily a good idea to bump up the \ndebt ceiling. We are saying, Let's all take a deep breath, let's not \nuse scare tactics, let's not use hysteria, and let's plan ahead.\n  What we hope will be the outcome is that we will not only deal with \nthe debt ceiling in a responsible way, but before that, we will also \ndeal with our underlying fiscal crisis in a responsible way. We will \nmake real and serious budget reforms to get on a fiscally sustainable \npath which we are clearly not on right now.\n  This morning Senator Toomey and I were in the Banking Committee \nhearing where Chairman Ben Bernanke of the Federal Reserve testified. \nChairman Bernanke said again, as he has numerous times over the last \nyear and more, that the fiscal path we are on as a Federal Government \nis completely unsustainable. He also said that is the single biggest \nlong-term threat to our economy, and he also said while it is a long-\nterm problem, it could manifest itself in serious negative consequences \nin the short term. So this could rattle our economy and even begin to \ncreate an economic crisis--who knows when--possibly in the short term.\n  So the clock is ticking and we need serious budget reform, and this \ncombined Toomey-Vitter amendment would take the hysteria out of the \ndiscussion and hopefully urge us to take concrete action on that \nserious budget reform before it is too late.\n  With that, I wish to yield to my distinguished colleague from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, before he does that, would the Senator \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Louisiana has been talking about \namendment No. 112. Does that mean you are withdrawing 113?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes. We will be seeking a single vote on the amendment, \nas modified.\n  Mr. LEAHY. So am I correct that amendment No. 113 is withdrawn?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is not withdrawn at this time.\n  Mr. VITTER. First of all, as I understand it, it has been modified, \nso it has become----\n  Mr. LEAHY. You modified No. 112. I didn't know what you wanted to do \nwith amendment No. 113.\n  Mr. VITTER. If I could yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania, I \nthink he can help answer the question. But to clarify from my point of \nview, we are seeking a vote--a single vote, which I think we are very \nclose to locking in--on the new modified amendment, which is a \ncombination of the separate Vitter and Toomey amendments.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I thank my colleague for yielding. I \nwould say that as soon as we can work out the specifics with the staff, \nthat is exactly the intention that Senator Vitter and I came to. So a \nsingle vote on the merger of two amendments.\n  I would take a moment to thank Senator Vitter for his help. Senator \nVitter was kind enough to offer the text of my legislation as an \namendment to the patent reform bill. What he is adding is suggesting \nthat the legislation should require the Treasury to prioritize not only \nthe debt service so we can avoid under all circumstances a default by \nthe U.S. Government, but also making sure Social Security payments get \nthe priority they deserve.\n  The fact is, in the unlikely--and I would say certainly unfortunate--\nevent that we were to reach the debt limit without having raised it, \nthe Federal Government would still take in more than enough revenue to \npay all of the interest service on the debt and all Social Security \nbenefits. It is entirely manageable from an operational and functional \npoint of view. Total revenue to the government from taxes alone is on \nthe order of 70 percent of all expected expenditures. Debt service is \nonly about 6 percent.\n  I appreciate the help of the Senator from Louisiana. By combining \nthis, what we do--if we can pass this legislation, which I hope we \nwill--is take off the table the specter of a default. We can take off \nthe table the specter of any senior citizen not getting their Social \nSecurity payment. What we can then do is have an honest discussion \nabout how are we going to reform a process that has gotten us into this \nfix--gotten us to the point where we are running a deficit of 10 \npercent of GDP, where our total debt is screaming toward totally \nunsustainable levels.\n  I can tell my colleagues, the folks in Pennsylvania know very well we \ncannot continue living beyond our means as this government has been. I \nsee this as a very constructive, important opportunity to begin to have \nthis discussion about how we are going to get this process under \ncontrol.\n\n[[Page S1046]]\n\n  I appreciate the help from Senator Vitter, and I yield.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague. \nAgain, this amendment, as modified, simply says that if we were ever to \nreach the statutory debt limit for the Federal Government, then revenue \ncoming in would go first to service two things: Social Security checks \nand interest on the Federal debt. So that would not be put in jeopardy \nfor months down the line.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to try to take, quite frankly, some \nof the scare tactics and some of the hysteria out of the debate and to \nurge us to act. None of us wants to bump up on the debt ceiling. None \nof us is advocating that. What we are advocating is to take action now, \nreal serious budget reform, to put us on a more fiscally sustainable \npath. We need to do that now. That is why we came to the floor with \nthese concerns on the patent bill. We need to do that now. We need to \nact now. We need to get on a fiscally sustainable path now. The clock \nis ticking, as Chairman Bernanke reminded us before the Banking \nCommittee this morning.\n  With that, I look forward to locking in a vote on this matter, and in \nthe consent that establishes that, we will be happy to withdraw the \nother amendment and simply have one vote on the now combined Toomey-\nVitter amendment.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I wish to thank the chairman of the \ncommittee for his work on this patent bill. I still have a few small \nproblems with it, but I am extremely grateful for his consideration of \nour amendment. Most people don't understand there are no tax dollars \ntaken from the general fund for the Patent Office. It is all fees paid \nwhen you file a patent or a trademark or a copyright. Unfortunately, \nover the last 10, 15 years, $800 million of those fees have not been \nleft at the Patent Office. They have been taken and used somewhere \nelse. So when you pay a fee for a patent, that money isn't going to pay \nfor the examination of the patent.\n  Right now, we find ourselves with 718,000 patents waiting for first \naction. If I file a patent today, what we will see is that 26 months \nfrom now my patent will have first action--the first reading by an \nexaminer.\n  If we want to create jobs and stay on top of the world in terms of \ninnovation, we cannot allow that process to continue. So what the \namendment does is say we are not going to take the money people use to \npay for a patent application and spend it somewhere else; we are \nactually going to spend it on patent applications. That is what it was \nset up for.\n  Quite frankly, it is immoral to take money for a specific purpose for \nadvantaging an American company or inventor or a university and not \napply that money for the intended purpose under the statute. Although \nthis is controversial, most Americans would think, if you are paying \n$10 on a toll road, the money is going to keep the toll road up. Yet we \nhaven't been doing that with the Patent Office.\n  We are in trouble not because of our Patent Office but because we \nhave not enforced intellectual property rights owned by Americans \naround the world. So as we work on getting a patent bill and blending \nit with whatever the House passes, it is as important--again, I thank \nthe chairman because he was kind enough to have a hearing on the \nintellectual property for us, in terms of its enforcement.\n  There are two key points for American innovation to bring jobs to \nAmerica. One is when you get a good idea and have an ability to get it \npatented and can defend the patent. The other side of that is to \nenforce that patent throughout the world with our own Justice \nDepartment, in terms of our State Department and in terms of the \nintellectual property rights.\n  It is amazing how much of our intellectual property is being stolen \nby China today. I wish to relate a conversation I had with their \nSecretary of Commerce--their equivalent to ours--in China 3 years ago. \nI asked him about intellectual property rights. He was bold in his \nstatement to say: We are not going to honor them. We are a developing \nnation and you would not have honored them either--even though they are \na signatory to the World Trade Organization. It is important we \nunderstand whom we are dealing with--people who will cheat and steal \nintellectual property from America. Fixing the patent apparatus will \nhelp us get there, but it is just as important to have tough laws on \nour books that create sanctions on nations that do not honor \nintellectual property.\n  Again, this is a simple, straightforward, moral response to an \nimmoral act: collecting fees for something and not spending it on that, \nwhich has put us behind the curve. This will bring us back. We have a \nwonderful new Director, over the last 18 months, in the Patent Office. \nIt is being run better than ever. They are catching up. But last year \nwe took $53 million of the fees that were for patents and spent it \nelsewhere. What this amendment does is stop that.\n  It may come to a time in this bill that we allow the Patent Office to \nset their fees. It will come to a time when we have to say: Wait a \nminute. You are charging too much. You have to be more efficient.\n  We don't do anything with oversight. We still have the oversight \ncapability of all the Appropriations Committees. We have the ability to \nchange this in the future in terms of their fee setting. If we do the \nproper oversight, we will spring forward with tremendous new technology \nthat is protected and enable that capital expenditure that was spent to \nget that technology to flourish in terms of American jobs.\n  Again, I thank the chairman. He worked with me judiciously. It has \nbeen a pleasure to work with him. I thank him for his efforts on my \nbehalf and that of the American inventors in this country.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senator raised some questions with \nme, both in committee and out of the committee, with respect to each \nother's positions. I appreciate his work in the committee to expedite \ngetting the bill out of the committee. Like him, I believe it is \nextraordinarily important to level the playing to allow American \ninnovators to compete in the world and within our country. I compliment \nthe Senator and, as he knows, I have included his proposal in the \nmanagers' amendment because I thought it was a good proposal.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 5 p.m. \nbe for debate on the Leahy-Grassley amendment No. 121, as modified, \nwhich I believe is pending, and the Vitter for Toomey amendment No. \n112, as modified, en bloc, and divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the Leahy-Grassley amendment No. 121, \nas modified; that upon disposition of the Leahy-Grassley amendment, the \nSenate vote in relation to the Vitter for Toomey amendment No. 112, as \nmodified; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table with no intervening action or debate; and that there be \nno amendments in order to any of the amendments listed in this \nagreement prior to the vote; further, that the Vitter amendment No. \n113, as modified, be withdrawn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to express my strong \nsupport for Senator Coburn's proposal to\n\n[[Page S1047]]\n\nend Patent and Trademark Office fee diversion. It is a commonsense, \nentrepreneur friendly solution to many of the problems plaguing the \nPatent and Trademark Office.\n  Over the years, we have heard numerous complaints from constituents \nabout the long time it takes the Patent and Trademark Office to review \npatent applications and render a final disposition. It is my \nunderstanding that in most cases, it takes almost 3 years for the \nPatent and Trademark Office to make a final decision on an application \nwhich can be costly to the applicant.\n  We have also heard from Patent and Trademark Office officials about \nthe difficulties that have arisen because of their lack of control over \nthe agency's funding model. There are 1.2 million patent applications \ncurrently pending at the Patent and Trademark Office but not enough \nresources to tackle the workload. The patent application backlog \nsituation, while improving, is still a significant problem.\n  Senator Coburn's proposal strikes at the heart of both of these \nconcerns by creating a revolving fund at the Treasury Department where \npatent and trademark fees that are paid to the Patent and Trademark \nOffice are directly allocated back to the office. That way those funds \ncan be utilized in a fashion most beneficial to inventors, small \nbusinesses, and academic institutions.\n  At his confirmation hearing in 2009, Patent and Trademark Office \nDirector David Kappos told the Judiciary Committee that one of the most \nimmediate challenges facing the office was ``the need for a stable and \nsustainable funding model.'' The financial crisis affecting the Patent \nand Trademark Office is a direct result of its current funding \nstructure. The Patent and Trademark Office receives no taxpayer funds--\nit is solely funded by patent and trademark user fees. Yet, those fees \nare not deposited within the Patent and Trademark Office. They are \ninstead diverted to the Treasury Department, forcing the Patent and \nTrademark Office to ask for funds generated by their own office to be \nappropriated back to them.\n  The Patent and Trademark Office often requests lower than the amount \ngenerated by patent and trademark fees, which results in any extra fees \nbeing diverted by Congress to address ``general revenue purposes.'' In \nfact, since 1992, Congress has diverted more than $750 million from the \nPatent and Trademark Office.\n  For example, as recent as 2007, 12 million user-fee generated dollars \nwere diverted from the Patent and Trademark Office for ``other \npurposes.'' With 1.2 million patent applications pending--735,000 of \nwhich are simply waiting for a patent examiner to take a first action--\nit is clear that the Patent and Trademark Office is in dire need of \nthose funds. I believe those fees belong to the Patent and Trademark \nOffice and are needed by their offices to make the patent and trademark \nprocess more accessible and efficient for America's innovators.\n  By ending fee diversion and allowing the Patent and Trademark Office \nto structure its own funding model, resources would be directly \nallocated to areas of most concern for both the Patent and Trademark \nOffice and American innovators. The Coburn proposal does both, and \nensures that the ever expanding backlog of unexamined patent \napplications and the timeframe for actual examination would be \naddressed in an efficient manner. It is time for Congress to take \naction and allow the Patent and Trademark Office to control the user \nfees that we think they deserve so they can effectively serve our \nNation's inventors and small businesses.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call be equally \ncharged to both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Members' Pay\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I think the managers are aware that I am \ngoing to make a unanimous consent request shortly on a bill that deals \nwith Members' pay in the event of a government shutdown. I have been \ntold we are waiting to see--there is apparently one objection on the \nRepublican side. If we can clear it, then this will be passed. If not, \nthen I will be back later to make the same request.\n  I say to my friend from Vermont and my friend from Iowa that I \nsupport the managers' package. It is terrific. One of the things in \nthere is a Coburn-Boxer amendment that would keep the patent fees in \nthe Patent Office. I am so glad the chairman sees it that way because \nwe have such a tremendous backlog.\n  I will be happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I wish to ask a question about the \nproposal that the Senator from California will make on pay, which is \nfine with me. Can we not have an alternative in the bill that we give \nthe money to charity so somebody would actually see it? This would be \none one-hundred thousandth of 1 percent, according to the Treasury. The \nlast time we had a shutdown, I just voluntarily gave $4,000, $5,000 to \ncharity. Would it not make a lot more sense, and actually people might \nget some benefit from it, especially places such as homeless shelters? \nThey are going to be hurt by a government shutdown. Why not do \nsomething where they would get the money directly?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is a good idea. The reason I have done it this way \nis because I am trying to say that we in the Senate and in the House \nhave an obligation to keep the government running, and we should be \ntreated just like other Federal employees. That is the simplicity of \nthis legislation. We cannot force a Member to give money to charity.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We could, actually, by saying either return it to the \nTreasury or give an equal amount to charity and file with the Secretary \nof the Senate to which charity they gave it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Again, that is treating us differently than other Federal \nemployees. That would be a tax writeoff.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Not if one gives the full amount.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is a tax writeoff to give to charity. All I am saying \nis that is certainly another option if my friend wanted to change it.\n  I just think it is simple. We just want to be treated the same as \nother Federal employees, and that is how I have structured it.\n  I spoke about this issue this morning. I wrote this bill with the \nsupport of Casey, Manchin, Tester, Nelson of Nebraska, Bennet, Warner, \nWyden, Coons, Harkin, Hagan, Menendez, Stabenow, Merkley, and \nRockefeller. There is a growing consensus that we want to avoid a \nshutdown at any cost. I am hoping we will avoid it. There could come a \nmoment where it is forced upon us. There are lots of stories--who will \nget the blame for this, that, and the other. To me, that is not \nimportant. What is important to me is that we sacrifice--we in the \nSenate and in the House as well.\n  I am hopeful that if we get this done and send this over to Speaker \nBoehner that he will get it through his body over there, and we can get \nthis done and send it to the President. It impacts the President too. \nWe say the President cannot get paid either because the deal is we have \nto work with the President to come up with a compromise.\n  Senator Leahy has a good suggestion. Some people might like that \noption better. I believe this should be kept very simple; that in the \ncase of a government shutdown we are treated the same way as other \nFederal employees. The reason we have to do this is Members of Congress \nand the President are paid by separate statute rather than by the \nannual appropriations process. We have to pass a separate statute on \nthis issue. It is a very simple bill.\n\n[[Page S1048]]\n\n  Again, I hope we never have to come to this, where we have any type \nof a shutdown. Maybe this bill will make some colleagues who believe \nthey will be protected from sacrifice realize it is painful. It is \npainful for a lot of people. Certainly, it would be painful if somebody \non Social Security or disability cannot get their payment. It is \npainful if veterans who are on disability do not get their check. It is \ncertainly painful if a citizen is planning a trip and cannot get a \npassport. It is painful if Superfund sites cannot be cleaned up. It is \npainful if there is, God forbid, an oil well explosion because we did \nnot have people there to inspect the oil well.\n  For our business people who are government contractors it is painful \nif they do not get paid. Export licenses must be granted, and our \ntroops should be paid. So there is no reason why we should shut down \nthis government, and I am very hopeful we will have unanimous consent \nto do it.\n\n  I have a parliamentary inquiry to ask the Chair: Is it true that we \nno longer have secret objections here; that a person has to identify \nthemselves if they are objecting?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are provisions that address \npeople objecting to unanimous consent requests.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So would I be correct if I said that if someone objects, \nwe would know who that individual is so we can speak with that \nindividual? You said there are provisions. Could you be more specific \nabout that?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If the Senator will hold for a \nminute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Certainly.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We will get the provision and read \nit to you.\n  Mr. LEAHY. While the Senator is waiting for that, if I might ask the \nSenator a question.\n  Article 2 of the Constitution says:\n\n       The President shall, at stated times, receive for his \n     services, a compensation, which shall neither be increased \n     nor diminished during the period for which he shall be \n     elected.\n\n  Would the Senator's amendment be constitutional under that provision? \nAnd remember that we voted to increase the pay of the President when \nPresident Clinton--if I could have the attention of the Senator--\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know this issue, yes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Between the time when President Clinton was in office, but \nit did not take effect until President George W. Bush came in and it \ndoubled the salary for President Bush but not President Clinton. How do \nyou, by statute, change, even for a matter of days, a Presidential \nsalary? Doesn't it violate article 2 of the Constitution?\n  Mrs. BOXER. We did check this with legal counsel, and they told us \nthat the legislation, as drafted, does not increase or diminish the \nannual salary of the President. It withholds pay during a shutdown or \nfailure to raise the debt ceiling.\n  There are definitely standing questions, and we are told that only \nthe President would be able to challenge this legislation in a court of \nlaw.\n  Mr. LEAHY. But you are saying that even though it goes directly \nagainst the Constitution, which says his compensation shall neither be \nincreased nor diminished during the period for which he shall be \nelected, that unless he objected--well, by the same token, why couldn't \nwe raise the pay of a President unless he objected?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, I will repeat what I said. This legislation--\n  Mr. LEAHY. It seems to be a total violation of the Constitution.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This legislation, as drafted, does not increase or \ndecrease the salary. If you withhold it, and if the President felt that \nwas a violation, he himself would have to challenge it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. But we have some responsibility in this body to actually \npass laws that are constitutional. It would, if there were a shutdown, \nand if upon a per-diem basis his salary was decreased, why isn't that \nde facto a violation of the Constitution?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Because we are not changing--diminishing--his salary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course you are.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is only in the case of an extraordinary event--a \ngovernment shutdown.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Constitution doesn't say anything about an \nextraordinary event.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator may oppose it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is not my question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will repeat. We don't diminish, we withhold it during a \nperiod of a government shutdown or a failure to raise the debt ceiling. \nThere is a reason we do it. It is very rare we have a government \nshutdown, but, in my view, and in the view of the cosponsors, this is a \nmajor function of our body and of the President--to avert a government \nshutdown. We don't think it is fair to treat some people differently \nthan others. If other Federal employees are going to get their pay cut \nand your Social Security recipients don't get their checks, we think \nthe Congress and the President ought to have a bite taken out of their \npay as well.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I don't disagree with anything the Senator is saying, but \nhow do you get--it would be like reducing a judge's salary. The \nConstitution specifically prohibits that. You say it is not reducing, \nbut of course it is. If you say we are shut down 5 days, take whatever \npercentage 5 days of the President's annual salary is, you withhold \nit--you are not going to give it back when the government comes back \ninto service--you have decreased his salary.\n  I am not suggesting not doing it for the Congress, but I don't see \nhow--I am not sure what kind of example we set if we pass a piece of \nlegislation which on the face of it violates the Constitution. I am not \ntalking about Members of Congress. As I said, the last time we had a \nshutdown I took whatever was my amount and added it to the thousands \nand thousands of dollars I give every year to charity. I added it to \nthat. But in this case, you go against article 2 by decreasing the \nPresident's salary.\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, we do not.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course you do.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We are not changing a penny of the President's pay. What \nwe are saying is, in the event of a government shutdown, he will be \ntreated the same way other Federal employees are treated and be treated \nin the same way we are treated. He can determine if he wants to \nchallenge this in a court of law.\n  We hope we don't ever face this. So we are not in any way changing \nhis salary. We hope never to have to use this.\n  Mr. LEAHY. So is the Senator saying we set the right example by \npassing a bill which, on the face of it, violates the Constitution, but \nit is okay unless somebody challenges it?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, I am not. I will reiterate again what I said, which \nis this: We do not increase or decrease the President's pay.\n  Mr. LEAHY. You just cut it for those days.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Can I finish? I let you talk. Now I think I have a turn. \nI don't have a legal degree, my friend has. It is common sense. It \nseems to me it is a question of fairness. Those of us who are \nresponsible for keeping this government open--\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then I will finish this thought.\n  We are responsible to keep this government open. If we fail to do \nthat, we ought to be punished.\n  I am going to make a unanimous consent request at this time, and I \nunderstand there is an objection.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I have just been told a Republican \ncolleague objects to this. I don't understand why. I don't think it is \na constitutional objection. I don't know the reason.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is out of time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to make my \nrequest.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. On behalf of Senator Coburn, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n\n[[Page S1049]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator does not have enough \ntime under her control to suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Toomey-\nVitter amendment, which we will vote on in the series of two votes \nstarting at 5 p.m. The idea behind the Toomey-Vitter amendment is very \nsimple. It says if we ever reach the debt ceiling, the government, as a \ntop first priority, will use revenue to pay two things: first, proper \ninterest payments on our U.S. Government debt; and secondly, Social \nSecurity checks to seniors.\n  The motivation behind this amendment is simple. First, those two \nthings should be legitimately a top priority. No one should want the \nU.S. Government to default on its debt and no one should want the \nimmediate stoppage, or the stoppage at any time, of Social Security \nchecks to seniors. So first, it is legitimate to rank those two \nfunctions as an absolute top priority.\n  The second motivation behind this amendment is to take some of these \nscare tactics and hysteria out of this debate. Too many people, in my \nopinion, have been saying if we ever reach the debt ceiling, the next \nday all Social Security checks will stop and all payments will stop on \nU.S. Treasury bills--on government debt. That is not true. There is no \nreason it has to be true. This amendment, when passed into law, will \nensure it is not true. It will ensure we look at this situation with \nfocus and calmness and not hysteria and scare tactics.\n  The goal, I am certain--and I know it is for Senator Toomey, my \ndistinguished colleague from Pennsylvania--is not that we not default \non our debt and not that we reach the debt ceiling, but it is that we \ntake strong, responsible action well ahead of any threatened event to \nput us on a fiscally sustainable path.\n  Just this morning, both Senator Toomey and I were in a hearing of the \nSenate Banking Committee and the witness--the only witness--was Ben \nBernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. He \nsaid very clearly several things directly pertinent to this discussion. \nFirst, he said we are on a fiscally unsustainable path. Our budget \nsituation is absolutely unsustainable. Second, he said that is the \nbiggest long-term threat to our economy--the biggest threat. Third, he \nsaid that although it is a long-term problem, it could create a short-\nterm crisis. It could create a crisis that could hit immediately, at \nany time. So we need to act and we need to act strongly.\n  Madam President, I yield time to the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want say I object to the Vitter-Toomey \nbill. I am not going to pay China before I pay people.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has no time. The \nSenator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent that the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee be discharged from--\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent to speak to make a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I think I control the floor and I yield \nto the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the Senator's \nrequest for unanimous consent to make a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. VITTER. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want an answer, please, to my question: Can people \nobject to a unanimous consent request without saying who they are, No. \n1? And No. 2, what is the parliamentary procedure here?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana objected \nto the unanimous consent request on behalf of the Senator from \nOklahoma, Senator Coburn. The Senator from Louisiana objected to the \nextension of the unanimous consent request for additional time on his \nown behalf.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So it is the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, who \nobjects to the bill we have that would say we don't get paid in the \ncase of a shutdown; is that correct? Senator Coburn is objecting to \nthat?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  All time remaining is under control of the minority.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Madam President, I wish to thank Senator Vitter for \nyielding his time and for his help on this effort. I want to be very \nclear. First, I am not aware of anybody in this body or anybody I know \nwho wants to see a government shutdown. I am not aware of anybody who \nwants to see the disruption that would result from failing to raise the \ndebt ceiling at the appropriate time. But I also feel strongly it is \ncritical we take this opportunity to begin to address the structural \nproblems we have.\n  The fact is we have a burden of debt right now that is costing us \njobs in this country today. The uncertainty it creates, the cost of \nfinancing this, the question of whether and for how long we can roll \nthis over, the extent to which inflation becomes a problem, all of \nthese risk factors are already weighing on our economy and our ability \nto create jobs now. For the future, it is an even bigger risk.\n  Senator Vitter and I have taken this step so we can have an honest \ndiscussion about how we are going to bring this spending under control \nand the process reforms we are going to make so we can hopefully get \noff this unsustainable path and get on a sustainable trajectory for the \neconomic growth we need. That is ultimately what this measure is all \nabout. It simply says that in the event we reach the debt limit without \nhaving raised it first--and let's face it, we have been there before. \nThis has happened in the past. In the last 20 years, it has happened on \nseveral occasions. So it is entirely possible that, despite the best \nefforts of those of us who want to avoid it, it could happen again.\n  If it were to happen again, we want to make sure that we have no \ndefault on our debt, that interest is paid, and that Social Security \nchecks go to the recipients as they should. There will be plenty of \nresources from ongoing tax revenue to make sure that happens, and \nanything less would be very irresponsible.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment.\n\n\n                            Damages Language\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I commend the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee for his hard work in putting together this \nmanagers' amendment and building consensus for this bill. Part of the \nmanagers' amendment strikes most of section 4 of the bill, relating to \ndamages. As the chairman knows, I worked very hard on the \n``gatekeeper'' damages language in this section of the bill. That \nlanguage represented a compromise between high-technology companies, \nmany located in my State of California, which believed that the law \nrelating to patent damages needed reform, and other interests, \nincluding universities, biotech, pharmaceutical companies, and small \ninventors, who were greatly concerned that the preferred solution of \nthe high-technology companies, namely apportionment of damages, would \nbe destructive to the value of patents. However, since then, the courts \nhave further developed the law relating to damages, so I understand \nthat the chairman proposes to now strike the gatekeeper damages \nlanguage from the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, the Senator is correct. I thank her for her hard work \nin putting together the gatekeeper damages language with Senator \nSpecter and myself in committee last Congress. It was instrumental in \nhelping to move this bill forward. However, as the Senator from \nCalifornia recognizes, the courts have advanced the law regarding \ndamages since then. For example, in Uniloc USA, Inc. v. Microsoft \nCorp., decided just this year, the Federal Circuit held that expert \ntestimony regarding a ``rule of thumb'' for allocating profits between \na patent user and a patent owner did not meet the Daubert test for \nexpert testimony, and was inadmissible. And in Lucent Technologies \nCorp. v. Gateway, Inc., the\n\n[[Page S1050]]\n\nFederal Circuit found that no rational jury could have concluded a \n``tiny feature of one part of a much larger software program with \nnumerous features . . . appear[ing] to account for the overwhelming \nmajority of consumer demand'' was worth an 8% royalty.'' This \nrepresented a new, greater level of review for jury damages assessment. \nIn light of cases like these, it no longer appears necessary for this \nbill to contain language regarding the assessment of damages.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, many businesses in my State agree. I also \nbelieve that if the bill remains silent on damages, as the managers' \namendment would do, that no harm will be done to the value of patents, \nwhich is so important for encouraging innovation. Is it the chairman's \nintention, in future discussions with the House of Representatives, to \ncontinue to have the bill remain silent on damages?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, it is. The courts have been making good progress in \ndeveloping the law in this area, and I do not believe patent reform \nlegislation should interfere with this progress. Should the House \npropose or pass some language on damages, I will certainly consult with \nthe Senator from California to obtain her views on that language.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the chairman, very much, for his \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). All time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Leahy-\nGrassley-Kyl, et al., managers' amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute \nequally divided for each side to explain this next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the next amendment is Vitter amendment No. \n112, which potentially says the United States must pay its interest \ndebt and Social Security benefits before it makes any other government \nobligations. I think that is a bad idea. That would bring economic \nchaos to our country. If we default, we default.\n  Just because the bondholders in China would get priority over our \ntroops overseas or get priority over tax refunds does not mean we are \nnot in default. Besides, it is bad policy anyway. This amendment would \nbring chaos. If we were ever to get to the point of being unable to \nraise our debt, it would bring chaos to pay the Chinese bondholders \nfirst before we pay anybody else. That is the wrong thing to do.\n  I do not think we want to get into a situation where we are going to \ntell the American people they are second to foreign investors. I \nstrongly urge that this amendment be defeated. At the appropriate time \nI will move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, if I can take the minute to rebut my \ncolleague, first of all, it is true it would be very disruptive and \nthere would be some chaos if we had a shutdown or if we eventually \nfailed to raise the debt limit. This amendment, of course, does not \ncause that. This amendment, in fact, is designed precisely to prevent \nthe kind of chaos that might otherwise ensue by simply ensuring that \nunder no circumstances whatsoever would the United States Government \ndefault on its debt.\n  I think we all agree that the last thing we should ever tolerate \nwould be a situation in which the United States Government would \ndefault on our debt. The chaos that would result from that would be \ndevastating. So this is an amendment that says, in the event the debt \nlimit is not raised when we reach it--and, by the way, we have been \nthere before, so it is not inconceivable--that we would make sure we, \nunder no circumstances, would default on the debt.\n  Because Senator Vitter offered a modification to this amendment, \nessentially the merger of these amendments ensures that Social Security \npayments would also go out. By the way, there is more than sufficient \nrevenue from ongoing taxes to ensure that could be done. So in the \ninterests of avoiding the chaos of an actual default, I think this \nabsolutely should occur.\n  By the way, I think it is also important to note that a majority of \nall of the debt issued by this government is held by Americans. They \nare held by senior citizens who live in Allentown, PA, and who have \nsaved their whole life and invested that savings in U.S. Treasury \nsecurities.\n  I think it is very important that we send the message to them that \neven if we are not able to get our work done and raise the debt limit, \nas I hope we will at the appropriate time, we certainly would not \ndefault on the debt they hold.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 112\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

I want to thank all Senators for supporting adoption of \nthe Leahy-Grassley-Kyl managers' amendment. This consensus amendment is \na compromise that resolves a number of the key outstanding issues in \nthe bill, including fee diversion, business method patents, damages and \nvenue. I want to take a moment to discuss the importance of these \nprovisions.\n  First, the provisions in this managers' amendment that end fee \ndiversion from the PTO are supported by all corners of the patent \ncommunity. Today, users fund 100 percent of the PTO's operations. The \nPTO does not take a dime of taxpayer money. For all of the improvements \nthat this legislation makes to our patent system, the Patent Office \nwill always be hindered if it cannot retain the funds it generates to \nmore adequately plan for its future. Today, as we ask our Patent Office \nto unleash the best in innovation from our businesses, our Patent \nOffice does not have the funding to do the same for itself. Ending fee \ndiversion will better equip the patent office with the resources to \ntackle the complexities of the 21st century.\n  Second, the managers' amendment creates a temporary proceeding at the \nPatent Office to reexamine certain business method patents. I \nappreciate the work that Senator Schumer has done on this issue, and \nthe provisions included in the managers' amendment represents a middle-\nground that bridges a divide on this issue between the financial and \ntech communities that reside in all of our States.\n  Third, the managers' amendment strikes provisions on damages and \nvenue. Removing these provisions addresses recent concerns voiced by \ncertain Members of the House, and raised by the high-tech community.\n  Finally, this managers' amendment wraps in Senator Bennet's \npreviously offered amendment to provide a 50-percent reduction in fees \nfor small business accelerated patent applications at the PTO, as well \nas some technical amendments. This break for small businesses, which \ndrive innovation and create jobs, will better enable them to compete \nwith the demands of the 21st century.\n  As we return to the America Invents Act, I encourage any Senator who \nhas a germane amendment to come and debate it now. This is bipartisan \nlegislation that our economy desperately needs. It will allow the PTO \nto function, and our inventors and innovators to flourish. If any other \nSenators have amendments, this is the time. We need to move on to other \npressing matters as soon as we complete work on this bill.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on my \namendment to strike the damages and venue provisions from this \nlegislation. I thank the chairman and committee for working with my \noffice on this important amendment and incorporating it into the \nmanagers' amendment.\n  I know the committee has been working tirelessly to address concerns \nwith this bill, and I applaud their efforts for trying to build \nconsensus.\n  As I discussed yesterday, I believe a well-functioning patent system \nis critical for our economic growth. The reforms in this legislation \nwill promote innovation and create jobs.\n  In my State alone, nearly 20,000 patent applications have been \ngranted between the years 2000 and 2009. These applications have \ncreated the foundation for our clean energy economy and emerging tech \nand bio industries.\n  Small inventors start new Colorado companies, and more established \ncompanies are able to expand their operations in a very competitive, \nknowledge-based economy.\n  An efficient and high-quality U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is \nessential to maintaining American leadership in innovation. The \nimprovements to the patent system in this bill will help us grow new \nindustries and will help cure the backlog and delay that has stunted \nthe ability of inventors to patent their ideas.\n  Right now, the average pendency period for a patent application is 36 \nmonths. That is unacceptable if we are to compete with the rest of the \nworld. This doesn't even account for those patents that have been tied \nup in years of litigation after they are granted.\n  This is why we need to ensure that patent owners have certainty. \nConsistency, uniformity, and fairness are essential to innovation.\n  Prolonged litigation and legal uncertainty only serve to stifle the \nincentive to innovate. We need clarity and efficient review by the \ncourts to make sure we don't have a system where patents are tied up \nfor years. Likewise, we also need to make sure there is a fair outcome \nwhere there is an infringement. Those whose rights are infringed have \nevery right to take their case to court and receive the appropriate \ndamages.\n  This is why I introduced my amendment on damages and venue. We need \nmore certainty for patent owners, and I think portions of the bill may \nnot do enough in this regard, in the face of litigation. In fact, the \nvenue and damages portions of the bill may actually generate more \nuncertainty, not less.\n  The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has made significant progress on \ndamages and venue issues. The courts are moving in the right direction, \nand I believe it is wiser to allow this process to run its course than \nto add a new layer of laws that could only serve to confuse patent \nlitigants. So in my view, congressional intervention on damages and \nvenue is not needed at this time.\n  I would like to close by again thanking the chairman for his \nleadership and willingness to take into account the views of others on \nthese important issues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the goal of the patent reform \nlegislation is to incentivize investment in the American economy, to \ncreate jobs, and allow this great country to continue to win in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  The amendment I am offering here today would do just that. It would \nincentivize innovation and investment by prioritizing patents that are \nvital to the American economy and American competitiveness. It will \nenable us, in essence, to incentivize that innovation by creating that \nprioritizing.\n  My amendment would allow the Patent Office to prioritize patent \napplications that are vital to our national interests.\n  Specifically, the amendment says the Patent Office Director may \nprioritize the examination of applications for technologies that are \nimportant to the national economy or national competitiveness, such as \ngreen technologies designed to foster renewable energy, clean energy, \nbiofuels, agricultural sustainability, environmental quality, \nconservation, or energy efficiency.\n  Currently, the Patent Office runs a green technology pilot program. \nAn application for green technologies may be fast-tracked, leading to \nan expedited decision. This fast-track process is reserved for a small \nnumber of applications that are vitally important, so it has little to \nno adverse impact on other patent applications.\n  Currently, the patent process is rather lengthy. Patent decisions \nregularly take 2 to 3 years for a final decision. Our country is at \nrisk of having vital new technologies buried in a sea of paperwork at \nthe Patent Office. We want to make sure patents that are important to \nour national economy are fast-tracked rather than sidelined.\n  The goal here is to create jobs at home. We have to make sure the \nPatent Office has the resources and ability to prioritize patents that \ndo just that--create jobs, incentivize investment, and support \ninnovation. The Patent Office supports this amendment because they need \nthe tools to make sure this bill reaches its intended goal of improving \nAmerica's economy.\n  This amendment will create green jobs and support America's \ntransformation to a self-sustaining economy that, among other things, \nis not reliant on foreign oil.\n  It is vitally important we do our best to ensure that all Americans \nhave good-paying jobs and that we secure our Nation's economic future.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. It codifies an \nexisting, successful program at the Patent Office. It is good \ncommonsense policy that can help America propel forward in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nAmerica Invents Act of 2011. As we all know, innovation, hard work, and \ningenuity long have been the fuel of the American dream. This bill will \nmake much needed improvements to our patent system to unleash the full \npower of American innovation once again. I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  Before I speak in more detail about the importance of this bill, I \nwould like to recognize the hard work of Senator Leahy, the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee. He long has sought to change our patent system \nfrom a drag on innovation into a driver of innovation. Chairman Leahy \nhas led bipartisan negotiations on this bill, seeking input from all \nsegments of the American intellectual property community. I applaud his \nwork with Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, and others of our colleagues \nin bringing this much needed legislation to the floor.\n  I take particular interest in this bill because of Rhode Island's \nlong and proud history of innovation, from the birth of the American \nindustrial revolution to the high-tech entrepreneurs leading our State \nforward today. An area has developed in Providence, for example, that \nis rightfully known by the nickname ``the Knowledge District'' for its \nremarkable innovation. We need to take every opportunity to support \nsuch work across our Nation.\n  Make no mistake, this legislation will drive innovation and create \nhigh-quality jobs. It will secure the foundations of new small \nbusinesses, encourage the discoveries made every day in our \nuniversities, and allow American companies to continue to lead the \nworld in technology, medicine, and mechanical science.\n  Patent reform may be complicated, but these are not abstract issues. \nIn my conversations with innovators in Rhode Island, it has become \nclear to me that the problems in our patent system are real and need to \nbe fixed. Fail to do so and we will pay the price in jobs and \ninternational competitiveness.\n  Perhaps the most consistent concern I have heard back home has \nrelated to delays in the issuance of patents. Massive backlogs of \npatent applications persist at the Patent and Trademark Office, causing \nyears of uncertainty over whether an innovator in fact has secured \nintellectual property rights in his or her invention. We have to fix \nthis problem. Innovators in Rhode Island and elsewhere in this country \nmust be able to gain patent protection for their inventions within a \nreasonable timeframe. Uncertainty and delay in patent protection will \ndampen and frustrate innovation.\n  The America Invents Act takes on this problem by allowing the Patent \nand Trademark Office discretion to set its own fees. Coupled with \nexceptions that will ensure low fees for small businesses, this \nprovision will enable the Patent and Trademark Office to better manage \nits resources and reduce examination times.\n  I also support Senator Coburn's amendment to restrict fee-diversion \nand enable the Patent and Trademark Office, which does not depend at \nall on taxpayer funding, to be properly resourced with examiners who \ncan work through the patent application backlog. This provision raises \nissues\n\n[[Page S1053]]\n\nbeyond the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee and as a result was \nnot considered previously, but I trust it will win the support of our \ncolleagues on the floor. I am glad that this provision has been \nincluded in the managers' amendment, of which I am a cosponsor.\n  My conversations with Rhode Island inventors also made clear that the \nfear of protracted litigation also dampens innovation. Unfortunately, \nnumerous poor-quality patents have issued in recent years, resulting in \nseemingly endless litigation that casts a cloud over patent ownership. \nAdministrative processes that should serve as an alternative to \nlitigation also have broken down, resulting in further delay, cost, and \nconfusion.\n  The America Invents Act will take on these problems by ensuring that \nhigher quality patents issue in the future. This will produce less \nlitigation and create greater incentives for innovators to commit the \neffort and resources to create the next big idea. Similarly, the bill \nwill improve administrative processes so that disputes over patents can \nbe resolved quickly and cheaply without patents being tied up for years \nin expensive litigation.\n  This body must not pass up this chance to enhance innovation and \nenergize our economy. We must see this bill through the Senate, and we \nmust work with the House to see it passed promptly into law. It is true \nthat the bill is a compromise and may not reflect all of everyone's \npriorities. Improvements to the bill may still be possible. To that \nend, I expect a productive debate on the floor and a constructive \ndialog with the House. I look forward to continuing to work with the \nchairman, my colleagues, and all interested parties to craft a bill \nthat generates the broadest consensus possible.\n  But we must not lose sight of the need for action. Our patent system \nhas gone 60 years without improvements. It needs repair. Now is the \ntime to energize our innovation economy, to create jobs, and to secure \ncontinuing American leadership in the fields of medicine, science, and \ntechnology.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the America \nInvents Act generally and about the managers' amendment specifically. \nThe America Invents Act, also known as the patent reform bill, has been \npending for many years and has been the subject of extensive debate, \nnegotiation, and revisions. In its current draft, it does much needed \ngood to help protect the American innovation economy by updating and \nmodernizing our patent system.\n  The patent system in the United States is designed to protect \ninnovation and inventions and investment. But over the last several \ndecades, the Patent and Trademark Office has become bogged down and \noverburdened by inefficient process and outdated law. The result is a \nheavy burden on the innovative work that is the engine of our economy.\n  I wish to commend Senator Leahy. He has gone the extra mile for this \nbill for many years. I am proud and glad he is seeing his work come to \nfruition as we finally debate the bill on the floor. Passage of the \nbill is in sight. I also wish to commend the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, who worked with him, as well as \nSenator Kyl, who has taken a leading role on the Republican side, for \ntheir hard work in crafting a bill that effectively modernizes the \npatent system, while paying attention to the many and varied demands \ndifferent sectors of the economy exert upon it.\n  I am particularly pleased the chairman has decided to adopt the \nSchumer-Kyl amendment on business method patents into the managers' \namendment. It is a critical change that this bill finally begins to \naddress the scourge of business method patents currently plaguing the \nfinancial sector. Business method patents are anathema to the \nprotection the patent system provides because they apply not to novel \nproducts or services but to abstract and common concepts of how to do \nbusiness.\n  Often, business method patents are issued for practices that have \nbeen in widespread use in the financial industry for years, such as \ncheck imaging or one-click checkout. Because of the nature of the \nfinancial services industry, those practices aren't identifiable by the \nPTO as prior art and bad patents are issued. The holders of business \nmethod patents then attempt to extract settlements from the banks by \nsuing them in plaintiff-friendly courts and tying them up in years of \nextremely costly litigation.\n  This is not a small problem. Around 11,000 new applications for \npatents on business methods are filed every year, and financial patents \nare being litigated almost 30 times more than patents as a whole. This \nis not right, it is not fair, and it is taking desperately needed money \nand energy out of the economy and putting it into the hands of a few \nlitigants. So I am very pleased Congress is going to fight it.\n  The Schumer-Kyl amendment, which was included in the managers' \npackage we just adopted, will allow companies that are the target of \none of these frivolous business method patent lawsuits to go back to \nthe PTO and demonstrate, with the appropriate prior art, that the \npatent shouldn't have been issued in the first place. That way bad \npatents can be knocked out in an efficient administrative proceeding, \navoiding costly litigation.\n  One of the most critical elements of this amendment has to do with \nthe stay of litigation while review of the patent is pending at the \nPTO. The amendment includes a four-factor test for the granting of a \nstay that places a very heavy thumb on the scale in favor of the stay. \nIndeed, the test requires the court to ask whether a stay would reduce \nthe burden of the litigation on the parties and the court. Since the \nentire purpose of the transitional program at the PTO is to reduce the \nburden of litigation, it is nearly impossible to imagine a scenario in \nwhich a district court would not issue a stay.\n  In response to concerns that earlier versions of the amendment were \ntoo broad, we have modified it so it is narrowly targeted. We want to \nmake sure to capture the business method patents which are at the heart \nof the problem and avoid any collateral circumstances.\n  In conclusion, I believe the amendment takes an important step in the \ndirection of eliminating the kinds of frivolous lawsuits the \njurisprudence on business method patents have allowed. I am very \ngrateful to the chairman and the ranking member, Senator Kyl, and I \nsupport the managers' amendment and the America Invents Act as a whole.\n  Finally, I would like to say a few words about Senator Coburn's \nproposal on fee diversion. I think his idea, which is incorporated in \nthe managers' amendment, makes a lot of sense; that is, to let the PTO \nkeep the fees they charge so they are self-funded and we don't have to \nspend taxpayer money to fund them every year.\n  Last year, when we were debating the Wall Street reform bill, Senator \nJack Reed and I made a similar proposal for the SEC, which ultimately \ndidn't make it into the final bill. I just wanted to\n\n[[Page S1054]]\n\ntake this time to make a few points about this commonsense proposal.\n  First, for the last 15 years, the SEC hasn't spent a dime of taxpayer \nmoney. For 15 years, the SEC has had no impact on the deficit. This is \nbecause Congress, in 1996, amended the securities laws to provide that \n100 percent of the SEC's funding comes from registration and filing \nfees charged by the Commission.\n  Second, even though the SEC collects more in fees every year than it \nspends, the amount of the SEC's annual budget is determined by \nCongress, which has continually shortchanged the SEC. The SEC's budget \nhas been in the crosshairs for years, and their funding has been so \ninadequate that they have been compromised in their ability to pursue \ntheir core mission.\n  Third, the budget proposal in the House would continue the \nshortchanging of the SEC, cutting $40 million from its existing budget \nat a time when it needs resources more than ever.\n  Finally, a word about the current demands on the SEC. We gave that \nagency significant new responsibilities under the Dodd-Frank Act, in \nparticular to oversee the previously unregulated derivative markets. \nThat is an enormous undertaking that everybody agrees is necessary \nafter seeing the role that unregulated derivatives played in the \nfinancial crisis.\n  In closing, I would strongly suggest to my colleagues that if self-\nfunding makes sense for the PTO, it makes sense for the SEC. I am not \ngoing to call up my amendment now or my bill now, but I urge my \ncolleagues to support this commonsense proposal Senator Reed and I are \npushing and ensure it gets a full hearing in the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair for his time and attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/01/senate-section/article/S1054-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, today I recognize Youth \nArt Month and congratulate Samantha Kenaston of Mitchell, SD, on \ndesigning the winning State entry for the national student flag design \nprogram. Each March, the Council for Art Education sponsors National \nYouth Art Month. I appreciate the importance of arts education for \nchildren of all ages and am pleased with the work being done across \nSouth Dakota to promote and spotlight student artwork.\n  This year marks the 50th anniversary of National Youth Art Month. \nThis month, schools across our country will partner with local \nbusinesses and communities to support the arts and display students' \nart work. In South Dakota, the Dakota Discovery Museum in Mitchell, the \nAberdeen Recreation and Culture Center, and Presentation College in \nAberdeen are just a few of the partners that will be hosting galleries \nand shows to display the artwork of South Dakota's many talented \nstudent artists.\n  This is the first year South Dakota has participated in the Youth Art \nMonth flag design competition. Students from across our State designed \nflags to creatively represent the essence of our great State. I \ncongratulate Samantha ``Sam'' Kenaston on designing the winning flag \nfor the inaugural South Dakota Youth Art Month flag design competition. \nSam is a seventh grade student at Mitchell Middle School. According to \nSam's teacher, Ms. Renee Berg, Sam is a talented student and art is her \nfavorite class. Sam also has a love for animals, which is often \nreflected in her artwork, and she aspires to become a veterinarian when \nshe grows up.\n  Sam's winning flag features a drawing of a pheasant, the State bird \nof South Dakota. Sam's flag will be displayed on March 9, 2011, at a \nceremony in Washington, DC, to honor the winners of the State flag \ncompetition, and her flag will then be displayed in Seattle, WA, at the \nNational Art Education Conference.\n  As a member of the Senate Cultural Caucus, I recognize the importance \nof promoting arts and humanities in our communities and schools.

Mr. President, I come to the floor with the hardest \nspeech I have ever made, to pay tribute to Sean Patrick McGee, a member \nof my staff who passed away suddenly over the weekend at the very young \nage of 26.\n  There really are no words to describe the tragedy of losing somebody \nso young, especially someone like Sean, who was so smart and so filled \nwith promise. His death is painful for all of us who knew him, but the \nway he lived his life is really a source of hope and inspiration for \nus.\n  Every single day, Sean worked hard to help others. Before coming to \nmy office, he was a congressional liaison at the American Legion \nAuxiliary, where he was an advocate for veterans, servicemembers, and \ntheir families. He joined my team in April of 2009, and quickly \nimpressed everyone with his\n\n[[Page S1056]]\n\nwork ethic and his dedication. It didn't take long before he was \npromoted and took on additional responsibilities, working on some of \nthe most difficult and complex issues that in which we have been \ninvolved.\n  He was really the heart of my staff working on finance issues. He \nspent a lot of time with retirees who lost their pensions when our auto \ncompanies went through bankruptcy, and he talked with them all the time \nto keep them updated on what we were doing to help. He took the lead on \nhousing issues, working with families whose dreams were shattered when \ntheir homes were lost to foreclosure. He spent his final days working \non an amendment that I cosponsored to help retired pilots who lost \ntheir pensions when the airline they worked for went bankrupt. He was \nso proud that we were able to include that amendment in the Federal \nAviation Administration bill.\n  During our work last year on the Small Business Jobs Act, Sean's help \nwas absolutely invaluable. He put together information for small \nbusiness owners letting them know how to take advantage of the new law. \nHe grew up in Farmington Hills, MI, and he was a very important part of \nour team working on issues related to the automobile industry, so \ncritical for Michigan's future and for our economy.\n  He took great pride in his work for our great State. Through hard \nwork and service, he achieved the rank of Eagle Scout--the highest rank \nin scouting. When he applied for a job in our office he wrote, ``At a \nyoung age, I was volunteering to do community . . . service in Metro \nDetroit to better the community and that work shaped my desire to serve \nMichigan.'' And he served Michigan well.\n  In college, he secured a coveted internship in the office of the \nGovernor, working in constituent services. After graduation, he worked \non a congressional campaign and for Senator Levin's campaign, always \nwilling to lend a hand and make a difference.\n  What really stands out about Sean is how good he was with people. On \nCapitol Hill, patience is sometimes a rare commodity, but Sean had more \nthan enough to go around. When everyone was running a mile a minute, \nSean was a beacon of calm. When his coworkers were stressed to the \npoint of breaking, Sean could diffuse it with a wonderful one-liner \nthat brought everything back into context.\n  He was also an amazing friend and had a quiet, charming sense of \nhumor. His favorite day of the week was when the cafeteria served \nchicken wings. He would get a group together and go down to lunch on \n``wing day''--he looked forward to that day all week long.\n  Sean McGee was a young man who brightened so many of our days, and he \nwill be terribly missed.\n  I offer my sincerest condolences to his parents Tom and Sharon, to \nhis brother Tom, and to his girlfriend of many years, Katie Kulpa, whom \nSean loved so much. Sean was a gift to all of us, and we will always be \nthankful for the precious time we had with him.\n  Next Tuesday would have been Sean's 27th birthday. It is hard to \nbelieve we won't be able to celebrate with him. But we can honor him by \nliving our lives as he did.\n  William Penn, one of the founders of our great Nation, said, ``I \nexpect to pass through life but once. If therefore, there be any \nkindness I can show, or any good thing I can do to any fellow being, \nlet me do it now, and not defer or neglect it, as I shall not pass this \nway again.''\n  That is how Sean lived his life, and that was the gift that he gave \nto all of us who knew him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/01/senate-section/article/S1056-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO VICTORIA MALOCH\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I recognize Victoria Maloch \nfrom Magnolia, AR, for being selected for participation in the annual \nUnited States Senate Youth Program.\n  Created in 1962, the United States Senate Youth was organized to \nencourage an understanding of our government with an emphasis of how \nits three branches work and how elected officials work for their \nconstituents and create policies that impact our Nation and the world. \nThe weeklong visit to Washington, DC, allows students to meet and \ninteract with lawmakers, appointed officials and staff who are involved \nin crafting legislation and making decisions that influence our laws.\n  This program brings together some of our Nations top youth leaders, \nlike Victoria, who show a commitment to public service. An outstanding \nstudent at Emerson High School, Victoria excels both in and out of the \nclassroom.\n  She serves as president of the 4-H Club and Future Farmers of \nAmerica; vice president of Arkansas Junior Brangus Breeders \nAssociation; secretary of the Science Club and captain of Quiz Bowl. \nVictoria is a member of the Beta club, Future Business Leaders of \nAmerica, and Family Career and Community Leaders of America. She was a \nPeople-to-People ambassador and volunteers in her community with the \nYouth Advisory Council and Today's Youth Tomorrow's Leaders program. \nVictoria plans to attend the University of Arkansas and continue her \neducation in law school.\n  Victoria is very deserving of this honor. I congratulate her for her \ndetermination, dedication, and service and encourage her growth as a \nleader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/01/senate-section/article/S1056-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1056-S1057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           30TH ANNIVERSARY OF MARIN AGRICULTURAL LAND TRUST\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 30th anniversary of Marin Agricultural Land Trust, MALT. \nLocated in Marin County, CA, MALT was the first land trust in the \nUnited States to focus explicitly on farmland preservation. Since its \nfounding in 1980, MALT has successfully protected more than 41,800 \nacres of California's land on 66 family ranches and farms.\n  Thirty years ago, in response to a changing economy and increasing \nurban expansion, biologist Phyllis Faber and dairywoman Ellen Straus \nrecognized that in order to preserve Marin's 150-year-old tradition of \nfamily farming and protect the county's tremendous natural resources, \nranchers and environmentalists would need to work together. Phyllis and \nEllen cofounded MALT, bringing together a diverse coalition of ranchers \nand environmentalists who came together to pursue their vision for \nconserving Marin's pristine farmlands. By providing an alternative to \nthe sale of farmland, MALT has protected thousands of acres of open \ngrasslands, fertile floodplains, oak woodlands, and mixed evergreen \nforests that would otherwise have been sold or developed.\n  Working in areas stretching from the salt marshes of Tomales Bay to \nthe Douglas-fir forest crowning Hicks Mountain, MALT continues to be an \nenvironmental and community leader. In addition to establishing \neasements, MALT runs a variety of stewardship and educational programs, \nincluding its Farm Field Studies Program in which more than 1,700 \nstudents from 35 schools recently participated. MALT also coordinates \nhikes and tours, giving residents opportunities to explore and \nexperience Marin's stunning agricultural landscapes first hand.\n  MALT is also doing its part to reduce greenhouse gases and integrate \nthe agriculture industry into the fight against climate change. As a \nfounding member of the Marin Carbon Project, MALT is working with \nproject partners in an attempt to sequester carbon in Marin's rangeland \nsoil using agricultural management strategies.\n  Due to the dedicated efforts of its 5,000 members, staff, volunteers, \nfunders, and partner agencies, MALT has helped revitalize local \nagriculture while preserving the ecological value of the land. Each \nyear, Marin County produces millions of dollars in livestock, livestock \nproducts, feed, and crops, without diminishing the county's biological \nvitality.\n  Over the past year, despite difficult economic times, MALT achieved \npermanent protection for a goat dairy, a small-scale sheep ranch, and a \ngrade A Holstein dairy that has been in operation since 1933. These \ncrucial projects were funded through a combination of grants from \npublic agencies and donations from private individuals.\n  The Marin Agricultural Land Trust's vision and commitment to \nprotecting California's ecological, environmental, and agricultural \nendowment should be commended. Please join me in congratulating MALT \nfor its three decades\n\n[[Page S1057]]\n\nof hard work and wishing MALT much more success in the years to come. I \nlook forward to future generations having the opportunity to enjoy \nMarin County's rich agricultural tradition and natural beauty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/01/senate-section/article/S1057-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING FRED HILL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor \nthe memory of a very special man, Frederick ``Fred'' Hill of Sonoma \nCounty, who died on February 9, 2011. He was 75 years old.\n  Fred Hill was a man of many talents and will be fondly remembered for \nhis diverse work in the literary world. Born in Philadelphia, PA, Fred \nwent on to attend Brown University. Following graduation, Fred served \nin the Army before getting a job as a travelling textbook salesman with \nKnopf. He later worked for Little, Brown as a Western States salesman \nand then as head of the company's international division. Throughout \nthis transformative time of travel and networking, Fred realized his \ngift: he loved writers, he loved publishers, and he was uniquely gifted \nin his ability to interact with and explain one to the other.\n  Fred relocated to the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1970s. In \n1979, after 5 years as general manager at Sierra Club Books, he rented \nan office on Union Street and opened his own agency, which is now run \nby his business partner, Bonnie Nadell. Fred remained on Union Street, \nin one office or another, until he decided to move his business to Glen \nEllen, where he resided with his partner, Peter Gilliam.\n  The job of a literary agent is all encompassing, as their success \ndepends on their client's success. Authors bestow a great deal of trust \nto their agents, and I know personally that Fred Hill was an \noutstanding agent. He was able to be encouraging and yet be critical \nwhere warranted.\n  Fred worked diligently to advance the products and interests of his \nclients, and could always be counted on to excite virtually anyone \nabout a client's book. Fred's clients ranged from best-selling novelist \nRichard North Patterson to nonfiction writer Michael Murphy. He also \nworked with an extensive list of food writers, including Carol Field, \nHubert Keller, David Lebovitz, and Gerald Hirigoyen.\n  Those who knew Fred Hill recognized him as a uniquely innovative and \nbrilliant man. His work in the literary world will be remembered fondly \nby all those whose lives he touched. He will be deeply missed.\n  Fred is survived by his partner of 31 years, Peter Gilliam.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/01/senate-section/article/S1057-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SUE ROUST\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.

She has effectively managed 24 county elections as well as \nSioux Falls city and school elections. In total, she has overseen the \ncounting of over 1.3 million ballots.\n  Additionally, Sue manages the accounting functions for the county. \nDuring her 20 years of service, the county budget has quadrupled. She \nhas provided oversight and counsel on a number of important issues \nimpacting the county. She has also utilized her position as county \nauditor to educate the general public on numerous issues. She has \nmaintained a high level of professionalism and commitment to community \nservice during her two decades of service.\n  In addition to her elected service, Sue has served in various \nleadership capacities for many community organizations, including the \nPTA, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, United Way, the Sioux Falls Washington \nHigh School Booster Club, the Dow Rummel Village board of trustees, the \nSioux Falls Business and Professional Women, and the First \nCongregational Church. She currently serves on the board of Here4Youth, \nan organization which provides day care and out-of-school care to \nchildren ages 3-21 with a special emphasis on children with special \nneeds.\n  I commend Sue for her great dedication and commitment to the people \nof Minnehaha County and the State of South Dakota. She can take great \npride in her service.

Mr. President, today I wish to \npay tribute to the Dolan-Justice family on the 100th anniversary of \nowning the Grant County Review of Milbank, SD. This occasion highlights \nthe Dolan-Justice family commitment to the newspaper industry and to \nthe Grant County community.\n  On February 11, 1911, 24-year-old William S. Dolan acquired the Grant \nCounty Review. This started a 46-year adventure as editor of the small \ntown weekly newspaper. In a time with virtually no access to television \nor radio, the local newspaper was the only source of news for small \ntown South Dakota. With no experience in news media, William quickly \nlearned the ropes. The Grant County Review became a family affair. \nWilliam's wife, Christine Olson, was a trusted adviser to the paper, \nand his sister-in-law, Victoria Olson, even set the type on the \nlinograph machine by hand. While other surrounding newspapers folded, \nWilliam's accounting background and hard work enabled the Grant County \nReview to continue through the 20th century. A fierce rivalry began \nbetween the Grant County Review and the Herald Review, pitting each \npaper against each other for advertisers and breaking news stories. \nOften Dolan and the editor of the Herald Review would trade blows in \nthe editorial section of their papers.\n  Sticking with the family tradition for journalism, William's daughter \nPhyllis pursued a journalism degree at South Dakota State University \nand the University of Minnesota. She then came back to write for the \npaper and help her father run the day-to-day activities. The family \npaper soon hired a printer, Clarence Justice. Clarence worked for many \npapers before coming to the Grant County Review, including the Miller \nGazette, the Interlakes Daily, and the Miller Press. After William S. \nDolan passed away, his family took over operation of the Grant County \nReview, with his wife Christine served as the new publisher, and his \ndaughter Phyllis as the new editor.\n  William always fought for small business and rural farmers, and \nserved as the president for the Board of Regents, overseeing South \nDakota's public universities. In 1962, William S. Dolan was elected to \nthe South Dakota Newspaper Hall of Fame. In 1982, Phyllis was elected \nas the first female president of the South Dakota Press Association, \nand in 1988 she joined her father in the South Dakota Newspaper Hall of \nFame. Phyllis' boundary breaking honors serve as an inspiration to \nwomen in journalism. Clarence and Phyllis both received distinguished \nservice awards for their work in journalism for the South Dakota \nNewspaper Association. In 1997, the Grant County Review received the \ndistinguished Bishop Dudley award from the Diocese of Sioux Falls, for \nClarence and Phyllis' dedication to integrity and religious values. The \nGrant County Review has the largest readership of any weekly newspaper \nin the State. This achievement highlights the incredible devotion this \nfamily and the paper's employees have to the responsibility of \ndisseminating the news. I am proud to honor the Dolan-Justice family on \nreaching this hallmark, and on being reliable, responsible members of \nthe journalism community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/01/senate-section/article/S1057-4", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1057-S1058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:40 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that that House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 347.

A bill to withdraw certain land located in Clark County, \nNevada, from location, entry, and patent under the mining laws and \ndisposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing \nor mineral materials, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend Senator \nEnsign to introduce the Sloan Hills Withdrawal Act of 2010.\n  For nearly a decade, there has been heated debate over a proposal to \npermit a sand and gravel mine on public lands next door to a Henderson \ncommunity with over 13,000 residents--many of whom are retired seniors. \nLocal citizens have voiced serious safety and community health concerns \nabout the mine. I have listened to their concerns and share their \nopposition to the mine.\n  That is why I am re-introducing legislation to stop the development \nof the proposed 640-acre gravel pit by withdrawing the area from \nlocation, entry, and patent under the mining laws and disposition under \nall laws pertaining to mineral materials. This legislation ensures the \nsafety of Nevadans and puts an end to this proposed mining operation \nonce and for all.\n  The opposition to the proposed gravel mine is overwhelming. I have \nreceived petitions with thousands--literally thousands--of signatures \nfrom people who are up in arms over the proposed gravel mine because of \nits potential effect on the health of residents and the toll that \noperations would have on an otherwise peaceful community. The project \nwould be located on federal land, so local governments are limited in \ntheir ability to influence the outcome of the Sloan Hills proposal. It \nis clear, though, that the location envisioned for this project is not \nin the best interests of our community.\n  Despite strong local opposition, the Bureau of Land Management has \nundertaken an evaluation of the proposed gravel operation at Sloan \nHills. If approved, the resulting mine would blast rock, crush gravel, \nkick up dust, and consume precious water resources up to twenty-four \nhours a day, every day, for thirty years. This would all be done just a \nstone's throw away from peaceful Henderson neighborhoods. Residents are \njustifiably worried that this project will reduce their home values, \nharm their health, and impact their overall quality of life.\n  Most troublesome to Henderson residents are large clouds of fine \nparticulate matter that would be generated by mining activities at the \nSloan Hills site. This dust pollution, kicked up by the proposed gravel \noperation, could exacerbate air quality challenges in the Las Vegas \nValley and would be particularly troublesome for the nearby, age-\nrestricted communities--home to many seniors already suffering from \nrespiratory problems.\n  This bill is important to me and to the people of southern Nevada. I \nwant to thank Steve Sisolak, vice chair of the Clark County Commission, \nfor all his hard work championing this issue in Southern Nevada. \nKeeping our communities safe, healthy, and livable is critical.\n  I appreciate your help and I look forward to working with Chairman \nBingaman, Ranking Member Murkowski and the other distinguished members \nof the Senate Energy Committee to move this legislation forward in the \nnear future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 427\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

It \n     banned them from government and military leadership posts, \n     the social pension system, and public schools and \n     universities unless they concealed their faith.'';\n       Whereas, on October 15, 2010, the United Nations Secretary-\n     General issued a special report on human rights in Iran, \n     stating that ``the Baha'i, who comprise the country's largest \n     non-Muslim religious minority, face multiple forms of \n     discrimination and harassment, including denial of \n     employment, Government benefits and access to higher \n     education'';\n       Whereas, on December 21, 2010, the United Nations General \n     Assembly adopted a resolution (A/RES/65/226) noting ``serious \n     ongoing and recurring human rights violations'' in Iran, \n     including against the Baha'i community;\n       Whereas, in November 2007, the Ministry of Information of \n     Iran in Shiraz jailed Baha'is Ms. Raha Sabet, 33, Mr. Sasan \n     Taqva, 32, and Ms. Haleh Roohi, 29, for educating \n     underprivileged children, and gave them 4-year prison terms;\n       Whereas Ms. Sabet remains imprisoned in Iran;\n       Whereas Ms. Sabet, Mr. Taqva, and Ms. Roohi were targeted \n     solely on the basis of their religion;\n       Whereas, in March and May of 2008, intelligence officials \n     of the Government of Iran in Mashhad and Tehran arrested and \n     imprisoned Mrs. Fariba Kamalabadi, Mr. Jamaloddin Khanjani, \n     Mr. Afif Naeimi, Mr. Saeid Rezaie, Mr. Behrouz Tavakkoli, \n     Mrs. Mahvash Sabet, and Mr. Vahid Tizfahm, the members of the \n     coordinating group for the Baha'i community in Iran;\n       Whereas, in August 2010, the Revolutionary Court in Tehran \n     sentenced the 7 Baha'i leaders to 20-year prison terms on \n     charges of ``spying for Israel, insulting religious \n     sanctities, propaganda against the regime and spreading \n     corruption on earth'';\n       Whereas the lawyer for these 7 leaders, Mrs. Shirin Ebadi, \n     the Nobel Laureate, has been denied all access to the \n     prisoners and their files;\n       Whereas these 7 Baha'i leaders were targeted solely on the \n     basis of their religion;\n       Whereas, in February 2011, the Revolutionary Court in \n     Tehran sentenced human rights activist and follower of the \n     Baha'i faith, Navid Khanjani, to a 12-year prison term on \n     charges of ``propaganda against the regime by publishing \n     news, reports, and interviews with foreign TV and radio,'' \n     among others;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran is party to the \n     International Covenants on Human Rights; and\n       Whereas the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, \n     and Divestment Act of 2010 (Public Law 111-195) authorizes \n     the President and the Secretary of State to impose sanctions \n     on ``the officials of the Government of Iran and other \n     individuals who are responsible for continuing and severe \n     violations of human rights and religious freedom in Iran'': \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate\n       (1) condemns the Government of Iran for its state-sponsored \n     persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued \n     violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights;\n       (2) calls on the Government of Iran to immediately release \n     the seven leaders and all other prisoners held solely on \n     account of their religion, including Mrs. Fariba Kamalabadi, \n     Mr. Jamaloddin Khanjani, Mr. Afif Naeimi, Mr. Saeid Rezaie, \n     Mr. Behrouz Tavakkoli, Mrs. Mahvash Sabet, Mr. Vahid Tizfahm, \n     Ms. Raha Sabet, and Mr. Navid Khanjani;\n       (3) calls on the President and Secretary of State, in \n     cooperation with the international community, to immediately \n     condemn the Government of Iran's continued violation of human \n     rights and demand the immediate release of prisoners held \n     solely on account of their religion, including Mrs. Fariba \n     Kamalabadi, Mr. Jamaloddin Khanjani, Mr. Afif Naeimi, Mr. \n     Saeid Rezaie, Mr. Behrouz Tavakkoli, Mrs. Mahvash Sabet, Mr. \n     Vahid Tizfahm, Ms. Raha Sabet, and Mr. Navid Khanjani; and\n       (4) urges the President and Secretary of State to utilize \n     all available measures, such as those available under the \n     Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment \n     Act of 2010 and Executive Order 13553, to sanction officials \n     of the Government of Iran and other individuals directly \n     responsible for egregious human rights violations in Iran, \n     including against the Baha'i community.\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bipartisan \nresolution with my colleague Senator Durbin condemning the government \nof Iran for its state-sponsored persecution of the Baha'i minority.\n  Founded in Iran in 1844, the Baha'i faith now has more than 5 million \nadherents in 236 countries and territories. The Baha'is comprise the \nlargest religious minority in Iran.\n  The Baha'is preach tolerance, diversity and equality. Yet since the \nIslamic Revolution of 1979, the Baha'is have faced brutal and \nunrelenting persecution in Iran. According to the U.S. State \nDepartment, more than 200 Baha'is have been killed since 1979.\n  The Baha'is are regularly denied employment, access to higher \neducation, and face multiple forms of discrimination and harassment.\n  In August 2010, the Iranian government sentenced seven leaders of \nIran's Baha'i community to 20-year prison terms on charges of ``spying \nfor Israel, insulting religious sanctities, propaganda against the \nregime and spreading corruption on earth.'' Their lawyer has been \ndenied all access to the Baha'i prisoners and their files. Last month, \nthe Revolutionary Court in Tehran sentenced a Baha'i human rights \nactivist, Navid Khanjani, to a 12-year prison term on charges that \nincluded ``propaganda against the regime by publishing news, reports, \nand interviews with foreign TV and radio.''\n  The United States and the international community need to act now.\n  The bipartisan resolution condemns the Iranian regime's continued \npersecution of its Baha'i minority, calls on the regime to release \nBaha'i political prisoners and urges President Obama and Secretary \nClinton to designate Iranian officials and other individuals directly \nresponsible for egregious human rights violations in Iran.\n  The plight of Baha'is in Iran should be deeply personal to all \nAmericans. I call on the administration to elevate human rights in \nIran, including the plight of Iranian Baha'is, to the top of the \ninternational agenda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/01/senate-section/article/S1062-2", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1062-S1068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 81--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY COMMITTEES OF THE \n SENATE FOR THE PERIODS MARCH 1, 2011, THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2011, AND \n   OCTOBER 1, 2011, THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2012, AND OCTOBER 1, 2012, \n                       THROUGH FEBRUARY 28, 2013\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nRules and Administration; which was placed on the calendar:\n\n                               S.

The agency supports \nmilitary commanders and policymakers throughout the U.S. Government.\n  In fact, as Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, \nI regularly review DIA intelligence products. The DIA produces a daily \nset of classified intelligence products, called\n\n[[Page S1070]]\n\nthe Defense Intelligence Digest, which is provided to our Committee \neach morning. The agency also produces longer reports on foreign \nmilitary capabilities, strategic reviews, and other issues of interest \nto defense and other policymakers.\n  But producing finished intelligence analysis is only one of DIA's \nmissions. Employing a diverse workforce of military and civilian \nintelligence professionals, DIA conducts all-source analysis, \nintelligence collection, and information technology infrastructure \nsupport worldwide.\n  DIA's responsibilities inside the Department of Defense and across \nthe Intelligence Community have grown significantly over the years. The \nagency today is responsible for the Defense Attache System, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and HUMINT Center, the National Defense \nIntelligence College, the National Media Exploitation Center, the \nNational Center for Credibility Assessment and four specialized \ncenters: the Underground Facility Analysis Center, the National Center \nfor Medical Intelligence, the Joint Intelligence Task Force-Combating \nTerrorism and the Missile and Space Intelligence Center.\n  DIA also oversees intelligence analysis throughout the Department of \nDefense, including analytic work performed at the Army National Ground \nIntelligence Center, the Office of Naval Intelligence, the Air Force \nNational Air and the Space Intelligence Center, the Marine Corps \nIntelligence Activity, and ten U.S. combatant command intelligence \noperations centers.\n  Over the last 50 years, the intelligence collected and analyzed by \nthe men and women of DIA has informed the Nation's civilian and \nmilitary leaders during crises and conflicts--from the Cold War to the \ncurrent struggle against international terrorism. DIA has played a \nvital role in collecting, analyzing, and producing intelligence \nrequired to defend the Nation while also supporting U.S. military \noperations worldwide.\n  During the past 5 decades, DIA has transformed in response to \nevolving national security threats. From the Cuban Missile Crisis and \nthe Vietnam conflict, to the first Gulf War, DIA's efforts have focused \non understanding and, if necessary, defeating state-sponsored \nmilitaries while also providing strategic warning and preventing \nstrategic surprise.\n  Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington almost \nten years ago, DIA has responded to the asymmetric threat posed by \ntransnational terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda by pushing more \nanalytic and collection capabilities forward in direct support of our \nmilitary forces in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. Today the agency \nis more forward deployed with soldiers on the battlefield than at any \ntime in its history.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I receive \nfrequent briefings from DIA personnel. Their depth of knowledge and \nexpertise on foreign military intentions and capabilities has been \nimpressive.\n  I've met twice within the past few weeks with the current DIA \nDirector, Lieutenant General Ronald Burgess. He, like his predecessors, \npresents the facts like he sees them and manages to serve the \nIntelligence Community and the Department of Defense with skill and \nintegrity.\n  I am keenly aware of the many sacrifices our intelligence \nprofessionals make to help defend our Nation and I am pleased that this \nresolution pays tribute to the DIA workforce and the DIA employees who \nhave given their lives, or have been wounded or injured, in the line of \nservice.\n  Because of the nature of intelligence and the need for secrecy, we in \nCongress often are understandably reluctant to draw unnecessary \nattention to our intelligence services and the vital and sometimes \ndangerous work they do to protect our Nation. However, at this \nimportant 50th anniversary, it is appropriate to reflect on DIA's \nhistory of important contributions while also honoring its \nprofessionals, past and present.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the men and women of \nDIA as they celebrate their legacy and forge their future.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Defense \nIntelligence Agency and a resolution that Chairman Feinstein and I have \nintroduced in honor of DIA's 50th Anniversary. The Defense Intelligence \nAgency is an integral part of the Department of Defense, our combatant \ncommands, and the intelligence community. I want to congratulate the \nAgency and its employees on the approaching 50th Anniversary.\n  The Defense Intelligence Agency was established in 1961 under \nSecretary of Defense, Robert McNamara following a national debate on \ndefense reorganization after World War II. McNamara, acting on \nrecommendations of a Joint Study Group appointed by President \nEisenhower, created the DIA to consolidate and integrate military \nintelligence efforts. DIA began operations on October 1, 1961 with only \na handful of employees in borrowed office space in the Pentagon.\n  Shortly after its inception, DIA was thrust into the Cold War where \nDIA's analysts played a key role in the discovery of ballistic missiles \nin Cuba. However, the fledgling agency faced several early hurdles in \nthe 60's including the Vietnam War and the Soviet Union's invasion of \nCzechoslovakia. In the 70's and 80's, DIA focused much of its attention \non providing intelligence on the Soviet Union, but was finally coming \nof age as it was assigned support responsibilities to our combatant \ncommanders under the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Reorganization Act. The \n90's brought Operation DESERT STORM and bolstered DIA's mission as a \nCombat Support Agency with U.S. and United Nations forces in places \nsuch as Somalia, Rwanda, former Yugoslavia, and Kosovo.\n  The emergence of radical Islamic movements such as al-Qaida and the \nterrorist attacks of September 11th have ushered in a new era of \nintegration and cooperation in military intelligence. The intelligence \ncommunity has faced significant challenges and reorganization in recent \nyears, but DIA has stepped up to meet these challenges head-on.\n  DIA has worked diligently to deter, detect, and prevent acts of \nterror by providing intelligence to U.S. and coalition forces in \nsupport of the Global War on Terror, Operation Enduring Freedom in \nAfghanistan, and Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Today, DIA has over 16,000 employees worldwide and has become an \nintegral part of the Department of Defense and the intelligence \ncommunity. I want to thank them for their service to our country and \nall that they do for our warfighters, planners, and policymakers. I am \nsure that all of my colleagues will join me in congratulating them on \ntheir upcoming 50th Anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/03/01/senate-section/article/S1070-1", "month": "03", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1070-S1071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 118.
