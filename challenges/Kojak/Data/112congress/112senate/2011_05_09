Mr. President, every time we have a peaceful transfer of \npower at any level of our government, it speaks to the strength of our \ndemocracy. Today is no different.\n  Today, Nevada welcomes our newly appointed Senator, Dean Heller--\nuntil a few minutes ago, Congressman Heller--to this side of the \nCapitol. Nevada is still reeling, more than most, from the Wall Street \nrecession that crashed our housing and jobs markets. I look forward to \nworking with our new junior Senator to make the tough choices that will \nhelp our State and our citizens recover.\n  The Senate will soon confront one of those tough choices. We will \ncontinue our conversation about how to save taxpayer money and lower \nour Nation's deficit and debt. We have to recognize that we cannot do \neither so long as we keep giving away money to oil companies that \nclearly do not need taxpayer handouts. As gas prices and oil company \nprofits keep rising, each Senator will soon have the opportunity to \nstand with the millionaires or with the middle class.\n  Also, today the Senate will vote on whether to advance the nomination \nof the Attorney General's top deputy, Jim Cole. The Deputy Attorney \nGeneral runs the day-to-day operations at the Department of Justice. He \nalso supervises the National Security Division and makes critical \ndecisions each day that affect the safety of our great Nation. For \ninstance, Jim Cole is one of the only people at the Department of \nJustice who can sign the critical warrants that permit our intelligence \nofficials to conduct surveillance on suspected terrorists.\n  In the last week, our country has been reminded of the incredibly \nimportant role our intelligence community plays. It is unthinkable that \npartisanship and legislative ploys are keeping a public servant as well \nqualified as Jim Cole out of this important national security role. I \nhope the Senate will confirm him quickly this evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/09/senate-section/article/S2756-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am going to devote my leader time \nthis afternoon to an issue which may not be on the Democrats' \nlegislative agenda this week but which is certainly on the minds of \nmost Americans every day. I am referring, of course, to the high cost \nof gasoline. All across the country, people are suffering from the \nrunup in gas prices we have seen over the past few months. It is \nsqueezing family budgets, tightening margins at already struggling \nsmall businesses, and it poses a mortal threat to any economic rebound.\n  This is a critical issue. Americans are looking for answers. Yet all \nthey are getting from the President and the Democratic leaders in \nCongress are gimmicks and deflection. We have seen this before. Every \ntime gas prices go up, Democrats claim there is nothing they can do \nabout it. Then they propose something completely counterproductive just \nto quiet their critics. This time, it is a tax increase. That is the \nDemocratic response to high gas prices--a tax hike.\n  Well, the first thing to say about this proposal is that it will not \ndo a thing to lower gas prices--not a thing. In fact, raising taxes on \nAmerican energy production will increase the price of gas. Oh, and it \nwould also make us even more dependent on foreign sources of oil. Now, \nthat is not my view. That is the view of the independent Congressional \nResearch Service, which concluded in March that the Democrats' proposed \ntax increase on energy production would ``make oil and natural gas more \nexpensive for U.S. consumers and likely increase foreign dependence.'' \nIt sounds like a brilliant strategy to me.\n  Beyond raising taxes, Democrats insist there is nothing they can do \nabout gas prices, but I think most Americans feel differently. I think \nmost Americans believe it is time to stop talking about what we cannot \ndo and start talking about what we can do. If the President and \nDemocrats in Congress are truly serious about lowering gas prices and \nmaking us less dependent on foreign sources of oil, here are a few \nsuggestions.\n  First, if ever there was a moment to develop our resources here at \nhome, it is now. For decades, Democrats have resisted efforts to tap \nour American resources. Then when gas prices go up, they tell us how \nmany years it would take to get the product to market. It is time to \ntake this excuse off the table by breaking the cycle.\n  Second, Democrats need to allow energy companies to cut through the \nbureaucratic redtape that prevents companies that are authorized to \nexplore here from getting to work and putting thousands of Americans \nback to work.\n  Third, they need to stop penalizing America's producers with new fees \nand threats of tax hikes, which only drive energy companies overseas \nand help our foreign competitors and create jobs in places such as \nVenezuela. And they need to call an end to the anti-energy crusade of \nthe EPA.\n  In short, Democrats need to throw away the old playbook--throw that \none away--and face this crisis with a new kind of creativity, \nindependence, and common sense that the American people are demanding.\n  Democrats need to stop deflecting attention from their own complicity \nin our Nation's overdependence on foreign oil. They need to stop paying \nlipservice to the need for American exploration while quietly \nsupporting efforts to suppress it. They need to end an approach that \nhas not changed, frankly, since the days of Jim Carter. Just like \nCarter before them, today's Democrats are using the crisis of the \nmoment as an excuse to push their own vision of the future with a \n``windfall profits tax'' on energy companies. And just like Carter \nbefore them, they have rightly been accused of bringing a BB gun to the \nwar.\n  This is a serious crisis. It is time for serious solutions--solutions \nthat create jobs instead of moving them overseas, solutions that \ndecrease our dependence on foreign sources of oil rather than increase \nit, solutions that offer relief rather than mere rhetoric.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/09/senate-section/article/S2756-6", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2756-S2757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Vice President Biden has been kind enough to host \ndiscussions--starting last week and going into this week and perhaps \nbeyond--with Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives to \ntry to find a way to reduce the huge debt that hangs over the United \nStates, as a prelude, I am sure he would put it, to the Congress acting \non the President's request that Congress increase the debt ceiling.\n  There have been generally two ways suggested on how to deal with our \ndebt. Many Democrats believe the wealthy in the United States do not \npay enough taxes, and therefore one way to reduce the debt is for taxes \nto be increased, especially on the wealthy. Most Republicans believe \nthat is a bad idea, that since debt is our problem and we got into debt \nbecause we have been spending too much, the better way for us to deal \nwith the problem is to begin reducing our spending and to make sure \nover the years we are able to do that.\n  There are a couple of interesting things that have just come out in \nthe news recently that I think bear on this argument.\n  A lot of folks wonder about the debt burden in the United States, and \nI think it is useful to point out the fact that last week the Wall \nStreet Journal reported that the Joint Committee on Taxation found that \n``the percentage of U.S. households paying no federal income tax . . . \nreached 51% for [the year] 2009.'' I think that is the first time in \nthe history of America that over half of Americans didn't pay Federal \nincome taxes. I do not think that is a good thing. While certainly \npeople in the lower income brackets are not able to pay very much in \nthe way of taxes, I think even a very small amount, an affordable \namount, would be appropriate so everybody has what they call skin in \nthe game, so everybody understands the relationship between the burdens \nand the benefits of government. I would not impose a significant tax on \nthe lower half or certainly not the lower 10 percent, but I think it is \nimportant for all Americans to know we all have a stake in this, and \nthat more than half of the people cannot just expect the so-called \nwealthy to bear all of the burdens of government.\n  But the question remains, are American wealthy taxpayers undertaxed? \nI think a useful measure to look at here is a comparison with other \ncountries, for example. The OECD countries--which stands for \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development--are generally \nregarded as the most advanced economies in the world, and the United \nStates is one of those countries.\n  A study that is based on 2008 statistics found that the highest \nearning 10 percent of the U.S. population paid the largest share among \n24 countries examined, even after adjusting for their relatively higher \nincomes, and it concluded:\n\n       ``Taxation is most progressively distributed in the United \n     States,'' the OECD concluded.\n\n  The bottom line here is that for a country to be competitive, the \npeople who provide the capital for job creation, for economic growth, \nhave to have some capital remaining after they have earned it in order \nto invest that capital, return it to their businesses, hire more \npeople, be more productive, create more wealth, and thereby provide for \nthe families of the people who own the businesses and, by earning more \nincome, increase the amount the Federal Government and the State \ngovernment take in as revenues.\n  Republicans are very happy to concede it would be helpful if the \ngovernment has more revenues in order to help close this debt gap we \nhave. The question is how we get more revenues. We believe more \nrevenues are a function of a growing economy. Here too some statistics \nthat just came out over the weekend, I believe it was, demonstrated \nthat we can actually delay the increase in the debt ceiling by some \nperiod of time because revenues to the Federal Treasury have been a \nlittle higher than previously expected. Why? Because the economy grew \nmore than expected, and as people made more money, they therefore paid \nmore in withholding and in Federal income taxes. That is the way for \nthe government to get more revenue--for the economy to do better, for \nAmericans to do better.\n  So if you tax more the people who are the ones likely to do the \ninvesting into businesses, will you get more investment? Will you get \nmore Federal revenue? Well, you will get a little bit more to begin \nwith, but in the long run, you will get less. One of the reasons it is \nnot a good idea to tax more the very people whom we are referring to in \nthis study is because half of all the small business income reported is \nreported as part of the highest income tax bracket for individuals. In \nother words, small businesses do not pay as corporations, they pay as \nindividuals, and when a small businessman has to report his earnings, \nhe reports all of the income from his enterprise. A lot of that is \nbusiness expense, but that is how he has to report it. So you are \ntalking here about half of all that income reported being taxed at a \nhigher rate, if, in fact, the President and some of his colleagues have \ntheir way. That will reduce the amount of investment and growth in the \neconomy and thereby make it harder for us to pay off this large debt.\n  The advocates of a gigantic tax increase are really very \nshortsighted, therefore, in assuming that if they raise tax rates, they \nare going to get more revenues. That is what they tried to do in Japan \nduring the late 1990s. It did not work out. Japan went back into a deep \nrecession, and it is not going to be possible for them to generate \nexisting revenue with their higher tax rates.\n  The way you get robust growth is not with higher tax rates but with \nlower tax rates. A rapidly expanding economy does create new jobs and \nincome for investment and wealth-creating enterprises, and obviously \nsome of that wealth flows back to the government and can be used to \nreduce the debt.\n  But the policy tools we decide upon in these negotiations will have a \nlot to say about how we are able to reduce the debt and whether part of \nthat will be a result of economic growth in the future. Obviously, the \npoint here is not just to have economic growth so the Federal \nGovernment can earn more in income tax revenue but to promote American \nprosperity and a better future for our families.\n  So the question is, Will we impose tax hikes that discourage \ninvestment and punish job creation or will we make the tax system more \nefficient and conducive to growth?\n  I wish to cite a couple of studies to show why it is most important \nfor us to focus on reducing spending rather than raising tax rates, \nbecause spending cuts, not tax hikes, are the best way to close the \nmassive budget gap and help to produce economic growth in our country.\n  One study was performed by two Harvard economists, Alberto Alesina \nand Silvia Ardagna. By studying large-scale fiscal adjustments by \nwealthy developed countries from 1990 to 2007, they determined that \n``spending cuts are much more effective than tax increases in \nstabilizing the debt and avoiding economic downturns.'' Moreover, they \nfound ``several episodes in which spending cuts adopted to reduce \ndeficits have been associated with economic expansions rather than \nrecessions.''\n  Two economists at Goldman Sachs, Ben Broadbent and Kevin Daly, \nundertook a similar study and reviewed every major fiscal correction in \nwealthy nations since 1975. They found:\n\n       Decisive budgetary adjustments that have focused on \n     reducing government expenditures have (i) been successful in \n     correcting fiscal imbalances; (ii) typically boosted growth; \n     and (iii) resulted in significant bond and equity market \n     outperformance. Tax-driven fiscal adjustments, by contrast, \n     typically fail to correct fiscal imbalances and are damaging \n     for growth.\n\n  So reducing spending was the way not only to reduce the debt of the\n\n[[Page S2758]]\n\ncountry, but it also boosted growth; whereas, tax-driven adjustments \nhad exactly the opposite effect and failed to correct fiscal imbalances \nand were damaging for growth.\n  A final study--and I think this is interesting because it focuses on \nwhat we think are big-spending countries. It is by the same two \neconomists, Broadbent and Daly. They pointed specifically to Ireland, \nSweden, and Canada. They pointed out cases driven by cuts in public \nspending. Sweden, in particular, which is famous for being a generous \nwelfare state, was able to trim the size of government substantially--\nall of which suggests to me that if Stockholm can do it, Washington \nought to be able to do it today.\n  Reducing the short-term deficit and stabilizing the long-term debt \nare critically important to American prosperity and living standards, \nand if you do it by reducing spending rather than increasing tax rates, \nyou can also have the additional benefit of increasing prosperity not \njust for businesses and families but for the U.S. Government, which \nwould then make more in terms of income tax revenues.\n  The bottom line here is when we work to forge this bipartisan \ncompromise that everybody is looking to us to reach, we should bear \nthese basics principles in mind: Cutting spending, not raising taxes, \nis the answer.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have two documents printed in the Record. \nThe first one was published in the National Review Online, dated May 9, \ncalled ``The Future of American Prosperity,'' which I authored. The \nsecond is a publication which was in weeklystandard.com on May 16, by \nFrederick Kagan and Kimberly Kagan.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the National Review Online, May 9, 2011]\n\n                   The Future of American Prosperity\n\n                          (By Senator Jon Kyl)\n\n\n Spending cuts, not tax increases, are the solution to our debt crisis\n\n       Members of both parties agree that Washington's present \n     fiscal course is dangerously unsustainable. We're now \n     borrowing 40 cents for every dollar we spend. This profligacy \n     continues to weaken the dollar, threatening its status as the \n     global reserve currency and fostering anxiety in the bond \n     markets. Last month, Standard & Poor's delivered a sobering \n     wake-up call when it revised its outlook on the U.S. long-\n     term credit rating from ``stable'' to ``negative.''\n       No question, our accounts must be brought into balance--but \n     not at the expense of economic growth. Those who advocate \n     gigantic tax increases are short-sighted. Amid a sluggish \n     recovery, abrupt tax hikes could drive the economy back into \n     recession. (That's what happened in Japan during the late \n     1990s.) Moreover, it will be impossible to generate \n     sufficient revenue without robust growth. A rapidly expanding \n     economy creates new jobs and income for investment in wealth-\n     creating enterprises. Some of that wealth flows back to the \n     government and can be used to reduce the debt.\n       The policy tools we use to restore fiscal stability will go \n     a long way toward shaping the future of American prosperity \n     and promoting the economic expansion we need. Will we impose \n     tax hikes that discourage investment and punish job creation? \n     Or will we make the tax system more efficient and conducive \n     to growth?\n       As these and other questions are debated, policymakers \n     should consult the evidence from other industrialized \n     countries, which overwhelmingly suggests that spending cuts, \n     not tax hikes, are the best way to close massive budget gaps \n     and help produce economic growth. Indeed, after studying \n     large-scale fiscal adjustments by wealthy, developed \n     countries between 1970 and 2007, Harvard economists Alberto \n     Alesina and Silvia Ardagna determined that ``spending cuts \n     are much more effective than tax increases in stabilizing the \n     debt and avoiding economic downturns.'' Moreover, they found \n     ``several episodes in which spending cuts adopted to reduce \n     deficits have been associated with economic expansions rather \n     than recessions.''\n       Goldman Sachs economists Ben Broadbent and Kevin Daly \n     recently undertook a similar study that reviewed every major \n     fiscal correction in wealthy nations since 1975. They found \n     that ``decisive budgetary adjustments that have focused on \n     reducing government expenditures have (i) been successful in \n     correcting fiscal imbalances; (ii) typically boosted growth; \n     and (iii) resulted in significant bond and equity market \n     outperformance. Tax-driven fiscal adjustments, by contrast, \n     typically fail to correct fiscal imbalances and are damaging \n     for growth.''\n       Broadbent and Daly pointed to successful fiscal adjustments \n     in Ireland (1987-89), Sweden (1994-98), and Canada (1994-97). \n     In each case, the adjustment was driven primarily by cuts in \n     public spending. Sweden in particular is famous for the \n     generosity of its welfare state. Yet, when faced with a \n     crisis, Swedish officials were able to trim the size of \n     government substantially. If Stockholm could do it back in \n     the mid-1990s, Washington can do it today.\n       Reducing the short-term deficit and stabilizing the long-\n     term debt are critically important to American prosperity and \n     living standards. But studies show that if fiscal \n     consolidation relies heavily on tax increases, it will stifle \n     economic growth and prove counterproductive.\n       This is the lesson we must apply as we try to forge a \n     genuine bipartisan compromise to deal with our debt crisis.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From WeeklyStandard.com, May 16, 2011]\n\n                        Bin Laden Is Dead . . .\n\n\n  But al Qaeda isn't--We should build on our success in Abbottabad by \n             redoubling our efforts to defeat his movement\n\n               (By Frederick W. Kagan and Kimberly Kagan)\n\n       Osama bin Laden's killing was a great moment for America \n     and for decent people around the world. But allowing the \n     euphoria of that moment to drive us to irresponsible \n     decisions in South Asia would be devastating to America's \n     interests and security. Al Qaeda has not yet been dismantled \n     or defeated.\n       Osama bin Laden's death has no implications for the number \n     of American or international forces in Afghanistan, for their \n     mission, or for the timeline for their reduction. George W. \n     Bush sent forces into Afghanistan not to kill bin Laden, but \n     to oust al Qaeda from its safe haven there, defeat that \n     organization, and create political conditions that would \n     preclude its return to Afghanistan. Barack Obama reaffirmed \n     that mission in his December 2009 speech setting out the \n     current strategy. He chose a counter-insurgency approach \n     because a return of the Taliban regime to Afghanistan would \n     allow al Qaeda to re-establish safe havens there, whether \n     drawing on the historical friendliness between the two or the \n     inability of the Taliban to prevent their return to the \n     country. Furthermore, the protracted, virulent insurgency \n     creates opportunities for al Qaeda-linked Pakistani proxies \n     such as the Haqqani network to invigorate international \n     terrorist groups and use them in the fight in Afghanistan. \n     President Obama has been pursuing the right strategy, and the \n     forces the United States and its international partners have \n     committed to executing it are--just barely--adequate to \n     achieve it.\n       The outcome of the war in Afghanistan hangs in the balance. \n     American forces and their allies made dramatic gains last \n     year, clearing the Taliban out of safe havens throughout \n     southern Afghanistan, their heartland. Eastern Afghanistan, \n     where al Qaeda-linked groups have a stronger presence, has \n     also seen considerable progress. Contrary to some media \n     reporting, neither al Qaeda nor Lashkar-e-Taiba has \n     established safe havens in the wake of the withdrawal of U.S. \n     forces from isolated river valleys in Kunar Province. In \n     fact, a series of offensive operations in the valleys and the \n     province has inflicted great harm on elements of those \n     organizations. Kunar's capital, Asadabad, is a growing and \n     increasingly thriving town, as we saw on a recent visit. And \n     Afghan Army troops have remained in some of the outposts from \n     which U.S. forces withdrew, demonstrating their determination \n     to control their own territory.\n       Although al Qaeda has not reestablished sanctuaries in \n     Afghanistan, it has not been for lack of trying. U.S. forces \n     only recently killed a senior Afghan al Qaeda official in \n     Kunar, and there is ample evidence that al Qaeda and Lashkar-\n     e-Taiba, among other Islamist groups, would welcome the \n     opportunity to set themselves up in a lawless Afghanistan \n     once again. The need to help Afghans establish a state that \n     can prevent the reemergence of terrorist sanctuaries remains \n     after bin Laden's death, and the current strategy, adequately \n     resourced, is the only way to achieve that goal. Calling for \n     accelerating the withdrawal is tantamount to declaring that \n     Afghanistan has become irrelevant with bin Laden's death and \n     that succeeding there is no longer important for America's \n     security.\n       Consequently, there is a great deal of fighting ahead. \n     Continued military engagements are needed to make precarious \n     improvements enduring and handle other challenges. The enemy \n     will work hard this year to retake its lost sanctuaries in \n     the south, to conduct spectacular attacks in Kabul and \n     elsewhere, and to strengthen its remaining safe havens in the \n     east. Our forces will try to hold and expand security gains \n     in the south and make progress in the east, but conditions \n     are not set for any major reductions in those forces.\n       If there is cause for cautious optimism in Afghanistan, \n     there are ample grounds for pessimism on the other fronts in \n     the struggle with militant Islamism. Bin Laden's presence in \n     Pakistan has once again concentrated the minds of Americans \n     on the fact that Pakistan's leadership has yet to come to \n     consensus about the need to combat and defeat militant \n     Islamist groups within Pakistan's borders. Nor has the United \n     States developed any real strategy for addressing this \n     challenge. We can hardly expand the campaign of targeted \n     strikes further, particularly after the recent raid deep into \n     Pakistani territory. And the drone campaign will not \n     defeat the virulent terrorist groups it is attacking. \n     Overreacting to suspicions of Pakistani complicity in bin\n\n[[Page S2759]]\n\n     Laden's presence in Abbottabad by suspending all aid or \n     military ties or by taking other drastic actions would \n     make it much harder, not easier, to operate against the \n     terrorists who threaten us.\n       On the contrary, withdrawing forces from Afghanistan and \n     cutting all aid to Pakistan would merely reinforce two of the \n     most prevalent conspiracy theories in South Asia--that the \n     United States will always abandon those who rely on it, and \n     that we were only there to get bin Laden anyway. We should, \n     instead, build on the symbolic victory of killing bin Laden \n     by following through with the president's strategy to \n     dismantle and defeat the militant Islamist groups supported \n     as proxies by some in the Pakistani security apparatus. Only \n     by defeating those proxies can we reasonably hope to compel \n     Pakistan to reevaluate its security interests and develop a \n     policy to oppose and suppress all militant Islamists \n     operating within its borders.\n       But al Qaeda has not confined itself to its sanctuaries in \n     Pakistan and Afghanistan. Al Qaeda thrives in political \n     weakness and has been in the process of expanding around the \n     globe. The core al Qaeda group of which bin Laden was the \n     head (often referred to as Al Qaeda Central) has long had at \n     best only a tenuous control over the operations of its \n     dispersed franchises. That control rested partly on resources \n     Al Qaeda Central directed, partly on the value of its \n     recognition of a particular group as worthy of the al Qaeda \n     brand, but largely on the symbolic importance of the \n     charismatic bin Laden. Bin Laden's likely successor, Egyptian \n     doctor Ayman al-Zawahiri, is far less charismatic. His \n     accession to the leadership role could prompt a competition \n     between Al Qaeda Central and its franchises over which group \n     really is at the center of the movement. Such competitions, \n     unfortunately, unfold in the form of spectacular attacks, \n     particularly those conducted on the territory of Western \n     states.\n       Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), in Yemen, is the \n     most active and perhaps the most dangerous al Qaeda franchise \n     in the world. The Arab Spring has reached Yemen with a \n     vengeance--massive protests have led to the defection of \n     elements of the Yemeni military, with the result that armed \n     forces are concentrating for potential civil war in and \n     around the capital and elsewhere in the country. Attempts to \n     broker a negotiated departure for Yemen's hated president, \n     Ali Abdullah Saleh, have broken down. It is far from clear \n     that any such agreement would keep the peace there for very \n     long in any case. Already Saleh has brought back to his \n     capital some of the elite, U.S.-trained Special Forces units \n     supposedly dedicated to the fight against AQAP. As the work \n     of Katherine Zimmerman at AEI's Critical Threats Project has \n     shown, almost any likely scenario going forward will give \n     AQAP more freedom to train, plan, stage, and conduct attacks \n     from increasingly lawless tribal areas in which it has \n     considerable local support. The combination of Yemen's slide \n     toward state failure and bin Laden's death could create a \n     tremendous opportunity for AQAP. His death may also lead to \n     an increase in AQAP's efforts to conduct spectacular attacks \n     against the United States and the West.\n       Another al Qaeda affiliate already has control over large \n     portions of a state: Al Shabab is the de facto government of \n     much of southern Somalia outside of Mogadishu. It has not \n     been formally recognized as an al Qaeda franchise, but its \n     ties with AQAP are long and deep, and its ideology closely \n     mirrors al Qaeda's. Shabab is kept from controlling all of \n     southern and central Somalia only by the presence of \n     peacekeepers from Uganda and Burundi, who have been barely \n     able to hold parts of the capital. Shabab is unlikely to \n     suffer at all from bin Laden's death, but it may see a \n     chance--or feel the need--to expand the reach of its strikes \n     in sympathetic retaliation.\n       Al Qaeda in Iraq, fortunately, remains relatively \n     ineffective, despite efforts to revive itself as American \n     forces withdraw. But the continued presence even of American \n     military trainers in Iraq after the end of this year remains \n     in doubt, and it is not clear that the Iraqi military on its \n     own will be able to maintain the necessary degree of pressure \n     on that al Qaeda franchise. If the complete withdrawal of \n     American forces now underway leads to the explosion of ethnic \n     conflict between Iraqi Arabs and Kurds, as some analysts \n     fear, Al Qaeda in Iraq could find fertile ground to \n     reestablish itself, undoing the progress we have made since \n     2006.\n       A protracted stalemate in Libya could also set conditions \n     for al Qaeda groups to pose again as the only reliable allies \n     of eastern fighters feeling abandoned by the United States \n     and the West. Although the current Libyan resistance \n     leadership is not penetrated by al Qaeda or supportive of \n     that organization or its ideology, eastern Libya is the area \n     that has produced the most al Qaeda fighters in that country \n     and that has the conditions most conducive to the injection \n     of al Qaeda's ideas and leaders.\n       More remote scenarios could see the rise of al Qaeda \n     franchises or fellow travelers in Egypt, elsewhere in North \n     Africa, the Levant, or Equatorial Africa, but there is no \n     need to belabor the point. The struggle with al Qaeda, to say \n     nothing of the larger struggle against militant Islamism \n     generally, is far from over. Clear and present dangers are, \n     in fact, emerging. It can be tempting to argue that these \n     threats merely show the wisdom of withdrawing from \n     Afghanistan, which is not now a center of al Qaeda activity, \n     to focus on more pressing problems elsewhere. We must resist \n     that temptation. Our struggle against Al Qaeda in the Arabian \n     Peninsula will not be helped by our giving its affiliates and \n     allies free rein in Afghanistan and returning Taliban leader \n     Mullah Omar, whom all al Qaeda affiliates recognize as ``the \n     leader of the faithful,'' to a position of power.\n       Success in Afghanistan and Iraq remains vital. American \n     withdrawal from either commitment will be taken throughout \n     the Islamist community as a sign of weakness and indecision. \n     But success in those two theaters is not enough. This moment \n     in the war with militant Islamism is the time to take stock \n     of our global strategy and to develop coherent approaches to \n     the dangers already visible on the horizon. No one wants to \n     invade Yemen, Somalia, Libya, or any other country. But the \n     strategies we have been relying on in Libya and Yemen are \n     failing, and we have never had a strategy for Somalia. The \n     United States must seek every possible way of averting the \n     dangers of stalemate, state collapse, and the triumph of al \n     Qaeda groups, preferably without deploying more of our own \n     forces.\n       It may be that, in the end, America simply cannot be secure \n     if terrorist groups with international ambitions have \n     uncontested control over sanctuaries and resources. But the \n     U.S. government has never yet focused its attention fully on \n     these challenges, let alone focused resources on them. It is \n     past time to do so. Those sincerely concerned with America's \n     security should be demanding that kind of commitment and \n     should reject utterly the notion that bin Laden's death will \n     allow us to declare ``mission accomplished'' and withdraw \n     from the Middle East, and the world.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, since my time is about expired, I will say \nthis is one of the best statements I have seen recently, by Frederick \nand Kimberly Kagan, where they write about the result of the death of \nbin Laden, not offering an excuse to end the war in Afghanistan or our \nother efforts against terrorists but, rather, that success will come to \nus when we understand the nature of the threat and maintain our efforts \nto root it out wherever it may be, whether that be in Afghanistan, \nIraq, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, or wherever. I think it is an excellent \npiece. I commend it to my colleagues as suggesting the way forward as \nwe continue to fight the radical Islamists who would continue to visit \nill on the United States and other western powers.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to call to the attention \nof the Senate the fact that a number of State legislatures, including \nour State legislature in Florida, have been enacting election law bills \nthat severely constrict the right of the people to express their vote.\n  This has just occurred in the State of Florida, with the legislature \nadjourning in the early morning hours of Saturday, enacting a bill that \nhas been sent to the Governor that would make it harder for the people \nof Florida to vote, harder for them to have their vote counted, and \nharder for the people to be able to register to vote.\n  Common sense would tell you what we ought to be doing is exactly the \nopposite--that we ought to be making things easier to vote, and \nespecially in a State such as ours, which went through that awful \nexperience in November of 2000, when there was so much chaos, not only \nin the voting in the Presidential election but then in the counting of \nthe votes. Of course, we all know how that ended up--Bush v. Gore in \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, which stopped the recount that was proceeding.\n  Because of that experience, to the credit of the State legislature, \nthey started to make voting easier. For example, instead of just voting \non election day, they had a 2-week period for early voting--something \nthat other States have been doing for some period of time, so that \npeople could go to designated polling places prior to election day. It \ncertainly made it a lot easier on the supervisors of elections, the \nvery people who are charged with the responsibility of registering \nvoters and counting votes, because it spread the amount of people \ncoming in to vote over time, so that all of them weren't there just \nwithin a 12-hour period on election day. This has turned out to be so \npopular in Florida that half of the voters in the last two elections \nvoted prior to election day.\n  Well, can you believe that the State legislature has seen fit to cut \nthe 14-\n\n[[Page S2760]]\n\nday early vote period back to 8, under the guise, well, we are going to \nmake the amount of hours the same by giving the supervisors of \nelections discretion so that they could increase the voting days on \nearly votes from 8 to 12 hours? But that is a ruse, because that means \nthe election supervisors are going to have to pay time and a half, and \nthose election supervisors are under the same kind of fiscal \nconstraints that all of the other levels of government are right now \nand, as a result, what is going to happen is the voting hours are not \ngoing to be extended, and the State legislature has just constricted \nthe number of voting days from 14 down to 8--and, by the way, they \ndidn't let it run right up to the day before the election; they backed \nit off several days before the election, which would be the last day of \nearly voting.\n  Why, when we want to make it easier to vote? Well, doesn't the \nlegislature--and I hope the Governor, who has this bill coming to him--\nunderstand that it is a tremendous convenience to senior citizens to \nmake it easier for them, instead of having to stand in a long line on \nelection day, that over a 2-week period they can go and vote in a \ndesignated place?\n  Is there some reason they are trying to make it harder for senior \ncitizens to vote? Well, it could be a lot of politics in this, but the \nfact is they are making it harder to vote, when in fact it ought to be \nthe opposite.\n  I wish I could report to the Senate that that was the only thing they \nhave done, but it is not. They made it harder to register to vote. As a \nmatter of fact, well-respected organizations, such as the League of \nWomen Voters, for years and years have taken it as their responsibility \nto go out and try to register people to vote. The League of Women \nVoters is a nonpartisan organization, which has as its sole goal to try \nto promote activities that promote our democracy. Here is what they \ndid. They said if you go out and register people to vote, and under \ncurrent law, there is a period of something like 1\\1/2\\ weeks to 2 \nweeks that you can turn in the names you have registered--no, no.\n  This time, what the legislature has done is said if you don't turn \nthose new registration forms in within 48 hours, you are going to be \nsubject to a fine and possibly a criminal penalty. And the President of \nthe League of Women Voters of Florida, Diedre McNabb, has said, in \neffect, what that means is that they will not put that onus on their \nmembers of a fine and a criminal penalty and, in effect, they will stop \nregistering people ahead of time.\n  What the election laws ought to do is exactly the opposite. We ought \nto have laws that encourage the registration of voters and try to get \nmore people to participate. But that is not what the Florida \nlegislature has done. It has done exactly the opposite.\n  I wish I could report to the Senate that was the only thing they have \ndone. But they did more. For four decades, Florida has had a law, in a \nhighly mobile society, if you have moved and you go on election day to \ncast your vote, and your registration address is different than the \naddress that you show, for example, where you registered to vote years \nago--maybe even a year ago--but in the meantime you have moved and your \ndocumentation--say, your driver's license--shows your new address, for \nfour decades the law of Florida has said that a voter can change their \naddress in the polling place to update that record, showing proper \nidentification of who they are and that their signature matches.\n  Not so now. The legislature of Florida has just changed the law that \nif your address or your name changes--what happens if you got married \nin the last year and now your name doesn't match your registration \nname, but you still want to vote? What has the legislature of Florida \ndone? They are going to require that you not cast a ballot. You are \ngoing to have to cast a provisional ballot, and you are going to have \nto have your authenticity certified after the fact.\n  The experience with provisional ballots in the last Presidential \nelection in Florida, in 2008, was that of the over 35,000 ballots cast, \n17,000--half of them--were not counted.\n  Who are the people who have been operating and have benefited by that \nlaw in Florida for four decades? They have been people who have gotten \nmarried and their name has changed. They have been people in the mobile \nsociety in which we live who have moved and bought a new house or moved \ninto a new apartment. In other words, all of us--we and our neighbors.\n  Who else especially might have been the reason for the legislature of \nFlorida to change this four decades-old law? The last Presidential \nelection, college students in Florida voted in record numbers because \ncollege students in Florida in the town of their college went down \nwhere they had their registration. Yet their identification showed \ntheir address as their parents' home, not the registration address they \nhad registered in their college town.\n  That is not making it easier to vote. That is not encouraging college \nstudents to vote. That is doing exactly the opposite. That is \nsuppressing the vote.\n  What I am reporting to the Senate has been widely commented on in \nFlorida in almost every editorial page in the State of Florida, with \nthe bottom-line conclusion of what I have just said: It is trying to \nsuppress the vote by making it harder to vote, harder to register to \nvote, and harder to have one's vote counted as it was intended.\n  I have written the Governor, and I have asked the Governor to \nconsider all these things. It is widely commented in the Florida press \nthat the Governor will sign the bill, thus constricting, restricting--\nwhatever word you want to use--the right of the people to vote. If the \nGovernor does sign the bill or lets it go into law without his \nsignature, then our only other mechanism at this point, since there are \n5 counties in Florida's 67 counties that are under a watch list under \nthe civil rights legislation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965--it is my \nintention to encourage the Department of Justice, the Civil Rights \nDivision, to examine this legislation with regard to the Voting Rights \nAct. Preparatory to that, I had sent a letter to Thomas Perez, the \nAssistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division of the \nDepartment of Justice, alerting him to this fact.\n  I have quoted in that letter several supervisors of election, both \nDemocrats and Republicans, who have said that cutting the early voting \nperiod from 14 days to 8 will shrink poll access by 50 percent and \ndisenfranchise a significant number of voters. That is what the \nsupervisors of election, the elected officials in each of the counties, \nwere telling me.\n  I wish to quote a Republican supervisor of election, Deborah Clark, \nin Pinellas County, which is the county of St. Petersburg and \nClearwater, FL. This is what she said:\n\n       Not allowing address or name change changes on election day \n     will create an undue burden on eligible voters.\n\n  She continues:\n\n       It will also result in long lines at the polls and \n     discourage many voters from voting.\n\n  It is self-evident, and this is an assault upon our democracy that \nshould not be tolerated. But it happened and it happened in the last \nweek of the legislative session. I hope--I hope--there will be such an \noutcry that this legislative policy gets reversed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to remember a fallen hero, \nU.S. Army SPC Joseph Cemper. Specialist Cemper was based in eastern \nAfghanistan, in the area east of Kabul bordering Pakistan. This area is \none of the areas where the fighting in the Afghan war has been the most \nintense.\n  Specialist Cemper was serving with the 101st Special Troops Battalion \nof the 101st Airborne Division, one of the Army's most elite units. He \nand four fellow American soldiers were killed in a suicide attack that \nultimately took 10 lives.\n  Specialist Cemper had a long desire to serve his country, and was \nrightfully proud of his commitment to defend and to protect.\n  He is mourned by his parents, three sisters, two brothers, a fiancee, \nand an infant son Liam. I know his family is proud of him, and will \nalways remember his spirit, enthusiasm, competitiveness, and can-do \nattitude. They are the\n\n[[Page S2761]]\n\ntype of American family that constitute the pillars of our Armed \nForces, and are the reason our Nation remains safe from its enemies.\n  Joseph's father, SFC Eugene Cemper, has made service to the Army his \nlife's work. As an Army recruiter, Sergeant Cemper had the unique \nexperience of personally recruiting his son into the Army.\n  As a father and a leader, Sergeant Cemper inspired both Specialist \nCemper and his younger brother, PFC Noah Cemper, to wear the uniform of \nan American soldier with pride.\n  The Cemper family laid their son to rest in Papillion, NE, on April \n29, 2011. Specialist Cemper returned to his birthplace with valor and \nhonor having been awarded both the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star \nMedals.\n  I know I speak for all Nebraskans, and all Americans, when I say that \ndespite our sorrow, we are deeply honored to have him.\n  I cannot imagine the pain the Cemper family is suffering today. The \nloss unexpectedly of a son in combat is one of the most extreme trials \na parent or loved one could face. I know, at this point, my words \ncannot ease their hurt.\n  So I will end this tribute by saying what Specialist Cemper held \nclose to his heart, so close that his family has inscribed it in a \nscrapbook which will one day be seen by his son. It reads:\n\n       When I stand before God at the end of my life, I hope that \n     I would not have a single bit of talent left, and I could say \n     that I used everything you gave me.\n\n  I hope he rests knowing that he died the bravest and most honorable \ndeath an American could.

Mr. President, I want to discuss today the tragedy that \nhas occurred in Alabama and other States across the Southeast as a \nresult of the tornadoes that hit our region in a 24-hour period between \n8 a.m. in the morning on April 27 and 8 a.m. in the morning on April \n28. The National Weather Service estimates there were a total of 312 \ntornadoes across the Southeast. The worst outbreak previously reported \noccurred in April of 1974, and that was with 148 tornadoes.\n  The Birmingham-Tuscaloosa F4 tornado had a path with a maximum width \nof 1.5 miles and a length, from the Tuscaloosa to Birmingham area, of \n80 miles. It stayed on the ground almost continuously--very unusual. It \nwent through a number of populated areas, and that tornado alone \nresulted in 65 deaths. Alabama's current death toll is nearing 250, \nwith thousands injured. Frankly, after seeing the damage to the \naffected areas, I am amazed we did not lose more lives. As I talked to \nmayors and others on the ground, they said the same thing.\n  I talked to Mayor Gunnin in Hackleburg today. I believe he was the \none who told me there were about 18 killed, and he was pleased it was \nthat low. They were hammered with an F5, the highest, strongest \ntornado, which basically destroyed his whole town. All his businesses, \nincluding the distribution center for a jeans manufacturing company, \nhave been destroyed. It is very difficult for them to pay for anything. \nTheir businesses that pay a sales tax that goes to the city have been \ndamaged, and he has made the point--and it is a good example--that he, \nin this little town of Hackleburg, had emergency funds, but they have \nbeen on massive overtime for the week since the event and other costs \nare arising and it is very difficult for him.\n  I want to thank President Obama for the quick response he made to the \ntragedy. The people of Alabama appreciated the fact that he, and later \nCabinet members, actually visited some of the devastated areas. We \nappreciate the quick action in declaring Alabama and other areas major \ndisaster areas. That does help in a lot of different ways.\n  I also had the opportunity to be with him in Tuscaloosa when he came \nthere. Mrs. Obama, of course, did a beautiful job also of talking to \nthe people who have lost so much and comforting them. Secretary \nNapolitano came on Sunday to the Pratt City area in Birmingham, along \nwith several other Cabinet members. I think they also got a real \nappreciation for the severity of the damage and reassured Alabamians \nthat help would be on the way in an appropriate fashion.\n  It is certain that it will take, for a number of our communities, an \nintegrated, coordinated State, local, and Federal response to get these \ncommunities back on track. That is why we have a Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency. That is why we have monies in the budget for these \nkinds of things, although this one is a particularly damaging event, I \nhave to say.\n  As the ranking member on the Budget Committee, I am aware we have to \nbe careful about how we spend money. We certainly don't have any \nmoney--not a dime--to waste.\n  I have to tell you, every time I have been there or I have talked to \npeople on the ground, they tell me how impressed they are with the \nvolunteers who are arriving from all over the country, bringing food \nand water and helping people who are already working. They are bringing \nchainsaws to help clear roads and highways and driveways to people's \nhomes. That has been real encouraging, and it makes me very proud to \nrepresent a group of people who have the integrity and the work ethic \nand the determination to overcome tragedy. It has been encouraging to \nme.\n  Having walked through the devastated neighborhoods less than 24 hours \nafter the tornado, I can tell you people were stunned at the damages, \nat the complete loss of homes and belongings. Many of the people \nbelieved themselves lucky to be alive. Their entire roof was gone, most \nof the walls were gone, and yet somehow they came out with minor \ninjuries or less severe injuries. Others, of course, did not survive, \nand others received severe injuries. It is always amazing to me in a \ntornado situation how a house can be just obliterated, and persons can \ncome out of it with not too severe an injury, and for that they were \nexpressing great appreciation. I think it is a reflection of the faith \nthese individuals have in a higher being who, I think, gives them the \ncourage to go on.\n  One of the things that is perfectly clear is that housing in some \nareas will be a critical matter. Many houses are totally destroyed--\nnothing but a concrete slab left. Of course, many mobile homes or \nmanufactured homes were completely lost. They are not on a slab, so \nthose homes have been rolled over and completely demolished or \ndisappeared basically. So we are going to need to work in a way that \nFEMA has done before to provide emergency housing.\n  In the larger areas where there is more housing around--there is \nvacant housing in some of our areas--they ought to be moved promptly \ninto that vacant housing that currently exists. In some areas there is \njust not housing for individuals to move into. I was told today by two \nmayors that they have people still in recreational areas--gyms and that \nkind of thing--using those as a place for shelter. We are definitely \nnot where we need to be.\n\n  Yet some FEMA trailers are being moved into areas of the State. That \nmay have to be done. I wish we could avoid that step, but in many areas \nit cannot be avoided--avoided in the sense that, to me, the best way to \nhandle a situation where a person's home is gone is to help that person \nmove as quickly as possible into what could be a permanent residence--\neither through rental or purchase. The longer that person is in a \ntemporary residence the more likely they are also often receiving \nFederal assistance. As long as they are in this temporary limbo \ncircumstance, their life is less stable, and the Federal Government is \nspending more money, money that could be utilized better if we can \navoid spending it\n\n[[Page S2762]]\n\nfor temporary housing so it could be used to facilitate permanent \nhousing. That would be a more effective policy, but it is not easy. In \nsome instances, it cannot be done.\n  Initial reports indicate that Alabama's losses may rival or surpass \nits $1 billion loss in Hurricane Katrina. That is a factor we do not \nnormally expect from tornadoes. We will wrestle with those costs as we \ngo forward. But dollar losses are nothing compared to the severe loss \nof life. We have a record-setting loss of life.\n  Going through the Rosedale Court area of Tuscaloosa, AL, seeing first \nresponders and volunteers frantically trying to help--in particular, \nthey were searching for a missing young girl. They kept on and there \nwere a large number of people there throughout this area where metal \nwas twisted and roofs were gone and no walls, hardly, were standing. \nMaterials were 3 feet deep on the floor, of plywood, roofing and the \nlike. They found that young child, but unfortunately it was too late \nand her life had been lost.\n  That is the kind of thing that has been happening throughout the \nState. Our people are responding with courage and dignity and hard \nwork. Volunteers from all over the country and all over Alabama are \nassisting. I was with a seafood group Friday, down from Bayou La Batre, \nAL, the seafood capital, in many ways, of the Gulf of Mexico, and they \nhad been helped so many times over the decades because of various \nhurricanes that came through, they wanted to help so they brought large \namounts of shrimp and seafood and their cookers. They were going to \nTuscaloosa or some of the other areas and serving people out there who \nwere volunteering or were emergency responders who were working to help \nin that neighborhood. That is the kind of thing that makes us proud and \nmakes us all recognize the good that we have in our people.\n  I wished to share these thoughts and to note I have filed a \nresolution that deals with this disaster, expressing the condolences of \nthe United States and noting many of the factors that are relevant to \nthis damage and I will be asking the Senate agree to that. I note it \nhas been cosponsored by Senator Shelby, my colleague from Alabama, \nSenators Alexander and Corker from Tennessee, Senators Cochran and \nWicker from Mississippi, Senators Chambliss and Isakson from Georgia, \nand I understand others are signing on as we proceed.\n  I thank the administration for helping to respond properly. I thank \nthe volunteers from all over America who have come to our State to \nassist those in need.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, I want to speak in opposition to the \nnomination of James Cole to be Deputy Attorney General of the United \nStates, on whom we will be voting a little later this afternoon.\n  Despite President Obama's recess appointment of Mr. Cole, who has had \nsignificant opposition in the committee, and was not looking at smooth \nsailing--I do believe we should oppose his confirmation and his \npermanent appointment based on some concerns I have with his record, \nspecifically his criminal justice view on the war on terror, which I \nbelieve is utterly wrong, and his questionable decisions as an outside \nconsultant for AIG, the big insurance company that had to be bailed out \nto the tune of, I think, $170 billion.\n  He was an independent consultant, supposed to be monitoring that \ncompany for other errors they had made previously. So that is a concern \nto me.\n  I served 15 years in the Department of Justice--as the U.S. attorney \nfor almost 12, and as an assistant U.S. attorney. I respect the \nDepartment. I love the Department of Justice, but I am getting \nconcerned about it. I am not happy with some of the decisions and \nphilosophies that are emanating from the Department. I believe they do \nnot reflect the highest standards and qualities that we expect from \nthat great Department.\n  This nominee has a lot of good qualities. I believe he has a number \nof strengths that--has management and some experience in the Department \nfor which I would give him credit. But at this point in history, I \nbelieve his approach, particularly to the war on terror, along with the \nAttorney General's approach to the war on terror are not good. I have \njust about had enough of them.\n  I am just going to say this: I am not voting for another nominee--I \nam not going to vote for this one--who spent their time defending \nterrorists before they went to the Department. It is all right to \ndefend an unpopular person, but 13 to 16 members of the Department of \nJustice, political appointees by this administration, have had as their \nbackground defending terrorists, including the Solicitor General \nnominee who is going to be coming up in committee this week, and also \nworking for or representing the ACLU.\n  So when we get this much of a tilt in the leadership of the \nDepartment, it gives me great concern that the great Department I love \nand respect is getting off base. So I think it is important to note \nthat right now one of the top priorities at the Department of Justice \nmust be the recent warnings we received that the terrorist groups \n``almost certainly'' will try to avenge the death of Osama bin Laden, \nand the continuing economic crisis that faces our country.\n  So I believe the President should be nominating proven prosecutors--\nprosecutors of terrorists, frankly--for top positions in the law \nenforcement agency, the U.S. Department of Justice. I do not think we \nneed any more terrorist defense attorneys. When I was the U.S. attorney \nI hired a lot of assistant U.S. attorneys. I looked for proven \nprosecutors wherever I could find them. I did not go around to look for \npeople who spent their spare time volunteering to defend terrorists or \nwriting papers defending criminals. That is just the way I see it, \nfrankly. I have to be honest about it.\n  So we have had this one, we have had that one, we have had another \none, and another and another. Now we have 13 to 16 who have been \nappointed to the Department of Justice who have had this background.\n  Defending the unpopular is not disqualifying. We voted, and I voted, \nfor a number of people in the Department who have been involved in \nthese kinds of defense efforts, who filed lawsuits against President \nBush. They thought they were doing something great. I guess they did \nnot turn down the evidence if it helped in any way lead to the location \nof Osama bin Laden.\n  We do have standards about how we should gather evidence, and lines \nshould not be crossed. But that does not mean we are not in a war. It \ndoes not mean the people who are attacking us are common criminals who \nneed to be tried in civilian courts. They are at war with us. Bin Laden \nsaid he is at war with us. He declared war on us. You do not treat \nprisoners of wars, captured enemy combatants, like you treat common \ncriminals. This is fundamental.\n  I served in the Army Reserve a number of years, some of that time as \na JAG officer. I taught courses on prisoners of war and how to treat \nprisoners and the standards of the field manual. I do not claim to be a \ngreat expert at it, but I did it. I had some experience in it.\n  Mr. Cole consistently--and some of these nominees to the Department--\ntakes the view that terrorists are criminals and not unlawful \ncombatants. Let me just say briefly, if a person is caught--a murderer, \na rapist, or virtually any kind of criminal--when they are taken into \ncustody, as the Presiding Officer knows, who was a good prosecutor \nhimself, they have to be--before you can interview them, once they are \nin custody you have to\n\n[[Page S2763]]\n\ngive them Miranda warnings. That authorizes and tells them--basically \ntells them: You did not have to make any statements at all. It \nbasically says: If you are an idiot, you will make statements. You are \nentitled to a lawyer. If you do not have any money, we will appoint you \na lawyer. You have to go before a magistrate within a matter of hours. \nYou are entitled to discovery of the government's case in short order, \nand you are entitled to a speedy trial. You are entitled to prowl \naround in the government's case and find all of the evidence the \ngovernment has.\n  In war, that is not so. A classic case was Ex parte Quirin in World \nWar II when German saboteurs were dropped off on our coast from a \nsubmarine. They were going to sabotage the United States of America. \nThey were apprehended, taken to military tribunals, tried, and most of \nthem were executed in a matter of months. The case went to the Supreme \nCourt, Ex parte Quirin, and was affirmed.\n  There has never been any doubt that unlawful combatants can be tried \nfor their crimes in military courts. It is done all over the world. It \nis an established principle.\n  Now, let's get one thing straight. If you are a lawful combatant, and \nyou are captured on the battlefield--whether you are a Japanese soldier \nor German soldier or Italian soldier--and you comply with the laws of \nwar and you wear your uniform and you do not attack deliberately men, \nwomen, and children, civilians, and try to kill them, and you comply \nwith other rules of war, you cannot be tried. You can just be detained \nuntil the war is over, but you do not get lawyers. You do not get \ntrials and discovery and all of that sort of thing. But if in \nconducting your military campaign you violate the internally respected \nlaws of war, you cannot only be held as a prisoner of war, but the \nnation that is holding you can try you for violations of the laws of \nwar.\n  So that is how these 9/11 attackers who did not wear uniforms, who \nattacked deliberately civilians, are perfectly fit to be tried as war \ncriminals or unlawful combatants. They have announced their intention \nto destroy the United States, to attack the United States. They have \nsaid they are at war with us. But they have done it in an unlawful way, \nand they can be tried in military commissions. This allows the military \nto conduct interrogations according to the laws of war over a period of \nmonths, years even. Sometimes after months a prisoner will start to \ntalk. You never know why they start talking.\n  But to deny ourselves the right to allow those kinds of things to \nhappen, to say we have to try these individuals, such as Khalid Sheikh \nMohammed, in civilian courts is clearly in error. But that is the \nAttorney General's position. I asked him about it last week when he \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee. He said: It still remains the \npolicy of the Department of Justice that persons who are arrested as \nterrorists are presumed to be tried in civilian court, although \nCongress has passed a law prohibiting moneys to be expended for that, \non the 9/11 attackers. The Attorney General is in a huff and said \nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed will be tried in Guantanamo under military \nprocedures as an unlawful combatant, but he does not like it. That is \nnot his view. It looks like everybody he wants to hire to be in the \nDepartment of Justice agrees with that erroneous view.\n  It is not a close question. This is not a close question. There is no \nreason a terrorist who is apprehended in the United States ought to be \nprovided lawyers and Miranda warnings. They are combatants. They are \nnot common criminals. Thinking this way has caused dangerous confusion.\n  As our troops and intelligence community continue to work night and \nday to keep our country safe, it is imperative that we view the war on \nterror as a real war and not a criminal matter and regard those who \nwish to perpetrate terror on this country as enemy combatants, not \nplain criminals. Like many in the administration, Mr. Cole disagrees.\n  In 2002, not long after the 9/11 attacks, he wrote an op-ed and \npublished it criticizing then-Attorney General John Ashcroft's decision \nto try the 9/11 terrorists in military commissions. They researched the \nlaw. Attorney General Ashcroft knew what he was doing. They decided \nthey were going to try these individuals by military commissions. He \nhad written an op-ed attacking the Attorney General for it.\n  So now that is the man we have as the nominee for the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral of the United States. At his hearing last Congress, Mr. Cole \nrepeated the prevailing and confusing Justice Department position that \ndecisions regarding whether captured terrorists should be tried in \ncivilian courts or before military commissions ``should be made on a \ncase-by-case basis based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances \navailable at the time of a suspect's capture.'' Is this going to happen \nin Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, wherever else they may be in the \nUnited States is not a practical policy because we have to tell the \nindividuals who are making those captures what the rules are. As the \nAttorney General said, they still adhere to the view that the \npresumption is, the individual will be tried in civilian court. \nTherefore, the presumption is, within a short time of their being taken \ninto custody, they should be given Miranda warnings, offered a lawyer, \nand set for a preliminary court appearance, which could reveal to all \nthe other terrorists that their partner in war has been captured and \nallow them to escape.\n\n  It is a wrong view, and why they persist in this is beyond my \nunderstanding. Congress understands it and the American people do also.\n  This administration has established a policy that declares there is a \npresumption of civilian trials and has failed to articulate a clear \npolicy for designating captured terrorists as enemy combatants or \ncriminal defendants. So I remain very unconvinced that the next \ncaptured terror suspect will not be given the rights of a common \ncriminal and told he has the right to remain silent to the detriment of \ncrucial intelligence gathering. One of the most significant findings of \nthe 9/11 Commission was that intelligence gathering, intelligence \npossession about what the enemy is doing is the best way to protect our \ncountry, not prosecuting them after the fact. So telling someone they \nhave the right to remain silent and they have a lawyer who is going to \ninsist that they not make any statements, does that help us gather \nintelligence? If it is required by the U.S. Constitution, we will do \nit. We will just plain do it, regardless, but it is not required by \nlaw, history or the Constitution. Law, history, and the Constitution \nallow these enemy combatants to be tried in military commissions and \nthey don't have to be given Miranda warnings, which was a court-created \nrule a number of years ago that never was understood before and is not \npracticed, to my knowledge, in any other Nation in the whole world. Of \ncourse, all this provides poor guidance for our law enforcement, \nmilitary, and intelligence officers as they go about their efforts, and \nit is a grievous and dangerous mistake to continue this policy.\n  It seems to me that Mr. Cole and Attorney General Holder are cut from \nthe same cloth on this issue. I am uneasy about these two individuals \nholding the top two positions in the Department of Justice. Now the \nSolicitor General nominee seems to hold similar views and, if \nconfirmed, he will be one of the highest ranking people in the \nDepartment. Their policy views appear to control the Department of \nDefense. In other words, if they say this is the rule, the Department \nof Defense has to give the Miranda warnings and so forth if they are \ninvolved in a capture, and it directly controls the FBI, which is part \nof the Department of Justice.\n  As the acting second in command at the Justice Department, Mr. Cole \nwould play a lead role in decisionmaking in the terror prosecutions \nthroughout the country. The Justice Department's continued insistence \non a presumption of civilian trials for terrorists confirms my concerns \nthat Mr. Cole has adhered to the failed pre-9/11 law enforcement \napproach to terrorists, an approach the 9/11 Commission and the Nation \nas a whole recognized was in error and should be changed. I thought we \nhad clearly made that move. Apparently, we haven't.\n  Also of concern, from 2003 to 2007, Mr. Cole represented a Saudi \nPrince against insurance carriers and September 11 victims who alleged \nthat the Saudi Prince helped finance terrorists. Reportedly, Mr. Cole's \nclient was\n\n[[Page S2764]]\n\nlinked through Treasury Department documents to the financial support \nof extremist groups through the Al-Haramain Foundation, a Saudi charity \nthat had diverted funds to al-Qaida before and after 9/11. While \nattorneys are free to, and should be free to, represent unpopular \nclients, Mr. Cole is one of a long line of political appointees at the \nDepartment of Justice who seem to me to be questionable choices for key \nposts at the agency that is charged with defending national security, \ngiven their choices to represent the very individuals and groups whose \ngoal it is to attack this country or kill Americans.\n  According to press reports, at least 13 to 16 current Obama \nadministration political appointees, including the current Solicitor \nGeneral nominee who represented Jose Padilla, previously provided legal \ncounsel to suspected or convicted terrorists and enemy combatants being \nheld in detention or to leftwing organizations that actively sought to \nreverse Bush administration antiterrorist and detainee policies--\npolicies, I might add, that were a contributing factor to the \nelimination of bin Laden and many other terrorists throughout this past \ndecade. I am curious to know if they have appointed anyone to key \npositions in the Department of Justice who has ever prosecuted a \nterrorist. I would like to know that. Maybe they have. Surely, somebody \nhas, but it looks odd to me that so many of those who have been on the \nother side have been given top appointments.\n  On another subject, I am very disappointed with this administration's \nabdication of its duty to defend congressionally enacted laws, \nspecifically the Defense of Marriage Act. Attorney General Holder has \nstated President Obama had decided he would no longer defend this law, \nafter reviewing the Attorney General's recommendation and that the law \nfalls under the exception in which ``the Department of Justice cannot \noffer a reasonable argument in defense of the statute's \nconstitutionality.''\n  Well, it has been defended and upheld by a number of courts. How do \nwe waltz in there and decide we are not going to defend a \ncongressionally enacted statute signed into law by President Clinton \nbecause they don't like it? That is how it appears to me. The \nadministration apparently came to this conclusion after unilaterally \ndeciding that ``classifications based on sexual orientation warrant \nheightened scrutiny''--in the face of precedent from 11 circuit courts \nof appeal holding that such classifications should be reviewed under \nthe much lower rational basis standard.\n  There is a very big difference between refusing to defend a law the \nadministration regards as unconstitutional and refusing to defend a law \nthat the administration opposes on the policy grounds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Department of Justice is a great \ndepartment, and they have some very fine people there. I know Mr. Cole \nhas some good qualities. I supported Mr. Holder for Attorney General, \nbut I am very uneasy about the direction the Department is taking on a \nlarge number of issues, and I believe one of the reasons this is \nhappening is because they have surrounded themselves with a group of \nleftist lawyers, activist lawyers who don't operate according to the \nmore traditional views of law and justice in America. That is my view. \nOther Senators may disagree. That is my view. I am not able to support \nMr. Cole for that and the reasons I have stated. I hope in the future \nthe administration will appoint more nominees that have proven records \nof independence, effective prosecution, and commitment to law.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I greatly respect my friend from Alabama, \nSenator Sessions, although I come to a different conclusion in regard \nto Jim Cole.\n  I have worked with Jim Cole. I was part of a legislative committee in \nthe House of Representatives that had to do some very difficult work on \nan ethics issue involving a former Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives. It was a tough decision to bring together six Members \nof the House--three Democrats, three Republicans--and do it in a way \nthat would maintain the nonpartisan requirements of an ethics \ninvestigation. The atmosphere was very partisanly charged around the \nwork we were doing. I know this sounds familiar. People in Maryland and \nConnecticut and around the Nation understand we are working in a very \npartisan environment, and they expect the people who are charged at the \nDepartment of Justice to work in a nonpartisan manner.\n  This is not a partisan position, the Deputy Attorney General. This is \na person who is working with the Attorney General, the Nation's lawyer. \nWe want somebody who has the experience, someone who has the character \nand commitment to carry out this very important position.\n  As I said, I have known Jim Cole. He has 13 years' experience within \nthe Department of Justice. He is a public interest attorney. That has \nbeen the largest part of his professional career, the service of public \ninterests. He has always followed policy, not politics. He has a very \ndistinguished career in law, and he is the type of person we like to \nsee within the Department of Justice.\n  As I pointed out, I worked with Jim Cole when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives. We worked on a very difficult investigation involving \nthe former Speaker of the House of Representatives who at the time was \nSpeaker. The chairman of the committee was Porter Goss, a Republican \nfrom Florida. Porter Goss's observations of Jim Cole were that he was a \nbrilliant prosecutor, extraordinarily talented. Then Mr. Goss goes on \nto say that over time, he brought our committee to a bipartisan \ncooperation which was desperately needed in order to successfully \ncomplete that matter. At the end of the day, the six of us came \ntogether in a unanimous recommendation. That is the type of person Jim \nCole is. He was professional and put policy ahead of politics.\n  Former Senator John Danforth testified at Jim Cole's confirmation \nhearing. John Danforth is a former Republican Member of the Senate. He \ncalled Jim Cole ``a lawyer's lawyer.''\n  Jim Cole has support from Democrats and Republicans. Former high \nofficials within the Department of Justice have all recommended him, \nincluding former Deputy Attorneys General appointed by both Republicans \nand Democrats.\n  Let me quote one other person I had hoped would be greatly respected \non both sides of the aisle; that is, Fred Fielding, the White House \ncounsel for former President George W. Bush. He said Mr. Cole \n``combines all the qualities you want in a `citizen public servant'--he \nunderstands both sides of the street and is smart and tenacious, and is \na person of unquestioned honor and integrity.''\n  That is what Fred Fielding, the former White House counsel to \nPresident Bush said, about Jim Cole.\n  Jim Cole is supported by former RNC officials and DNC officials \nbecause he is nonpartisan. He is a nonpartisan person who has put \npublic interest law as his top priority.\n  I was listening to Senator Sessions talk about terrorism. We have had \na spirited political debate taking place in this country over the best \nway to bring terrorists to justice. Mr. Cole, however, will always put \nprinciple over politics, and he is committed to evaluating each case \nand matter that comes before him based on the facts and the law. That \nis what you want from the Department of Justice. They are the values \nand the character we want in our Nation's Department of Justice, and \nJim Cole will bring that to the Department of Justice--already brought \nit to the Department of Justice.\n  The bottom line about Mr. Cole's approach on fighting terrorists is \none I believe we all believe in. We are a nation at war with al-Qaida, \nthe Taliban, and their associated forces. We need tough, aggressive, \nand flexible policies that recognize the paramount importance of \nproviding the President with the ability to use all of the lawful \ntools--all of the lawful tools--of our national power to protect the \nAmerican people and bring terrorists to justice.\n\n[[Page S2765]]\n\n  Jim Cole believes in that. He is committed to working with the \nCongress so we use all available tools. We make the judgment in each \nindividual case as to what is the most effective way to bring a \nterrorist or criminal to justice.\n  He not only has expertise in handling terrorists and bringing them to \njustice, he has had very important positions in the Department of \nJustice supervising the criminal prosecution of white-collar crimes. He \nunderstands the full breadth of the Department of Justice and is a very \nvaluable player in making sure the Department of Justice follows in the \nfine tradition of that agency.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to move forward. At least vote to allow \nthis nomination to get an up-or-down vote. This is a very important \nposition: the Deputy Attorney General. We talk about we were sent here \nto Washington to make tough votes. OK. I do not think this is a tough \nvote. I think Jim Cole is the best person for this critically important \njob, and I do not think he is at all a partisan person. I know him \nwell. I know him to be a career type individual who is interested in \ndoing what is right. But this is not a nominee where you should be \nusing a filibuster to prevent an up-or-down vote.\n  This is a very important position for our country. For the dignity of \nthe Senate and the Department of Justice and the decency of Jim Cole, I \nurge my colleagues to allow us to go forward with an up-or-down vote on \nhis confirmation, and I urge my colleagues to support his confirmation \nto be Deputy Attorney General of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I know we are in morning business. I ask \nunanimous consent to speak on the nomination of James Cole to be Deputy \nAttorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the nomination of James Cole to be the Deputy \nAttorney General at the Department of Justice. I oppose proceeding to a \nvote on the nominee for a number of reasons.\n  I have concerns regarding Mr. Cole's qualifications and am troubled \nby President Obama's recess appointment of Mr. Cole to this position. I \nhave been consistent in my opposition to recess appointments over the \nyears. Whenever the President bypasses the Senate by making recess \nappointments, such nominees will not receive my support. We have a \nprocess in place for nominations and if the President is not willing to \nwork with Senators to clear nominations, the nominee should not get a \nsecond bite at the apple.\n  In addition to my general opposition to recess appointments, I have \nconsistently warned this administration that I would not cooperate in \nmoving nominees for the Department of Justice, until they cooperated \nwith my request for oversight materials. Last month, I went to the \nfloor to describe what I have learned in the course of my investigation \ninto whistleblower allegations at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms, and Explosives, ATF. According to whistleblowers, guns found \nat the scene of the murder of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry had been \npurchased illegally by a known straw buyer a year earlier, with the \nblessing of the ATF as part of an operation known as Fast and Furious.\n  I first asked about this issue on January 27. On February 16, I \nrequested specific documents from the Justice Department. I reiterated \nthat request on March 3.\n  When the Justice Department failed to produce any responsive \ndocuments, I partnered with House Oversight and Government Reform \nChairman Darrell Issa, who first requested documents and then issued a \nsubpoena to the ATF after his voluntary request was ignored. On April \n13, my staff learned that the Justice Department was making certain \ndocuments available for Chairman Issa's staff to review at the \nDepartment. Not only did the Department fail to notify me of this \ndocument review, when I sent two of my staff members to participate, \nthey were turned away at the door of the Justice Department.\n  To this day, the Justice Department has still not produced a single \npage of documents in response to my inquiries and has provided only \npreviously released public documents in response to Chairman Issa. I \nreceived a letter on May 2, 2011, declining to provide my staff with \naccess to the documents on the grounds that ``the Executive Branch . . \n. has taken the position that only a chairman can speak for a committee \nin conducting oversight work.'' According to the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals, however:\n\n       It would be an inappropriate intrusion into the legislative \n     sphere for the courts to decide without congressional \n     direction that, for example, only the chairman of a committee \n     shall be regarded as the official voice of the Congress for \n     purposes of receiving such information, as distinguished from \n     its ranking minority member, other committee members, or \n     other members of the Congress. Each of them participates in \n     the law-making process; each has a voice and a vote in that \n     process; and each is entitled to request such information \n     from the executive agencies as will enable him to carry out \n     the responsibilities of a legislator.\n\n  That is from Murphy v. Department of the Army, 1979.\n  I said on the floor on April 14 that if the Justice Department did \nnot cooperate and provide the information we need, I would consider \nexercising my right to object to unanimous consent requests on a \nnomination. Since that time, I have received nothing but stonewalling \nfrom the Department. As the chief operating officer of the Department, \nMr. Cole is in a position to ensure the Justice Department meaningfully \ncooperates with my inquiries and complies with my document requests. He \nhas failed to do so.\n  I also am troubled by the Department's continued resistance to \noversight requests from Senator Chambliss, the vice chairman of the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence. Senator Chambliss has requested that \nthe Department of Justice share important documents with Congress \nregarding the Guantanamo Bay Detainee Review Task Force. This task \nforce reviewed the case files of many detainees that were released or \ntransferred from U.S. custody. Unfortunately, we now know that over 25 \npercent of those detainees later returned to fight against us or our \nallies.\n  These documents are part of a legitimate exercise of our \nconstitutional duty to conduct oversight. The Department's repeated \nstonewalling of Senator Chambliss's request should not be rewarded with \na cloture vote on a controversial nominee.\n  The Deputy Attorney General is the second in command at the Justice \nDepartment and responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of \nthe Department. Managing this vast bureaucracy is a difficult task that \nrequires a serious commitment to protecting our national security, \nenforcing our criminal laws, and safeguarding taxpayer dollars. We need \na qualified individual to fill this slot, an individual who possesses \nthe ability to not only provide leadership for the Department but also \nan individual who has the smarts, capability and willingness to manage \nDepartment programs and root out inefficiencies and abuses in those \nprograms. After reviewing all his responses and his hearing testimony, \nI concluded that I could not support Mr. Cole's nomination to be the \nDeputy Attorney General.\n  In particular, I am seriously concerned about Mr. Cole's views on \nnational security and terrorism. Back in 2002, Mr. Cole was the author \nof an opinion piece in the Legal Times. In that piece, he stated:\n\n       For all the rhetoric about war, the Sept. 11 attacks were \n     criminal acts of terrorism against a civilian population, \n     much like the terrorist acts of Timothy McVeigh in blowing up \n     the Federal building in Oklahoma City, or of Omar Abdel-\n     Rahman in the first effort to blow up the World Trade Center. \n     The criminals responsible for these horrible acts were \n     successfully tried and convicted under our criminal justice \n     system, without the need for special procedures that altered \n     traditional due process rights.\n\n  He added that, ``The acts of Sept. 11 were horrible, but so are . . . \nother things.'' The other things he referred to were the drug trade, \norganized crime, rape, child abuse and murder. Mr. Cole's opinion piece \nargued that\n\n[[Page S2766]]\n\nnotwithstanding the involvement of foreign organizations, such as al-\nQaida, we have never treated criminal acts influenced by foreign \nnationals or governments as a basis for ``ignoring the core \nconstitutional protections ingrained in our criminal justice system.''\n  Mr. Cole concludes his opinion piece by arguing that in addition to \nstopping future terrorist attacks, the Attorney General is a criminal \nprosecutor and that he has a special duty to apply constitutional \nprotections engrained in our criminal justice system to everyone, \nincluding terrorists captured on a foreign battlefield.\n  Mr. Cole wrote this opinion piece 2 days short of the first \nanniversary of the September 11 attacks. Given the close proximity in \ntime to the September 11 attacks, we must understand this opinion piece \nto be Mr. Cole's true beliefs about the application of the civilian \ncriminal justice system to terrorism cases, including those who \nmasterminded the 9/11 attacks.\n  From the opinion piece and his responses to our inquiries, it appears \nthat if given a choice of prosecuting high ranking terrorists in \ncivilian courts or military commissions, Mr. Cole would likely favor \ncivilian courts based upon his longstanding belief in the role the \nAttorney General plays in protecting the principles of the criminal \njustice system. Absent a clear statement from Mr. Cole about what \nfactors would warrant selecting a civilian or a military forum, it is \nhard to look at his entire record of past opinions, his testimony, and \nresponses to our questions and reach a different conclusion.\n  Military tribunals have many advantages to civilian criminal courts \nand are better equipped to deal with dangerous terrorists and \nclassified evidence while preserving due process. I am troubled that \nMr. Cole does not appear to share this belief. Based upon his responses \nand testimony, I have serious concerns about Mr. Cole's support for \ncivilian trials for terrorists captured on a foreign battlefield given \nthat the Deputy Attorney General oversees the national security branch \nat the Justice Department.\n  Second, I have concerns about Mr. Cole's abilities relative to \noversight of government programs. First, in his responses about \noversight of DOJ grant programs, Mr. Cole failed to commit to a top to \nbottom review of the programs.\n  We have had enough examples of the tremendous inefficiencies, \nduplications, and waste in these programs. I am disappointed that Mr. \nCole has failed to recognize that there is a need for comprehensive \nreview of the Department of Justice's grant program, not only for the \nsake of saving taxpayer dollars but also to ensure that grant \nobjectives are being met in the most efficient and effective manner \npossible.\n  Third, I do not have confidence regarding Mr. Cole's abilities based \non his performance as an independent consultant tasked with overseeing \nAIG. By way of background, the Justice Department provided copies of \nthe reports Mr. Cole issued when he was overseeing AIG, but they were \nlabeled ``committee confidential.'' Consequently, I cannot discuss in a \nspecific manner the context of those documents publicly.\n  Nevertheless, when taken into context with the public responses \nprovided by Mr. Cole to my questions, a troubling picture develops \nabout Mr. Cole's performance in his independent consultant \nresponsibilities. The responses and reports do not dispel the serious \nquestions raised about Mr. Cole's independence and completeness. \nFurther, they reveal what appears to be a level of deference to AIG \nmanagement one would not expect to see from someone tasked as an \n``independent'' monitor.\n  In order to clarify a number of questions on this matter, Senator \nCoburn and I sent a followup letter seeking additional answers from Mr. \nCole. Mr. Cole's reply clarified that DOJ, SEC, and the New York State \nAttorney General's office were aware of his practice of seeking input \nfrom AIG and making modifications to the reports. He indicated that the \nchanges AIG made were often factual changes, such as AIG employee \nnames, dates of materials, and events. He also indicated that some of \nthe changes requested by AIG were included in a section of the report \nentitled ``AIG Response.'' However, he said that ``on a few occasions'' \nAIG would ``suggest a stylistic change of phrasing in the analytical \nsection of the report.'' He stated that while he included the edits \nmade by AIG, he ``did not believe that a detailed presentation of this \nfactual review was necessary to an understanding of each party's \nposition.'' As a result, the report did not necessarily show which \nedits AIG made that were incorporated. Instead, he said that those \nchanges were available in working papers that were ``available to the \nSEC, the DOJ, the New York Attorney General's Office.'' Unfortunately, \nhe added, ``the agencies--which were aware of this practice--did not \nrequest such documents.''\n  While I appreciate Mr. Cole's responses to these clarifying \nquestions, they raise concerns about how independent his monitoring \nwas, what changes were ultimately requested by AIG, what changes were \nincluded, and how much the SEC and the DOJ really knew about edits AIG \nwas making to the ``independent'' reports.\n  Finally, I have serious concerns about Mr. Cole's decision to suspend \nthe compliance review at AIG's Financial Products Division following \nthe government bailout. In his testimony, Mr. Cole acknowledged that \nfollowing the government bailout of AIG, he scaled back his efforts \nuntil the future of AIG as a corporation was determined. After Mr. Cole \nsuspended his monitoring, AIG restructured its compliance office and \nterminated a number of staff overseeing the company's compliance with \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. Mr. Cole said that \nafter it was determined that AIG's Financial Products Division would \nnot be dissolved, the compliance and monitoring were ``revived and are \nbeing reviewed and implemented where applicable.'' Under Mr. Cole's \nwatch, AIG not only got $182 billion of taxpayer money, it was able to \ntalk the independent consultant--Mr. Cole--out of monitoring what the \ncompany was doing.\n  Based upon these factors, I am concerned about Mr. Cole's ability to \nperform the duties required of Deputy Attorney General. He would be in \na position to potentially influence future compliance monitors \nappointed under settlements between the Justice Department, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, and other corporations that have \nviolated the law. Independent monitors need to be truly independent and \ncompletely transparent. They are selected and appointed to ensure that \nthe interests of the American people are protected.\n  I cannot support the nomination of Mr. Cole to be Deputy Attorney \nGeneral and, therefore, will vote against cloture. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join me in opposing this cloture vote to send a message \nto the Justice Department to stop the stonewalling of legitimate \noversight inquiries from Members of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/09/senate-section/article/S2766-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. In less than an hour, \nthis body will be asked to vote on cloture to proceed to the nomination \nof James Michael Cole to be Deputy Attorney General. I rise in \nopposition to that cloture vote on the nomination of James Cole, and I \nurge my colleagues to strongly oppose it.\n\n[[Page S2767]]\n\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I share the views \nof the vice chairman, Senator Chambliss, and the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, as expressed in their letter to \nRepublican colleagues dated May 6, 2011, opposing cloture on this \nnomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter \nfrom Republican colleagues.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 6, 2011.\n       Dear Colleague: The Majority Leader has filed cloture on \n     James Cole, the President's nominee to be the Deputy Attorney \n     General. At this time, we do not support Mr. Cole's \n     appointment and urge you to oppose cloture on his nomination.\n       During the last Congress, Mr. Cole's nomination was not \n     considered by the full Senate for several reasons. First, the \n     Department of Justice has refused to comply with repeated \n     minority requests since August 2010 for documents and \n     information related to the activities of the Guantanamo Bay \n     Detainee Review Task Force. Second, Mr. Cole's comments and \n     hearing testimony regarding the September 11th terrorist \n     attacks raise significant concerns about his suitability to \n     be the Deputy Attorney General of the United States. Third, \n     we have concerns about Mr. Cole's abilities based on his \n     performance as an Independent Consultant tasked with \n     overseeing the insurance group, AIG. As a result, the Senate \n     returned the nomination to the President. Unfortunately, on \n     December 29, 2010, Mr. Cole was recess appointed to a one-\n     year term while the Senate was adjourned and sworn in shortly \n     thereafter. Notwithstanding Mr. Cole's recess appointment, \n     our reasons for opposing his nomination remain.\n\n\nDepartment of Justice Stonewalling Document and Information Requests by \n                            Ranking Members\n\n       For several years, the Senate Select Committee on \n     Intelligence has been reviewing the process used by the \n     Administration's Guantanamo Bay Detainee Review Task Force to \n     detain, transfer, or release detainees from the Guantanamo \n     Bay facility. Given that the recidivism rate among these \n     detainees has now risen above 25 percent, Congress must have \n     clear insight into this process to determine whether \n     additional legislation is needed to protect our national \n     security.\n       The Attorney General has been asked repeatedly to provide \n     Congress with: (1) any guidance or recommendations related to \n     the Task Force process (including a September 2009 Attorney \n     General memorandum concerning a presumption to be applied in \n     favor of transfer or release for certain detainees); (2) the \n     Task Force's unredacted recommendations regarding each \n     detainee; and (3) a list of the 92 detainees who were \n     approved for transfer as of August 28, 2009, prior to the \n     issuance of the September 2009 memo. In spite of these \n     specific written requests from Senators in the minority, \n     including a request from all of the minority members of the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence, the Justice Department has \n     not provided the information, instead asserting a \n     questionable ``deliberative process'' privilege to justify \n     its lack of compliance.\n       Aside from this dubious assertion of privilege, the \n     repeated failure of the Justice Department to comply with \n     this oversight request is part of a disturbing pattern of \n     refusing to recognize legitimate oversight requests from \n     ranking minority members. For example, the Justice Department \n     is currently refusing to turn over documents requested by the \n     Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding \n     serious allegations that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \n     Firearms, and Explosives knowingly allowed straw purchasers \n     to buy firearms that were then provided to criminal drug \n     cartels in Mexico. At least two of these weapons were later \n     found at the scene where Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was \n     murdered.\n\n\n                     Mr. Cole's Views on Terrorism\n\n       A September 2002 opinion piece by Mr. Cole raises serious \n     questions about his judgment and his current views on \n     terrorism. In that article, he noted that ``[f]or all the \n     rhetoric about war, the September 11th attacks were criminal \n     acts of terrorism against a civilian population'' and were no \n     more horrible than ``the scourge of the drug trade, the reign \n     of organized crime, and countless acts of rape, child abuse, \n     and murder.'' He also argued that the protections of our \n     criminal justice system ``must be applied to everyone to be \n     effective.''\n       While the United States must use every means at our \n     disposal--criminal, intelligence, and military--to fight \n     terrorism, not every terrorist deserves the valued \n     protections of our criminal justice system. Although Mr. Cole \n     has downplayed his comments, he has not rejected the \n     comparison of September 11th to ordinary criminal acts or \n     answered whether he favors trying terrorists in civilian \n     courts. His failure to do so exhibits a lack of understanding \n     about the real threat of terrorism.\n\n\n                Mr. Cole's Performance in Overseeing AIG\n\n       We have a number of concerns about Mr. Cole's abilities \n     based on his performance as an Independent Consultant tasked \n     with overseeing AIG. Some of these concerns cannot be shared \n     in this letter, because the Judiciary Committee has labeled \n     the relevant reports as ``Committee Confidential.'' \n     Nonetheless, these reports and Mr. Cole's responses reveal \n     what appears to be a level of deference to AIG management \n     that one would not expect to see from someone tasked as an \n     ``independent'' monitor. Also, we have serious concerns about \n     Mr. Cole's decision to suspend the compliance review of AIG's \n     Financial Products division following the government bailout.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       We believe that before Mr. Cole's nomination receives an \n     up-or-down vote in the Senate, the Department of Justice must \n     immediately comply with the long-standing requests for \n     documents and information related to the Guantanamo Bay \n     Detainee Review Task Force. Moreover, we are not yet \n     convinced that Mr. Cole's recess appointment should be \n     ratified by the Senate in light of the remaining concerns \n     about his suitability for this very important position.\n       Again, we urge you to oppose cloture of Mr. Cole's \n     nomination at this time.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles E. Grassley,\n       Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary.\n     Saxby Chambliss,\n       Vice Chairman, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. Cole's nomination is troubling on several fronts. \nFirst, the Department of Justice, where he now serves as second in \ncommand since his recess appointment this past December, refuses to \nprovide the Senate Intelligence Committee with documents we have been \nrequesting for months.\n  More than 2 years ago, the Intelligence Committee learned that the \nrecidivism rate--the number of prisoners we release who go back into \nthe fight--at Gitmo was 11 percent. Today it stands at over 25 percent. \nIn this effort to close the detention facility at Gitmo, the President \nordered a task force run by the Attorney General to review the status \nof all detainees still housed at Gitmo. Through much of 2009, the Gitmo \ndetainee review task force examined every detainee's case and made \nrecommendations to the administration on whether to transfer, release, \nor detain each one.\n  At a time when Congress is aware that former Gitmo detainees are \nreturning to their old ways, we have an obligation to the American \npeople--an obligation to the American people--to make sure no more \ndetainees are released who could cause us harm. Even though Gitmo \nremains open right now, efforts to transfer or release many of these \ndetainees continue today. The documents the Intelligence Committee is \nseeking all relate to the task force process and will help the \ncommittee understand why the task force made the recommendations it \ndid, especially with respect to those detainees who may have raised red \nflags for the intelligence community.\n  We know that the Attorney General provided recommendations on how the \ntask force should make its transfer decisions because of separate \ninformation provided to the committee. We do not have everything, \nhowever, including the September 2009 memorandum in which the Attorney \nGeneral reportedly recommends that an entire category of detainees be \npresumed to be eligible for transfer--presumed eligible for transfer. \nWhile we have asked for this memorandum and any other recommendations \nrepeatedly, the Department has refused to provide them. If the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States recommended that certain detainees be \ntreated favorably, possibly in spite of the intelligence, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee has a clear oversight interest in reviewing the \nSeptember memorandum and seeing if and to whom it was applied.\n  In addition to refusing to provide the September 2009 memorandum, the \nJustice Department has also denied the Intelligence Committee the \nrecommendations of the task force. The committee cannot determine why \nthe task force made its recommendations without seeing the description \nof how the task force came to the positions it did. The Department \nclaims that both the September 2009 memorandum and the unredacted \nrecommendations are protected from disclosure to Congress because of \ndeliberative process. This is an assertion ordinarily used in a FOIA \ncase or in the context of Executive privilege, not to inhibit \ncongressional oversight of a Federal agency. An interesting \ninconsistency in this assertion is that the administration has\n\n[[Page S2768]]\n\nwillingly provided the Intelligence Committee with the recommendations \nof the past administration.\n  I understand that in the last few days, the Attorney General has \nreached out to the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee in an \neffort to resolve these issues before today's vote. Given the \nDepartment's months of delays and obstruction in complying with this \nrequest, I believe cloture on this nomination is not appropriate until \nthe documents requested have been provided in full.\n  In addition to the document issue, Mr. Cole has not explained some \nhighly charged comments he made about 9/11. An op-ed he authored back \nin September 2002 called the 9/11 attacks ``criminal acts of terrorism \nagainst a civilian population.'' He went on to dismiss the severity of \n9/11, calling it no more horrible than ``the scourge of the drug trade, \nthe reign of organized crime, and countless acts of rape, child abuse, \nand murder.''\n  Mr. Cole has not rejected or fully explained those comments. Until he \ndoes so and until the Department ends its refusal to comply with \nreasonable congressional requests for information, I cannot support the \nmove to consider his nomination. I urge my colleagues to reject cloture \ntoday.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I assume we are on the nomination of Jim \nCole.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, to make a parliamentary inquiry: Am I \ncorrect that time runs to 5:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Time has been consumed by this quorum call, and so I ask \nunanimous consent that any time consumed in further quorum calls be \nequally divided on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the majority leader has been required to \nfile cloture in this extraordinary case in an attempt to overcome a \nRepublican filibuster on the nomination of Jim Cole to be Deputy \nAttorney General. This is a key national security position and the No. \n2 position at the Department of Justice. Certainly, with what has \nhappened in the past week or so, it is important for this President or \nany President to have a full national security team.\n  I thought back, and I could not remember a time in my 37 years here \nwhere the Senate has filibustered a President's nomination to be Deputy \nAttorney General. I asked Senate Judiciary Committee staff to check \nthat and they found that the Senate has never filibustered a \nPresident's nomination to be Deputy Attorney General. In fact, during \nthe time I was chairman of the committee, we quickly moved on President \nBush's Deputy Attorneys General, even on those who would not have been \nmy choice. We knew it was a national security position and it is \nimportant at a time when we face the threats we do here and abroad that \nwe have that position filled. In fact, I thought it would be \nunconscionable, whether it was President Bush, President Reagan or any \nother President, to stall a Deputy Attorney General.\n  Mr. Cole's nomination to fill this critical national security \nposition was blocked last year, when it was pending on the Senate's \nExecutive Calendar for 155 days after it was reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Committee. The nomination was reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Committee again in March, and incredibly, it is again being \nfilibustered. People have asked me how this could be happening. It is \nhard to believe that one week after the successful operation that \nkilled Osama bin Laden, the world's number one terrorist, we cannot \ntake this step to ensure that President Obama has his full national \nsecurity team in place. It is similar to ``Alice in Wonderland.''\n  Now that a measure of justice has been secured for the victims of \nSeptember 11, I have expressed hope that we could come together, as we \ndid in the weeks and months following September 11. We should be \nensuring that we are extra vigilant these days. There are widespread \nreports that experts are concerned about this being a time in which al-\nQaida will seek reprisals. Most Americans believe we should be \nconcerned about them trying to strike back. This is not a time for \nfurther delay or obstruction. Let us join together and confirm this \nqualified nominee. We also ought to show the rest of the world that no \nmatter what our political labels might be, we believe in the President \nof the United States having his national security team in place.\n  This weekend, the Washington Post editorial board called this delay \n``ridiculous,'' referring to the Deputy Attorney General as \n``essentially the chief operating officer of the Justice Department, \nincluding its national security operations.'' This delay is ridiculous \nand dangerous to every single American. I hope other Senators will see \nit as such and help end it.\n  We have the opportunity to set aside partisanship and join with our \nPresident to keep America safe. I recall in the aftermath of 9/11 we \ntook immediate steps--Republicans and Democrats together--to do what we \ncould to make sure the President's entire law enforcement team was in \nplace.\n  We expedited the nominations of 14 U.S. attorneys that had been \nreceived in the Senate only 1 week before, reporting them from the \nJudiciary Committee on September 13 and confirming them by voice vote \nthe very next day. Those nominations included the nomination of Paul \nMcNulty to the Eastern District of Virginia, one of the key districts \nwhere terrorism defendants like Zacarias Moussaoui, one of the \nconspirators in the 9/11 attacks, are tried. We continued to expedite \nnominations in the weeks and months that followed, confirming an \nadditional 58 officials to posts at the Justice Department in those \nweeks and before the end of 2001.\n  Republican Senators helped a Republican President to get his security \nteam in place to protect the Nation, but now are not going to help a \nDemocratic President to get his security team in place. It is the same \nNation and the security threats are the same against Republican \nPresidents and Democratic Presidents. We ought to come together as \nAmericans first on this important issue.\n  Last week at the Judiciary Committee's oversight hearing on the \nDepartment of Justice, the Attorney General of the United States \nreiterated the need for final Senate action on the nomination of the \nDeputy Attorney General. He urged the Senate to confirm Jim Cole to \nhelp the Department fulfill all of its critical tasks, including \nprotecting national security, in a time of heightened concern about \nretaliatory attacks stemming from Osama bin Laden's death. Yet, rather \nthan take action to end the unnecessary and unexplained delays and \nfinally confirm the nomination of Jim Cole, the unprecedented \nRepublican filibuster continues. This is wrong. It should end.\n  I hope that Senators on the other side of the aisle will listen to \nformer Deputy Attorneys General of the United States who served in both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations. Last December, they wrote to \nthe leaders of the Senate and urged the Senate to consider Mr. Cole's \nnomination without delay. These former officials who served with \ndistinction in that post wrote that the Deputy is ``the chief operating \nofficer of the Department of Justice, supervising its day-to-day \noperations'' and that ``the Deputy is also a key member of the \npresident's national security team, a function that has grown in \nimportance and complexity in the years since the terror attacks of \nSeptember 11.'' They were right and their advice rings true today.\n  As the former Deputies, 3 of whom served under President George W. \nBush, noted in their letter, ``Because of the responsibilities of the \nposition of Deputy Attorney General, votes on nomination for this \nposition usually proceed quickly.'' I wish the Senate had heeded their \nadvice and voted to confirm Mr. Cole last year. Now another 5 months \nhave passed.\n  When we first reported Jim Cole's nomination last July, I said that I \nhoped the Senate would treat his nomination to this critical national \nsecurity and law enforcement position with the same urgency and \nseriousness with which we treated all four of the Deputy\n\n[[Page S2769]]\n\nAttorneys General who served under President Bush. All four were \nconfirmed by the Senate by voice vote an average of 21 days after they \nwere reported by the Judiciary Committee. In fact, we confirmed \nPresident Bush's first nomination to be Deputy Attorney General the day \nit was reported by the committee. That is not the treatment that Deputy \nAttorney General Cole has received.\n  The Senate's treatment of the Cole nomination represents a sharp \nbreak from the Senate's longstanding practice of deference to the \nadministration and timely consideration of critical national and law \nenforcement nominations. In their letter last December, the 8 former \nDeputy Attorneys General noted that, of the 11 nominations to fill this \nposition over the last 20 years from Democratic and Republican \nPresidents, ``none remained pending for longer than 32 days.'' I \nremember some of President Bush's nominations to this position remained \npending even less than that.\n  Jim Cole's nomination has been pending on the floor for 222 days \ncombined, nearly seven times longer than any nominee in the last 20 \nyears. In fact, dating back to 1981, 15 of the 16 Deputy Attorney \nGeneral nominations pending on the Executive Calendar were confirmed \nunanimously, the only exception being President Obama's first Deputy \nAttorney General nomination, of David Ogden, which was confirmed 65-28 \nafter cloture was filed and a time agreement was reached. All of the \nnominees of Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton and George \nBush were confirmed unanimously by the Senate, in an average of less \nthan 2 weeks.\n\n  Last December, after the nomination had already been delayed for over \n4 months without explanation, I came to the floor and asked unanimous \nconsent that at a time to be determined by the majority and minority \nleaders, the Senate consent to a time agreement for a debate and a vote \non the Cole nomination. I asked that Senators have the courage to step \nforward, not hide behind the filibuster, and to either vote yes or no \non this critical national security position. Republicans objected to \nthat request in December and have still, 5 months later, refused to \nagree to a time to debate and vote on the nomination. It is time \nfinally for the Senate to vote. The American people expect us to vote. \nThe security of this country is threatened.\n  Jim Cole's nomination was pending last year for 5 months while \nRepublican Senators objected time and time again to calling it up for a \nvote. I believe that Mr. Cole would have been confirmed by the Senate \nhad his nomination been given an up-or-down vote. I believe he should \nbe confirmed. As it was, after the Senate did not take final action on \nthe nomination, President Obama exercised his authority after the \nSenate had recessed for the year to appoint him in order to make sure \nthis critical national security and law enforcement post was filled. \nThe President promptly renominated him when Congress returned this \nyear. Recess appointments have not prevented Republican Senators from \nvoting to confirm nominations by Republican Presidents. Given the \nhistory of obstruction of this nomination, it is time for the Senate to \nvote.\n  This is not a nomination that should have been controversial. It is a \nnomination supported by former Republican Senator Jack Danforth, who \nworked with Jim Cole for more than 15 years. When he introduced Mr. \nCole at his confirmation hearing, Senator Danforth described Mr. Cole \nas someone without an ideological or political agenda. He also wrote to \nthe committee that ``Jim is a `lawyer's lawyer.' He is exceedingly \nknowledgeable, especially on matters relating to legal and business \nethics, public integrity and compliance with government regulations. He \nis highly regarded [] as a skillful litigator. As his resume \ndemonstrates, he has a long and deep experience in the Department of \nJustice.'' I agree.\n  Jim Cole served as a career prosecutor at the Justice Department for \na dozen years and has a well-deserved reputation for fairness, \nintegrity and toughness. He has demonstrated that he understands the \nissues of crime and national security that are at the center of the \nDeputy Attorney General's job. Nothing suggests that he will be \nanything other than a steadfast defender of America's safety.\n  We have received numerous letters of support for the nomination of \nJim Cole to be Deputy Attorney General, including letters from many \nformer Republican public officials. I ask unanimous consent that these \nthree letters be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Among these is a letter from Michael Toner, former Chief \nCounsel of the Republican National Committee and former General Counsel \nto the Bush-Cheney 2000 Campaign, who wrote ``[i]n light of his \nextensive experience, legal acumen, professionalism and integrity, I \ncan think of no better person than Mr. Cole to serve as Deputy Attorney \nGeneral.''\n  Chuck Rosenberg, former Chief of Staff for Deputy Attorney General \nJames Comey, who served under President George W. Bush, wrote, ``I know \nhow important it is for this crucial position to be filled by the right \nperson. Jim is the right person. He is smart, experienced, thoughtful \nand has the proper skills and temperament to help Attorney General Eric \nHolder lead the Justice Department.''\n  In his letter recommending Mr. Cole, Michael J. Madigan, a Republican \ncounsel on many high-level Senate investigations, described Mr. Cole as \n``one of those somewhat rare individuals in this city about whom you \nwill never hear even the mildest of criticism.'' He concluded that Mr. \nCole ``is a good man and perfectly suited for the challenging position \nfor which the President has wisely nominated him.''\n  Mr. Cole's critics have been wrong to try to blame him for the \nactions of AIG. His limited role was as an outside monitor of other \ncorporate functions and there is no evidence showing he did not perform \nhis assignment well. Let us hold those responsible at AIG accountable. \nNot a single person at AIG has been. There is no basis for making Mr. \nCole the scapegoat for the action of AIG. Blame the AIG agents and \nemployees, blame its officers, blame its board, or even criticize the \nlack of oversight by state and Federal regulators and law enforcement \nofficials if you like. But scapegoating this good man is wrong. As The \nWashington Post observed in an editorial last year when Mr. Cole's \nnomination was being blocked on the Senate floor, ``There is no \nsuggestion that Mr. Cole suffers from the kind of ethical or legal \nproblems that would disqualify a nominee.''\n  There is no justification for the failure to act on this critical \nnational security nomination, and for failing to make sure that the \nadministration has its full national security team in place. During the \ntime when I was chairman we moved very quickly on President Bush's \nnominees for Deputy Attorney General because of the importance of the \nsecurity of the United States. It is important for every President to \nsucceed, no matter their party.\n  I hope that the Senate will reject this destructive and unprecedented \nfilibuster so that we can finally consider and confirm Jim Cole after \nmany months of unnecessary delays. As I said, I could not remember a \ntime in my 37 years here where we had filibustered a nominee to be \nDeputy Attorney General and that proved to be true.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                   Bryan Cave,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2010.\n     Hon.

Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Sessions: I write in strong \n     support of Jim Cole's nomination to serve as Deputy Attorney \n     General of the United States.\n       By way of background, I am a Partner at Bryan Cave LLP in \n     Washington, DC. Prior to joining Bryan Cave, I was Chairman \n     of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) and was a \n     Commissioner on the FEC from 2002-2007. Prior to being \n     appointed to the FEC, I served as Chief Counsel of the \n     Republican National Committee, General Counsel of the Bush-\n     Cheney 2000 Campaign, and General Counsel of the 2000 Bush-\n     Cheney Transition Team.\n       I have known Jim Cole for approximately 15 years and have \n     had the privilege of being a colleague of Mr. Cole's at Bryan \n     Cave for the last three years. I first met Mr. Cole when he \n     served as Special Counsel for the House Ethics Committee's \n     inquiry concerning Speaker Gingrich and I was an attorney \n     representing Speaker Gingrich in the\n\n[[Page S2770]]\n\n     matter. Although Mr. Cole and I obviously had conflicting \n     interests in the Gingrich matter, I was tremendously \n     impressed with the thoroughness and professionalism by which \n     Mr. Cole conducted himself in the Gingrich matter, and that \n     has been a hallmark of all of my experiences with Mr. Cole \n     over the last 15 years.\n       Mr. Cole is superbly qualified to serve as Deputy Attorney \n     General of the United States. Mr. Cole is one of the smartest \n     and most able criminal lawyers in the country, and Mr. Cole's \n     prior service at the Justice Department will be invaluable \n     experience in working with Attorney General Holder in \n     managing and leading the Justice Department. In light of his \n     extensive experience, legal acumen, professionalism and \n     integrity, I can think of no better person that Mr. Cole to \n     serve as Deputy Attorney General.\n       Jim Cole has my highest recommendation to serve as Deputy \n     Attorney General of the United States and it is an honor to \n     have the opportunity to write on Mr. Cole's behalf. If \n     confirmed, I believe that Mr. Cole would serve the Department \n     of Justice and the country with great distinction in the \n     years ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael E. Toner.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                Phelps Dunbar,\n\n                                   New Orleans, LA, June 10, 2010.\n     Re Nomination of Jim Cole to be next Deputy Attorney General \n         of the United States of America.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judicial Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing this letter to recommend, \n     without hesitation, Jim Cole to be confirmed as the next \n     Deputy Attorney General in the United States Department of \n     Justice.\n       As a former United States Attorney in Louisiana, I worked \n     with Jim Cole when he prosecuted a corrupt federal judge. I \n     also have worked with Mr. Cole for more than a decade while \n     he worked in the private sector.\n       I know Jim Cole to be bright, hard-working, dedicated and \n     beyond reproach. If confirmed by the United States Senate, I \n     believe Jim Cole will be an asset to both the Justice \n     Department and the citizens of the United States. I \n     respectfully ask you to consider my wholehearted support of \n     Jim Cole as the next Deputy Attorney General.\n       I know that you, and the other members of the Judiciary \n     Committee as well as the Senate, strive for bipartisan \n     cooperation. As a Republican Presidential appointee, I \n     believe it is critical for members of the Justice Department \n     to have bipartisan support and the confidence of the American \n     people regardless of party affiliation. I appreciate your \n     consideration of my views as to the soundness of the \n     nomination of Jim Cole for Deputy Attorney General and would \n     welcome an opportunity to provide you with additional \n     information if you so choose.\n       Thanking you again for your courtesies and with best \n     regards, I remain,\n           Sincerely,\n     Harry Rosenberg.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                       Orrick,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2010.\n     Re James M. Cole, Nominee for Deputy Attorney General.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Sessions: It is my great privilege \n     and honor to add my voice, wholeheartedly, to those \n     supporting the nomination of Jim Cole for the critically \n     important position of Deputy Attorney General of the United \n     States.\n       I have known Jim for years and he is and has been a truly \n     outstanding lawyer and, most importantly, an even better \n     person. For the last two years I have had the honor of \n     serving with Jim on the ABA-DOJ Dialogue Group where he has \n     been an always thoughtful and important member.\n       Jim, as you already know, has had an outstanding career \n     both as a federal prosecutor and as a criminal and civil \n     trial lawyer. Indeed, Jim, I dare say, is one of those \n     somewhat rare individuals in this city about whom you will \n     never hear even the mildest of criticism. He is a good man \n     and is perfectly suited for the challenging position for \n     which the President has wisely nominated him.\n       I am honored to offer unqualified support for Jim's \n     nomination.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                               Michael J. Madigan.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I see the distinguished Senator from Texas is here, so I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee has pointed out the Deputy Attorney General is a \nmember of the national security team of the President, and the \nPresident has already used the authority under the Constitution to make \na recess appointment of this nominee. But the question before the \nSenate today is whether the Senate should confirm the nomination of \nJames Cole to serve as Deputy Attorney General.\n  There are three reasons why I oppose this nomination. The first is \nMr. Cole is one of the earliest and most vociferous advocates of \nbringing foreign al-Qaida terrorists to American cities for civilian \ntrials--a position since repudiated by the Attorney General himself in \nthe case of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and I am grateful for that. But Mr. \nCole has never recanted his position that, in effect, these are \ncriminal cases to be prosecuted as ordinary crimes rather than \nterrorist acts during a time of war.\n  The problem, of course, with the paradigm of treating terrorism as a \ncriminal case is that we don't punish the terrorists until they have \nactually been successful in committing a terrorist attack. In war, half \nthe battle--maybe more than half the battle--is trying to stop the \nterrorist from actually accomplishing his or her goal of killing \ninnocent people. We do that by interrogating detainees and finding out \nwhat they know about the organization and plans of terrorist attacks. \nMr. Cole, unfortunately, stands by the outdated, outmoded \ncharacterization of these terrorist attacks being ordinary crimes. Of \ncourse, they are something much worse indeed.\n  Quite frankly, as Mr. Holder's Deputy, Mr. Cole will only exacerbate \nthe worst tendencies of the Department of Justice when it comes to \ndistinguishing between criminal prosecutions and fighting a war against \nterrorists. This was, of course, the primary reason why Mr. Cole's \nnomination was unanimously rejected by Republicans in the Judiciary \nCommittee. The American people want a Department of Justice that is \ncommitted to enforcing the law and protecting the innocent, not \ncreating new civil rights for terrorists or treating them as ordinary \ncriminals when they are something else indeed.\n  In fact, the recent death of Osama bin Laden was a product of a lot \nof intelligence gathering that occurred over the years. That would \nnever have occurred under Mr. Cole's proposed model of Mirandizing \nthese people when they are arrested; telling them they do not have to \nprovide any information because they are being treated as ordinary \ncriminals rather than as terrorists who are eligible for rough \ninterrogation, if necessary, in order to find out what they know in \norder to save innocent lives.\n  Rather than listening to the concerns of Republicans on the Judiciary \nCommittee about Mr. Cole's narrow view of the war on terror and of the \nviews of the American people and perhaps reconsidering this flawed \nnomination, the President decided to plow ahead and bypass the advise \nand consent process with a recess appointment. As I said, he, of \ncourse, has the right to do so.\n  There are actually a couple other reasons why I oppose the \nnomination, and I wish to first express my appreciation to Senator \nChambliss and Senator Grassley. Senator Chambliss, of course, is the \nranking member of the Senate's Select Committee on Intelligence, and \nSenator Grassley is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. They have continued to demand information from the \nDepartment of Justice and have been stonewalled at every turn. Senator \nChambliss and his colleagues on the Intelligence Committee have made \nperfectly reasonable requests consistent with the committee's oversight \nresponsibilities related to the Obama administration's Guantanamo \nDetainee Review Task Force. Senator Grassley, on the other hand, from \nhis position as the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, on \nwhich I serve, has requested documents concerning serious allegations \nthat the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives knowingly \nallowed straw purchasers to buy firearms which were then provided to \ncriminal drug cartels in Mexico. It has later been reported that at \nleast two of these weapons were found at the scene where a Border \nPatrol agent named Brian Terry was murdered.\n\n  I fully support Senators Grassley and Chambliss and regret that \nrepeated requests for information that were well within the purview of \nthe oversight responsibilities of Congress have been unreasonably \nrejected. When a minority in the Senate is denied the usual and \ncustomary information necessary for us to do our job, we are left\n\n[[Page S2771]]\n\nwith very few options. One of those options is to force a resolution by \nexercising our rights as a minority to block cloture. That is not \nnecessarily a permanent move. It means debate continues on the \nnomination and we cannot come to a vote. But I submit, if rational \nminds would come together--if Senator Grassley and Senator Chambliss \ncould get the information they and their committees are entitled to and \ndischarge their oversight responsibilities--we could come much closer \nto resolving the differences on this particular nominee.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to cloture on the \nnomination of James Cole to be the Deputy Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  Last December, I objected to further consideration of Mr. Cole's \nnomination because of the refusal of the Department of Justice, DOJ, to \ncomply with reasonable document requests from the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. Unfortunately, the President decided to \ncircumvent the Senate and recess-appointed Mr. Cole on December 29, \n2010.\n  Here we are 5 months later: the Justice Department is still thwarting \nthe Intelligence committee's oversight.\n  The documents we have requested all relate to the Guantanamo Detainee \nReview Task Force that made recommendations to the Administration on \nwhether to transfer, release, or detain Gitmo detainees. Over 2 years \nago, the committee became aware of rising recidivism rates among former \nGitmo detainees. At that time, the rate was around 11 percent--it is \nnow above 25 percent. Congress has a unique obligation to the American \npeople to ensure that no more dangerous detainees are released from \nGitmo, and that those who have been released do not resume their \nterrorist ways. Each one of the documents we are seeking is essential \nto understanding why the task force made certain recommendations about \ncertain detainees, especially those detainees our intelligence \nprofessionals judged were too dangerous to transfer.\n  The detainees remaining at Gitmo are among the worst of the worst, \nyet many are still designated for transfer. Given the upward trend in \nrecidivism rates, the Intelligence Committee is reasonably concerned \nthat some of the detainees who have been or may be transferred to third \ncountries will reengage in terrorist activities. Lingering questions \nabout the monitoring capabilities of countries that have accepted \ndetainees add to these concerns.\n  In making its recommendations, the task force operated under guidance \nand recommendations from the Attorney General. The Department of \nJustice, however, refuses to provide a September 2009 Attorney General \nmemorandum that reportedly recommends that an entire category of \ndetainees be presumed to be eligible for transfer. If classes of \ndetainees are to be presumed to be eligible for transfer by DOJ, then I \nthink the Intelligence Committee should know about it and why such \nguidance was considered appropriate.\n  The Department has also refused to provide the Intelligence committee \nwith the task force's recommendations for the disposition of the \ndetainees. The task force documents we have been given have entire \nportions of their recommendations blacked out. This is no way to \nconduct oversight and it certainly puts the committee at a disadvantage \nin trying to understand why transfer decisions were made. \nInterestingly, the Department has provided the recommendations made by \nreview boards during the previous administration.\n  As with the September 2009 memorandum, the Department argues against \ngiving this information to Congress because of ``deliberative \nprocess.'' That assertion may work in a FOIA case or in the context of \nexecutive privilege, but there is no legal basis for using it to deny \ncongressional oversight, especially where the documents pertain to \nnational security matters. It is time for the Justice Department to \nabandon this baseless argument and give us the documents.\n  The Intelligence committee is also waiting for a list of the 92 \ndetainees who were approved for transfer as of August 28, 2009, prior \nto the application of the September 2009 memorandum. The Department \nindicated in November 2010 that the list would be provided, but the \ncommittee has yet to receive it.\n  Last Friday, we heard from the Department for the first time in \nmonths, wanting to work something out on the documents in advance of \nthe cloture vote on the Cole nomination. This is a bit ironic, \nconsidering that letters and e-mails from last year have gone \nunanswered. The best thing they can do now is to honor our request and \ngive us the documents that we have requested.\n  The Department's obstruction of a congressional review is not the \nonly reason I am opposing cloture. Mr. Cole still has not explained \ncomments he made about the 9/11 attacks. In September 2002, he wrote an \nop-ed in which he called these attacks ``criminal acts of terrorism \nagainst a civilian population.'' Following this logic, he diminished 9/\n11 to being no more than ``the scourge of the drug trade, the reign of \norganized crime, and countless acts of rape, child abuse, and murder.'' \nHe also argued that the protections of our criminal justice system \n``must be applied to everyone to be effective.'' I could not disagree \nmore with this statement--no terrorist deserves the benefits of our \ncriminal justice system.\n  Mr. Cole has neither rejected these comments, nor really explained \nwhy he made them. Until he does so, I have to question his judgment and \nhis suitability to be the second-in-command at the Justice Department.\n  It is for these reasons, I cannot support cloture on the nomination \nof Mr. Cole at this time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor an outstanding \nIllinoisan, Alice Saudargas, and to thank her for her many years of \nservice as she ends her term on the Rockford School Board.\n  Alice Saudargas is a remarkable public servant. She has dedicated her \nlife to working with high-poverty schools and troubled children. Alice \nand her late husband Alex spent more than 70 years educating students \nin Rockford, and as she recently said ``we loved every minute of it.''\n  Alice Christine Nesheim was born in 1916 in northern Illinois to \nNorwegian immigrants. She graduated first in her high school class and \nwas the first in her family to attend college. She graduated with a \ndegree from DeKalb State Teachers College, which is now Northern \nIllinois University. While there, she met her husband Alex Saudargas \nand they moved to Rockford to start a family.\n  Alice raised ten children and supported Alex as he led the basketball \nteam at West High School to two legendary state championships in 1955 \nand 1956. In those days, Alice could always be seen at West's \nbasketball games, cheering on the team.\n  But Alice wanted to have a personal impact on the lives of Rockford's \nneediest students. She went back to school and earned her master's \ndegree in education from Northern Illinois University. Alice worked as \na special education teacher and eventually became a principal of \nElmwood Center, a school for emotionally disturbed children. The \nstudents there called her ``Big Mamma'' and they always appreciated the \nlove, support, and care she showed them.\n  Alice retired from the school district in 1986 at the age of 70, but \nshe didn't slow down or lose her passion for education. She led \ncommittees to help make the Rockford schools more inclusive of all \nchildren and to maintain the legacy of West High School. At the age of \n84, Alice was appointed to complete a term on the Rockford School \nBoard. She was subsequently elected in her own right and served on the \nboard for 11 years. Her last day as a Rockford School Board member was \nApril 26.\n  Alice is supported in all her endeavors by her 9 surviving children, \n16 grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren as well as the hundreds of \nstudents she has supported and mentored throughout her long career. She \nhas touched the lives of countless individuals in my state. She is \nrenowned for her commitment to Rockford's neediest children, her strong \nspirit, and of course her trademark laugh.\n  Although Alice's time on the Rockford School Board has come to an \nend, I know that this won't be the end of her service or commitment to \nthe community. I understand that she plans to write a book about her \nlife and work. That will be quite a story.\n  I thank Alice for her lifelong efforts to improve the lives of others \nin and around Rockford. I wish her all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/09/senate-section/article/S2772-4", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JODY HERNANDEZ\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in the midst of all our other business, \nI would like to just pause and take a moment to recognize the \noutstanding work of Jody Hernandez, who left us yesterday after 16 \nyears of dedicated Senate service. Jody came to Washington, by way of \nSan Antonio, after graduating from Vanderbilt University. Over the \nyears, she has lent her talents to the Republican Policy Committee, the \nBudget Committee, and with Senator Don Nickles on and off the Hill. \nDavid Schiappa convinced her to come back to the Senate in 2005, and \nshe has been an indispensable part of the Senate floor team ever since. \nWhenever any of us had a question, she had the answer. She has been a \nfriendly and welcoming presence in the cloakroom, regardless of how \nlong her day was. She has been a tremendous help to every one of us. \nAnd we will all miss her. But we are all delighted that she has found \nher partner in life, and we wish her and her new husband, LCDR Glenn \nWright, U.S. Navy, many years of happiness and every success as they \nbegin their life together. Jody and Glenn met on a church trip to \nIsrael in October and recently tied the knot. So I am sure many \nadventures lie ahead. We thank her for her good cheer, her \nprofessionalism, and her service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/09/senate-section/article/S2772-5", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2772-S2773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING THE ALLY FOUNDATION\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today to honor The \nALLY Foundation, an inspirational organization in Massachusetts. In the \nsummer of 2002, a young woman named Alexandra ``Ally'' Zapp walked into \na fast food restaurant's restroom in Massachusetts and was brutally \nmurdered.\n  Soon after Ally's death, her parents learned that the man who killed \nAlly was not just an employee of the restaurant but an extremely \ndangerous sexual predator with 24 previous criminal convictions, \nincluding rape and kidnapping.\n  Ally's mother, Andrea Casanova, and stepfather, Steven Stiles, turned \ntheir anger to resolve and their sadness to hope and founded The ALLY \nFoundation. The ALLY Foundation is dedicated to changing the way our \nsociety deals with sexual predators and educating policymakers, \nemployers, and the general public on sexual violence. Their work \ninitially involved learning all they could about sexual violence, \nporing over research, attending conferences, and interviewing dozens of \nexperts. Andrea soon became an expert herself and a compelling presence \nat sex offender management conferences.\n  Andrea and Steve's tireless research confirms that current criminal \nstatutes and incarceration guidelines as they pertain to sexual \nviolence often go unenforced and are at best inconsistent. There are an \nestimated 600,000 sex offenders in the country and authorities have not \naccounted for as many as 100,000 offenders.\n  The ALLY Foundation does more than merely raise awareness of a \nproblem; they're helping to solve it. Within 2 years of Ally's murder, \nThe ALLY Foundation had already made a significant impact on public \npolicy, including helping to pass Massachusetts's sexually dangerous \ncommitment law--known as the Ally Zapp Law--to keep sex offenders \npredators off the street after they complete their criminal sentence.\n  Ally's tragic death and countless other attacks were the result of a \nlegal\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\nsystem largely unequipped to handle the unique dynamics of sexual \npredation. Ally's killer should never have been free, let alone work \naround the general public.\n  In less than a decade, The ALLY Foundation has had a profound impact \non public policy. It is impossible to know how many lives have been \nsaved or how many were spared the physical and emotional scars of \nsexual abuse and violence. But the fact remains that thanks to The ALLY \nFoundation, public officials and employers are far better educated and \nequipped to enact laws and adjust policies to reflect the unique nature \nof sexual violence. I commend Andrea and Steve for all they do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/09/senate-section/article/S2773-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ROONEY NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in March, I was compelled to place a hold \non the nomination of Jo Ann Rooney to be Principal Deputy Under \nSecretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, when I was not \nsatisfied that the military had properly investigated the mistreatment \nof some members of the Oregon National Guard who were demobilizing at \nJoint Base Lewis-McChord, JBLM.\n  I am pleased to say that today I am lifting that hold.\n  I have had meetings and exchanged letters with Secretary of the Army \nJohn McHugh, Army Vice Chief of Staff General Peter Chiarelli, Major \nGeneral Philip Volpe, Jo Ann Rooney, and Dr. Clifford Stanley, who will \nbe Dr. Rooney's supervisor if she is confirmed. I have also received \nseveral documents related to the investigations, and written answers to \nmore than 60 questions about the investigations.\n  I am satisfied that the actions taken by the Army put them on the \nright path to ensuring that future National Guard soldiers receive all \nof the care and benefits to which they are entitled.\n  I will continue to closely monitor the implementation of the changes \nthe Army is making. However, I believe that Dr. Rooney would, if \nconfirmed, work to ensure that all servicemembers get appropriate \nmedical care, and improve the demobilization process.\n  I would urge the Senate to quickly and positively act on Dr. Rooney's \nnomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/09/senate-section/article/S2773-2", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THOMAS J. PAMPERIN\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today \nto recognize the long and distinguished career of Mr. Thomas J. \nPamperin of the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. After nearly four \ndecades of public service, beginning with the U.S. Army and now as the \nVA's Deputy Under Secretary for Disability Assistance, Tom is retiring. \nFrom his days as a VA claims examiner in Milwaukee to his present \nleadership position, he has ably served our Nation's veterans.\n  Tom has earned an excellent reputation with Members of Congress and \ntheir staff, especially with that of the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs, of which I was proud to serve as chairman during the 109th and \n110th Congresses. He also receives high praise from leaders of veterans \nservice organizations, the Department of Defense, the Social Security \nAdministration, and the Department of Justice. He has represented the \nVA with distinction before the Congress, other Federal agencies, and \nforeign delegations.\n  During my chairmanship of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Tom was \nthe ``go to person'' for matters of critical importance to veterans, \nespecially those seeking compensation for their war wounds. When time \nwas of the essence, he cut through the red tape and personally saw to \nit that the veteran got the benefits that were due. More broadly, he \nhas led efforts to improve the delivery of benefits to all veterans, \nincluding initiatives to ease the burden of proof for those suffering \nfrom post-traumatic stress disorder, to enable veterans to begin the \nclaims process before discharge from military service, to better \ncoordinate the delivery of military and VA benefits, and to automate \nclaims for higher education benefits under the new G.I. bill.\n  In particular, I thank Tom for the work he did in improving VA's \nevaluation of and ratings for veterans with traumatic brain injuries, \nTBI. Soon after becoming chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I \nasked former VA Under Secretary for Benefits, Daniel L. Cooper, about \nlimitations on TBI ratings to 10 percent ``and no more.'' Tom played a \nsignificant role in VA's response: He developed temporary guidance so \nthat VA could promptly address cases where the limitation should not be \napplied and developed final regulations to ensure more appropriate \nratings in subsequent claims. Tom's actions had an immediate and \nsustained impact on the lives of veterans who were injured in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Nearly 40 years of service to the Nation demonstrates a commitment to \npublic service matched by few. Tom has worked tirelessly to ensure that \nveterans receive the benefits that they deserve, a goal that has become \never more challenging with increases in the number of servicemembers \nreturning from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan who have serious \ninjuries, the demand for G.I. bill benefits, and the number of \ncompensable illnesses. Over the course of his career, Tom has devoted \nhimself to delivering on the Nation's promise to care for the veteran \nand his widow. I applaud his dedication, hard work, and countless \nachievements, and I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking him for \nhis many years of service to the country and to the many veterans whose \nlives he has improved in such crucial ways. His record is an example of \npublic service at its best, and I deeply appreciate his long commitment \nto those who have worn the nation's uniform.

ROBERT A. WILD, S.J.\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I wish to honor Reverend Robert A. \nWild, S.J., president of Marquette University in Milwaukee. Father Wild \nbegan his duties as president of Marquette University on June 17, 1996, \nwith a pledge that he would ``spare no effort in keeping Marquette on a \nstrong and clear path into the future.'' As he enters retirement on \nJuly 31, 2011, it is my belief that my friend has not strayed from his \npledge.\n  As a Catholic, Jesuit institution, Marquette promotes an academically \nrigorous, values-centered curriculum. Throughout his presidency, Father \nWild has encouraged the practical preparation of students for work in \nan increasingly complex and diverse world, advocating for the formation \nof individuals as ethical and informed leaders in their religious, \ncultural, professional, and civic communities. Through this work, \nFather Wild has demonstrated a deep care and understanding of the \ndevelopment of young people.\n  Early in his career as president, Father Wild oversaw the rewriting \nof Marquette's mission statement in an effort to clearly define what \nall people,\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\nyoung and old, should strive toward on a daily basis. The mission \nstatement was reorganized under the key values of excellence, faith, \nleadership and service. These values have permeated all aspects of \nFather Wild's tenure as he has constantly inspired the Marquette \ncommunity in the fostering of personal and professional excellence, the \npromotion of a life of faith, and the development of leadership \nexpressed in service to others.\n  Father Wild has boldly committed Marquette to making higher education \naccessible to all students, regardless of financial means. To \naccomplish this, Marquette became the first university in the country \nto partner with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America to offer full-tuition \nscholarships. This program and others have helped many first-generation \nstudents attend college, so much so that 20 percent of Marquette's \nstudents are the first in their families to attend college.\n  The more than 36,000 students who have received a Marquette degree \nunder Father Wild's tenure have had the advantage of learning from \nrenowned faculty members who work to advance knowledge and improve the \nworld around them. Over Father Wild's career, faculty members and \nstudents have seen a 130-percent increase in total research and \nsponsored project dollars.\n  Beyond research and academics, Father Wild has placed an emphasis on \ncommunity interaction that has made Marquette a focal point for \ndiscussion of the region's most important and complex societal issues. \nThanks to these interactions, Marquette's presence in southeast \nWisconsin is stronger than ever before. Father Wild has expanded the \nuniversity's outreach through service and faculty research, and \ncurrently more than 85 percent of Marquette students serve their \ncommunity.\n  The physical growth of the Marquette campus is one of the most \nobvious indicators of Father Wild's commitment to the university. \nFather Wild oversaw the financing, construction and completion of a new \nfacility for the Marquette University School of Dentistry, training the \nState's future dentists and promoting oral health through outreach \nprograms that target underserved patients in six clinical sites \nthroughout the State, making Marquette one of the largest Medicaid \nproviders in the State. All of this growth has been fueled by \nunprecedented fundraising led by Father Wild.\n  In addition to promoting academics and service, Father Wild was \nstrategic in helping Marquette enter the Big East Athletic Conference \nin 2005. In 6 short years, the school has enjoyed success in many of \nits athletic programs, most prominently a Sweet 16 run in the 2011 NCAA \nMen's Basketball Tournament.\n  I offer my gratitude and sincerest thanks to my friend Father Wild on \nhis retirement from Marquette University. His presidency, based in the \nvalues of excellence, faith, leadership and service, has inspired \ncountless individuals not only in the Marquette community but in \nMilwaukee and throughout Wisconsin that will be felt for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/09/senate-section/article/S2774-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2774-S2775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HOOSIER ESSAY CONTEST WINNERS\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish today to take the opportunity \nto express my congratulations to the winners of the 2010-2011 Dick \nLugar/Indiana Farm Bureau/Indiana Farm Bureau Insurance Companies Youth \nEssay Contest.\n  In 1985, I joined with the Indiana Farm Bureau to sponsor an essay \ncontest for 8th grade students in my home State. The purpose of this \ncontest is to encourage young Hoosiers to recognize and appreciate the \nimportance of Indiana agriculture in their lives and subsequently craft \nan essay responding to the assigned theme. The theme chosen for this \nyear was ``Agriculture: Then and Now.''\n  Along with my friends at the Indiana Farm Bureau and Indiana Farm \nBureau Insurance Companies, I am pleased with the annual response to \nthis contest and the quality of the essays received over the years. I \napplaud each of this year's participants on their thoughtful work and \nwish, especially, to highlight the submissions of the 2010-2011 contest \nwinners Alexis J. Carmony of Falmouth, Indiana, and Collin Bowlin of \nJasper, Indiana. I submit for the Record the complete text of Alexis's \nand Collin's respective essays. I am pleased, also, to include the \nnames of the many district and county winners of the contest.\n  The essays and winners follow.\n\n                       Agriculture: Then and Now\n\n                         (By Alexis J. Carmony)\n\n       Indiana agriculture is important to me because of the basic \n     values it instills in my life. Agriculture is about hard \n     work, appreciation for life and living things, the importance \n     of our soil and water conservation, perseverance, ability to \n     overcome hardships, and being creative in dealing with \n     factors beyond man's control.\n       Indiana agriculture has an amazing responsibility. Years \n     ago, Indiana farmers were proud to feed their families from \n     the farm; today Indiana farmers are proud to feed the world \n     from their farms. The heart of Indiana agriculture has not \n     changed from decades ago. Past generations had to physically \n     work hard to produce their product, whereas the present \n     generations have to work as hard for the skill it takes to \n     market their product.\n       From the time I went with my great grandfather to feed his \n     cattle and sensed his love for those animals, I was hooked on \n     agriculture. Even when those animals did not cooperate, \n     grandpa still loved them. He has cared for livestock for \n     years, and he enjoys it today as he did years ago. My great \n     grandfather continues to be active in Indiana agriculture \n     today and models what agriculture is all about: hard work, \n     appreciation for livestock and plants, and good stewardship \n     of our earth.\n       In closing, I will leave you with a quote from William \n     Jennings Bryan, ``American Politician and Orator''; 1860-\n     1925, that summarizes my thoughts on Indiana agriculture. \n     ``Burn down your cities and leave our farms, and your cities \n     will spring up again by magic; but destroy our farms and the \n     grass will grow in the streets of every city in the \n     country.'' I believe agriculture was the foundation of our \n     country then and still is today.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Agriculture: Then and Now\n\n                           (By Collin Bowlin)\n\n       Slowly standing up from the seat of his Case-IH tractor in \n     which he has been sitting for the past two hours, he wears a \n     smile that turns into a grimace until the shooting pain eases \n     and his knee pops back into place. The pain in his knee is \n     the result of the many years of hard work he has put into \n     farming this land. Steadily stepping down from the tractor, \n     he points to where he stopped making the windrows of hay and \n     now I climb onto the tractor. It is my turn to take over, \n     where he left off.\n       He has made his livelihood from farming these rolling hills \n     in southern Indiana, growing crops of corn, soybeans, and \n     hay, and raising livestock which include beef cattle, swine, \n     and poultry. He is my grandfather. He has instilled in me to \n     take good care of these blessings, land and livestock. As a \n     young boy, Grandpa worked the land with a team of horses. Now \n     we have horsepower to more efficiently produce the food that \n     people rely upon every day. After his eighth grade year in \n     school, Grandpa had no choice but to end his schooling early \n     in order to help out on his family's farm. As an eighth grade \n     student today, I have many choices, and I know I will attend \n     college in the future.\n       My love for raising, showing, and judging beef cattle and \n     pigs has given me many opportunities. Agriculture will always \n     play a huge role in my life. I am proud to be one voice \n     supporting the agricultural industry which provides food, \n     fiber, and fuel to the world. The economic and environmental \n     issues facing farmers today need to be addressed by \n     knowledgeable people. So now, it is my turn to take over, \n     where Grandpa left off.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    2010-2011 District Essay Winners\n\n\n                               District 1\n\n       Gabrielle Carlson, Quinn McGovern.\n\n\n                               District 2\n\n       Katie Lopshire, William Joseph Rockey.\n\n\n                               District 3\n\n       Shelbi Perry, Dakota Burghardt.\n\n\n                               District 4\n\n       Rachel Girod, Nathan Chou.\n\n\n                               District 5\n\n       Shane Slaven, Kiersten Mundy.\n\n\n                               District 6\n\n       Katie Pfaff, Max Keller.\n\n\n                               District 7\n\n       Easton Booe, Whitney Halfhill.\n\n\n                               District 8\n\n       Josh Orschell, Alexis J.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure that \nveterans in each of the 48 contiguous States are able to receive \nservices in at least one full-service Department of Veterans Affairs \nmedical center in the State or receive comparable services provided by \ncontract in the State, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Veterans \nHealth Equity Act of 2011. This bill would require the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to ensure that every State has either a full-service \nveterans hospital or, in the alternative, that veterans in every State \nhave access to comparable in-state hospital care and medical services. \nI am pleased that my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Ayotte, has \nagreed to be an original cosponsor of this measure.\n  New Hampshire is currently the only State that does not have either a \nfull-service veterans medical center or a military hospital providing \ncomparable services to veterans. While the staff of the Manchester VA \nMedical Center does an excellent job of caring for our State's \nveterans, this facility does not provide inpatient surgical care, \nemergency services or care in a number of critical specialties. This \nimposes a great burden on many New Hampshire veterans who are forced to \ntravel out of state for a range of medical services.\n  New Hampshire has over 130,000 veterans and this number continues to \ngrow as our troops return from major deployments in the Middle East. It \nis unconscionable that our veterans must board shuttles to larger VA \nfacilities in Massachusetts or Vermont to get the medical care they \nhave been promised in exchange for their service. Often, especially \nduring the winter months, travel is difficult in New England, and our \nveterans should not be forced to drive long distances in order to \nreceive the medical care they have earned and deserve.\n  Our goal is to ensure that New Hampshire veterans get the care they \nneed as close to home as possible. This legislation provides the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs with the flexibility to achieve this end \nin the most cost-effective manner. If it is not feasible for the VA to \nconstruct a new full-service hospital in New Hampshire or to provide \nthe full panoply of hospital services at its existing medical center in \nManchester, the legislation simply requires the VA to contract with \nother health providers to offer comparable in-state care.\n  I introduced similar legislation in the 111th Congress with our \nformer colleague, Senator Judd Gregg. Since that time, the VA has \nestablished an effective contractual relationship with one hospital in \nNew Hampshire, Concord Hospital, to expand in-state care for our \nveterans. I believe this type of partnership could be readily expanded. \nI have begun working with officials at the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to\n\n[[Page S2780]]\n\nfind innovative ways to enhance public-private health care partnerships \nin New Hampshire and look forward to furthering that dialogue.\n  Our veterans deserve access to first-rate medical care, regardless of \nwhere they live. There are full-service veterans hospitals in 47 States \nand veterans in Alaska and Hawaii are able to receive care at military \nhospitals. New Hampshire alone has neither. I am hopeful that my \ncolleagues will recognize this inequity and support this effort to \nprovide New Hampshire veterans with the same access to quality local \nhealth care that veterans in every other State enjoy.\n  I look forward to working with the entire New Hampshire congressional \ndelegation, with my Senate colleagues and with the Obama administration \nto end this injustice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 910\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the Veteran's \nHealth Equity Act, a bill I am introducing with my colleague from the \nGranite State, Senator Jeanne Shaheen. I am pleased to support this \nbipartisan legislation that addresses an issue of importance to our \nNation's heroic military veterans, especially in my home State of New \nHampshire.\n  As a military spouse, I personally understand the commitment and \nsacrifice required of our service members and their families, and I am \nfully committed to ensuring that our heroes have access to the support \nand care they have earned. The bill we are introducing would level the \nplaying field for veterans by requiring the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to guarantee that veterans in every State have access to \nhospital care within their borders. As it stands now, New Hampshire is \nthe only state in the nation without a full-service VA hospital or \nmilitary hospital providing equivalent care to veterans. Specifically, \nthe Veteran's Health Equity Act would require the VA to either provide \na full-service VA hospital in every State or contract with civilian \nhospitals to provide veterans with a comparable level of care.\n  While some States, like Alaska and Hawaii, rely on large military \nmedical facilities to compensate for gaps in VA medical care, New \nHampshire lacks the military medical facilities to compensate for a \nlack of a full-service VA hospital. Yet, New Hampshire has one of the \nhighest rates of veterans per capita in the country. New Hampshire \nveterans must travel out of State to Maine, Massachusetts, or Vermont \nto access certain kinds of specialty care. Elderly veterans are often \nbused by volunteers during the treacherous winter months to an out of \nstate service provider only to have their appointment canceled. Simply \nput, the lack of a full-service VA hospital in New Hampshire is \nunacceptable and our veterans deserve better.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I will continue to press \nfor a full-service VA hospital in New Hampshire and explore all \nlegislative remedies to ensure that our New Hampshire veterans receive \nthe care they deserve. My 95 year old grandfather, John Sullivan, a \nWorld War II veteran, and veterans like him who have selflessly served \nour country, have earned high-quality medical care that is commensurate \nwith their courageous service. We must honor our commitments to \nAmerica's brave veterans. The Veteran's Health Equity Act will help \nensure every veteran in the United States can access quality medical \ncare without having to travel to another State.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 913. A bill to require the Federal Trade Commission to prescribe \nregulations regarding the collection and use of personal information \nobtained by tracking the online activity of an individual, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. ROCKFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Do-Not-Track \nOnline Act of 2011; and I ask for unanimous consent that the bill be \nprinted for the record. This bill is a first step towards furthering \nconsumer privacy by empowering Americans with the ability to control \ntheir personal information and prevent online companies from collecting \nand using that information, if they so choose.\n  Do-Not-Track is a simple concept. It allows consumers, with a simple \nclick of the mouse or the press of the button, to tell the entire \nonline world, ``Do not collect information about me. I care about my \nprivacy. And I do not want my information used in ways I do not expect \nor approve of.'' Under my bill, online companies would have to honor \nthat user declaration, and cease the information collection and use \npractices to which consumers have said, ``no.'' My bill would direct \nthe Federal Trade Commission to issue regulations that establish \nstandards for a do- not-track mechanism and obligate online companies \nto accommodate that consumer preference.\n  This bill is necessary because Americans' privacy is increasingly \nunder surveillance as they conduct their affairs online. Whether it is \na mother at home on a computer researching the symptoms of her sick \nchild, a man exploring how to change jobs or buy a home, or a teenager \nusing her smartphone while riding the subway, online companies are \ncollecting vast amounts of information about all of this activity, \noften surreptitiously and with consumers completely unaware. There are \na vast array of companies collecting this information in numerous ways: \nthird-party advertising networks place ``cookies'' on computer web-\nbrowsers to keep track of the websites consumers have visited; analytic \nand marketing companies identify individual computers by recognizing \nthe unique configuration, or ``fingerprint,'' of web-browsers; and \nsoftware applications installed on mobile devices, colloquially known \nas ``apps'', that collect, use, and disseminate information about \nconsumer location, contact information, and other personal matters. All \nof this information is being stored on computer servers around the \nworld and is used for a variety of purposes, ranging\n\n[[Page S2781]]\n\nfrom online behavioral advertising to internal analytics to the \ncreation of personal dossiers by data brokers who build comprehensive \nprofiles on individual Americans.\n  My bill will empower consumers, if they so choose, to stem the tide. \nIt gives them the means to prohibit the collection of their information \nfrom the start. Consumers will be able to notify companies who are \ncollecting their personal information that they want those collection \npractices to stop. If online companies fail to obey this request, they \nwill face stiff penalties from the Federal Trade Commission or state \nAttorneys General.\n  The strength of this bill is its simplicity. Congress has long \ngrappled with consumer privacy through the lens of ``notice and \nconsent.'' That is, for over a decade in the Senate Commerce Committee, \nwhich I chair, we have tried to determine how online companies can \nprovide clear and conspicuous notice to consumers about their \ncommercial information practices; and once this notice has been given, \nfurther determine how consumers can either opt-in or opt-out of those \ninformation collection practices.\n\n  The endeavor has proven complicated and often unworkable: privacy \npolicies are often long and tedious, replete with technical legalese. \nThese notices don't work well on a full screen computer, much less on a \nsmall hand-held mobile device, and consumers often ignore them. \nFurther, consumer consent has been dependent on the type of information \nthat is being collected and who is doing the collection. For instance, \nshould a third-party advertising network be subject to the same \nrestrictions as the Washington Post website that hosts the ad network? \nShould Apple be allowed to collect information about a person's iPhone, \nbut an application be prohibited? Should companies differentiate \nbetween particularly sensitive information--such as health or political \nactivities--and more innocuous information such as which sports teams \nsomeone may like?\n  My Do-Not-Track bill avoids all of these messy policy considerations \nand provides consumers with the opportunity to take advantage of an \neasy mechanism that says ``no'' to anyone and everyone collecting their \ninformation. Period.\n  I think it is worth noting that the FTC has recognized the utility of \ndo-not-track in its December 2010 report on consumer privacy. The \nreport states: ``Such a mechanism would ensure that consumers would not \nhave to exercise choices on a company-by-company or industry-by-\nindustry basis, and that such choices would be persistent. It should \nalso address some of the concerns with the existing browser mechanisms, \nby being more clear, easy-to-locate, and effective, and by conveying \ndirectly to websites the user's choice to opt out of tracking.'' \nIndeed, the private sector has similarly recognized the utility of do-\nnot-track. Mozilla's popular web browser, Firefox, and Apple's web \nbrowser, Safari, already allow consumers to affirmatively declare a do-\nnot-track preference to websites. The problem is that online companies \nhave no legal obligation to honor this request. My bill fixes that.\n  Let me say a few words about what this bill does not do. My bill \nwould not ``break the Internet.'' I am sure that we will hear such \nhyperbole in opposition to the bill. The truth is that my bill makes \nall of the necessary accommodations for online companies to use \ninformation as is necessary to allow companies to provide the content \nand services consumers have grown to expect and enjoy. For instance, \nwebsites will still be able to use IP addresses to deliver content, and \nwill be allowed to collect data to perform internal analytics and \nimprove performance. Applications will still be able to use a phone's \nUnique Device Identifier--also known as UDID--to perform their \nfunctions as they are supposed to. However, when consumers state that \nthey do not want to be tracked, online services will no longer be \nallowed to collect and use this information for any extraneous purpose, \nand they will be obligated to immediately destroy or anonymize the \ninformation once it is no longer needed to provide the service \nrequested. Furthermore, my bill allows online companies to collect and \nmaintain consumer information when it has been voluntarily provided by \nthe consumer. Consumers also can allow companies they trust to collect \nand use their information by providing specific consent that overrides \na general do-not-track preference.\n  As such, my bill empowers consumers to stop online companies from \ncollecting and using their information, but also preserves the ability \nof those online companies to conduct their business and deliver the \ncontent and services that consumers expect. The bill provides the FTC \nwith rulemaking authority to use its expertise to protect the privacy \ninterests of consumers while addressing the legitimate needs of \nindustry.\n  To be clear, my bill is not a comprehensive consumer privacy bill, \nnor is it meant to be. Do-not-track is just one aspect to consumer \nprivacy albeit an important one. Other Members of the Commerce \nCommittee are actively engaged in protecting consumer privacy \ninterests. I want to commend Senator Kerry, who is a senior Member of \nthe Commerce Committee, and Senator McCain for their efforts and for \nintroducing legislation designed to establish a broad privacy \nframework. I also commend Senator Pryor's dedication to privacy \nprotection and the vigorous oversight of his Subcommittee. I expect \nconsumer privacy to remain a focus of the Congress and the Members of \nthe Commerce Committee with more legislation being introduced in the \ncoming weeks and months.\n  In the end, my Do-Not-Track bill is a part of the ongoing discussion \non consumer privacy in Congress. It is simple, yet powerful. It allows \nconsumers, if they choose--and I should emphasize that many will not \nmake such a choice--to stop the constant, almost mind-boggling sweep of \nonline companies that are collecting vast amounts of consumer \ninformation. It prohibits those lurking in the cyber-shadows from \nsurreptitiously profiting off of the personal, private information of \nordinary Americans. I look forward to working with my colleagues on \nthis and other privacy legislative efforts in the Commerce Committee \nand on the Senate floor.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 913\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nthe waiver of the collection of copayments for telehealth and \ntelemedicine visits of veterans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \namend title 38, related to this Nation's obligation to provide benefits \nto our veterans. Specifically, the bill I introduce today with my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Grassley of Iowa and Senator Tester \nof Montana, will waive collection of copayments for telehealth and \ntelemedicine visits for Veterans.\n  More than 42,000 veterans are receiving care in their homes, enrolled \nin the Veterans Health Administration's, VHA, Telemedicine program as \none form of treatment. In Alaska, as of March 2010, there were 226 \nveterans receiving this service. Just over a 100 of those live in rural \nAlaska.\n  Home Telehealth programs provide needed care for the 2-3 percent of \nveterans who account for 30 percent or more of agency resources. These \nmen and women are frequent clinic attendees and often require urgent \nhospital admissions. VHA programs have demonstrated reduced hospital \nadmissions and clinic and emergency room\n\n[[Page S2783]]\n\nvisits, and contribute to an improved quality of life for our veterans.\n  For no group of veterans is this service more important than for \nthose who live in rural and remote America. Telemedicine has become an \nincreasingly integral component in addressing the needs of veterans \nresiding in rural and remote areas, and is critical to ensuring they \nhave proper access to health care, especially in rural areas.\n  While the VHA is saving taxpayers money by usingtelemedicine, \ncurrently all telemedicine visits require veterans receiving these \ntreatments to make copayments. My legislation would implement a simple \nfix. It would waive the required copayments--sometimes up to $50 per \nvisit--to lessen the burden on our veterans, who have sacrificed in \nservice to our great nation. I believe that waiving these fees may \nencourage more veterans to take advantage of VHA's telehealth programs, \nwhich can be a godsend for rural veterans with few other viable \noptions.\n  For rural veterans in Alaska, who have to travel by small float \nplanes or boats or even snow machines to get to the nearest clinic for \nmonitoring of their diabetes, high blood pressure, or other chronic \nconditions, Congress can go a long way in repaying this Nation's debt \nto our veterans by passing this legislation.\n  The VHA plans to expand Home Telehealth for weight management, \nsubstance abuse, mild traumatic brain injury, dementia, and palliative \ncare, as well as enabling veterans to use mobile devices to access \ncare. I would hate to see these vital services go unused by veterans \nliving in remote villages and communities because of the cost of \ncopayments. But, this is not primarily about saving veterans money. \nThis is about the federal government doing what is good for our \nveterans. The monetary benefits for veterans are a plus.\n  Basically, this legislation will amend title 38 to authorize the \nwaiver of the collection of copayments for telehealth and telemedicine \nvisits of veterans by giving the Secretary the authority to do so.\n  In closing, I must say it is an honor for me to serve as a member of \nthe Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. I feel very privileged to be \ninvolved with policy formation that helps our veterans. I appreciate my \ndistinguished colleagues on the committee.\n  This is a bipartisan bill to address an issue with no partisan \nconnection. I strongly encourage my colleagues to join Senators \nGrassley, Tester, and me in cosponsoring this legislation, and I urge \nexpeditious consideration of the legislation to address a growing need \nfor our rural veterans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 916. A bill to facilitate appropriate oil and gas development on \nFederal land and waters, to limit dependence of the United States on \nforeign sources of oil and gas, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Oil and Gas \nFacilitation Act of 2011. This is a bill to facilitate appropriate oil \nand gas development on Federal land and waters, and to limit the \ndependence of the United States on foreign sources of energy.\n  For example, its provisions will increase our understanding of our \noil and gas resources, coordinate interagency activity on permitting \nfor oil and gas development, and facilitate transportation of Alaskan \noil and natural gas.\n  Its provisions are drawn from a bill reported out of the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources on a bipartisan basis in the last \nCongress. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle as we move forward on these issues in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 916\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \nreform the management of energy and mineral resources on the Outer \nContinental Shelf, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Outer \nContinental Shelf Reform Act of 2011. This is a bill intended to reform \nthe management of energy resources on the Outer Continental Shelf, and \nto create a culture of excellence for the industry and the regulatory \nagency going forward.\n  Following the tragic Deepwater Horizon oil rig accident last year, we \nhave learned a lot about changes that need to be made by the industry \nand the regulatory agency to ensure that accidents like this never \nhappen again. In addition, we should do more, and create a system for \nthe management of offshore energy development that is a model for the \nworld.\n  This bill is intended to put in place the changes that can achieve \nthese goals. It is identical to a bill reported unanimously by the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources in the last Congress. In the \nintervening time since the committee's action, there have been \ndevelopments and new information that may indicate the need to update \nor change some parts of the bill. But, as we begin to work on this \nissue again in the committee, I believe that it is sensible to start \nwith last year's bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to address these important issues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 917\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize grant programs to ensure successful, \nsafe, and healthy students; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, one of our greatest national priorities is \nensuring that all students in all schools are in settings that are \nsafe; classrooms that support learning; situations that ensure our \nchildren will be successful.\n  To be a successful student, to be a contributing citizen to our \ndemocracy, to be prepared for college and the workforce of tomorrow, \nour students need to be of sound mind, of sound body, and have access \nto resources that will support their success.\n  Students who travel to school safely; who attend classes in \nstructurally sound buildings where the adults model positive teamwork \nand collaboration skills; where good nutrition is available and where \nopportunities for physical activity are available and expected; where \nthey have a safe, supportive social environment, students who have all \nof these conditions in their schools will be prepared to achieve high \nacademic standards.\n  In a country where almost one in every five children is obese, where \nthousands of students are bullied and harassed daily, and where access \nto high-quality mental and physical health care is limited, students \nmust have these basic conditions for learning in order to be \nsuccessful.\n  While the Department of Justice reports that the rate of serious \nincidents of school violence continue to decline, according to the \nNational Center for Education Statistics, bullying remains a pervasive \nproblem that affects almost one in four students each year. As\n\n[[Page S2794]]\n\nwe have seen in recent times, sometimes bullying results in the worst \npossible tragedy, the death of a child.\n  Fifteen-year-old Phoebe Prince, a freshman at South Hadley High \nSchool in Massachusetts, endured nearly three months of routine torment \nby classmates. On January 14, 2010, Phoebe hanged herself in the \nstairwell of her family's home, following weeks of taunting by \nclassmates. The day before she died, she told a friend: ``School has \nbeen close to intolerable lately.'' In California, thirteen-year-old \nSeth Walsh committed suicide this past October because of the bullying \nhe experienced in his school. We need to have the expectations in all \nof our schools that all students will be valued and all students will \nhave a safe haven to learn and achieve. In New York City, middle \nschooler Gurwinder Singh was targeted by bullies who bashed his head \ninto a metal pole while bystanders watched, because of his Sikh \nreligion. Luckily, Gurwinder survived, and has become an outspoken \nproponent of bullying prevention. We cannot stand idly by when school \nbecomes a hostile place for kids.\n  Thus, today, I am introducing the Successful, Safe and Healthy \nStudents Act. This legislation will advance student achievement and \npromote the positive physical, mental, and emotional health of students \nthroughout the nation. It will help to reduce violence in schools, \nprevent bullying and harassment, help students make responsible choices \nabout drugs, tobacco, and alcohol, and create the type of school \nenvironments where students can do their best work and achieve the \nhighest possible academic outcomes, while also becoming healthy, happy \nand productive members of their communities.\n  Essential conditions for learning include schools that provide for \nadequate physical activity, positive mental health, and safe \nenvironments. Those conditions include physical and emotional safety \nfor both students and school personnel and promote positive character \ndevelopment in our youth. Schools with the essential conditions for \nlearning also provide for opportunities for good nutrition and healthy \nliving, and are free of violence, harassment, bullying and other forms \nof interpersonal aggression. Schools that have the right conditions for \nlearning are free of weapons and prevent the use and abuse of drugs and \nalcohol. And schools with good conditions for learning have positive \nadult role models with high expectations for students' development, \nconduct, and academic achievement.\n  For those who might be skeptical about these critical conditions for \nlearning, we only need to look to the States and their efforts to \nimprove school performance and accountability. Many States are moving \nbeyond the limited measures of school performance required by No Child \nLeft Behind and have started to collect data on school-wide factors \nthat are associated with student success. Some of these areas include \nschool climate, physical activity of students, and physical and \nemotional safety. In fact, a March 2011 report from the RAND \nCorporation indicated that many States are now establishing \naccountability systems that include school safety, school climate, \nfamily involvement, and student engagement.\n  This legislation will provide to each State the support necessary to \nmeasure the conditions for learning in each school in each school in \nthe State. Resources will also be available to offer grants to school \ndistricts to establish policies and activities to improve the \nconditions for learning in each of their schools. This legislation \ngives State and local school districts the resources and opportunities \nto create safe, healthy schools that will enhance the academic \nachievement of students.\n  This legislation is an essential tool for our States and local \nschools to support students who are prepared for college, a career, and \nto be world-class citizens.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 919\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Successful, Safe, and \n     Healthy Students Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 173\n\n       Whereas a decline in physical activity has contributed to \n     the unprecedented epidemic of childhood obesity, which has \n     more than tripled in the United States since 1980;\n\n[[Page S2798]]\n\n       Whereas regular physical activity is necessary to support \n     normal and healthy growth in children and is essential to the \n     continued health and well-being of children;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control, \n     overweight adolescents have a 70 to 80 percent chance of \n     becoming overweight adults, increasing their risk for chronic \n     disease, disability, and death;\n       Whereas physical activity reduces the risk of heart \n     disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and certain types of \n     cancers;\n       Whereas type 2 diabetes can no longer be referred to as \n     ``late in life'' or ``adult onset'' diabetes because type 2 \n     diabetes presently occurs in children as young as 10 years \n     old;\n       Whereas the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans \n     issued by the Department of Health and Human Services \n     recommend that children engage in at least 60 minutes of \n     physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of the \n     week;\n       Whereas according to the Centers for Disease Control, only \n     19 percent of high school students are meeting the goal of 60 \n     minutes of physical activity each day;\n       Whereas children spend many of their waking hours at school \n     and, as a result, need to be active during the school day to \n     meet the recommendations of the Physical Activity Guidelines \n     for Americans;\n       Whereas nationally, according to the Centers for Disease \n     Control, 1 out of 4 children does not attend any school \n     physical education classes, and fewer than 1 in 4 children \n     get 20 minutes of vigorous activity every day;\n       Whereas teaching children about physical education and \n     sports not only ensures that the children are physically \n     active during the school day, but also educates the children \n     on how to be physically active and the importance of physical \n     activity;\n       Whereas according to a 2006 survey by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, 3.8 percent of elementary schools, \n     7.9 percent of middle schools, and 2.1 percent of high \n     schools provide daily physical education (or an equivalent) \n     for the entire school year, and 22 percent of schools do not \n     require students to take any physical education courses at \n     all;\n       Whereas according to that 2006 survey, 13.7 percent of \n     elementary schools, 15.2 percent of middle schools, and 3.0 \n     percent of high schools provide physical education (or an \n     equivalent) at least 3 days per week for the entire school \n     year for students in all grades in the school;\n       Whereas research shows that fit and active children are \n     more likely to thrive academically;\n       Whereas increased time in physical education classes can \n     help the attention, concentration, and achievement test \n     scores of children;\n       Whereas participation in sports teams and physical activity \n     clubs, often organized by the school and run outside of the \n     regular school day, can improve grade point average, school \n     attachment, educational aspirations, and the likelihood of \n     graduation;\n       Whereas participation in sports and physical activity \n     improves self-esteem and body image in children and adults;\n       Whereas children and youths who partake in physical \n     activity and sports programs have increased motor skills, \n     healthy lifestyles, social skills, a sense of fair play, \n     strong teamwork skills, self-discipline, and avoidance of \n     risky behaviors;\n       Whereas the social and environmental factors affecting \n     children are in the control of the adults and the communities \n     in which the children live, and therefore, the people of the \n     United States share a collective responsibility in reversing \n     the childhood obesity epidemic;\n       Whereas if efforts are made to intervene with unfit \n     children to bring those children to physically fit levels, \n     then there may also be a concomitant rise in the academic \n     performance of those children; and\n       Whereas Congress strongly supports efforts to increase \n     physical activity and participation of children and youth in \n     sports: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of May 1 through May 7, 2011, as \n     ``National Physical Education and Sport Week'';\n       (2) recognizes National Physical Education and Sport Week \n     and the central role of physical education and sports in \n     creating a healthy lifestyle for all children and youth;\n       (3) supports the implementation of local school wellness \n     policies (as that term is described in section 9A of the \n     Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1758b)) that include ambitious goals for physical education, \n     physical activity, and other activities that address the \n     childhood obesity epidemic and promote child wellness; and\n       (4) encourages schools to offer physical education classes \n     to students and work with community partners to provide \n     opportunities and safe spaces for physical activities before \n     and after school and during the summer months for all \n     children and youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/09/senate-section/article/S2798-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2798-S2799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 174--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT \n EFFECTIVE SHARING OF PASSENGER INFORMATION FROM INBOUND INTERNATIONAL \n FLIGHT MANIFESTS IS A CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND \nTHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY MUST MAINTAIN THE INFORMATION \n    SHARING STANDARDS REQUIRED UNDER THE 2007 PASSENGER NAME RECORD \n       AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Ms. Collins) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs:\n\n                              S. Res. 174\n\n       Whereas the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon \n     the United States--\n       (1) found that ``[t]argeting travel is at least as powerful \n     a weapon against terrorists as targeting their money''; and\n       (2) recommended that the United States ``combine terrorist \n     travel intelligence, operations, and law enforcement in a \n     strategy to intercept terrorist, find terrorist travel \n     facilitators, and constrain terrorist mobility'';\n       Whereas terrorists continue to target international travel \n     to the United States, as evidenced by Umar Farouk \n     Abdulmutallab's attempt to detonate a bomb on board Northwest \n     Airlines Flight 253 on December 25, 2009, en route from \n     Amsterdam to Detroit;\n       Whereas Congress responded to the attacks of September 11, \n     2001, by mandating that all air carriers flying into the \n     United States provide passenger name record (referred to in \n     this resolution as ``PNR'') data concerning all inbound \n     passengers to U.S. Customs and Border Protection to assist \n     the Department of Homeland Security in fulfilling its \n     missions of protecting the border and enhancing border \n     security;\n       Whereas there is bipartisan agreement on the need to \n     collect and share passenger travel data, which--\n       (1) has served as a cornerstone for interdicting terrorists \n     by the administrations of President Barack Obama and former \n     President George W. Bush; and\n       (2) continues to fulfill the mandate for increased \n     information sharing set by Congress in--\n       (A) the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (Public \n     Law 107-71);\n       (B) the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of \n     2004 (Public Law 108-458);\n       (C) the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission \n     Act of 2007 (Public Law 110-53); and\n       (D) other laws requiring information sharing \n     internationally and within the United States Government to \n     promote greater security;\n       Whereas the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 \n     Commission Act of 2007 required nations to enter into an \n     agreement to exchange passenger information with the United \n     States in order to qualify for the United States' visa waiver \n     program;\n       Whereas international law and treaties have recognized \n     that--\n       (1) advance information about travelers is a critical tool \n     in identifying high-risk passengers; and\n       (2) the intelligence gained from the analysis of passenger \n     travel data is critical for--\n       (A) protecting the United States against terrorists \n     entering the United States; and\n       (B) preventing terrorists from boarding international \n     flights bound for the United States;\n       Whereas the Agreement Between the United States of America \n     and the European Union on the Processing and Transfer of \n     Passenger Name Record (PNR) Data by Air Carriers to the \n     United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS), done at \n     Brussels and Washington on July 23 and 26, 2007 (referred to \n     in this resolution as the ``EU-U.S. PNR Agreement'')--\n       (1) succeeded a series of agreements between 2002 and \n     October 2006;\n       (2) was intended to remain in effect until 2014; and\n       (3) complied with European Union and United States privacy \n     laws by providing assurances that the United States would use \n     PNR data for limited purposes;\n       Whereas PNR data gathered pursuant to the EU-U.S. PNR \n     Agreement has been used to identify and arrest a number of \n     dangerous terrorists, including--\n       (1) David Headley, who was planning an attack on Denmark \n     and who contributed to the tragedy in Mumbai; and\n       (2) Faisal Shahzad, who was attempting to flee the country \n     after attempting to set off a car-bomb in Times Square.\n       Whereas PNR data has been used to prevent the travel of \n     many other individuals considered to be national security \n     threats or otherwise inadmissible to the United States;\n       Whereas the privacy protections in the current EU-U.S. PNR \n     Agreement are robust, and a February 2010 joint review by \n     both signatories found no privacy violations, misuse, or \n     injury from the collection of PNR data by the Department of \n     Homeland Security;\n       Whereas although the United States and the European Union \n     have different governing mechanisms that lead to differences \n     in how oversight is conducted, both governments have a firm \n     commitment to the protection of data and the respect of \n     individual privacy;\n       Whereas in February 2011, the European Commission proposed \n     that the European Union create its own PNR system in order to \n     identify potential terrorists and other dangerous criminals;\n       Whereas in 2010, the Washington Post--\n       (1) recognized the important role that PNR data plays in \n     securing international aviation; and\n\n[[Page S2799]]\n\n       (2) recommended that data sharing should not be restricted \n     without demonstrating specific problems with the operation of \n     current agreement: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the grave threat posed by terrorists and \n     other dangerous criminals who seek to exploit international \n     aviation to do harm to our countries;\n       (2) urges the Department of Homeland Security to reject any \n     efforts by the European Union to modify existing PNR data \n     sharing mechanisms in a way that would degrade the usefulness \n     of the PNR data for identifying terrorists and other \n     dangerous criminals;\n       (3) urges the Department of Homeland Security to not enter \n     into any agreement that would impose European oversight \n     structures on the United States; and\n       (4) opposes any effort by the European Union to interfere \n     with counterterrorism cooperation and information sharing \n     between the Department of Homeland Security and non-European \n     countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/09/senate-section/article/S2799-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 319.

Mr. President, I rise on a point of personal privilege \nto commend a gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Keith Hatcher.\n  Twenty-five years ago, when I worked with my father--my father, among \nother things, was the past president of the Georgia Association of \nREALTORS. I remember one afternoon he came into my office and said: \nSon, we just hired someone today who is going to be special. His name \nis Keith Hatcher. I want you to be sure and look him up the first time \nyou get a chance.\n  Well, about a week later I met Keith. I was then a member of the \nGeorgia Legislature, and I showed him around a little bit. He became \nthe assistant to John Cox, who had been the venerable representative of \nthe REALTORS for years in that State. I saw that spark in Keith \nHatcher's eye, and I knew he was going to be a great one, and a great \none he has been.\n  In his 25 years representing the Georgia association and landowners \nand homeowners around our State, he has fought hard for limitations and \ncurbs on the power of eminent domain, fought hard for lower ad valorem \ntaxes and transfer taxes, and fought hard for reform of landlord-tenant \nlaws. He has worked day in and day out for the landowners of our State \nand for the REALTORS of our State, and he has done it in the most \nprofessional, comprehensive way anybody could possibly do it.\n  He has another great story to tell. Keith faced a significant health \nhazard just a few years ago. He was about to lose a kidney, and he \ncould have lost his life, but he went through a transplant program in \nBirmingham, AL. The transplant was successful, and he rehabilitated \nhimself. Today, he works as hard as he did before the injury. \nImportantly, as well, he works as a member of the board of the National \nKidney Foundation helping to raise money to support the transplant \nprogram so others who are afflicted as he was will have the same cure \nhe has had.\n  So this week, as the REALTORS from Georgia come to town, as I think \nthey will from every other State of the Union, to talk to the Members \nof the Senate about laws that affect their industry and their \nprofession, the one from Georgia will be led by Keith Hatcher. As he \nhas for the last 24 years, he will be a voice for home ownership, a \nvoice for lower taxation, and a voice for wide distribution and \nownership of land, which makes the United States of America the most \nunique country of any on the face of this Earth.\n  I am pleased to commend him today on the celebration of his 25th \nanniversary representing the Georgia Association of REALTORS.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/09/senate-section/article/S2800-3", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2800-S2801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PROFIT OVER HEALTH\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, yesterday across this country, we \ncelebrated Mother's Day, marking the contribution of mothers across our \ncountry. But 2 months ago, the health of tens of thousands of expectant \nmothers and their unborn children was threatened by a drug company \nputting profit over public health. Two months ago, there was justified \npublic outrage that the cost of a drug hormone, progesterone, to \nprevent premature births went from approximately $10 a dose--20 doses \nare needed through the course of a pregnancy--to $1,500 per dose. The \nentire course of the 20-week treatment, therefore, was about $200 three \nmonths ago. Two months ago, it went to $30,000--$200 to $30,000.\n  This was once an affordable, common treatment to help women facing \nhigh-risk labor. I visited Toledo Children's Hospital, MetroHealth in \nCleveland, and St. Elizabeth's Health Center in Youngstown to hear \ndirectly from patients and physicians and hospital executives about how \nthe outrageous price increase affects them. Patients explained what it \nwas like to overcome a previous miscarriage and rely on this \nprogesterone to carry to full term today. Physicians and public health \nadvocates explained the risk to women and children's health if the \ntherapy were no longer affordable and accessible. Hospital \nadministrators and State Medicaid directors worried what such an \nexorbitant increase would mean to already-stretched budgets.\n  Meanwhile, several colleagues and I began to ask questions about how \nand why the increase happened in the first place. We are concerned \nabout how companies, private companies, abuse the FDA approval process \nor manipulate existing rules to shortchange consumers while those \ncompanies reap massive windfall profits. That is especially so because, \nin addition to affixing such a high cost to the drug, this company, KV \nPharmaceuticals from St. Louis, sent a letter threatening a cease and \ndesist order to compounding pharmacies--those pharmacies that actually \nmake their own progesterone, in this case--a cease and desist order to \nprevent these pharmacies from producing it, further solidifying KV \nPharmaceutical's monopolization in the marketplace. All the while, \npregnant women are left without the critical medicine their doctors \nprescribe for them, and either taxpayers foot the bill, insurance \ncompanies foot the bill, driving the price up, or women simply do \nwithout, increasing the number of miscarriages, increasing the number \nof low-birth-weight babies, increasing the cost to taxpayers, and \nincreasing the heartache in mother after mother and father after \nfather.\n  Fortunately, in an unusual response--unusual in the sense that this \ncase was so dramatically outrageous and unbelievably greedy on the part \nof KV Pharmaceutical executives--the FDA did something it doesn't \nnormally do: It asserted its authority and made clear it would not \nenforce the cease and desist order. What was KV's response after the \npublic outrage, after the refusal to enforce the cease and desist \norder, therefore allowing the pharmacies to keep producing the \nprogesterone? It reduced the price from $1,500 a dose--remember, it was \n$10 per dose as recently as 3 months ago. They take a shot every week \nfor 20 weeks during the pregnancy. It was $10 a dose, and they raised \nit to $1,500. But do you know what they did after the FDA and a small \nnumber of Democratic Senator's pushed them, embarrassed them in public? \nThey brought the price down to $690 a dose. It went from $10 when \ncompounding pharmacies were doing it, to $1,500 when they thought they \ncould get away with it, to $690--as if they thought they were doing \nAmerica's women a favor. That means instead of it being $30,000 for the \nwhole cost of the pharmaceutical, the 20 doses, it would be about \n$15,000. What a bargain. On top of that, they did what companies whose \nhands are caught in the cookie jar always do: They hired high-powered \nWashington, DC, lobbyists to fight for their rights, this exclusivity \nfor this drug, trying to prohibit the critical work of compounding \npharmacists.\n  I agree with drug companies; generally they need to recoup their \ninvestment. I want America's drug companies to do the boldest, most \ninnovative, most progressive research in the world, and I want them to \nmake a profit doing it so they can afford to do it and keep doing it. \nThey should reflect the amount of R to bring drugs to market, the \ncost of their manufacture, the cost of their distribution, but in the \ncase of this progesterone, the case of this pharmacy compound, \ntaxpayers--in this case, through the National Institutes of Health--\nfunded the initial research and continue to fund critical research on \npremature births. KV Pharmaceutical didn't do the research; they bought \nthe exclusive rights to a monopoly by reimbursing another company--\ncontracting with them--I believe that actually conducted the clinical \ntrials and incurring the costs needed for FDA approval.\n\n[[Page S2801]]\n\n  Something is very wrong when a company with limited R investments \ncan grossly overprice a drug that in its absence virtually guarantees \nan increase in premature births.\n  Think of the greed involved here. They paid some number of millions \nof dollars to do a clinical trial, which was a good thing. They then \nbrought the price from $10 to $1,500--times 20, again, with the number \nof doses people need in their treatment. With an initial investment of \nless than $200 million, the first year they would have reaped over $3 \nbillion in revenue. Those are the kinds of numbers they were operating \non, as if that is fair.\n  When a company used taxpayer-funded research to produce a drug so \nimportant that it reduces infant mortality and birth defects, that \ncompany should also take on the responsibility for pricing it in a \nreasonable manner. But prices should never be inflated, particularly on \na public health drug where this company did not do the basic \nfoundational research; all it did was pay for clinical trials that did \nnot prove much more than we already knew. A company should never be \nallowed to inflate prices of a public health drug to reap these kinds \nof massive profits, nor should the FDA approval process ever be \nmanipulated to achieve that same end, which it was.\n  While balancing the benefits of corporate profit--and I understand \nthe balance, and I want the companies to continue to invest and move \nahead--while it can be challenging balancing corporate earnings and \nsocietal benefits, we can't lose sight of our responsibility to make \ninnovative medicines available and accessible to as many people as \npossible.\n  I would like to close with a story about why all this matters. Not \ntoo long ago--last month, I guess it was, early April--I was in Port \nColumbus International Airport about to fly to Washington when Karen \nTurano, whom I never met before, walked up to me to share her story. \nShe has since e-mailed after our discussion where she talked about this \ndrug, and she sent me this letter:\n\n       I met you at the Columbus airport with my husband Thad and \n     our 17-month-old son Ryker. Again, I just wanted to say thank \n     you for the work you are doing to make the progesterone shots \n     affordable again.\n       Our first son, Tyler, was born August 18, 2008 and passed \n     away the next day, August 19, 2008. I prematurely went into \n     labor at 24 weeks and had an emergency C-section. Tyler was \n     born at 9:59, weighing 1 pound 10 ounces.\n       Thad went to be with [my son] since I was recovering from \n     surgery. He called me early the next morning and told me the \n     worst news a new mother could hear: There was nothing more \n     that could be done and that Tyler would pass away. My mother-\n     in-law took me to see and hold Tyler for the first and last \n     time in his precious life. It was devastating.\n       Thad and I have since worked with public health advocates \n     to raise awareness on ways to prevent premature births--while \n     following doctor's orders to wait 6 months before we tried \n     again.\n       After I became pregnant with Ryker, I was monitored closely \n     and started the progesterone shots at 16 weeks which \n     continued through 36 weeks.\n\n  She had these shots through 20 consecutive treatments, once a week \nfor 20 weeks.\n\n       I am convinced that these shots allowed me to carry the \n     pregnancy to term.\n\n  Interrupting the letter for a moment, understand that when a doctor \nsees someone like Karen who has had a pregnancy like she had where a \nbaby was born that prematurely, that doctor understands that a \nprogesterone like this progesterone we are talking about can make a \nhuge difference in her carrying her baby to full term.\n\n       Ryker was born at 38 weeks on October 30, 2009, my \n     Halloween baby. My husband is a Columbus firefighter and I am \n     an attorney practicing in workers' compensation. We look \n     forward to more children in the near future, but the cost of \n     this shot concerns us greatly. We have experienced the \n     horrible pain of losing a child. No mother or father should \n     have to go through this pain.\n\n  She writes, signed:\n\n       Sincerely, Karen, Thad, Ryker and Tyler Turano.\n\n  Today is Karen's birthday, coincidentally. She celebrates with her \nson Ryker and husband Thad and other family and friends--and she does \nwith Tyler in her memory. I thank Karen for sharing her story and the \npatients in Toledo, Cleveland, Youngstown, and across our Nation and \nState who have spoken about this, who deserve the affordable and \naccessible treatment they need. I am optimistic we can continue to find \nways to ensure that the majority of women in this country will still \nhave access to affordable versions of this critical lifesaving \ninjection. It should not take public outrage, it should not take \ncongressional action, it should not take the FDA altering a policy it \nnormally doesn't alter for a company to do the right thing.\n  Mr. President, as you know, with the unemployment in your State and \nthe unemployment in my State and the problems we have as a nation on so \nmany levels, this is particularly outrageous because this progesterone \nis a public health pharmacy compound that has worked and meant many \nmore women will have safe births with growing, healthy children, \ncontrasted with, if they do not have the opportunity to get this \nprogesterone at a reasonable rate, at a reasonable price, we know what \nhappens then. But rest assured, we will keep up the outrage, and we \nwill continue to move through Congress, if that is what it takes, to \nget progesterone at an affordable price to America's women.\n  It is an outrage what KV Pharmaceuticals did. I applaud the FDA for \nchanging its policy to make it more accessible.\n  I ask KV Pharmaceuticals to again come to the table. Instead of \nlobbying Congress to get their way and make a huge amount of money on a \nrelatively small investment, I ask them to come to the table and work \nwith us so we can make this very important pharmacy compound accessible \nto all American women whose doctors prescribe it to them.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/05/09/senate-section/article/S2801-1", "month": "05", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
