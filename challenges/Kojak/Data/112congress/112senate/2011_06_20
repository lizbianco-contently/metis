Mr. President, this Congress convened in January with a \nsingle mandate from the American people: create jobs. So Democrats have \nbrought to the Senate floor bill after bill aimed at helping American \nbusinesses innovate, grow, and hire. These were good pieces of \nlegislation with proven track records of creating jobs.\n  Take the latest, the Economic Development Administration \nreauthorization. Since 1965 the EDA has created jobs in economically \ndistressed communities all over America, creating good jobs in places \nthat need them, such as Nevada, California, Florida, and many others. \nThis should be a goal on which we can all agree.\n  In the last 5 years, the Economic Development Administration has \ncreated 314,000 jobs and has done it efficiently too. For every dollar \nthe Federal Government invests, private industry invests $7.\n  For 45 years the EDA has worked with businesses and universities at \nthe local level to create jobs from the ground up. Even when \nRepublicans controlled the White House, even when they controlled \nCongress, even when they controlled both, EDA was there helping \nbusinesses grow.\n  Today, our economy needs jobs more than ever. Yet Republicans have \nfound new ways to kill a piece of legislation that would put Americans \nback to work. They have stood on the Senate floor and talked with \nstraight faces about job creation and then turned around and bogged \ndown good job-creating legislation with amendments that would kill even \nthe most bipartisan bill. Meanwhile, unemployed Americans wait and \nwait.\n  They wait while Republicans filibuster, not with words but with \namendments. A bill that has created 314,000 jobs in the last 5 years, \nthey filibustered. One would think these must be important amendments \nif Republicans are willing to make Americans who are standing in the \nemployment line wait longer and longer. But you be the judge.\n  Our Republican friends are holding up a proven job creator to exempt \nthe sand dune lizard from the Endangered Species Act. Lest the lizard \nbe singled out, there is an amendment to exempt the lesser prairie \nchicken.\n  This sends the message that such frivolous amendments, more than 90 \nof\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\nthem, are more important than putting people back to work.\n  Here are some of the amendments they have filed: EPA water quality \nstandards, lightbulbs, right-to-work laws, the estate tax, repeal of \nWall Street reform, the United States-Mexico border fence. Yet, again, \na handful of these amendments would delay or repeal health care reform. \nNone of them are germane to the legislation before us.\n  My staff looked through all of these, and they found one arguably is \ngermane, and that one is an amendment offered by Senator Inhofe which \nthe chairman of the committee, Barbara Boxer, agrees to. Again, they \nhave amendments that would delay or repeal health care reform. It is a \nbattle Republicans seem determined to fight over and over, no matter \nhow many times they lose.\n  We have already voted on bank card swipe fees and ethanol subsidies, \nand we voted on the regulatory reform amendment offered once again by \nthe senior Senator from Maine. Yet we could not reach agreement to \nconsider this worthy bill.\n  This is not the first time Republicans have stopped the important \nwork of job creation in its tracks. The small business innovation \nresearch bill died on the Senate floor because of amendments, none of \nwhich related to that bill. The Federal Aviation Administration \nreauthorization and patent reform bills, which would have put about a \nhalf million people to work, languish in the House. They are over there \nnow someplace. Yet, still, unemployed Americans wait on this bill we \nare going to vote cloture on tomorrow--or try to.\n  The amendments are really hard to comprehend: the Consumer Financial \nProtection Agency, to do away with that; they repeal Dodd-Frank Wall \nStreet reform, the Commission to Approve Oversight and Eliminate \nWasteful Spending, debt instrument transparency, amend the NLRA with \nrespect to States that have the right-to-work laws, national right to \nwork, gainful employment regulation, termination of global climate \nchange, permanently repeal the estate tax, substitute the Economic \nDevelopment Administration, prohibit award and designation of funds to \nany area or entity named for a living Member of Congress, repeal \nposition on withholding of certain payments made to vendors \nby government entities, extension of certain Outer Continental Shelf \nleases, removal of insurance moratorium for industrial banks, limit \nantitrust exemption, repeal Davis-Bacon wage requirements, prohibit \nprinting of the Congressional Record, increase statutory limit of the \npublic debt, enable States to opt out of health care reform.\n\n  Another one is, Stability Oversight and Council authority, inclusion \nof application to independent regulatory agencies, amend Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act, border fence completion, major rules of the \nlegislative branch shall have no force for approval as enacted into \nlaw, delay implementation of health care reform until final resolution \nin pending lawsuits, securities laws amendments, rescind $45 billion of \nunobligated discretionary appropriations, rescission of unobligated \ndiscretionary appropriation, reduce amounts authorized to be \nappropriated, prescribe fires in Flint Hills region, EPA water quality \nstandard, repeal Bright Fields Demonstration Program, terminate global \nclimate change mitigation.\n  Mr. President, these are amendments that go page after page. I have \nonly mentioned a few of them. They have more than 90 of them. If there \never were an example of such a tremendous waste of the Senate's time \nand the indication that the Republicans don't care anything about the \nAmerican people working--I guess their goal is to make things as bad as \nthey can and, hopefully, the American people won't see through it, and \nmaybe they will get somebody elected to replace President Obama. What \nother reason could there be?\n  People are desperate for jobs. The unemployed wait and wait. It would \nbe different if they came here and offered amendments that had some \nrelevance or germaneness to this legislation. But they don't.\n  Tomorrow, Republicans will get another chance to help us move forward \non a bill that has a proven track record of putting people to work, for \nthe amount of $1.2 billion, and the last 5 years we have created \n314,000 jobs. Why? Because it is good for the private sector. For every \ndollar we invest, they invest $7. In the meantime, though, I urge my \nRepublican colleagues to consider the cost of these delaying tactics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/20/senate-section/article/S3906-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to say a few words to \nacknowledge the three coal miners who are trapped in a coal mine near \nMiddlesboro, KY. They were trapped there as a result of terrible storms \nand flooding in the southeastern part of my State. A number of \ndifferent communities have been affected by the flooding, and a lot of \npeople are working hard to help folks recover from power outages and \nmudslides. From what I understand, rescue efforts for the three miners \nare now underway, and the people on the ground are hopeful they will be \nable to rescue all three men, but we want them and their families to \nknow we are all thinking of them as the rescue efforts continue.\n  This is a vitally important industry in the region, and in moments \nsuch as this it is appropriate that we acknowledge the danger people \nwho work in the coal mines subject themselves to every single day. They \nare a courageous and dedicated group, and we are very grateful for \ntheir work.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, tomorrow, the Senate will vote on the \nconfirmation of Michael Simon to serve as U.S. District Court Judge for \nthe District of Oregon. Michael Simon is a good and decent man. In my \nhome State where we have a judicial emergency by the standards of Chief \nJustice Roberts, it is vitally important that Michael Simon be \nconfirmed. To begin, I wish to thank Chairman Leahy; ranking minority \nmember Grassley; the majority leader, Senator Reid, and minority leader \nMcConnell for bringing this nomination to the floor today.\n  Senator Merkley and I have been proud to put forward Mr. Simon's name \nfor consideration by the President. We were enthused by his subsequent \nnomination, and we are now hopeful he will soon be able to continue his \nservice to the people of Oregon in this new capacity.\n  Michael Simon is both a distinguished lawyer and a legal scholar with \na diverse and impressive legal career. That career includes work as a \npublic servant, as a litigator, a pro tempore judge, and as a \nprofessor. Michael Simon now is a partner at the firm of Perkins Coie \nin Portland, and he has worked there since 1986. After graduating summa \ncum laude from UCLA, Mr. Simon attended Harvard Law School where he \nagain graduated with honors cum laude.\n\n[[Page S3907]]\n\n  He began his legal career in the Department of Justice antitrust \ndivision where he served as a trial attorney for 5 years. During his \ntime working in Washington, DC, Mr. Simon also volunteered for and \nserved as special U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. \nIt was through his work at the antitrust division that Mr. Simon made \none of his most notable contributions, and that was a contribution to \nstrengthening consumer protection law. The distinguished President pro \ntempore of the Senate knows from his days in Connecticut as attorney \ngeneral how important it is that there be public advocates for consumer \nrights because so often this is a field that gets short shrift. People \nsay they are for the rights of consumers, but these cases can be hard \nand time consuming to bring. That is what Michael Simon did and did so \nwell.\n  Working on behalf of the Department of Justice on the case of United \nStates v. American Airlines, Mr. Simon successfully argued for \nextending the reach of the Sherman Act to include monopolization and \nattempted monopolization. In my view, this extension is one that \nbenefits consumers each and every day across this country. Frankly, to \nhave someone on the bench who has this kind of expertise in fighting \nmonopolies and protecting the rights of consumers is a very special \nqualification that I would simply commend to the Senate as we consider \nthe nomination of Michael Simon.\n  Throughout his work both in the public sector and in private \npractice, Mr. Simon has been an active member of our community. In \nfact, I have had many conversations with him in his capacity as the \nimmediate past president of Congregation Beth Israel in my hometown \nwhere he constantly is the leader of the congregation, reaching out to \nconscript volunteers for a host of projects, particularly those that \ninvolve children. He has engaged in extensive pro bono work. He has \nvolunteered for many local nonprofit organizations. I would call him \nthe official champion of voluntarism, because when we look at some of \nthe causes he has volunteered for--he has been a past board member of \nthe Waverly Children's Home; he has been past president and current \nboard member of the Classroom Law Project--we see that he consistently \ncomes back to recognizing the importance of the well-being and security \nof children in our community. That, too, is a special area of expertise \nand advocacy that he will bring to the bench, confirmed by the Senate, \nand another area that I wish to commend Mr. Simon to the Senate for as \nwe look at his candidacy this week.\n  This seat has been vacant for nearly 2 years. As the distinguished \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate knows, there is a process by which \none actually determines a judicial emergency. It has essentially been \ndefined by Chief Justice Roberts, and we clearly have such an emergency \nin my home State of Oregon. So it is very welcome news for Oregonians \nthat we have this opportunity to have a full bench, to have all \njustices on deck, and it is my view that Mr. Simon is an outstanding \nnominee. I have absolutely no reservations that he will be a superior \njudge.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting an exceptional \nindividual--a person who is fair and thoughtful and who brings years \nand years of expertise and a host of very important legal assignments. \nI am especially grateful that he is a resident of my hometown where he \nhas distinguished himself with extraordinary volunteering for a whole \nhost of causes that are important, especially the future of our \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I see the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee here, so \nlet me yield the floor at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/20/senate-section/article/S3907-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3907-S3908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MONTANA FLOOD HEROES\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Christopher Reeve once said that ``A hero \nis an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere and \nendure in spite of overwhelming obstacles.''\n  Today I wish to call attention to five Montana heroes--everyday folks \nmaking a superheroic effort to help their friends and neighbors. I \nenjoy sharing these stories. I am proud of these stories because they \ntell the story about what it is to be a Montanan.\n  For all the flooding that is going on in my State of Montana and in \nother States of the Nation, I am happy to mention the names of many \nMontana heroes who have been rising above and beyond the call of duty \nand are following Christopher Reeve's definition of what it means to be \na hero.\n  We in Montana pride ourselves in helping our fellow neighbors. I know \nthat is true in States all across our country. I don't want to say it \nis just in the State of Montana, but I can say that in our State it is \nspecial. We in Montana sometimes say we are one big small town. It is a \nbig State, not a lot of people. We tend to know each other. There is a \nstrong sense of camaraderie and community which I think is even \nstronger in my State than perhaps in some others.\n  My home State continues to face severe flooding. The Jefferson River, \nwhich is one of the three rivers that form the headwaters of the \nMissouri River, is over its banks at Three Forks, MT. The Milk River, \nwhere Lewis and Clark traveled--up the Missouri and part of the way up \nthe Milk River--continues to flood, and the Missouri River is flooding \nin Toston. As we know, downstream the Missouri flooding has been very \nsignificant. Rain is also in the forecast for the rest of the week. We \nhave record snowpack levels in our State. We have a lot of flooding, \nand there is going to be more.\n  But Montanans all across our State continue to do all that is \nnecessary and beyond to help. As we can see, this is the Rocky Boy's \nIndian Reservation that is underwater for the second time in a year. \nThis is the problem. The floods come and then they recede; the rains \ncome and melt the snowpacks, so it is flooding again. This is the Rocky \nBoy's Reservation, one of the seven major Indian reservations in the \nState of Montana.\n  This is Bruce Sun Child, interim chairman of the Chippewa Cree Tribe. \nI have known Bruce for many years. He has been working around the clock \nto help his tribe through this emergency. For those who lost their \nhomes, he helped them find a place to sleep. For the sick, he found a \nway to get them to the hospital. He is one of those guys who cares.\n  Dave Dickman owns a business in Great Falls called Dickman \nExcavation. After flooding threatened homes in Great Falls--this \nhappens very often, usually in the Sun River which is one of the \ntributaries of the Missouri River. It flows into the Missouri in Great \nFalls. Dave Dickman donated thousands of sandbags to Montana families \nworking to protect their homes from rising waters. This is classic. \nThis is typical. When we asked him why he did all this and why he is \nworking so hard, he humbly said, ``I know my neighbors would do the \nsame for me if I needed a helping hand.''\n  Floyd Fisher is another Montana hero. I have been mentioning many \nheroes in Montana individually and specifically by name over the last \ncouple of weeks. This is Floyd Fisher. He does it all. Floyd Fisher is \nthe Golden Valley sheriff. He is also the county coroner. Floyd is the \ncounty fire chief. He is also the disaster emergency services director. \nHe works as an EMT responding to ambulance calls. Floyd is a busy guy. \nFloyd cares. He likes to help people. After learning of a pending flash \nflood in Ryegate, MT, last week, we initiated the county's reverse 911 \nalert system. He then rushed across town door to door with an \nevacuation order. Shortly thereafter, 2 feet of water flooded the \nstreets of Ryegate.\n  After the floods, Floyd Fisher kept at it. He directed traffic away \nfrom washed out roads. He picked up a broom to help clean out Super D's \nGrocery. He provided emergency medical care.\n  Floyd has been working around the clock, catching 2 or 3 hours of \nsleep when he can find it. If you want to understand Montana, look no \nfurther\n\n[[Page S3908]]\n\nthan Floyd. His efforts sum it up very well.\n  Last week, Missoula County set up a flood hotline to help people face \nthe rising floodwaters. Before long, the hotline received dozens of \ncalls from volunteers wanting to help. Missoula's former rural fire \nchief, Curt Belts, stepped up to help. This is Curt. He has a smile on \nhis face right now. He didn't have a smile on his face when he was \nhelping out with the flood.\n  Curt worked with the United Way to organize over 60 volunteers daily. \nHe made sure sandbags were placed at key locations around Missoula. He \nworked very hard--14-hour days--to minimize damage from flooding in \nMissoula. If we ask any volunteer around Missoula, they will tell you \nit was Curt who made all the difference, even down to the finest \ndetails such as sunscreen and bug spray for volunteers.

Mr. President, as you know, there is a great deal of \ndiscussion going on right now in different forums on whether to \nincrease our debt limit and, as a part of that, how we can reduce this \ngovernment's spending practices so that we won't have to keep extending \nthe debt ceiling in the future. Those conversations include a lot of \nfocus on reducing spending in the near term and finding ways to reform \nsome of the entitlement programs so that spending will also be reduced \nover the long term because I think everyone agrees that the current way \nwe spend money--40 cents of every dollar has to be borrowed--is \nliterally going to result in bankruptcy if we don't bring it under \ncontrol.\n  There are those who say: Well, actually, the answer to the problem is \nto increase revenues--meaning raise taxes. The problem with that is we \ndidn't get into this problem because we didn't tax enough; we got into \nthis problem because we have been spending too much.\n  The simplest way to think about it is that historically we spend \nabout 20 percent of the gross domestic product. Under the Obama \nbudgets, we are going to be spending--and we almost spend this much \nnow--25 percent of the gross domestic product, and that is a spending \nincrease that is not sustainable.\n  Even under the largest of deficits, when President Bush was \nPresident, it was less than $\\1/2\\ trillion. But under the Obama \nbudget, it is $1.5 trillion almost exactly for every year for the last \n3 years and on into the future. The result is that under this President \nwe will have doubled all of the debt this country has accumulated from \nthe time George Washington was President all the way through the time \nGeorge Bush was President. We will double that under the Obama \nadministration.\n  The problem is spending; it is not taxes. Evidence of that was \npresented last Thursday in an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal. \nAt the conclusion of my remarks, I am going to ask unanimous consent to \nhave the article printed in the Record because I think it makes the \npoint. I will quote from it or at least discuss some of the arguments \nin this piece right now.\n  It was put together by a Cato Institute senior fellow Alan Reynolds, \nwho has written on this subject in the past and is a real student of \nthe effect of tax rates on economic growth and on revenues for the \ncountry. One of the points he discusses in this op-ed is what happens \nwhen you raise tax rates, as some of our friends--particularly on the \nother side of the aisle--want to do as part of this deficit reduction \nexercise. Do you necessarily increase revenues if you raise tax rates? \nWhat are the impacts on the economy? What happens, on the other hand, \nif you are able to reduce tax rates?\n  Now, there is no plan on the table to actually reduce tax rates, but \nI think the arguments he presents make it clear that lower rates do not \nnecessarily produce less revenue and, in fact, can have a salutary \nimpact on economic growth and therefore job creation, which is, of \ncourse, what we are trying to be all about here.\n  He has studied tax rates for the last six decades, and here is some \nof the factual information he comes out with. The conclusion is this: \nHigher tax rates do not necessarily lead to more revenue. In fact, \nrecent history has often shown the opposite. Here are some specific \nexamples.\n  Back when the highest tax rate in this country was 91 percent--if you \ncan just think about that, a 91-percent tax rate. Why would anyone work \nto make that last $1 when 91 cents of the $1 you earn goes to Uncle \nSam? That was the highest tax rate. The lowest tax rate was 20 percent. \nToday, the lowest tax rate is zero and the next one is 10 percent and \nthen 15 percent and so on. So this was a much more progressive Tax \nCode. Individual income tax revenues during that time were 7.7 percent \nof the gross domestic product.\n  President Kennedy came along and proposed cutting both the highest \nand the lowest rates. So they went from 91 down to 70 and from 20 down \nto 14 percent. What happened to the 7.7-percent revenues? They rose to \n8 percent of gross domestic product. So the rates were reduced, but the \nrevenue to the Treasury was increased.\n  What happened a few years later when that was done, when President \nReagan first cut the top rate from 70 percent down to 50 percent? Did \nrevenues fall? No. Revenues to the government increased to 8.3 percent \nof the gross domestic product.\n  Third example, 1986, when the top rate was slashed again from 50 \npercent down to 28 percent, almost in half. You would think revenues \nwould decline. No. They remained almost exactly the same, from 8.3 to \n8.1 percent.\n  So his research clearly demonstrates that the link between lower \nrates and lower revenues is very weak, if not actually a converse \nrelationship. The relationship between higher taxes and economic \ndifficulty could not be more clear.\n  Let's talk about what happens when you have increases in the tax \nrates. In the early 1990s, the top rate was increased to 31 percent--\nwhich, by the way, is more comparable to about 35 percent in today's \ndollars because of hidden taxes--the country fell into a recession and \nrevenues actually dropped to just 7.8 percent of GDP. So you think you \nare going to raise more revenue and reduce the deficit by raising tax \nrates? Wrong. We raised taxes, revenues actually dropped, and the \ncountry went into a recession.\n  When the top two tax rates were raised later to 36 and 39.6 percent \nand taxes on Social Security increased as a part of the Clinton tax \nhikes, revenues again barely moved to 8 percent--so from 7.8 to 8 \npercent. The government actually collected more tax revenue when the \ntop rate was just 28 percent.\n\n[[Page S3909]]\n\n  It is simply not true that you can raise tax rates and therefore get \nmore revenue to the Treasury and therefore reduce the debt and the \ndeficit. It is especially not true if you are only talking about doing \nthat for the very highest tax earners because they don't make enough to \nproduce the kind of revenue that would be required to reduce the \ndeficit that much.\n  To be sure, there are always fluctuations, and there is not a very \nspecific causal relationship in all cases between rates and revenues \ncollected. For example, during the technology bubble of the 1990s, \nrevenues rose above 9 percent. We were on a roll. People made more \nmoney. The government made more money as a result. But, interestingly \nenough, this was only after capital gains taxes were cut from 28 \npercent down to 20. There is almost an inverse relationship between the \ncapital gains tax rate and revenues collected. As that rate goes up, \nless revenue is collected. As the rate comes down, more revenue is \ncollected because it is a tax on economic activity. The lower the tax, \nthe more economic activity you have and therefore the more the Federal \nGovernment receives in revenues, even though the rate is lower.\n  Reynolds found a similar correlation between rates and revenues with \ncapital gains as he identified with ordinary income taxes.\n  Just a couple of other statistics. When the capital gains rate was 28 \npercent, revenues were 2.5 percent of the GDP. After the rate was cut \ndown to 20 percent, capital gains revenues rose to 4.6 percent of GDP. \nSo when you cut the tax rate, then the revenues almost doubled.\n  As I said, capital gains are the most sensitive to rate reductions or \nrate increases of all our tax rates. Nonetheless, it is an impressive \nfigure to demonstrate that at least you don't want to be raising tax \nrates even if you are not willing to reduce them.\n  In summary, after both ordinary income and capital gains tax rates \nwere cut to 35 and 15 percent respectively in 2003, individual income \ntax revenues were 8.1 percent of GDP, which was higher than the period \nwhen the ordinary income tax rate was 39.6 and the capital gains rate \nwas 28 percent. So almost no matter how you look at it, you can see \nthis relationship, and it is almost an inverse relationship.\n  Again, I am not claiming that all tax cuts pay for themselves or that \nin all cases this is exactly the way it works out. But to assume we can \nsolve part of our problem by raising tax rates and especially raising \nthem on the people who are most able to move income around to avoid \npaying taxes or minimize their tax rates and who are the most \nsusceptible to the capital gains rates and who are the people most able \nto invest in business and therefore help to create jobs--to suggest \nthat increasing their tax rates is a good idea is obviously not true \nbased upon the research Mr. Reynolds has done.\n  The bottom line, lower tax rates do not necessarily mean less \nrevenue, higher rates do not always mean more revenue, and the facts \nfrequently point to the opposite.\n  There is obviously more to consider than just how much revenue will \nbe raised. Unfortunately, higher tax rates also have a very pernicious \neffect on economic growth and job creation, and Reynolds' research in \nthis area is very clear as well. When surtaxes were imposed in our \neconomy back in 1969 and 1970, our economy fell into one of the deepest \nrecessions we have had until the one we are in right now.\n  During the bracket creep of the 1980 to 1981 period, when inflation \nforced taxpayers to pay higher rates, until that was fixed later, the \neconomy again fell into a recession, and following the rate increases \nof 1990, the economy fell into a recession. So it is pretty clear \nhigher taxes are the last thing you need to do or want to do during a \ntime of persistently high unemployment and a struggling economy, as we \nhave today. Yet, as I said, there are some Members of Congress and the \nadministration who have proposed raising tax rates as a way to address \nthe deficit.\n  I even read that an academic proposed a 70-percent rate. One witness \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee, believe it or not, even suggested \nthat a tax rate of 90 percent would maximize revenue.\n  To show you how counterintuitive that is, let me just ask the \nquestion. What two tax rates produce zero revenue? Well, the answer is \nzero, of course, and 100 percent. If you are going to tax 100 percent \nof what somebody makes, he is not going to bother to make the money. It \ndoesn't do him any good, and it doesn't do him much good if he only \ngets to save a dime out of a dollar that he makes if the government \ntakes 90 percent. So it is not true that sticking the rich with a very \nhigh tax rate is going to bring in more revenue to the government. \nThose people don't have to make the money. They can shift it around so \nthey can minimize their tax burden. Eventually, what that does is put \nan even greater burden on middle-income Americans who aren't that \nwealthy, who can't move their money around, who have to take it and \nspend it to support their families, send their kids to school or for \nhealth costs or whatever it might be. That is why you cannot solve this \nproblem by raising taxes. You have to focus on the side where all the \ngrowth has been, which is increased spending.\n  At the end of the day, the American people believe wasteful \nWashington spending has to stop. That is why they are saying to many of \nus, don't raise the debt ceiling, at least until you have made sure we \nare not going to have to keep doing this in the future because spending \nkeeps going up. Let's have a downpayment on significant savings now. \nLet's set the budget numbers for the next 10 years so they actually \nrepresent a reduction in spending, not an increase. Let's have \nentitlement reform that shows that, even after that 10 years, the \nexpenses will continue to, if not fall, at least rise less quickly so \nour economic growth can manage any increase in costs. Let's do that in \nsuch a way that we absolutely put constraints on Congress and the \nPresident. We put ourselves in a straitjacket, so to speak, so we can't \ncreate exceptions and waivers and get around it in other ways.\n  Unless we do those things, I don't think most of the people on my \nside of the aisle are going to have an appetite for increasing the debt \nceiling. I know I am not. I am going to look at the historical evidence \nthat people such as Alan Reynolds point out to us, the evidence that \nclearly shows that higher tax rates do not necessarily translate into \nhigher revenues; in fact, in many of the cases, it is precisely the \nopposite. It is why, beyond the obvious economic costs, it is foolish \nto propose higher rates as a solution to our fiscal crisis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Wall Street Journal op-ed I mentioned.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 16, 2011]\n\n                      Why 70% Tax Rates Won't Work\n\n                           (By Alan Reynolds)\n\n       The intelligentsia of the Democratic Party is growing \n     increasingly enthusiastic about raising the highest federal \n     income tax rates to 70% or more. Former Labor Secretary \n     Robert Reich took the lead in February, proposing on his blog \n     ``a 70 percent marginal tax rate on the rich.'' After all, he \n     noted, ``between the late 1940s and 1980 America's highest \n     marginal rate averaged above 70 percent. Under Republican \n     President Dwight Eisenhower it was 91 percent. Not until the \n     1980s did Ronald Reagan slash it to 28 percent.''\n       That helped set the stage for Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D., \n     Ill.) and nine other House members to introduce the Fairness \n     in Taxation Act in March. That bill would add five tax \n     brackets between 45% and 49% on incomes above $1 million and \n     tax capital gains and dividends at those same high rates. The \n     academic left of the Democratic Party finds this much too \n     timid, and would rather see income tax rates on the ``rich'' \n     at Mr. Reich's suggested levels--or higher.\n       This new fascination with tax rates of 70% or more is \n     ostensibly intended to raise gobs of new revenue, so federal \n     spending could supposedly remain well above 24% of gross \n     domestic product (GDP) rather than be scaled back toward the \n     19% average of 1997-2007.\n       All this nostalgia about the good old days of 70% tax rates \n     makes it sound as though only the highest incomes would face \n     higher tax rates. In reality, there were a dozen tax rates \n     between 48% and 70% during the 1970s. Moreover--and this is \n     what Mr. Reich and his friends always fail to mention--the \n     individual income tax actually brought in less revenue when \n     the highest tax rate was 70% to 91% than it did when the \n     highest tax rate was 28%.\n       When the highest tax rate ranged from 91% to 92% (1951-63), \n     even the lowest rate was quite high--20% or 22%. As the \n     nearby chart shows, however, those super-high tax rates\n\n[[Page S3910]]\n\n     at all income levels brought in revenue of only 7.7% of GDP, \n     according to U.S. budget historical data.\n       President John F. Kennedy's across-the-board tax cuts \n     reduced the lowest and highest tax rates to 14% and 70% \n     respectively after 1964, yet revenues (after excluding the \n     5%-10% surtaxes of 1969-70) rose to 8% of GDP. President \n     Reagan's across-the-board tax cuts further reduced the lowest \n     and highest tax rates to 11% and 50%, yet revenues rose again \n     to 8.3% of GDP. The 1986 tax reform slashed the top tax rate \n     to 28%, yet revenues dipped trivially to 8.1% of GDP.\n       What about those increases in top tax rates in 1990 and \n     1993? The top statutory rate was raised to 31% in 1991, but \n     it was really closer to 35% because exemptions and deductions \n     were phased-out as incomes increased. The economy quickly \n     slipped into recession--as it did during the surtaxes of \n     1969-70 and the ``bracket creep'' of 1980-81, which pushed \n     many middle-income families into higher tax brackets. \n     Revenues fell to 7.8% of GDP.\n       The 1993 law added two higher tax brackets and, \n     importantly, raised the taxable portion of Social Security \n     benefits to 85% from 50%. At just 8% of GDP, however, \n     individual income tax receipts were surprisingly low during \n     President Bill Clinton's first term.\n       The Internet/telecom boom of 1998-2000 was the only time \n     individual income tax revenues remained higher than 9% of GDP \n     for more than one year without the economy slipping into \n     recession (as it did when the tax topped 9% in 1969, 1981 and \n     2001).\n       But that was an unrepeatable windfall resulting from the \n     quintupling of Nasdaq stocks--combined with (1) the \n     proliferation of nonqualified stock options that have since \n     been thwarted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, \n     and (2) the 1997 cut in the capital gains tax to 20%. \n     Realized capital gains rose to 4.6% of GDP from 1997 to \n     2002--up from 2.5% of GDP from 1987 to 1996 when the capital \n     gains tax was 28%.\n       Suppose the Congress let all of the Bush tax cuts expire in \n     2013, which is the current trajectory. That would bring us \n     back to the tax regime of 1993-96 when the individual income \n     tax brought in no more revenue (8% of GDP) than it did in \n     2006-08 (8.1% of GDP).\n       It is true that President Obama proposes raising the \n     capital gains tax to 23.8%, which could raise more revenue \n     than the 28% rate of 1993-96. But a 23.8% tax on capital \n     gains and dividends would nevertheless be high enough to \n     depress stock prices and related tax revenues.\n       Still, pundits cling to the myth that lower tax rates mean \n     lower revenues. ``You do probably get a modest boost to GDP \n     from tax cuts,'' concedes the Atlantic's Megan McCardle. \n     ``But you also get falling tax revenue. It can't be said too \n     often--and there you are, I've said it again.''\n       Yet the chart nearby clearly shows that reductions in U.S. \n     marginal tax rates did not cause ``falling tax revenue.'' It \n     is not necessary to argue that tax rate reduction paid for \n     itself by increasing economic growth. Lowering top marginal \n     tax rates in stages from 91% to 28% paid for itself \n     regardless of what happened to GDP.\n       It is particularly remarkable that individual tax revenues \n     did not fall as a percentage of GDP because changes in tax \n     law, most notably those of 1986 and 2003, greatly expanded \n     refundable tax credits, personal exemptions and standard \n     deductions. As a result, the Joint Committee on Taxation \n     recently reported that 51% of Americans no longer pay federal \n     income tax.\n       Since the era of 70% tax rates, the U.S. income tax system \n     has become far more ``progressive.'' Congressional Budget \n     Office estimates show that from 1979 to 2007 average income \n     tax rates fell by 110% to minus 0.4% from 4.1% for the \n     second-poorest quintile of taxpayers. Average tax rates fell \n     by 56% for the middle quintile and 39% for the fourth, but \n     only 8% at the top. Despite these massive tax cuts for the \n     bottom 80%, overall federal revenues were the same 18.5% \n     share of GDP in 2007 as they were in 1979 and individual tax \n     revenues were nearly the same--8.7% of GDP in 1979 versus \n     8.4% in 2007.\n       In short, reductions in top tax rates under Presidents \n     Kennedy and Reagan, and reductions in capital gains tax rates \n     under Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush, not only ``paid \n     for themselves'' but also provided enough extra revenue to \n     finance negative income taxes for the bottom 40% and record-\n     low income taxes at middle incomes.\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, it was about 10 years ago that I received \na call to my office in Chicago from a Korean-American mother who was \nconcerned about her daughter. Her daughter had been brought to the \nUnited States at the age of 2, had grown up in the United States, all \nher brothers and sisters were born here as well, and her daughter had \nbeen accepted on a music scholarship. Turns out she was an \nextraordinarily talented concert pianist. She was graduating from high \nschool and had been accepted at Juilliard School of Music and Manhattan \nObservatory School of Music, and in filling out the application, there \nwas a question about her daughter's citizenship. Since she brought her \ndaughter here on a visitor's visa at the age of 2 and never filed any \npapers, she wanted to know her daughter's status.\n  It turns out her daughter's status was very clear. She was \nundocumented, and the law was also very clear; that this 18-year-old \ngirl who had lived here for 16 years was told she had to leave America. \nThere was no recourse. She was not even being sent back to Korea \nbecause her family transited from Korea to Brazil to the United States. \nThey wanted to ship her to Brazil, a country she was not even aware of \nwith a language she did not speak, Portuguese. In that situation, her \nmother said: What can we do? I checked with the law, and it turned out \nthere was no place to turn. Her daughter was without a country. That is \nwhen I introduced the DREAM Act.\n  The DREAM Act is legislation which says if you came to the United \nStates as a child, if you have been a long-term resident of the United \nStates, you have good moral character, and you graduate from high \nschool, we will give you two chances to become legal in America. You \ncan either enlist in our military or you can finish at least 2 years of \ncollege. That was 10 years ago. I am still working to pass that \nlegislation. Over the period of time I have worked on it, I have met \nhundreds, maybe more, of people like that young girl I just described. \nThey are young people who have that kind of excited look in their eyes, \nthey want to be part of this world. Most of them are college students \nor college graduates, but they cannot make the first move toward the \nlife they want to live because they are undocumented.\n  That is why I continue to come to the floor of the Senate each week \nand tell their stories, urging my colleagues, on both sides of the \naisle, in the name of justice, to give these kids a chance. We have a \npretty basic principle in America. We do not hold kids responsible for \nthe wrongdoing of their parents. We tell kids you are responsible for \nyour own life. Do the right thing. Go to school. Don't get in trouble, \nstudy, aspire to greatness. Go to college, and they do. These kids do \ntoo. But they have an obstacle most children in America do not have. \nThey have no country.\n  Senator Menendez of New Jersey, my friend and colleague, had a great \nstatement on the floor, and I have used it many times. I credited the \nSenator the first time, but I will credit him again because he is here. \nHe tells of these young people getting up every day and putting their \nhands to their heart and pledging allegiance to the United States of \nAmerica, going to events where they sing along with the only National \nAnthem they know, and in the eyes of the law, in the eyes of America, \nthey are not part of us. They are somewhere in the middle.\n  Is that right? Is it fair? Is it a standard we want to establish in \nthis country when it comes to justice? I don't think so. We need these \nyoung people. They are not only bright and energetic, they can become \ntomorrow's leaders in our military. That is why Secretary Robert Gates, \nwho is retiring this month as Department of Defense Secretary, supports \nthis legislation. That is why so many others have stepped up in both \npolitical parties and said this is a smart thing to do, give these \nyoung people a chance to prove themselves.\n  I just had a discussion in my office about H-1B visas. These are \nvisas we offer to foreigners, people who were not born in the United \nStates, to come here and work because we need their talent pool to be \npart of an expanding American economy. What about the talent pool of \nthese DREAM Act students? As I have told their stories on the floor, \nthese are students who are extraordinary: chemical engineers, \nmechanical engineers, teachers, aspiring attorneys, but they cannot do \nany of those things because they have no citizenship status in America.\n  I wish to share the story of two of them and I know Senator Menendez \nis\n\n[[Page S3911]]\n\non the floor and this will not take long. The first is Diana Banda. \nThis is her photo. Diana was brought to the United States in 1993 at \nthe age of 3. She grew up in Oregon and dreamed of being a first \nresponder. She volunteered with the American Red Cross at her community \nemergency response team. During her senior year in high school, Diana \nwas diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Thankfully, after a long struggle, \nshe is cancer free. After her recovery, Diana is more determined than \never to pursue her dream. She is enrolled in a firefighting and \nparamedic program at the community college in Salem, OR. These students \nqualify for no Federal assistance. When they go to college, they pay \nfor it out of their pockets. They sacrifice more than many students \nbecause they are determined to get an education.\n  Diana sent me a letter. This is what she said about her dreams for \nthe future:\n\n       Although I love Mexico because it is the place I was born, \n     I could not pack my things and move back to a place I know \n     nothing about, a place I only know through old baby pictures \n     and family stories.\n\n  Diana says:\n\n       America is my home. This is the place I love where everyone \n     and everything I know is. I know nothing outside the United \n     States. Whatever punishment I must pay, I am willing to do. \n     All I ask for is a chance. Better yet I beg for a chance to \n     prove that I am not a criminal, that I have much to offer \n     this beautiful place.\n\n  Should we deport Diana Banda, a cancer survivor, a future paramedic, \nback to Mexico, a country she left behind when she was just a toddler? \nShould we accept her invitation to punish her? For what? For being part \nof the family who brought her here at the age of 3? It was not her \ndecision; it was her parents' decision. Rightly or wrongly, she is in \nthe United States. When you look at this photo and realize she could be \npart of our future, we realize what the DREAM Act is all about.\n  Let me introduce you to another dreamer. This is Monji Dolon. Monji's \nparents brought him here from Bangladesh in 1991 at the age of 5. As he \ngrew up in his new home, Monji immersed himself in the study of \ncomputers and technology.\n  Monji wrote me a letter and said as follows:\n\n       For as long as I can remember, I have had an intense \n     passion for technology. In middle school, that passion led to \n     spending many nights constructing remote-controlled model and \n     Van de Graaff generators. In high school, I fell in love with \n     computers and the Internet, spending my senior year creating \n     an online newspaper for my school.\n\n  Monji did not know about his immigration status until he started \napplying for college. He asked his parents what he should say in terms \nof his immigration status. That is when Monji learned he was \nundocumented. In 2008, Monji graduated from the University of North \nCarolina at Chapel Hill, an outstanding school. Again, let me put in \nthe record, these students who graduate from college do it facing \nsacrifices many students don't. They get no Federal assistance, none. \nMonji's prospects are limited, even though he graduated from the \nUniversity of North Carolina Chapel Hill, an outstanding school, and he \nis being courted by the technology industry. They want to hire this \nbright young man. He has even been offered a job as a lead engineer for \na startup company in Silicon Valley. Monji's prospects are constricted \nbecause of his immigration status. The DREAM Act would give him a \nchance to pursue his dreams and contribute his talent to the only \ncountry he has ever called home.\n\n  Here is what he told me:\n\n       I've turned down several great job offers from reputable \n     companies because of my status. The DREAM Act would let me \n     take my passion for technology to the next level by allowing \n     me to move to Silicon Valley and pursue my dream as an \n     Internet entrepreneur.\n\n  When you look at some of the most amazing technology in America \ntoday, you will find that many times it is the product of immigrants \nwho came to this country and created companies that employ thousands of \npeople. I do not know if Monji will be one of those persons. I think he \ndeserves a chance. Would America be better off if we sent him back to \nBangladesh, a country he has not been to in 20 years? Of course not.\n  There is so much discussion about America's economic future in the \n21st century. Every year, with all these H-1B visas, we bring in \ntalented people from overseas while at the same time our laws banish \nthese talented people I just talked about back to countries they have \nnever known as they have grown up. We could use people with Monji's \ntalents in America. We can use them in technology, as we can use \nDiana's talents in the field of medicine.\n\n  I first introduced this bill 10 years ago. Since then I have met so \nmany immigrant students who would qualify. As are Diana Banda and Monji \nDolon, they are America's heart. They are willing to serve our country, \neven risk their lives for our country, if we would just give them a \nchance.\n  I urge my colleagues in this political town, this partisan town, on \nthis issue: Let's put it aside. Let's support basic justice and \nfairness. Let's give these kids a chance. I am willing to stake my \nreputation as a Senator on the fact that America will be a better place \nwhen the DREAM Act becomes law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, first of all, I didn't come to the floor \nfor this purpose, but I would be remiss if I didn't thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois, the Democratic whip, for his \nincredible commitment and passion to this issue. I have seen him just \nabout every session take time out of every day to both dramatize and \nput a human face on this opportunity to turn some of America's greatest \nprospects into opportunity and prosperity for this entire country. I am \nthrilled he has adopted various of my lines, and I am honored by it.\n  It is true; these young people came to this country through no choice \nof their own. The only country they have ever known is the United \nStates of America. They put their hands on their hearts and pledge \nallegiance to the United States, and the only National Anthem they have \never learned to sing or believe in is ``The Star-Spangled Banner.''\n  We have a tremendous opportunity. I wish to thank the distinguished \nSenator for his incredible commitment to this issue. I appreciate it \nvery much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/20/senate-section/article/S3911-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3911-S3913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to speak about \nsomething that I very passionately believe in, and that is my view in \nsupport of a significant and sustained reduction of American combat \nforces in Afghanistan beginning this July.\n  In short, I believe the time has come to move from a strategy of \ncounterinsurgency to one of counterterrorism--a strategy that would \nrely on our specialized military forces to continue to engage those who \npresent a real and continued threat to the national security of the \nUnited States and one that would allow us to bring home a majority of \ntroops serving in Afghanistan.\n  After September 11, almost a decade ago, we were clearly justified in \nintervening in Afghanistan to defeat al-Qaida and bring bin Laden to \njustice for the atrocities they committed against Americans on our own \nsoil. I supported President Bush at that time in that effort. I have a \nstandard that if I am willing to send my son and daughter to fight for \nAmerica on behalf of the Nation's national security interests, I will \nvote to send anyone else's sons and daughters. Not so in Iraq where I \ndid not believe it was in the national security interests of the United \nStates; and if I won't send my son and daughter, I won't vote to send \nanyone else's sons or daughters. But in Afghanistan nearly a decade \nago, that is where the perpetrators of September 11 were, and it was \nthe right engagement. Our original goals have largely been met in that \nrespect.\n  Today, even according to the Director of the CIA, fewer than 100 \nmembers of al-Qaida remain in Afghanistan. Since September 11, we are \npainfully aware that the world is a different place, and we will always \nhave to be vigilant. But the current threat simply does not justify the \npresence of 100,000 American troops on the ground. Bin Laden is dead, \nhaving hidden for years in Pakistan in plain view of the ISI, \nPakistan's intelligence force, and the Pakistani military.\n  Clearly, the issue at hand is about terrorism not insurgency. \nTerrorism is a borderless issue represented by the\n\n[[Page S3912]]\n\nunimpeded movement of the Taliban into Pakistan and a safe haven in \nAbbottabad for al-Qaida's leader. In finding bin Laden and bringing him \nto justice, we have struck a serious blow to al-Qaida's network that \npermits us to now reconsider our mission and the wisdom of pursuing a \nbroad and open-ended strategy of nation building in Afghanistan \nbecause, make no mistake about it, what we are doing in Afghanistan is \nnation building.\n  This is interesting. I have heard speeches on the Senate floor and in \nmy previous service in the House by many of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle about how we should not be nation building, as though \nthat is not a vital national interest. Well, that is exactly what we \nare doing. The costs of our current strategy are too high in lives \nlost, in futures unraveled by injury, and in taxpayer dollars spent.\n  Mr. President, 1,500 brave men and women have lost their lives in \nAfghanistan. Almost 12,000 have been wounded in action, at a cost--a \ncontinuing cost--of $10 billion a month--a month. Nonmilitary \ncontributions to Afghan reconstruction and development from 2002 to \n2010 have reached $19 billion--a number which is expected to surge as \nwe transition to a civilian mission. But at the same time, reports from \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on which I sit, and from the \nbipartisan Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan \nplace our billions of dollars in investment at risk of falling into \ndisrepair because of inadequate planning to pay for the ongoing \noperations and maintenance; not to mention that from my own \nperspective, $19 billion later, I don't know what we have achieved in \nAfghanistan.\n  In my mind not only are the costs and lives and treasure far too \nhigh, but there is a growing consensus that absent a very long and \nsustained commitment involving many troops on the ground, we can't win \nthe hearts and minds of the Afghan people or, for that matter, even \nPresident Karzai who, in my view, has not proven to be a good partner. \nKarzai most recently suggested that the U.S. and NATO forces risk \nbecoming an occupying force that would be, in his words, ousted from \nthe country--all of these lives later of American troops lost. To do \nwhat? To have a counterinsurgency effort. Which is what? Fighting \ninsurgents to give the Afghan Government the opportunity to sustain \nitself, to defend itself, to govern itself, and we are an occupying \nforce? We are an occupying force?\n  We have to ask, even if we are willing to make the enormous economic \ncommitment required to build a democracy and to fund the necessary \nsecurity elements at the cost of tens of billions of dollars per year, \nwhat is the likelihood of our success?\n  The Afghan Government is corrupt. Our working relationship with \nPresident Karzai continues to be challenged. Today I believe he made \nsome other comments--either today or yesterday--again, that malign the \nvery Nation that is there defending them with the sons and daughters of \nAmerica, with the National Treasury of America--in a country that, by \nthe way, has $1 trillion of precious deposits of various minerals that, \nif properly pursued, would be able to fund the Afghan Nation for years \nto come.\n  When they gave out their first contract, who did they give it to? Not \nthe Nation that has defended them but the Chinese who have done nothing \nto stand up for the Afghan people.\n  So I look at a government that is corrupt, our working relationship \nwith Karzai crumbling, our focus on building security forces challenged \nbecause its membership largely excludes Pashtuns in the south, which is \nthe base for the Taliban. I am not certain there is any amount of money \nor a plan that can work under those circumstances. It seems to me for \nevery Taliban fighter we kill, buy off, or convert another one will \ntake his place, and more and more will stand up to fight an enemy that \nis perceived as infidels. I am not certain a counterinsurgency strategy \nis anything but counterproductive.\n  It is clear to me the present course is unsustainable, creates \ndependency, breeds corruption, and ignores the fact that at some point \nAfghanistan will have to stand on its own--on its trillions of dollars \nin mineral deposits--and build its own future. We are spending $10 \nbillion a month on a counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan that \ndoes not have a clear path to a definable victory. I am not certain a \ncounterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan does anything but feed and \ngrow the insurgency.\n  In short, I am not certain a counterinsurgency strategy is a winnable \nstrategy. Therefore, it is my belief we need a tailored \ncounterterrorism strategy to achieve and protect our national security \ninterests and meet our broader fiduciary responsibilities. Since 2001 \nwe have invested over $50 billion to help stand up a central government \nin Kabul and fund reconstruction projects across Afghanistan. So $26 \nbillion has gone to standing up the Afghan security forces, including \nan additional $11 billion this year. To date, the Afghan National Army \nnow stands at 164,000 men, and the Afghan National Police Force at \n126,000. So combined, the Afghan National Security Forces now stand at \n290,000 men strong.\n\n  We can't forever be the overprotective parent. The time has come to \nallow Afghans to secure their own future, to draw on the 290,000 men \nwho have committed to securing their country's future, and to allow \nthem the opportunity to defend their Nation and their people.\n  The fact is, Afghanistan is a rugged, multifaceted country with a \nlong history of complex tribal relationships. It faces almost \nunprecedented challenges in building a vibrant, independent, and, \nhopefully, democratic nation from the rubble of more than a quarter \ncentury of war. We can guide a process to provide necessary, \nachievable, and sustainable assistance to bolster their efforts--and we \nshould--but it is up to the Afghan people to stand up a government and \na security force and to develop their own counterinsurgency effort.\n  Our primary goal--the goal that was crystal clear on September 12, \n2001--was to address the imminent terrorist threat to America and \nAmerica's interests. The phrase was ``to drain the swamp and address \nthe new threats we face.''\n  The Taliban is a threat, but they are not the threat we rallied to \naddress. Any counterterrorism strategy we employ now can necessarily \ndeal with any Taliban issues that would be a threat to American \nsecurity. But the primary threat to America and to American interests \nis posed by al-Qaida. It is a threat that is stateless, borderless. The \nnotion that if we deploy enough forces in Afghanistan we will somehow \nlessen that threat, in my view, is farcical and falls on the \nconventional Washington wisdom that more is better.\n  In my view, better is better--a mission better focused on the \nthreats, with specialized troops better trained to better locate and \nbetter destroy terrorist hideouts; a mission with resources better \nspent on projects that are necessary, achievable, and sustainable. In \nshort, we need a better, not a bigger, mission.\n  In my view, we must accelerate the transfer of nation building and \nnation protecting to the Afghan people and their government. We must \nremain ever vigilant and ever prepared to protect our national security \ninterests and eliminate any new terrorist threats that emerge. We \nshould continue to identify areas where our advice and assistance can \nstrengthen the Afghan Government and the institutions of democracy. But \nour mission should be one of counterterrorism, not counterinsurgency.\n  We need to concentrate our resources on the real threats in the \nregion--threats to U.S. citizens and U.S. interests and threats that \ncould destabilize Pakistan and place nuclear materials at risk, which \nwould be a very real and present threat to national security and the \nsecurity of the region--a threat we cannot abide.\n  We entered Afghanistan to address a threat vital to the national \nsecurity of our country. By reforming our mission, targeting our unique \nmilitary resources, and refining our assistance mission to focus on \nsustainable and achievable outcomes, we can achieve that goal with \nfewer troops and less money.\n  For those reasons, last week I joined with my distinguished colleague \nSenator Merkley of Oregon and many other Members in urging the \nPresident to begin a sizable and sustained reduction in U.S. combat \nforces from Afghanistan this summer. It is time to\n\n[[Page S3913]]\n\nbring our men and women home. It is my belief this is the best and most \nresponsible policy for America--a policy that seeks to protect our \nnational security while meeting our fiduciary responsibilities, and \nserving the interests of the service men and women and their families \nwho have sacrificed so much on behalf of a grateful Nation. It is time. \nIt is time.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/20/senate-section/article/S3913-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WORLD REFUGEE DAY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this year, we celebrate the 60th \nanniversary of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. \nI am pleased that today, June 20, the international community is \ncelebrating World Refugee Day, an important opportunity to recognize \nthe continuing plight of the millions of refugees around the world who \ndeserve our protection.\n  It is also a moment to celebrate the accomplishments of refugees who \nhave been resettled and are building new lives in the countries that \nwelcomed them.\n  The theme of World Refugee Day 2011 is ``Real People, Real Needs.'' \nThis theme reminds us that each individual refugee has a story to tell. \nEvery refugee has experienced persecution, causing him or her to flee a \nhome, a community, and a nation, because the circumstances are so dire \nthat flight is the only option. Conflicts around the world are \ndisplacing persons, such that the United Nations High Commissioner for \nRefugees now counts over 43 million persons who have been forced from \ntheir homes, which include refugees, internally displaced, and \nstateless persons. For many of the world's 15.4 million refugees, \nresettlement is the only hope they have of rebuilding a stable life and \nhome.\n  The United States has long been committed to resettling refugees, but \nour resettlement program was strengthened by the enactment of the 1980 \nRefugee Act. Over the past 30 years, more than 2.6 million refugees and \nasylum seekers have found safety in the United States. And since 1989, \nalmost 5,600 refugees have been resettled in my home State of Vermont. \nWe are fortunate to have the Vermont Refugee Resettlement Program, with \nits decades of experience and award-winning volunteer program, leading \nthis effort. Over the last 5 years, many of these new Vermonters have \ncome from Bhutan, Burma, and the Congo. Their culture is enriching my \nhistorically Anglo Saxon and French Canadian State.\n  Throughout this challenging time, I have remained proud of the role \nthat our Nation plays in protecting refugees abroad and in helping many \nresettle in the United States. In a time of tight budgets, I was \npleased to be able to protect funding for refugee assistance and \nresettlement programs in the fiscal year 2011 appropriations continuing \nresolution, when many other programs were cut.\n  The United States is a leader in international refugee protection. I \nam proud of that commitment and will work to ensure our government \nmaintains this strong financial and political support. There is more \nthat we can do, however.\n  I regret that the United States is not in full compliance with its \nobligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention. Changes to the law and a \nhandful of court opinions issued in recent years have eroded \nprotections for some of the most vulnerable asylum seekers.\n  Last week, I reintroduced the Refugee Protection Act, S. 1202, to \nrestore the legal foundation of the United States for protection of \nrefugees and asylum seekers. The Refugee Protection Act will correct \nserious shortcomings in current law, such as the overly broad \ndefinition of material support for terrorist groups.\n  The Refugee Protection Act does not diminish the rigor of security \nand background checks of incoming refugees, but it recognizes that the \ncurrent law sweeps in a large number of persons who were victims of \npersecution at the hands of terrorist organizations, not supporters of \nthose terrorist groups.\n  The Refugee Protection Act also repeals the 1-year filing deadline \nfor asylum seekers in the United States. This deadline was unnecessary \nwhen it was added to the law in 1996 and remains unnecessary now.\n  Under court decisions interpreting our law, certain groups of asylum \nseekers can face improperly high barriers to protection. For example, \nthe Board of Immigration Appeals has required seekers who base a claim \non persecution of their social group to show that the group is \n``socially visible.'' This requirement is not a part of the statute or \nimplementing regulations. Moreover, it is unnecessarily onerous for \ncertain groups who take great pains to conceal their membership in the \nsocial group. For example, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgendered \nindividuals from certain countries may have to hide their identity to \navoid physical attacks or extreme social isolation. Women from certain \ncultures must conceal that they have not been forcibly circumcised or \nface the threat that tribal leaders will subject them to this violent \nand dangerous practice.\n  Our law grants asylum to those who have experienced persecution or \nhave a well-founded fear of future persecution. Therefore, courts \nshould not require these individuals to risk serious harm by exposing \ntheir membership in the persecuted social group in the home nation. \nSocial visibility may be a factor in some cases, but must not be a \nbaseline requirement to prevail on an asylum claim.\n  I thank Senators Levin, Akaka, and Durbin for their support of the \nRefugee Protection Act of 2011. I also thank Representative Zoe Lofgren \nfor introducing a companion bill, H.R. 2185, in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I hope that on World Refugee Day others will join us in helping to \nreform our domestic laws to help the victims of persecution worldwide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/20/senate-section/article/S3913-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LUKAS ROBERT CORWIN\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

We \nreceived the joyous news that a great-grandson, Lukas Robert Corwin, \nhad been born in Riley Hospital for Children, Indianapolis, IN. I was \nprivileged to visit Lukas early in the morning on the next day and to \ncongratulate his proud parents, Jonathan and Christie Corwin.\n  At that time, we had been informed that Lukas would require heart \nsurgery in a few weeks and would probably remain in the hospital until \nthe date of surgery. Suddenly, just 2 weeks after his birth, it was \napparent that Lukas could barely breathe and that his heart rate had \ndropped into the 40s. His evening nurse performed oral care. Dr. \nTurrentine determined that the surgery must occur immediately and we \nprayed as Jonathan and Christie accompanied Lukas to the surgical area \nwith the support of Ariana, Christie's favorite nurse, Chrissy, Lukas' \nevening nurse, Andrew, a medical student, Abby, another nurse, and Dr. \nTurrentine.\n  These remarkable medical heroes for the next few hours performed \nmiraculous procedures that brought the ordeal of Lukas to a very \nsuccessful conclusion. I salute all of the life saving procedures and \nthe gifted persons who were able to use them so well in truly saving \nthe life of a beautiful little boy. Our prayers are now with Lukas, his \nparents, grandparents, and the dedicated teams of life saving persons \nat Riley Hospital.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/20/senate-section/article/S3913-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3913-S3914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GERRY COUNIHAN\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

After this senseless act of violence, he was told by his \ndoctors that he may never walk again.\n  But Gerry has never taken no for an answer.\n  After months in the hospital and grueling rehabilitation, Gerry \nreturned to the Capitol, eventually taking a job as an elevator \noperator.\n  Again, Gerry impressed all of us in the Senate with his dedication \nand his generous spirit.\n  Gerry will soon begin a job at the Department of Health and Human \nServices.

Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in paying tribute to Laura Ellen Ziskin, one of Hollywood's most \ninfluential film producers, activists, and philanthropists. Laura \nZiskin passed away on June 12, 2011, at her home in Santa Monica, CA, \nafter a 7-year battle with cancer. She was 61 years old.\n  A native of the San Fernando Valley, Laura Ziskin was born on March \n3, 1950, to Mae and Jay Ziskin. In 1973, Ziskin graduated from the \nUniversity of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts and began \nworking in the entertainment industry first as a game show writer, and \nthen as a personal assistant to producer and director Jon Peters, with \nwhom she would work on the 1976 Barbra Streisand remake of ``A Star Is \nBorn.''\n  Over the next three decades, Laura Ziskin became one of the world's \nmost successful female producers. Ziskin's fame quickly grew with her \nproduction of 1985's ``Murphy's Romance,'' 1988's ``D.O.A.,'' 1990's \nmegahit ``Pretty Woman,'' and 1991's ``What About Bob?'' Ziskins films \nwere both critically acclaimed and well received, with ``As Good As It \nGets,'' 1997, ``The Thin Red Line,'' 1998, ``Fight Club,'' 1999, and \nthe recent blockbuster Spider-Man films. In 2002, Laura Ziskin would \nalso become the first woman to ever produce the Academy Awards--again \nrepeating the feat in 2007.\n  Laura Ziskin devoted her time and celebrity to improving the lives of \nothers. She gave her support by serving on the boards of organizations \nsuch as the National Council of Jewish Women and Education First and \nwas honored by many others, such as the Big Sisters of Los Angeles, the \nWomen's Image Network Award, the Producers Guild of America, City of \nHope, and her own alma mater, USC's School of Cinematic Arts. I was \nalso proud to present her with a ``Woman Making History'' Award for her \nwonderful work.\n  When Ziskin was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004, she immediately \nbecame heavily involved in creating a new model for cancer research. In \n2008, she founded the nonprofit Stand Up To Cancer, SU2C, in \ncollaboration with friends and colleagues, Katie Couric and Sherry \nLansing and the Entertainment Industry Foundation, among others. Ziskin \nused her film production skills to be a driving force for raising funds \nfor cancer research and support services, including by producing \ntelevision specials in 2008 and 2010 that aired on major international \nnetworks.\n  Throughout her illness, Laura never quit either her professional or \ncharitable work. She touched the lives of countless individuals and \nfamilies who struggle with cancer by giving them hope that one day, \nthere will be a cure. In one of her last blog postings, she urged \nothers to take a stand. She wrote, ``Take a stand--for yourself, for a \nloved one . . . for anyone in the fight. Let's make everyone diagnosed \nwith cancer a survivor.''\n  Laura Ziskin is survived by her partner, Alvin Sargent, her daughter, \nJulia Barry, and her son-in-law, Eli Dansky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/20/senate-section/article/S3914-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3914]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FIGHTING BLINDNESS\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, for most people, it is a given that \nthey are able to see the many wonderful sights the world has to offer. \nBut in this country, more than 10 million people are affected by \nretinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular \ndegeneration, that result in blindness. These people are being robbed \nof their vision, plain and simple. By 2020, as the population continues \nto age, that number is expected to reach 15 million. These diseases \nmight not attract much attention, but their impact on the lives of our \nfriends, family members, and constituents is significant.\n  Later this month, in Baltimore, MD, the Foundation Fighting \nBlindness, a private nonprofit that has raised more than $425 million \nin research funding, will host its national VISIONS Conference. It will \ngather together visually challenged people from across the United \nStates, as well as eight other countries, along with renowned \nresearchers committed to finding treatments and cures for these \ndiseases and physicians providing patient care.\n  The Foundation will also celebrate its 40th anniversary by looking \nback on four decades of breakthroughs, progress, and hope in the field \nof retinal disease research. There is a lot to celebrate, as recent \nadvances in research, including a number of clinical trials, have given \nnew hope for restoring vision. Results from one breakthrough study \nfunded in part by the Foundation Fighting Blindness show that gene \ntherapy restored vision in patients suffering from a severe retinal \ndisease. In fact, a 9-year-old boy who had lost his vision almost \ncompletely was able to play baseball and read the chalkboard in his \nclass for the first time.\n  This life-changing work is possible thanks to the Foundation Fighting \nBlindness, which, through various fundraising efforts, provides the \ncapital necessary to launch innovative, results-oriented research--the \nkind of research promising enough to draw funding from other sources, \nsuch as the National Eye Institute, one of the National Institutes of \nHealth. Now, as the momentum continues to build, a partnership between \nthe private and public sectors is crucial to eradicating blinding \ndiseases.\n  I congratulate the Foundation Fighting Blindness on its 40th \nanniversary. With the help of this organization and the National Eye \nInstitute, research will continue to flourish until cures are \nrealized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/20/senate-section/article/S3914-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3914-S3915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BOWDLE, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I pay \ntribute to the 125th anniversary of the founding of the city of Bowdle, \nSD. Bowdle, like many of the cities in South Dakota, was founded for \nits position along the railroad tracks.\n  Alex M. Bowdle, an employee for Chicago & Milwaukee Railroad, founded \nBowdle in 1886. He chose the location for its readily available access \nto clean water. This water was essential for the trains to use in their \nboilers, and helped to keep the trains moving on schedule. The water \nalso greatly benefited area farmers who needed it for irrigation of \ntheir crops.\n  Bowdle through the years has continued to be a thriving community. \nTheir commitment to education can be seen in the graduates of the \nBowdle School District. In addition city of Bowdle has many outdoor \nrecreation options including pheasant hunting and the Bowdle Golf Club, \nwhich residents believe is one of the best courses in the State.\n  Bowdle's residents have a strong local community and take pride in \ntheir city. To celebrate the momentous occasion the city is planning to \nhold a street dance with live music, along with many other events to \nbring the surrounding community together to share stories and \nexperiences of the beloved city of Bowdle.\n  I am proud to publicly honor Bowdle on this memorable occasion. Small\n\n[[Page S3915]]\n\ncommunities such as Bowdle are part of the backbone of our great State, \nand help to preserve our rich frontier history and deep-seated \ncharacter.

Bryant is a community-oriented town \nlocated in Hamlin County and will be celebrating its quasquicentennial \nthe weekend of June 24 to 26.\n  Founded in 1887 upon the completion of the Chicago, Milwaukee, and \nSt. Paul railroads, the small town embraced its origins and was named \nafter the local railroad official. Bryant prides itself on its fire \npreparedness and is home to a dedicated volunteer fire department.\n  The importance of community to the town is evident in the presence of \ntheir well-maintained auditorium and parks which host town gatherings, \nbaseball games, dances, craft fairs, and suppers. Bryant will celebrate \nthis milestone with many activities including a car and tractor show, a \nparade, and even fireman's games.\n  South Dakota is built on the values and spirit of small communities \nlike Bryant. It is because of our small tight-knit communities that \nmany choose to call South Dakota home. I congratulate the citizens of \nBryant on their accomplishments over the last 125 years and look \nforward to seeing their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/20/senate-section/article/S3915-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CONDE, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.

Located in Spink County, this small, close-knit \ncommunity will be celebrating its quasquicentennial the weekend of June \n24 to 26.\n  The building of railroad branches in South Dakota by the Chicago and \nNorthwestern Railroad created growth for numerous towns. Amongst the \nnewly established area, the town of Conde was founded in 1886. This \nrailroad town was formerly known as Coral until April 15, 1882. A \nrailroad official's wife selected the name in honor of the Conde family \nof France and the French town of Conde.\n  Conde, SD, ``The Place to Call Home,'' is known for its beautiful \nscenery and outdoor activities. Conde is settled in the rolling Coteau \nHills and is an excellent area for Ring Neck Pheasant and White Tail \nDeer hunting. The city of Conde still has a variety of businesses \nlocated in this community. Conde will commemorate its anniversary with \na weekend of events. The community has planned to host live music \nbands, an all-school reunion, a 5K ``Roll and Stroll'' through the \nbeautiful town of Conde, and plenty of food vendors.\n  Conde exemplifies the hometown community spirit of South Dakota. \nAfter 125 years, the community of Conde is still thriving, and it is my \nhonor to publicly congratulate the citizens of Conde on reaching this \ncommendable milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/20/senate-section/article/S3915-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HECLA, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota.

This small town in Brown County has flourished from its \nhumble pioneer origins to a vibrant South Dakotan community.\n  The completion of the Dakota Central Railroad, known later as the \nChicago Northwestern, breathed life into this region of Brown County, \nand the community of Hecla was born in 1886. The railroad was essential \nto the progress of the town as it provided a means to get supplies, \nexport harvests, and transport mail. Mystery surrounds the naming of \nHecla as the railroad crew decided to name the town after the volcano, \nMt. Hekla, in Iceland for unknown reasons.\n  Today, Hecla is a progressive small town community.

Sam Denton originally surveyed the 190-acre plot overlooking \nthe South Dakota countryside. John A. Edmunds' hardware store was the \nfirst business established in Langford. The store was delivered \nprebuilt as a shanty. The very next day a blacksmith shop was opened \nwith several churches soon to follow.\n  From its earliest days, Langford has been marked by a strong sense of \ncommunity with residents gathering frequently in the Langford Opera \nHouse, now the Legion Hall.

This \nsmall town in Spink County embodies the very values that South Dakota \nwas founded upon.\n  Named after Joseph Turton, one of the town's first settlers from \nEngland, the town was founded in 1886 and formally incorporated in \n1907. Situated along the Groton branch of the Chicago Northwestern \nRailroad, Turton was originally established as a railroad town. The \nrailroad was essential to the development of the vibrant town as it \nprovided necessary supplies and a means to transport goods. Today, \nTurton is best known for their beautiful Catholic church, which was \nbuilt in 1893, and is still in use today.\n  Residents of Turton will kick off the town's quasquicentennial \ncelebration and their annual St. John's Day with the Turton Community \nGolf Tournament, street dances, games, and banquets. To wrap up a fun \nfilled weekend, Turton has planned a Sunday morning mass and breakfast.\n  Small towns like Turton symbolize what it means to be a South Dakotan \ncommunity.

Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record \nthe remarks of my friend Donna Brazile at the 20th anniversary \ncelebration for Teen Voices. Teen Voices is a journalism mentoring and \nleadership development program for teen girls which was founded in \nCambridge, MA, and creates publications which reach hundreds of \nthousands of young women across the world. Donna's words do great \njustice to what a terrific program Teen Voices is as they celebrate an \nimportant milestone, and I believe this occasion deserves special \nrecognition in the Congressional Record.\n\n[[Page S3916]]\n\n  The information follows.\n\n                Remarks of Donna Brazile, April 14, 2011\n\n       Now, Karen, I noticed that as soon as I started speaking \n     you turned the music off. It reminded me of a few weeks ago \n     when I was at the White House--let me start by bringing \n     greetings from President Obama, who's in Chicago tonight. \n     President Obama is having a rally tonight and he wanted to \n     know why I couldn't come to Chicago to introduce him. I said, \n     ``I'm going to be hanging out with Teen Voices and trust me, \n     I want to be in Boston tonight, Mr. President.'' But I was \n     invited a few weeks ago and some of you who are young enough \n     to remember the Motown sounds, the President invited me, and \n     it was one of those weekends when I wanted to see my sisters. \n     I have five sisters. So I said, ``I really need three \n     tickets.'' And he looked at me and said, ``Donna, this is \n     Motown. Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, John Legend, Arthur \n     Rees,'' and the list went on and on and on. So I said, \n     ``Well, alright, then give me four tickets!'' And he said, \n     ``Well I'm only going to give you one ticket. One for \n     yourself, and one for a guest.''\n       Well, I have six sisters. I mean five of us and you know, \n     my brothers. I said, ``Please give me a couple extra \n     tickets.''\n       He said, ``Sorry, you know, we have rules. And you cannot \n     get but one ticket.''\n       So I waited, I called the next week. And they said this was \n     the public liaison office so they gave me one ticket. So I \n     called the political engagement office. I thought, clearly \n     they must have an extra ticket. And they gave me another \n     ticket! So I called my sister, Lisa, and I said, ``Lisa, you \n     can come.'' I already told my older sister she could come. \n     And then I have another sister. She's number--Sheryl, Sheila, \n     Donna--she's number seven! So I said, ``Dmitri, guess what, \n     you can come!'' So there were four Brazile women in the \n     house. So of course, we got there right before the \n     performances. And then they said, ``Well, you all have to go \n     back there.'' And I'm like, ``No, no, no. That's not right. \n     We don't care. Because we're going to dance.'' And of course, \n     they seated us way in the back. But the performers had to \n     come out. So as John Legend came out my sisters were blowing \n     kisses. They didn't want autographs (we're not into \n     autographs from Louisiana). We want hugs. So the Jonas \n     Brothers came out, and I whisper, ``That's Nick Jonas!''\n       ``What! What! My daughter loves him! Hey baby!''\n       I said, ``No, this is the White House, you don't do that. \n     This is a dignified place, this place has been here for 200 \n     years.'' And so the night went on and on. And you know, back \n     in the day, for those of you who are a little young, every \n     time a new song came out--we had to twists and we did the \n     jerks. And then with Jackson 5--I want you back, I want you \n     back. So we knew all of the songs. Well, one song came on and \n     of course, this was a rendition of ``Dancing in the Street'' \n     and my sister decided this was her moment to do a dance that \n     I had never seen. And a dance the Secret Service had never \n     seen. So, the reason why, when the music started playing, I \n     just wanted to give you all a warning, if my sisters were \n     here, they would have come up with a song. So it's now like \n     midnight, and I say ``Girls, the President has gone up. I \n     know Stevie Wonder is still here, but we've got to go home, \n     so come on, let's go.''\n       And my sister goes, ``Ain't no party like a White House \n     party, like a White House party don't stop.''\n       I said, ``Where'd you all get that?'' And then the Marine \n     Band, who knew the Marine band could actually play jazz \n     tunes, and then she's teaching the Marine Band--``Ain't no \n     party like a White House party, like a White House party \n     don't stop.''\n       The next day I saw the President, I was at a meeting and I \n     was trying to pretend I didn't know those women. I said, ``I \n     know Mr. President was taped so hopefully you can edit my \n     sisters out.'' Of course, when it was on PBS, they didn't \n     edit us out. Alright, my sisters--I just wanted to let you \n     all know if you go to the White House and decide to hang out \n     for a party or an event just remember--``Ain't no party like \n     a White House party, like a White House party don't stop.'' \n     But . . . I'm chair of the Democratic Party. My dad is 80 \n     years old. I called him and I said, ``Guess what. I'm chair \n     of the Democratic party, one of the oldest political parties \n     in the country.''\n       He said, ``It's a job.''\n       I said, ``Well, but it doesn't pay.''\n       He said, ``Well, that's like most jobs.''\n       There are some perks and I took advantage of one of them \n     just a night ago. I just want to let everyone know a little \n     bit about it. And you know, some people want a car to drive. \n     Not me. First of all, I want a man dropping me off. So it's \n     bad enough I live one block from the head of the CIA and I \n     have to explain to people who visit me why the cops are \n     outside. I say, ``No, nothing's going on at the house. It's \n     the CI--wait, never mind--it's okay, just come on in, it's \n     alright.'' So no, I don't want a car to drive. That's too \n     tacky, that's not me. I mean, I'm a girl from New Orleans. I \n     can roll.\n       So they say, ``Well, do you want a phone?''\n       I mean, well, I worked for Al Gore. He created the \n     Internet; of course I want a phone. ``So what do you have?''\n       ``AT''\n       ``No, no, no. Dropped service. I'll stick with Verizon.'' \n     And so they start listing all these other things, and I say \n     no letterhead, no business card, no office, no secretary, no \n     assistant.\n       They say, ``Donna, what do you want?''\n       I say, ``I hear you have tickets for the Easter egg roll.'' \n     And, I want to tell you this story because when I worked for \n     Bill Clinton and Al Gore back in the 1990s, I was involved \n     with the inaugural as well as the campaign. I went into the \n     office one day and they said, ``Donna, what do you want?''\n       I said, ``All of the leftover tickets.'' Some people didn't \n     make it; they didn't sell all the seats, and so on. So here \n     you have rows of all the dignitaries all in the diplomatic \n     core, all these people from the government, all these people \n     looking good. And then you have rows of little kids. Rows and \n     rows. And that was me. I said, ``Absolutely. I'm going across \n     the bridge to Southeast, Washington D.C., and I am going to \n     give tickets out to kids, who like myself, their parents are \n     not rich. They don't have connections. But one day, one of \n     these kids, one, maybe one, will grow up and become President \n     of the United States.'' And I want to say that I gave them a \n     ticket. I gave them an opportunity. So when President Obama \n     won, and you all know I'm one for tickets--This is not my \n     speech, I'm going to get to my speech. But I just wanted to \n     let everyone know how I roll.\n       And so, this is why, at my age of 51, I have 300 children, \n     don't ask me how I did it. I did it, I got 300, they are \n     really well taken care of, different daddies; it's a long \n     story. But when you've worked on as many campaigns--Karen \n     mentioned my 7 presidential, my 58 congressional, and my 19 \n     state and local campaigns, I worked on campaigns in 48 \n     states. I've lived here twice in my life, 2 more states and I \n     will become Miss USA. I've done a lot of work in my life, \n     okay? I mean, I've worked in Alaska, I was up there. I was in \n     Juneau. I've been to Utah, I've seen the mountains. So I've \n     been all over the place, but I still keep it real. I'm still \n     that little girl, that little girl who grew up poor. To a \n     mother who was a maid, a father who was a janitor. And I was \n     proud of my parents, my parents worked very hard. They wanted \n     us to have everything; they wanted us to have the best of \n     life. Sometimes, they couldn't afford it. But often times, \n     they would put a little away. That's why I tell people I can \n     wait. My mother used to say, ``It's a little away. How fast \n     you need it?''\n       ``Tomorrow.''\n       ``Oh, no, no, no. How fast you need it?''\n       I'd say, ``Okay, next month.''\n       She'd say, ``Oh, I'll get it out by next month, don't \n     worry.'' And then, my mother, or my father, would go out and \n     work an additional job or longer hours so that we could get \n     what we needed in order to be the people that we are, or the \n     kids that we wanted to be, the grown-ups that we wanted to be \n     as well.\n       But, I would get my tickets, so my kids would come in, and \n     I'd say, ``Hey B.'' And by the way, I used to carry a big \n     purse. Whenever you see my carrying a big purse, I'm coming \n     after some tickets. That's not a bag, that's a ticket basket. \n     And I would walk into (something?) headquarters--you heard \n     the song ``Ain't too proud of the bag.'' I need it for my \n     kids. So I had 700 tickets from the President, and let me \n     tell you, everybody, every dignitary was hitting me up. \n     They'd say, ``Donna, got tickets?''\n       I'd say, ``No I don't.''\n       Ohhh she's lying! And then I learned how to, for my purple \n     ticket, oh so you want my purple give me 2 of your golds! \n     Why! Because my purple ticket gets you up front but you give \n     me 2 so think about it! I would get those big tickets so I \n     could get 5 smaller tickets so I could get more people in. \n     All I cared about was getting more people in. So I thought \n     about it the other day, because I'm always into tickets. I'm \n     a ticket person--so I said, ``How many tickets can I get as \n     the chair of the Democratic Party? I need my tickets.'' And \n     then I learned I got 10 tickets, I thought, oh thank you, \n     Lord, I got 10. Now you all know I'm starting at 10. Watch \n     me. Now the chair gets 10, how many does the Vice Chair get? \n     I'm still Vice Chair!\n       And then I'm going to call my congresswoman, and then I'm \n     going to call the congress people from Alaska. Nobody's \n     coming here for an Easter egg hunt. And Washington State; and \n     you know you can always hit up California; you know I'm going \n     to hit up Kansas. I can't hit up Hawaii because that's where \n     the President is from. But I'm going to get my tickets and \n     you know, I'm giving them to the kids, like myself, kids who \n     have grown up poor, kids who need to be able, because they \n     live in Washington, D.C., to say that ``I went to the White \n     House. I was at the White House and I saw the President, I \n     saw the First Lady, I saw his two little daughters, and I met \n     Bo.'' That's the dog, for those of you who don't know.\n       But I'm honored to be here with you, I had to tell my \n     tickets stories. Everyone who knows me back in DC calls me \n     the ticket lady. And I love tickets--not parking tickets--but \n     tickets. But it is an honor to join you tonight as you \n     celebrate 20 years. I've had some time to read up on Jenny \n     and all of the work that you all have done and have committed \n     to do. You are an inspiration. You have empowered millions of \n     young girls who not only read your magazine but those who \n     also contribute to it and those who want to be a part of it. \n     You are a source of inspiration and extortion of empowerment \n     and I want to thank the Board. I'd like to thank Lisa. I'd \n     like to thank all the sponsors and of\n\n[[Page S3917]]\n\n     course Denise and Seema. And yeah, I've been checking out \n     your shoes. They come in size 11, baby?\n       But I also want to thank you for helping young girls find \n     their voices and helping them amplify their message and \n     lifting them up. Your message is one of hope and change. I \n     want to say, I remember what it's like to be young--it was \n     just 2 weeks ago--the grey hair may throw you off a little \n     bit, but the truth is, I'm still 15 at heart. Now, notice I \n     said 15, not 18. Fifteen not 13. Because, I believe at 15, I \n     had a life-changing, what I call, experience.\n       My grandmother, who took time to raise most of us, because \n     my parents were busy working, she got sick that year. And \n     throughout our childhood, Grandma was the rock; she was the \n     foundation in our house. My grandmother was from Mississippi. \n     She was the daughter of former slaves. And though she had \n     lived to see so many changes take place in her lifetime, she \n     had 12 kids. In fact, my daddy was number 12. My grandmother \n     had my father when at the age of 48--yeah I guess that's made \n     him the way he is.\n       But my grandmother, in my judgment, was my role model. She \n     was my rock. She was my inspiration. I wanted to be just like \n     Ramon, because she knew everything. I would get up in the \n     morning at 4 o'clock--``Ramon, what are you doing?''\n       She'd say, ``I'm soaking the clothes.''\n       ``Well, okay.''\n       ``We going to go hang them up outside.''\n       ``Well, okay.'' I did that. At 5:30, she was in the kitchen \n     making buttermilk biscuits. As you can tell, I ate a couple \n     of them. They were the best buttermilk biscuits in the world. \n     She made her biscuits from scratch. But by 7:00, before we \n     went off for school, Ramon told me that I had to read the \n     newspaper with her. Her eyesight was failing. So I would read \n     the newspaper, from front to back. The classified section, \n     the sports section, and of course, I read the opinion \n     columns. I was excited to know what was going on in the world \n     and Grandma even taught me how to read the comics, and of \n     course, her horoscope--every day.\n       But when Ramon took sick, it really changed my life. All of \n     a sudden, I had to grow up. All of a sudden, I had to learn \n     how to take care of her. Along with two of my other siblings, \n     we took turns watching over her, bringing her soup, bringing \n     her water, helping her get up, and of course, helping her put \n     on her petticoat and slippers so that she could sit in her \n     rocking chair. A few months before we were to return back to \n     school, Ramon took a turn for the worst. And my mother and \n     father sat down along with Dr. Beam and said ``Ramon Frances \n     has to go into a nursing home. We can't afford to take care \n     of her--you're going back to school, and she will need \n     help.'' And so I talked to my baby sister, Lisa, and I said, \n     ``Lisa, you like to comb hair. I can help bathe her. Sheryl \n     can make sure that her clothes--my grandmother liked all her \n     clothes ironed, we could not just put on anything. After all, \n     she did make our slips.'' She made everything but our \n     underwear.\n       She was the most important person in my life because she \n     taught me responsibility at a very young age. But, she also \n     taught me to pursue my dreams, and not to be afraid of what \n     was out of our homes. Ramon was one who believed in the \n     future; she was one who taught us not to be fearful of \n     anyone. One of the best pieces of advice I've ever received, \n     and God knows if it comes in handy now, is she said, ``Donna, \n     it's not what they call you. It's what you answer to.'' And \n     so, as a cable call girl on CNN, when they call, I go! I got \n     called last night--MSNBC--for three weeks, I can go on MSNBC \n     and Fox, so I'm having fun. Anderson called me last night, \n     ``I miss you!''\n       ``Baby, I know you're my boo, but I'm going to see what's \n     going on at MSNBC and Lawrence O'Donnell and Debbi Gregrory, \n     and George Will-Karen.'' I told George the other day, ``I \n     wanna see you in jeans before you retire.'' I want to tell \n     you all something about conservative men. If any of you all \n     are in the room, I know your secret--it is Victoria, it's \n     out. George Will, George Will has a soft spot. His soft spot \n     is that he is really a baseball fan, he loves sports. And \n     George Will loves anyone who knows sports. And so I often \n     bring in my baseball metaphors and my football metaphors and \n     that's how I get George to really warm up to me. And then I \n     do my zingas.\n       But my grandmother taught me another important lesson. And \n     at a very early age, she taught me that lesson. She taught me \n     to listen. She taught me to listen to what other people were \n     saying. So I know what it's like to grow up in a household \n     where people don't talk to you, or listen to you. I know what \n     it's like to grow up and not know what it is you wish to do \n     with your life. I know what it's like to be silenced, even \n     when I'm screaming my head off sometimes to get people to \n     listen--I know what it's like to have people think that you \n     have nothing to say. And I know what it's like, because I \n     experienced it also as a child growing up down in the \n     segregated deep South.\n       I can remember when I was often the youngest person because \n     I was so active in politics back in my native state of \n     Louisiana. So often they would invite young people in the \n     room just so the picture would look right but they really \n     didn't want us to say a word. They didn't want us to even \n     give our input. And it used to drive me crazy when I was \n     growing up, to just be out in the world not knowing if I \n     could make a difference, not knowing what the sound of my \n     voice would do if I was able to contribute. But it was my \n     grandmother who kept pushing me and others out the door. And \n     she gave me all of the courage I needed to go out there and \n     to try to make change in the world.\n       So I want to first of all say to all the teens in the room, \n     and those who still, like myself, are young at heart--you \n     have so much to give. The world is waiting for you. The world \n     needs you. And why you? Because there's no one better. And \n     why now? Because tomorrow is not soon enough. This is your \n     moment. This is your time. This is a time that not only can \n     you find your voice but you can find it in ways that will \n     allow you to soar and to make a difference.\n       I didn't wait until I was 18 before I decided to find my \n     voice. I started writing poems at an early age hoping that \n     someone would discover me. Perhaps I didn't know the rhymes \n     at the time but I had a story, I had something to say and I \n     wanted to share it. I wanted someone to listen to me. Then \n     again, my mother bought a tape recorder one year for \n     Christmas. She said, ``What do you want Donna?'' I said, \n     ``Donna wants a tape recorder.'' And so my nickname became \n     ``Tape Recorder.'' And I recorded every conversation and then \n     I put music to it and made it a soap opera for everyone to \n     listen to.\n       And so I wanted to be in the world, I wanted my voice \n     heard. And so this is your moment to begin the dream about \n     your future. And what kind of future are you looking to have? \n     And what do you want to do with your life?\n       You have to begin thinking about all of these questions \n     early because the world is not going to wait for you to catch \n     up with it. You have to begin to hurry history and catch up \n     with the world, especially now with all of the technology at \n     our disposal. We can talk to someone on Skype all the way \n     across the world. We can text right now and reach out to \n     people standing in line waiting for a (something). And yes, \n     we can find out with our own Twitter accounts and Facebook \n     that we can be part of a revolution taking place thousands \n     and thousands of miles away from here. So you are the future, \n     and it's time that you learn that ``the future belongs to \n     those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.'' The First \n     Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, when she said that, she could not \n     envision that we would live to see so many changes in this \n     country, yet we still have a long way to go.\n       So I want to leave you with some ingredients, and I want to \n     pour them into you right now. Because this is the moment for \n     you, many of you, who are ready to enter the world, ready to \n     make a difference, ready to use your voice, out there to try \n     to stir things up. When I was a young girl, I used to tell my \n     grandmother, ``Ramon, I want to be like Harriet Tubman.'' \n     Harriet Tubman was one of my favorites. I figured anyone who \n     ran away from slavery was a good role model to have.\n       So I said to Ramon I wanted to be a leader. I wanted to be \n     a leader like Harriet Tubman. So some of you are probably \n     thinking, ``Wow, how can I become a leader?'' So this is what \n     I knew about being a leader. A leader is defined as someone \n     who is in command, as someone who guides, a person in a \n     position of influence or importance, a role model. Now let me \n     say, I'm a leader. Not only am I elected to an office that \n     allows me to help guide the oldest political party in the \n     country, I'm also a party leader that helps devise political \n     strategy, a campaign consultant who has also helped to \n     organize and manage campaigns at every level. But I'm also an \n     owner of a small business that employs staff, consultants, \n     and interns, I also teach at a major college. So the \n     foundation of good leadership is being honest and fair. A \n     leader is someone who listens as well as asks questions. A \n     leader has courage and a leader treats others with respect \n     and dignity. A leader admits to mistakes and takes \n     responsibility for his or her actions. And a leader has \n     integrity and can be trusted. A leader also inspires and \n     motivates others to take action in the pursuit of the common \n     good. Now, there are more traits; leaders are often problem-\n     solvers because they seek solutions and leaders are also \n     visionaries because they help to set long-term goals.\n       So it's important to learn how to use your voice to become \n     a leader, and that you begin to see yourself as a leader and \n     as someone who can become successful because you are \n     important and because we need you. We need more young women, \n     more young women willing to serve in public office. We need \n     more young women willing to write news articles, tweet, \n     posting blogs and stories on Facebook, and not just that \n     stuff that makes your friends happy. But the stuff that can \n     really make other people think. And so, here are my other \n     ingredients.\n       Believe in the power of your dreams. If you don't, no one \n     else will.\n       Second, be true to yourself. I've done a lot in my life \n     because someone else wanted me to do it or I thought about \n     it. Sometimes it turned out well, sometimes of course it \n     hasn't, but I have never ever given up on any of my dreams. I \n     keep working toward them. And when I finished writing that \n     first book, I will see a minority or woman as president and \n     four years later, we have our first bi-racial president. And \n     if I continue to work hard, one day, you all will be invited \n     to the White House as we inaugurate our first female \n     president, or Hispanic, Asian-American, person of color, and \n     so on.\n       So you have to live your dreams, you just can't dream and \n     then walk out of the room and expect someone to stir up all \n     the ingredients. You gotta go into the arena and stir\n\n[[Page S3918]]\n\n     it up. Sometimes, you have to bring your own pot and \n     sometimes you have to bring your own fire. It's called \n     Tabasco, for those of you who don't know.\n       Number three: Never accept no as a final answer. I've been \n     told ``no, no, no;'' I know ``no'' in just about every \n     language. I often tell people after they say no, ``That's a \n     yes, isn't it?'' Nah, figure out a way. Go around it, go \n     beneath it, go above it, go below it, just find a way. Find a \n     way, find a path. If you really want to do something, go for \n     it. You can't stop at no. A friend used to tell me that no is \n     just a prelude to yes. Now, when I hear no, I think ``Good, \n     now I'm just one step closer to yes.''\n       Now number four: When you stumble get back up. I have \n     stumbled a lot. My knees are good, my elbows are even better, \n     sometimes I've had to work my way up, because I've had some \n     hits. I have fallen. But you get back up, it's as simple as \n     that. You're gonna fall, you're gonna fail, you're gonna make \n     mistakes, people will not always listen to you--I've got \n     three minutes left, I am not Baptist--I am Catholic; I need \n     five, and Ill wrap it up in four.\n       Number five: Keep a little spice handy. Life gets boring. \n     It is really boring sometimes. But never be afraid to spice \n     it up. Were all unique, no two of us are exactly alike--but \n     think about your limits. And then push them a bit. What makes \n     you uncomfortable? Sometimes you gotta know that so you can \n     just add those missing ingredients that might give you some \n     spice. For me, I was scared of horses. I had to spice up my \n     life and I had to ask myself--why? What's keeping me from \n     embracing something that I'm scared of? It was fear. Took me \n     until I was in my mid-40s, but I conquered that fear. I had \n     that horse following me, and I didn't even have an apple.\n       And let me tell you number six. Courage isn't the absence \n     of fear; courage is facing your fear and overcoming it. \n     Sometimes, you know what you're scared of before you even \n     know what you like! Don't let your fears stand in the way of \n     your success.\n       And then there's number seven. This is about faith. Because \n     when I was a little girl I had so many people invest what I \n     would call and consider now a lot of energy into me. They'd \n     say, ``Donna, you gotta do this.'' I'd respond, ``Okay!'' \n     They'd say, ``Donna, can you make this happen?'' I'd say, \n     ``Yes!'' And they would run off, and I'd be thinking----AHH! \n     I would freak. But I remember when Dr. Martin Luther King, \n     who inspired me as a little girl, said ``Faith is taking one \n     step, even when you cannot see the entire staircase.'' And \n     for me, I often have to just take that one step, and then it \n     comes right there. It just, it appears.\n       And Mrs. King, his wife, I was just over 21 when I met her \n     and worked for her as a young girl. And Mrs. King said, \n     ``Donna, we want to make the birthday a national holiday.'' \n     And I said, ``Okay!'' Everybody else, from the time Dr. King \n     died in 1968 'til 1981, they just said, ``We'll, maybe,'' and \n     then Ronald Reagan was elected and they'd say, ``Well that'll \n     never happen.'' And a bunch of us, we were all young, were \n     just out of college, we said, ``We have time.'' We'll do \n     it.'' And within 18 months, we had a holiday because we had \n     faith.\n       And so, let me close up a little bit by saying that I \n     learned growing up, with a large family, with brothers and \n     sisters, with parents, grandparents and others, with \n     neighbors who loved us, and with friends who would always \n     stand by our side--I learned that I could really go to the \n     next step. That I could move beyond the limitations placed on \n     me simply because of where I was born. I knew that when I was \n     a kid that no matter what people said about my skin color, \n     what they said about my hair, what my sisters continue to say \n     about my hair. I'm like, ``Will you all stop?'' They say, \n     ``Donna, it looked like (something) last night.'' And I say, \n     ``Your TV, maybe you should get HDTV. Maybe you should get \n     rid of that box.'' But I know they're telling me with love to \n     get myself to the beauty parlor. But I learned as a little \n     kid, it's not what people say, and it's not what people see \n     about you. My grandmother was right. It's what you believe \n     in. It's not what they call you, it's what you answer to.\n       So let me close with a poem that continues to inspire me \n     every time I read it. It's Maya Angelou, called ``Still I \n     Rise.'' And I close with her words:\n\n     You may write me down in history\n     With your bitter, twisted lies,\n     You may trod me in the very dirt\n     But still, like dust, I'll rise . . .\n     Out of the huts of history's shame\n     I rise\n     Up from a past that's rooted in pain\n     I rise\n     I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,\n     Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.\n     Leaving behind nights of terror and fear\n     I rise\n     Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear\n     I rise\n     Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,\n     I am the dream and the hope of the slave.\n     I rise\n     I rise\n     I rise.\n\n       To my friends, to the young ladies, to the sponsors, to all \n     the supporters of this great organization, it's now your turn \n     to let these young women rise, to give them the wings that \n     they need so that they will soar and make a difference. To \n     rise up to your full potential, to rise until you feel the \n     air surrounding you. Rise up, rise high, and make us all \n     proud. Thank you and God bless \n     you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/20/senate-section/article/S3918-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3918-S3919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               WDEV RADIO\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as one born in Montpelier, VT, I \ngrew up listening to WDEV in Waterbury. My mother and father were \nfriends of the owners of the station and I still remember days as a \nchild going to visit.\n  Living now in Middlesex, VT, I--like everyone else in our area listen \nto WDEV to find out what is happening throughout central Vermont. At a \ntime when more and more radio stations nationwide go to a canned \nformat, WDEV is one that has not forgotten over the decades that it is \na mainstay of the community.\n  Recently when we were facing horrible flooding and storms in Vermont, \nthe lifeline for all of us was WDEV. Only there could we find out what \nwas happening on the weather, what was happening on road conditions, \nand what we would face. Stefan Hard of the Times Argus wrote an \nexcellent story about Chris Bouchard and Roger Hill and what they did \nto keep us all safe and informed. I talked with my friend Ken Sauier, \nabout what they had done and said I intended to speak on the Senate \nFloor, and now, Mr. President, I ask that the article by Stephan Hard \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                  [From the Times Argus, June 6, 2011]\n\n                             Storm-Centered\n\n                            (By Stefan Hard)\n\n       For weather forecasters Chris Bouchard and Roger Hill, who \n     were on duty May 27, the historic storms of that day quickly \n     pushed their workdays into overdrive and overtime and gave \n     them a first-hand taste of the crazy weather they were \n     reporting on. Looking back, they are both in awe at the level \n     of destruction caused by the storms' related flooding, but \n     are grateful that no one was killed.\n       Hill prepares forecasts for Radio Vermont, WDEV, for \n     utility companies, and for his WeatheringHeights.com website; \n     Bouchard is a staff meteorologist at the Fairbanks Museums \n     Eye on the Sky forecast center.\n       Both men knew from early in the day, May 27, that the \n     weather could be turning severe.\n       ``It was clear to us for several days that there was a \n     possibility for severe weather on Thursday-Friday,'' said \n     Bouchard. ``On the day of the event in the morning, it looked \n     pretty clear that we were going to get supercell \n     thunderstorms, large hail, damaging winds and possibly even \n     tornadoes.'' Bouchard reported as such during his 12:55 p.m. \n     weather report on Vermont Public Radio. The first supercell \n     of the day passed just north of Burlington at about 3p.m. and \n     left large hail on the ground as it passed over Lowell. \n     Bouchard continued his warnings through the afternoon.\n       By 6:30 p.m., storms were beginning to hit central Vermont, \n     and power was knocked out at Hill's home and forecast center \n     in Worcester. Hearing tornado warnings on the radio for \n     Caledonia County and without power to run his phalanx of \n     computers, Hill decided to head to the WDEV studios in \n     Waterbury, where the station had back-up power and where Hill \n     could get his own evaluations and warnings directly on the \n     air in the midst of what he had already determined could be \n     life-threatening conditions due to the continued risk of \n     tornadoes, dangerous lightning, and with already-saturated \n     ground from recent rains, a real possibility of catastrophic \n     flash floods. He hopped in his car and headed for Waterbury.\n       ``I felt a need and a responsibility to do this,'' said \n     Hill. ``I've haven't had anybody die on my watch and I didn't \n     want that to happen this time,'' he said.\n       Hill forgot to take his cell phone charger and didn't leave \n     a note for his wife, Michelle, as to where he was going. ``My \n     wife is very upset with me,'' he said. ``She didn't know \n     where I was until she heard me on the air.''\n       Driving through Middlesex, Hill encountered a downed tree \n     across the road and had to reroute and rain and hail fell and \n     tornado warnings continued come across on the crackling \n     radio. When he got to the station offices in Waterbury, the \n     door was locked (after business hours) and his cell battery \n     was dead, so he couldn't call on-air host Lee Kittell to let \n     him inside, and Kittell was unable to check and see emails \n     that Hill was sending from his netbook, which still had a \n     charge. Kittell was very busy and lightning temporarily \n     knocked out the station's computer system. Hill resorted to \n     running down the street to use the phone at a convenience \n     store to call Kittell to let him in. Once inside, Hill and \n     Kittell reported on the storm continuously, except for a \n     half-hour break for the audio track of WCAX-TV news at 11, \n     until 1:45 a.m.\n       Callers kept the phone lines lit up all evening with \n     reports of continuous lightning, ball lightning, hail the \n     size of golf balls, trees down, power outages, and worst of \n     all, flash flooding in Barre and Montpelier. Hill, stunned, \n     kept seeing a line of ``training echo'' thunderstorms \n     streaming\n\n[[Page S3919]]\n\n     into central Vermont all night and his on-air voice became \n     increasingly ominous.\n       ``I felt stupid, but I got to the point where I was just \n     saying, Oh, my God!''\n       Meanwhile, Bouchard had finished his forecasting shift at \n     the Fairbanks Museum in St. Johnsbury, and had taken to the \n     road, storm chasing, and didn't have the need to let anyone \n     know where he was going. ``I went to Barnet, because that's \n     where it looked like the action was going to be,'' he said. \n     Bouchard stopped in several locations, setting up his tripod \n     just outside his car to get pictures of clouds that might \n     produce tornadoes, and lots of lightning. Bouchard said at \n     one point, he grabbed his tripod and camera and jumped in his \n     car just as lightning bolts crashed to the ground \n     uncomfortably close. Bouchard never saw a tornado, and none \n     were confirmed from that storm outbreak, but he got some \n     striking lighting photos, some of those will part of a show \n     of 32 of his best lightning images at the Fairbanks Museum at \n     the end of the month.\n       Hill, his cell battery dead, his netbook battery now dead, \n     and his own batteries running low, headed home from WDEV at \n     about 2 a.m. after receiving, along with Kittell, countless \n     calls from listeners praising the duo for staying on the air \n     with information. Of course, on his way home, Hill couldn't \n     update his wife on his progress through the continuing \n     storms, so, when he finally made it home, he faced a storm of \n     another kind.\n       Happily, Hill and his wife, Michelle on Sunday were \n     beginning a belated celebration of their 25th wedding \n     anniversary, taking a few days off, including a little \n     travel. Hill has planned a small detour in their travels to \n     see, first-hand, the level of destruction in Springfield, \n     Mass., where, last week, two tornadoes struck in another \n     example of powerful, training echo thunderstorms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/20/senate-section/article/S3919-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NICHOLAS MAXIM\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, Mahatma Gandhi once said, ``Strength \ndoes not come from physical capacity, it comes from an indomitable \nwill.'' Today, I recognize and pay tribute to Nicholas Maxim, an \nextraordinary young man from Readfield, ME, and the living embodiment \nof Gandhi's words. Nicholas, a fifth grade student at Readfield \nElementary School, was recently presented with a national award for his \noutstanding penmanship. He earned the award when, unbeknownst to him, \nhis principal submitted a sample of his handwriting to Zaner-Bloser, an \nOhio-based company that holds an annual handwriting contest.\n  While this national honor would, in and of itself, merit the high \npraise and recognition of this esteemed institution, this \naccomplishment is even more compelling and impressive when one \nconsiders that Nicholas was born without lower arms or hands. His \nwriting sample, which stood out among the estimated 200,000 entries, \nwas executed by balancing the writing utensil between his two upper \narms--the manner in which he routinely writes, given that he rarely \nuses his prosthetic devices for such purposes.\n  Nicholas' sample was so outstanding, and his story so compelling and \ninspirational, that Zaner-Bloser created a new award category in his \nhonor--the ``Nicholas Maxim Special Award for Excellent Penmanship.'' \nFittingly, Nicholas was the first recipient of this special award \nearlier this year. His story caught the attention of many of the \nnational media outlets but, despite all the attention and accolades, \nNicholas retained his humility and unassuming style. Preferring to stay \nout of the limelight and seemingly content to allow others to talk \nabout his myriad accomplishments, Nicholas represents Maine and our \nNation with unwavering modesty that speaks volumes about his character \nand personality.\n  During my congressional career, I have often spoken about the primacy \nof maintaining one's values and integrity, setting high expectations \nand goals, and believing in one's self. I further contend that there \nare certain constants that are timeless, and one of them is that the \ngreatest limits that will be placed on our lives are the ones which we \nplace upon ourselves. A courageous and persistent young man, Nicholas \nis truly an inspiration to us all, as he has never allowed his \ncircumstances to limit what he can achieve. As a testament to this \nfact, one of Nicholas' favorite pastimes is writing and drawing comic \nstrips. Delightful and humble, Nicholas innately possesses an \nunconquerable resolve that is hidden beneath an unpretentious exterior. \nHis sister captured the essence of these character traits when, to the \nKennebec Journal, she said about him, ``He is who he is and does what \nhe does not to get attention . . . It's for me to see him being who he \nis that's an inspiration.''\n  Undeniably, Nicholas Maxim stands as a shining testament to the power \nof the human spirit. I offer my heartfelt congratulations to him for \ndemonstrating to children and adults alike, across the State of Maine \nand, indeed, our Nation, that by placing no restrictions on your \nhorizons, you broaden the range of possibilities that exist for you and \nthe trajectory you envision for yourself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/20/senate-section/article/S3919-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3919]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                COMMUNITY FOUNDATION OF NORTH LOUISIANA\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the Community \nFoundation of North Louisiana on the occasion of its 50th anniversary \non June 26, 2011.\n  The Community Foundation of North Louisiana has had a widespread \nimpact in our State, and I applaud its exceptional efforts to enrich \nLouisiana communities.\n  Since 1961, the Community Foundation has been committed to providing \nemergency aid during disasters, strengthening communities and nonprofit \norganizations through programs like the Endowment Challenge Program, \nand establishing partnerships such as the Aspen Ideas Mini-Festival \nthat bring citizens and local leaders together.\n  Endeavors such as the Genius Fund, the Women's Philanthropy Network, \nand the Northwest Louisiana Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster \nare further examples of how the Community Foundation's generosity has \nsuccessfully improved the community and the lives of so many \nLouisianans.\n  Under the leadership of COL James Hellums Tucker, Jr., the foundation \nhas grown from an organization with a modest $21,000 to one that has \nendowed more than $75 million. And through its goodwill and \nphilanthropy, has awarded more than $40 million for more than 4,000 \ngrants and scholarships so that organizations and students can achieve \ntheir goals and realize their dreams.\n  Again, I am proud to honor and applaud the Community Foundation of \nNorth Louisiana, the oldest in the State, on 50 years of charitable \ngiving and congratulate them for their many contributions to our \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/20/senate-section/article/S3919-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3919-S3920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS DECLARED \nIN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13159 OF JUNE 21, 2000, WITH RESPECT TO THE RISK OF \n  NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION CREATED BY THE ACCUMULATION OF WEAPONS-USABLE \n    FISSILE MATERIAL IN THE TERRITORY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION, AS \n      RECEIVED DURING RECESS OF THE SENATE ON JUNE 17, 2011--PM 11\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

Bush have offered him their congratulations; \n     and\n       Whereas, domestically, he has acted with both initiative \n     and organizational acumen toward the precautionary defense of \n     our citizens and has successfully prevented a terrorist \n     attack on American soil during his service to our nation as \n     president; and\n       Whereas, internationally, he has wisely exercised the use \n     of diplomacy to nurture collaborative relationships with \n     other nations, which has helped improve the freedom and \n     safety of the world's people; and\n       Whereas, President George W. Bush had the near universal \n     support of the freedom-loving peoples and countries of the \n     world after the attacks on September 11, 2001, when he \n     famously pledged to defend freedom against fear, saying ``We \n     will not tire, we will not falter, and we will not fail,'' \n     and President Obama had the strength and wherewithal to see \n     that pledge through to fulfillment; and\n       Whereas, legislators in Texas reaffirm the solemn creed \n     that we are one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty \n     and justice for all, who stand strongly behind the president \n     with respect to these several issues as he confronts the \n     grave problems of national and international security; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the 82nd \n     Legislature of the State of Texas hereby congratulate \n     President Obama on his proven and successful policies in the \n     war on terrorism and in homeland security; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the 82nd \n     Legislature of the State of Texas hereby commend the \n     intelligence personnel who diligently and quietly toiled for \n     years to uncover the whereabouts of bin Laden and whose \n     achievement, while historic, may never be fully known to the \n     public; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Legislature of the State of Texas hereby commend the members \n     of the 82nd armed forces who successfully and heroically \n     carried out an incredibly sensitive mission with no military \n     losses and with a minimal loss of civilian lives; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the chief clerk of the Texas House of \n     Representatives forward official copies of this resolution to \n     the president of the United States, to the speaker of the \n     House of Representatives and the president of the Senate of \n     the United States Congress, to the governor of Texas, and to \n     all the members of the Texas delegation to Congress with the \n     request that this resolution be officially entered in the \n     Congressional Record as a memorial to the Congress of the \n     United State's of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-39. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Texas \n     urging Congress to fully support the vital operations and \n     joint force structure at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base; \n     to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 784\n\n       Whereas, Ellington Field plays an important role in the \n     Houston-area economy while contributing to the defense of our \n     nation; and\n       Whereas, Ellington Field was constructed in 1917 and served \n     as a training base for military air personnel during World \n     War I and World War II and as a navigator training school in \n     the 1950s; NASA became a tenant there in 1962, and in 1984, \n     Ellington Field was taken over by the City of Houston; today, \n     it continues to provide support for military reserve and \n     guard units even as it serves as a base for a variety of \n     commercial operations; and\n       Whereas, featuring commands from all five Department of \n     Defense and Department of Homeland Security military \n     services, Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base has grown to \n     include more than 6,000 active, reserve, and guard members; \n     it is home to the 147th Reconnaissance Wing, which is at the \n     forefront of the trend toward unmanned aircraft that is \n     transforming the Air Force and Air Guard; and\n       Whereas, the region served by the Ellington Field JRB is \n     vital to national security and the only one in the country \n     containing all 17 national asset categories identified by the \n     Department of Homeland Security as prime potential targets \n     for global terrorism; a $100 million expansion now in \n     progress is vastly increasing the defense capabilities of the \n     base and will have an enormous economic impact on surrounding \n     communities, with estimates ranging to nearly $700 million; \n     and\n       Whereas, Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base provides a \n     strong stimulus to the Houston-area economy and is poised to \n     take on an ever-greater role in the defense of the Lone Star \n     State, the Gulf Coast region, and the nation; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the 82nd \n     Texas Legislature hereby respectfully urge the Congress of \n     the United States to fully support the vital operations and \n     joint force structure at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base; \n     and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the chief clerk forward official copies of \n     this resolution to the President of the United States, to the \n     President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives of the United States Congress, to the \n     Secretary of Defense, to the Secretary of Homeland Security, \n     to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and to all the members \n     of the Texas delegation to Congress with the request that \n     this resolution be entered in the Congressional Record as a \n     memorial to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-40. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Texas \n     expressing opposition to H.R. 3424 and to any other proposal \n     that would limit the use of reinsurance by non-U.S.-based \n     insurance companies; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \n     and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 243\n\n       Whereas, the insurance business greatly depends on \n     affiliated reinsurance for managing and spreading risk; and\n       Whereas, purchasing reinsurance from affiliates is a means \n     for large insurers to manage capital and also serves an \n     important risk-transfer purpose, providing significant \n     additional primary insurance capacity, particularly for crop, \n     windstorm, general liability, products liability, and \n     aircraft insurance; and\n       Whereas, non-U.S.-based insurance companies with U.S. \n     affiliates purchase reinsurance from parent and sister \n     companies domiciled abroad, but a bill introduced in the \n     United States Congress would penalize them for doing so, even \n     though U.S. and foreign-based insurance groups currently pay \n     functionally equivalent taxes on reinsurance transactions; \n     given the average tax burden of 25 percent in European \n     countries, such legislation would render most offshore \n     reinsurance transactions prohibitively expensive, and the \n     U.S. market would see a capacity shortfall and increases in \n     premiums for consumers; and\n       Whereas, a major study by the Brattle Group, an economic \n     research and consulting firm, concluded that the proposed \n     policy would result in a 20 percent reduction in the supply \n     of reinsurance for consumers in the United States, in turn \n     leading to annual cost increases of $10 to $12 billion; in \n     addition, a broad coalition of industry and consumer groups \n     have spoken out against the proposal; and\n       Whereas, taxation proposed in H.R. 3424, 111th Cong. \n     (2009), discriminates against the use of offshore affiliated \n     reinsurance by foreign-based companies and, if enacted, will \n     severely undermine the risk management practices at the heart \n     of international reinsurance markets; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the 82nd \n     Texas Legislature hereby express its opposition to H.R. 3424 \n     and to any other proposal that would limit the use of \n     reinsurance by non-U.S.-based insurance companies; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the chief clerk of the Texas House of \n     Representatives forward official copies of this resolution to \n     the President of the United States, to the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the \n     United States Congress, and to all the members of the Texas \n     delegation to Congress with the request that this resolution \n     be entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the \n     Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-41. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Texas \n     urging Congress and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to \n     withdraw its proposal to list the dunes sagebrush lizard \n     under the Endangered Species Act of 1973; to\n\n[[Page S3922]]\n\n     the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                       House Resolution No. 1955\n\n       Whereas, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has \n     proposed granting endangered species status to the dunes \n     sagebrush lizard, a measure that would have a significant \n     negative impact on the Lone Star State; and\n       Whereas, the business climate in Texas has been \n     consistently ranked as the nation's best, and the oil and gas \n     sector is crucial to its continued vitality; Texas is the \n     nation's leading producer of oil and natural gas, and it \n     holds 30 percent of the nation's natural gas reserves and \n     almost a quarter of its oil reserves; the oil and gas \n     industry contributes $30 billion annually to the Texas \n     economy and employs more than 315,000 Texans at some of the \n     highest salaries in the state; and\n       Whereas, despite its resilience, the Texas economy has not \n     been immune to the global economic recession; there have been \n     significant job losses over the past two years, and recently \n     high gas prices have posed new challenges; the Fish and \n     Wildlife Service failed to take these factors into account in \n     its proposal to grant endangered species status to the dunes \n     sagebrush lizard in southeastern New Mexico and adjacent oil-\n     producing areas of West Texas; and\n       Whereas, in addition, the service has failed to consider \n     that approximately 75,000 acres identified as habitat for the \n     lizard are owned and managed by The University of Texas for \n     the benefit of higher education; university officials have \n     estimated that the listing could stop the drilling of \n     approximately 1,000 oil and gas wells and eliminate the \n     production of seven million barrels of oil equivalent \n     annually; and\n       Whereas, the Texas Legislature and the Texas Parks and \n     Wildlife Department have traditionally recognized the private \n     landowner as the primary steward of our state's natural \n     resources, but the Fish and Wildlife Service has not \n     adequately consulted with the State of Texas, Texas \n     landowners, or other stakeholders; moreover, the service has \n     failed to fully consider issues unique to species protection \n     and habitat conservation in Texas; and\n       Whereas, listing the dunes sagebrush lizard as an \n     endangered species would inflict severe economic damage, harm \n     property owners, and undermine higher education in the Lone \n     Star State; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the 82nd \n     Texas Legislature hereby respectfully urge the United States \n     Fish and Wildlife Service to withdraw its proposal to list \n     the dunes sagebrush lizard under the Endangered Species Act \n     of 1973; and, be it further\n       Resolved,  That the House of Representatives direct the \n     agencies of the State of Texas to cooperate with the efforts \n     of the Texas Endangered Species Task Force to investigate the \n     scientific basis of the proposed listing and the potential \n     burdens on private property rights and economic development \n     in the state; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the chief clerk of the Texas House of \n     Representatives forward official copies of this resolution to \n     the President of the United States, the acting director of \n     the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the President of the \n     Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the \n     United States Congress, and all the members of the Texas \n     delegation to Congress with the request that this resolution \n     be entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the \n     Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-42. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Texas \n     expressing support for the inclusion of Taiwan in the United \n     States Visa Waiver Program; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                       House Resolution No. 1483\n\n       Whereas, Taiwan and the United States enjoy a friendly and \n     mutually beneficial relationship, and solid commercial, \n     educational, and cultural ties can be further strengthened by \n     the inclusion of Taiwan in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program; and\n       Whereas, a full-fledged, stable democracy, Taiwan shares \n     with the United States a commitment to democracy, human \n     rights, the rule of law, and a market-based economy; \n     moreover, Taiwan is our ninth-largest trading partner and a \n     key export market in almost every major sector; trade in \n     commercial goods between Taiwan and the United States totaled \n     nearly $62 billion in 2010; and\n       Whereas, the two nations have long maintained close and \n     productive cooperation in science and technology, and since \n     1979, they have signed more than 190 science and technology \n     agreements under the framework of the Taipei Economic and \n     Cultural Representative Office and the American Institute in \n     Taiwan; Taiwan has worked very closely with the United States \n     in the field of education, and in 2010, more than 26,000 \n     Taiwanese studied in our colleges and universities; and\n       Whereas, these important relationships generate significant \n     interpersonal contact and travel, and in 2009, people from \n     Taiwan paid more than 500,000 visits to the United States; if \n     admitted to the Visa Waiver Program, holders of Taiwan \n     passports could travel to the United States without the \n     expense and time-consuming process of obtaining a visa, which \n     is expected to boost the number of visits for both \n     sightseeing and business purposes; Taiwanese travel to the \n     United Kingdom and New Zealand spiked by 35 to 40 percent \n     after those countries waived visa obligations, and it is \n     estimated that waiving visa requirements for Taiwanese \n     travels in the United States could increase tourism revenue \n     by as much as $1.8 billion; and\n       Whereas, in order to gain entry into the Visa Waiver \n     Program, a country must have a visa refusal rate below 3 \n     percent, and only 2.2 percent of Taiwanese visa applications \n     were rejected by the United States in fiscal year 2010; about \n     100 countries, including Japan and members of the European \n     Union, offer Taiwan visa exemptions on the basis of \n     reciprocity and out of confidence that citizens of Taiwan are \n     law-abiding and unlikely to overstay; and\n       Whereas, Taiwan has already exempted U.S. passport holders \n     from visa requirements for visits up to 30 days; by extending \n     similar privileges, the United States can facilitate people-\n     to-people contacts, enhance cultural links, and expand \n     business opportunities and tourism; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the 82nd \n     Texas Legislature hereby endorse the inclusion of Taiwan in \n     the United States Visa Waiver Program; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the chief clerk forward official copies of \n     this resolution to the President of the United States, to the \n     President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives of the United States Congress, and to all the \n     members of the Texas delegation to Congress with the request \n     that this resolution be entered in the Congressional Record \n     as a memorial to the Congress of the United States of \n     America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-43. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing Congress to review \n     the Government Pension Offset and the Windfall Elimination \n     Provision Social Security benefit reductions and to consider \n     eliminating or reducing them by enacting the Social Security \n     Fairness Act of 2011, the Public Servant Retirement \n     Protection Act of 2011, or a similar instrument; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 94\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has enacted both \n     the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the spousal and \n     survivor Social Security benefit, and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision (WEP), reducing the earned Social \n     Security benefit for any person who also receives a public \n     pension benefit; and\n       Whereas, the intent of congress in enacting the GPO and the \n     WEP provisions was to address concerns that a public employee \n     who had worked primarily in federal, state, or local \n     government employment might receive a public pension in \n     addition to the same Social Security benefit as a person who \n     had worked only in employment covered by Social Security \n     throughout his career; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of congress in enacting these \n     reduction provisions was to provide a disincentive for public \n     employees to receive two pensions; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a spouse or survivor \n     receiving a federal, state, or local government retirement or \n     pension benefit who would also be entitled to a Social \n     Security benefit earned by a spouse; and\n       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor \n     Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefit received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases \n     completely eliminating the Social Security benefit; and\n       Whereas, nine out of ten public employees affected by the \n     GPO lose their entire spousal benefits, even though their \n     spouses paid Social Security taxes for many years; and\n       Whereas, the GPO often reduces spousal benefits so \n     significantly it can make the difference between self-\n     sufficiency and poverty; and\n       Whereas, the GPO has a harsh effect on thousands of \n     citizens and undermines the original purpose of the Social \n     Security dependent/survivor benefit; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively impacts approximately twenty-\n     seven thousand one hundred forty-four Louisianians; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefits, in addition to working in employment covered under \n     Social Security and paying into the Social Security system; \n     and\n       Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned Social Security benefit \n     using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula and may \n     reduce Social Security benefits for affected persons by as \n     much as one-half of the retirement benefit earned as a public \n     servant in employment not covered under Social Security;

and\n       Whereas, these provisions also have a greater adverse \n     effect on women than on men because of the gender differences \n     in salary that continue to plague our nation and because of \n     the longer life expectancy of women; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort to improve the \n     quality of life of its citizens and to encourage them to live \n     here lifelong, yet the current GPO and WEP provisions \n     compromise that quality of life; and\n       Whereas, retired individuals negatively affected by GPO and \n     WEP have significantly less money to support their basic \n     needs and sometimes have to turn to government assistance \n     programs; and\n       Whereas, the GPO and the WEP penalize individuals who have \n     dedicated their lives to public service by taking away \n     benefits they have earned; and\n       Whereas, our nation should respect, not penalize, public \n     servants; and\n       Whereas, the number of people affected by GPO and WEP is \n     growing every day as more and more people reach retirement \n     age; and\n       Whereas, the GPO and WEP are established in federal law, \n     and repeal of the GPO and the WEP can only be enacted by the \n     United States Congress: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to review the \n     Government Pension Offset and the Windfall Elimination \n     Provision Social Security benefit reductions and to consider \n     eliminating or reducing them by enacting the Social Security \n     Fairness Act of 2011 (H.R. 1332), the Public Servant \n     Retirement Protection Act of 2011 (S. 113), or a similar \n     instrument;

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana memorializing Congress to review \n     the Government Pension Offset and the Windfall Elimination \n     Provision Social Security benefit reductions and to consider \n     eliminating or reducing them by enacting the Social Security \n     Fairness Act of 2011, the Public Servant Retirement \n     Protection Act of 2011, or a similar instrument; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 93\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has enacted both \n     the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the spousal and \n     survivor Social Security benefit, and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision (WEP), reducing the earned Social \n     Security benefit for any person who also receives a public \n     pension benefit; and\n       Whereas, the intent of congress in enacting the GPO and the \n     WEP provisions was to address concerns that a public employee \n     who had worked primarily in federal, state, or local \n     government employment might receive a public pension in \n     addition to the same Social Security benefit as a person who \n     had worked only in employment covered by Social Security \n     throughout his career; and\n       Whereas, the purpose of congress in enacting these \n     reduction provisions was to provide a disincentive for public \n     employees to receive two pensions; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a spouse or survivor \n     receiving a federal, state, or local government retirement or \n     pension benefit who would also be entitled to a Social \n     Security benefit earned by a spouse; and\n       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor \n     Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefit received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases \n     completely eliminating the Social Security benefit; and\n       Whereas, nine out of ten public employees affected by the \n     GPO lose their entire spousal benefits, even though their \n     spouses paid Social Security taxes for many years; and\n       Whereas, the GPO often reduces spousal benefits so \n     significantly it can make the difference between self-\n     sufficiency and poverty; and\n       Whereas, the GPO has a harsh effect on thousands of \n     citizens and undermines the original purpose of the Social \n     Security dependent/survivor benefit; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively impacts approximately 27,144 \n     Louisianans; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefits, in addition to working in employment covered under \n     Social Security and paying into the Social Security system; \n     and\n       Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned Social Security benefit \n     using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula and may \n     reduce Social Security benefits for affected persons by as \n     much as one-half of the retirement benefit earned as a public \n     servant in employment not covered under Social Security; and\n       Whereas, the WEP causes hard-working individuals to lose a \n     significant portion of the Social Security benefits that they \n     earn themselves; and\n       Whereas, the WEP negatively impacts approximately 25,322 \n     Louisianans; and\n       Whereas, because of these calculation characteristics, the \n     GPO and the WEP have a disproportionately negative effect on \n     employees working in lower-wage government jobs, like \n     policemen, firefighters, teachers, and state employees; and\n       Whereas, many workers rely on Social Security \n     Administration Annual Statements that fail to take into \n     account the GPO and WEP when projecting benefits; and\n       Whereas, because the Social Security benefit statements do \n     not calculate the GPO and the WEP, many public employees in \n     Louisiana are unaware that their expected Social Security \n     benefits shown on such statements will be significantly lower \n     or nonexistent due to the service in public employment; and\n       Whereas, these provisions also have a greater adverse \n     effect on women than on men because of the gender differences \n     in salary that continue to plague our nation and because of \n     the longer life expectancy of women;

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Iowa \n     memorializing its support of the positive impact of the CSBG \n     program in Iowa and its opposition to federal action to \n     reduce CSBG funding disproportionately compared to the rest \n     of the federal domestic discretionary budget; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 44\n\n       Whereas, in state fiscal year 2010, 365,752 Iowans in \n     140,333 households were helped in their fight against poverty \n     through services funded by the federal Community Services \n     Block Grant (CSBG) program; and\n       Whereas, more than 96 percent of the families receiving \n     services were at or below 175 percent of the federal poverty \n     level or $35,427 annual family income; and\n       Whereas, more than 76 percent of the individuals served by \n     the 18 community action agencies were working or received \n     social security as their source of income; and\n       Whereas, those 18 community action agencies have 127 \n     service centers throughout all 99 Iowa counties; and\n       Whereas, each community action agency is governed by a \n     community-based volunteer board of directors consisting of \n     elected officials, private sector representatives, and low-\n     income Iowans; and\n       Whereas, Iowa's 18 community action agencies employ 3,350 \n     Iowans; and\n       Whereas, CSBG funding for the 18 community action agencies \n     brought in $2.3 million in local funding, $13.6 million in \n     private funding, $13.9 million in state funding, and $222.9 \n     million in federal funding to Iowa's local communities; and\n       Whereas, CSBG funding for Iowa's 18 community action \n     agencies helped generate $17.7 million in in-kind goods and \n     services and donated items; and\n       Whereas, the 18 community action agencies received \n     $7,154,281 in CSBG funding enabling the community action \n     agencies to operate their service centers and to administer \n     state and federally funded programs; and\n       Whereas, President Obama has proposed a 50 percent \n     reduction in CSBG funding and making the allocation of the \n     remaining funds competitive instead of continuing the current \n     allocation formula that brings stability to Iowa's community \n     and economic development initiatives; and\n       Whereas, the Iowa House of Representatives supports efforts \n     of the United States Congress to effectively reduce the \n     federal deficit while promoting the current and future \n     economic security of all Iowans; Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That the House of \n     Representatives supports the positive impact of the CSBG \n     program in Iowa and opposes federal action to reduce\n\n[[Page S3924]]\n\n     CSBG funding disproportionately compared to the rest of the \n     federal domestic discretionary budget; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the President and Secretary \n     of the United States Senate, the Speaker and Clerk of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and each member of \n     the Iowa congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-46. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Texas \n     memorializing the legacy of public service to the community \n     of Campbellton Post Office; to the Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 523\n\n       Whereas, the Campbellton Post Office in southern Atascosa \n     County, Texas, has played an essential role in the lives of \n     area residents for more than 130 years, but the United States \n     Postal Service has placed it on a list of facilities to be \n     closed in 2011; and\n       Whereas, John Campbell established the post office in his \n     general store in 1874, and five years later, moved them both \n     to the new town of Campbellton; Mr. Campbell was officially \n     appointed the first postmaster and was succeeded over the \n     years by a number of his descendants, including William \n     Campbell, Edward Campbell, Louise Campbell, and Alyce \n     Campbell; and\n       Whereas, its present postmaster, Lydia Rodriguez Castillo, \n     began her long tenure in 1971; a postal service hiring freeze \n     prevents her position from being filled when she retires, yet \n     the postal service has targeted the branch for closure in \n     part because it lacks a permanent postmaster; and\n       Whereas, residents of the rural area and hamlets served by \n     the Campbellton Post Office rely on it for business \n     communications as well as for their personal mail, and the \n     post office is particularly important to the elderly; if it \n     should close, customers would have to travel some 20 miles to \n     send packages, check post office boxes, or mail important \n     documents; accordingly, patrons and civic leaders have formed \n     a committee and started a petition to support the \n     preservation of this integral institution; and\n       Whereas, throughout the history of Campbellton, the post \n     office has been part of the fabric of the community, and its \n     closing would deprive citizens of ready access to vital \n     services and diminish their quality of life; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the 82nd \n     Texas Legislature hereby honor the legacy of public service \n     to the community of the Campbellton Post Office; and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives hereby \n     respectfully urge the United States Congress to direct the \n     U.S. Postal Service to continue operating the Campbellton \n     Post Office in Atascosa County, Texas; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the chief clerk forward official copies of \n     this resolution to the President of the United States, to the \n     President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives of the United States Congress, to the United \n     States postmaster general, and to all the members of the \n     Texas delegation to Congress with the request that this \n     resolution be entered in the Congressional Record as a \n     memorial to the Congress of the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/20/senate-section/article/S3924-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LEAHY, from the Committee on the Judiciary, without \n     amendment:\n       S. 978.

A bill to reauthorize the Second Chance Act of 2007; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S3926]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with Senator \nPortman to introduce the bipartisan Second Reauthorization Act. This \nbill builds on recent successes and takes important new steps to ensure \nthat people coming out of prison have the opportunity to turn their \nlives around, rather than returning to a life of crime. That saves \ntaxpayer money and makes us all safer.\n  This important legislation improves Federal reentry policy and \nauthorizes assistance to collaborations between state and local \ncorrections agencies, nonprofits, educational institutions, service \nproviders, and families to ensure that offenders released into society \nhave the resources and support they need to become contributing members \nof the community. The reauthorization bill builds on the success of the \nSecond Chance Act by continuing, improving, and consolidating its \nprograms.\n  Four years ago, I joined with then-Senators Biden, Specter, and \nBrownback as an original cosponsor of the Second Chance Act, and I was \npleased to help move that legislation through the Senate. The Senate \nrecognized the value of the Second Chance Act when, after a great deal \nof work and compromise, the bill passed unanimously. I hope this \nreauthorization bill receives the same bipartisan support.\n  In the past few decades, Congress and the states have passed new \ncriminal laws creating more and longer sentences for more crimes. As a \nresult, this country sends even more people to prison every year, \ncosting millions and millions of dollars. There are currently over 2 \nmillion people in jail or prison, and more than 13 million people spend \nsome time in jail or prison each year. Most of these people will at \nsome point return to our communities.\n  Last July, I chaired a hearing on the Second Chance Act, and the \nCommittee heard about the great strides many states are making with \ninnovative prisoner reentry programs. Commissioner Andrew Pallito from \nthe Vermont Department of Corrections testified and shared with us his \nexperience with reentry programs in Vermont. The Vermont Department of \nCorrections and many others in Vermont have strongly supported the \nSecond Chance Act, which gives me confidence that it represents an \nimportant step in making our country safer.\n  The Second Chance Act authorized grants for key reentry programs and \nrequired that these programs demonstrate measurable positive results, \nincluding a reduction in recidivism. Preliminary studies show that \nthese programs are already working well.\n  The reauthorization bill that we propose today improves, consolidates \nand reauthorizes the state and local government grant programs created \nby the Second Chance Act. It is intended to ensure that funding is \navailable for planning and implementation of key reentry projects so \nthat evidence-based methodology is employed to ensure meaningful \nreductions in recidivism rates. It is designed to ensure that all \nstates have the opportunity to develop and benefit from these important \nprograms.\n  The bill also consolidates several programs that were underutilized \ninto one grant program with multiple purposes. This will ensure that \nFederal dollars are effectively spent on programs that link probation \nwith swift and certain enforcement, like the very successful HOPE \nprogram in Hawaii.\n  The Second Chance Act authorized research into educational methods \nused in prisons and jails. This reauthorization bill asks the Attorney \nGeneral to review that research and establish best practices for prison \neducation. It then reallocates the authorized funds previously used for \nresearch into a grant program to implement these best practices in \nprisons and jails. The bill also adds nonprofit organizations as \neligible grant recipients for programs promoting family-based substance \nabuse treatment.\n  This legislation makes modest improvements to Federal reentry policy \nthat have the added benefit of reducing Bureau of Prison costs. It \ncontinues the successful Elderly and Family Reunification for Certain \nNon Violent Offenders Pilot Program and modestly expands the pool of \ninmates eligible to apply for the program. More than 60 inmates have \nnow participated in this program, and not a single one has reoffended.\n  The bill also creates an incentive for inmates to participate in \nrigorous recidivism reduction programming by awarding a credit of up 60 \ndays per year toward completion of their sentence for participation in \nsuch programs. The incentive is modeled on that currently awarded for \nsuccessful participation in residential drug abuse treatment programs.\n  Finally, the Second Chance Reauthorization Act promotes \naccountability by requiring periodic audits of grantees to ensure that \nFederal dollars are responsibly spent. Grantees with problematic audits \nwill not be eligible for funding in future years.\n  As a former prosecutor, I believe strongly in securing tough and \nappropriate prison sentences for people who break our laws. But it is \nalso important that we do everything we can to ensure that when these \npeople get out of prison, they enter our communities as productive \nmembers of society, so we can start to reverse the dangerous cycle of \nrecidivism and violence. The Second Chance Reauthorization Act will \nhelp break this cycle.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1231\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part B of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to reauthorize grants to assist children affected by \nmethamphetamine or other substance abuse under the promoting safe and \nstable families program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce a \nbill on an issue that is very important to me and many of my colleagues \nhere in the Senate. I have long been a passionate supporter of some of \nthe most vulnerable members of our society, especially the thousands of \nour Nation's foster youth. Currently, there are over 420,000 children \nliving in foster care. Each one of these foster youth deserves a safe, \nloving and permanent home. But, each year, these children face a \ndeclining number of foster homes, and must also deal with the \nwidespread negative misperceptions attached to the foster care system. \nMany of them have to cope with parents that struggle with substance \nabuse problems. Parental substance abuse is one of the leading, if not \nthe primary, reasons forcing children into the foster care system.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, in a nationally \nrepresentative study, caseworkers investigating allegations of abuse or \nneglect noted active drug abuse by the 37 percent of the primary \ncaregivers from whom children were removed to out-of-home care. The \nsame report also noted active alcohol abuse among 29 percent of the \nprimary caregivers from whom children were removed. The percentage of \nchildren who remain in care due to issues related to substance abuse is \nbelieved to be even larger because, among other reasons, accessing and \nsuccessfully completing treatment services is often time consuming and \nchildren may not be able to safely return to their homes until \ntreatment is successfully completed. An additional troubling statistic \ncomes from a 2005 report by the RAND Corporation, which revealed that \nmore than 300,000 children entered the foster-care system due to \nmethamphetamine abuse.\n  I would like to take a moment to share a story about one foster youth \nwho is currently serving as an intern in my Washington, DC office \nthanks to the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute. Her name \nis Taatianna and her story is a reminder of the challenges that many \nfoster youth face.\n  When Taatianna turned three, she opened the front door of her home to \na caseworker who removed her and her two siblings from their home. \nTaatianna was placed in the foster care system at very young age \nbecause of her parent's substance abuse. She has lived many years with \nshame and guilt, believing she was responsible for splitting apart her \nfamily. However, she now knows that drug and alcohol were the reasons \nshe was neglected and forced into foster care. Fortunately, Taatianna \nand her siblings were able to live together and be raised by their \nbiological grandmother, Ruby, in Relative Kinship Care. Ruby played the \nrole of mom, dad, and grandma to these three children. While growing \nup, Taatianna and her siblings faced emotional and mental anxieties, \ntrying hard not to succumb to the curse of substance abuse addiction \nthat ran in their family. But more importantly, the kids longed to be \nwith their mom and dad again, hoping they could get clean, hold a job, \nand be a family. Taatianna's mother struggled, and continues to \nstruggle with, addiction.\n  Drugs and alcohol have torn this family apart, and have destroyed any \nsense of normalcy or permanency they so desperately yearned for. \nTaatianna witnessed first-hand the traumatic effects of substance abuse \nin both her parents and many other family members. Taatianna, and many \nother foster youth in this country, could be helped if parents were \ntreated or had better access to treatment for their substance abuse \nproblems.\n  Foster care shouldn't be a destination. It should be a temporary \ndetour for children while their parents are treated and are ready to be \nparents.\n  So, today, on behalf of many youth in foster care, I introduce the \nPartners for Stable Families and Foster Youth Affected by \nMethamphetamine or Other Substance Abuse Act. This bill will \nreauthorize the Regional Partnership Grants that were created in 2006 \nas part of the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Act. The passage of \nthis legislation was a tremendous step forward\n\n[[Page S3931]]\n\nin our efforts to help the youth in the foster care system. The funds \nfrom these grants address a variety of challenges that are barriers to \noptimal family outcomes. The mission of the Regional Partnership Grants \nis to improve the safety, permanency, and well-being of children who \nare in an out-of-home placement or are at-risk of such placement \nbecause of a parent or caretaker's abuse of methamphetamine or another \nsubstance.\n  In September 2007, following the authorization of the Regional \nPartnership Grants, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded \nmultiyear grants to 53 regional partnerships representing 29 states and \n6 tribes. The first round of grants supported the creation or expansion \nof family treatment drug courts, improvement of system-wide \ncollaboration, expanded access to comprehensive family centered \ntreatment, use of evidence-based practice approaches such as \nmotivational enhancement therapy, parent advocates, and recovery \nmanagement approaches to drug treatment monitoring. The groups \nreceiving these grants were split almost evenly between the public and \nprivate sectors, and they represent a great example of how both can \nassist the many youth and families that are a part of the foster care \nsystem.\n  Allow me an opportunity to tell you about the grantees in my home \nstate of Iowa.\n  One grantee, Upper Des Moines Opportunity Inc., is undertaking the \nParent Partner Program in 9 counties in rural Northwest Iowa. This \nprogram primarily assists individuals addicted to meth, and is unique \nbecause parents are matched to Parent Partners who serve as mentors, \nassisting clients to navigate the child welfare and substance abuse \nsystems. The goal of these Parent Partners is to support and mentor \nparents who have trouble keeping their families together and are at \nrisk of incarceration or permanently losing custody of their children. \nThis program is more personal than stand alone drug treatment programs \nbecause Parent Partners have been through the same situations. One \noutcome is that clients are developing a trusting relationship with \nprofessionals in the child welfare and substance abuse systems; thereby \nincreasing their chances for success and becoming more engaged in \nsubstance abuse treatment and recovery. The Parent Partner understands \nthe client's situation, allowing them to bond and build trust with the \ngoal of regaining custody of their children more quickly. The Parent \nPartners serve as the critical link between the Department of Human \nServices, the parent, and other experts.\n  Another grantee, the Parents and Children Together, PACT, is a family \ndrug court initiative implementing a community based approach to \nsubstance abuse treatment. The program supports the family to remain \nthe primary permanency option for their children. PACT is a partnership \nof the courts, the state child welfare agency, the Iowa Department of \nPublic Health, and five community pilot sites with the State Court \ntaking the lead. Through this program, family treatment courts were \nimplemented in each pilot site. The program is focused on increasing \nthe safety, permanency and well-being of children by addressing the \nsubstance abuse treatment programming and service gaps through a \ncommunity collaborative planning approach. The partnership has worked \nhard over the years to establish family drug courts in their pilot \nsites that support families as they navigate the foster care system and \nsubstance abuse treatment. With the knowledge they are gaining on what \nworks and what doesn't, they have provided two family treatment court \nforums for other interested community court led teams. They presently \nserve 6 sites and have 6 other court led teams that are interested in \nlearning more.\n\n  According to a forthcoming report from the Administration on \nChildren, Youth, and Families, over 8,000 adults and 12,000 children \nhave been served by the Regional Partnership Grants. Bryan Samuels, the \nCommissioner of the Administration, has said that children are \ndischarged from foster care at a faster rate because of the grants and \nthat families are more likely to be reunited within 12 months and are \nmore likely to stay that way after 12 months.\n  The efforts to help at-risk youth must continue. We know that \nsubstance abuse issues will continue to push kids into foster care. In \nIowa alone, from 2005-2009, the Iowa Department of Human Services \nclassified 5,330 children victims of abuse due to the presence of an \nillegal drug in their body. Meth continues to be a huge concern. In \nfact, meth lab incidents in Iowa have dropped dramatically since their \npeak in 2004, but have risen in each of the past three years. The \nresurgence in meth lab incidents coincides with a rise in drug-related \nprison admissions, meth treatment admissions, and child abuse cases.\n  In my original version of the Regional Partnership Grants in 2006, I \nenvisioned $40 million per year to be available for grants to improve \nthe outcomes of those affected by meth or other substance abuse. \nUnfortunately this amount was reduced during conference committee \nnegotiations. In the bill I am introducing today, I am again calling \nfor the amount to be set at $40 million per year. This will allow new \ngrantees to start programs while giving short two-year extensions to \nexisting grantees. The goal is to encourage new collaborations \nthroughout the country, while giving time to existing collaborations to \ninstitute best practices and educate other entities about what works \nand what does not.\n  The reauthorization of the Regional Partnership Grants will also \ninclude several measures aimed at improving the original legislation. \nThe bill will allow more dollars to be available for activities and \ncollaborative efforts by instituting a 5 percent administrative fee cap \non the amount that can be retained by the Administration on Children, \nYouth, and Families for technical assistance or contract services. \nFinally, the bill will require more evaluation of regional \npartnerships, and require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nevaluate the new grantees and issue a report on the best practices \nimplemented by their programs no later than December 1, 2012, with a \nfollow-up report due in 2017. These reports will prove useful in \nefforts to improve our foster-care system.\n  The improvement of the lives of families and youth that are involved \nin the foster care system is one of the most important issue I have \nundertaken in the U.S. Senate. The Regional Partnership Grants have not \nonly helped youth in search of permanent, loving families, but have \nbrought back together families that were torn apart by substance abuse. \nAs a founder and co-chair of the Senate Caucus on Foster Youth, I have \nbeen a witness to the many successes that have occurred thanks to our \nsupport of these children and young adults; however, I am also still \npainfully aware of the amount of work that remains. We can take another \nsignificant step forward in this area by passing the Partners for \nStable Families and Foster Youth Affected by Methamphetamine or Other \nSubstance Abuse Act and reauthorizing the Regional Partnership Grants.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, and Mrs. \n        McCaskill):\n  S. 1236. A bill to reduce the trafficking of drugs and to prevent \nhuman smuggling across the Southwest Border by deterring the \nconstruction and use of border tunnels; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Border Tunnel \nPrevention Act of 2011 with my colleagues and friends, Senator Jon Kyl, \nSenator Mary Landrieu and Senator Claire McCaskill. This bill will \nprovide law enforcement and prosecutors with important tools to locate \nborder tunnels, identify criminals and punish those involved.\n  As the U.S., Mexico border has become more secure, criminals have \nsought out new ways to transfer drugs and people across the border. For \nyears, smugglers have tried to go around our border checkpoints. Now, \nthey are trying to go under them to evade border enforcement. There is \nan increasing number and sophistication of tunnels along the Southwest \nborder.\n  Tunnels range from anything from a shallow dirt crawl way to \nsophisticated concrete structures with shoring, ventilation and \nelectricity. One tunnel found in San Diego even had a makeshift \nelevator.\n\n[[Page S3932]]\n\n  Underground tunnels present a serious national security threat. The \nfirst tunnel was discovered in May of 1990. However, beginning in 2001, \ntunnels began to increase dramatically. Between September 2001 and \ntoday, an astonishing 125 completed tunnels have been discovered making \na total of 137 completed tunnels since 1990.\n  Border tunnels are most often used to transport narcotics from Mexico \nto the United States, but assumingly are also used to smuggle weapons \nand people. Just as tunnels can be used to transport drugs across the \nborder, they could be used to smuggle a terrorist into the United \nStates.\n  In recent years, there has been a striking increase in the \nsophistication of these tunnels. To date, authorities have discovered \n61 sophisticated tunnels, 37 of which were constructed in California.\n  In San Diego in February of 2006, I had the occasion to visit a very \nsophisticated tunnel discovered by the multi- agency San Diego Tunnel \nTask Force, led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security has established these tunnel task \nforces in San Diego, El Paso, Nogales, Yuma and Imperial Valley.\n  The tunnel was 2,400 feet long, close to half of a mile, stretching \nfrom an abandoned warehouse near the southern border of California \nthrough to Tijuana, Mexico. It remains the longest cross-border tunnel \ndiscovered in U.S. history, more than nine stories below ground at its \ndeepest point, and had ample ventilation and groundwater drainage \nsystems, cement flooring, lighting, and a pulley system.\n  Authorities seized over 4,200 pounds of marijuana in the tunnel, and \nhave attributed the operation to the Arellano Felix Organization.\n  The exit of the tunnel in the United States was concealed in a small \noffice inside a massive empty warehouse, covered only by four square \ntiles.\n  After seeing this tunnel, I introduced the Border Tunnel Prevention \nAct of 2006. The bill became law in 2007 and criminalized the \nconstruction, financing or use of an unauthorized tunnel or \nsubterranean passage across an international border into the United \nStates. It also imposes a punishment for anyone who negligently permits \nothers to construct or use an unauthorized tunnel or subterranean \npassage on their land.\n  The first prosecution under this law was in connection to a December \n2009 partially-built tunnel found in Calexico, California. An \ninvestigation resulted in the arrest of Daniel Alvarez, a United States \ncitizen. Alvarez eventually pled guilty to criminal violations put into \nplace by the Border Tunnel Prevention Act and was sentenced to 15 \nmonths in federal prison.\n  Today, I am introducing a bill to enhance the 2007 law. Specifically, \nit will make the use, construction or financing of a border tunnel a \nconspiracy offense. This would punish the intent to engage in tunnel \nactivity, even in cases where a tunnel was not fully constructed.\n  The bill will include illegal tunneling as an offense eligible for \nTitle III wiretaps even when there are not drugs or other contraband to \nfacilitate a wiretap; specify border tunnel activity as unlawful under \nthe existing forfeiture and money laundering provisions to allow \nauthorities to seize assets in these cases.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1236\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Border Tunnel Prevention Act \n     of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) As the international border between the United States \n     and Mexico becomes more secure, trafficking and smuggling \n     organizations intensify their efforts to enter the United \n     States by increasing the number of tunnels and other \n     subterranean passages between Mexico and the United States.\n       (2) Border tunnels are most often used to transport \n     narcotics from Mexico to the United States, but can also be \n     used to transport people and other contraband.\n       (3) Between May 1990 and May 2011, law enforcement \n     authorities discovered 137 tunnels, 125 of which have been \n     discovered since September 2001. While law enforcement \n     authorities discovered only 2 tunnels in California between \n     1990 and 2001, there has been a dramatic increase in the \n     number of border tunnels discovered in California since 2001.\n       (4) Section 551 of the Department of Homeland Security \n     Appropriations Act, 2007 (Public Law 109-295) added a new \n     section to title 18, United States Code (18 U.S.C. 555), \n     which--\n       (A) criminalizes the construction or financing of an \n     unauthorized tunnel or subterranean passage across an \n     international border into the United States; and\n       (B) prohibits any person from recklessly permitting others \n     to construct or use an unauthorized tunnel or subterranean \n     passage on the person's land.\n       (5) Any person convicted of using a tunnel or subterranean \n     passage to smuggle aliens, weapons, drugs, terrorists, or \n     illegal goods is subject to an enhanced sentence for the \n     underlying offense. Additional sentence enhancements would \n     further deter tunnel activities and increase prosecutorial \n     options.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) National security zone.--The term ``national security \n     zone'' means any Southwest Border land designated by the \n     Secretary as being at a high risk for border tunnel activity, \n     as authorized under section 8(b).\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security.\n       (3) Southwest border land.--The term ``Southwest Border \n     land'' means all parcels of real property in the United \n     States that--\n       (A) are located within 1 mile of the international border \n     between the United States and Mexico; and\n       (B) are not owned by a Federal, State, tribal, or local \n     government entity.\n\n     SEC. 4.
