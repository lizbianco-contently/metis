Mr. President, I move that the Senate proceed to \nconsideration of the motion to proceed to calendar No. 396, H.R. 2072.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to calendar No. 396, H.R. 2072, a bill to \n     reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are now on the motion to proceed to the \nEx-Im bill. I hope we can pass the bill today. I haven't had an \nopportunity today to speak to the Republican leader, but I will do that \nshortly, and we will decide if there is a way forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the next hour be equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees, with the \nmajority controlling the first half and the Republicans controlling the \nsecond half.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on a strong bipartisan vote yesterday, the \nHouse passed a piece of commonsense, job-creating legislation--the \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. We refer to it as the Ex-Im \nBank legislation.\n  For many years this legislation has helped American companies grow \nand sell their products overseas, creating tens of thousands of jobs. \nAnd for years the bank has enjoyed broad bipartisan support. It passed \nby unanimous consent on one occasion and by voice vote on another \noccasion. It is the perfect example of the kinds of smart investments \nCongress should be making to spur job growth.\n  I hope the Senate will be able to quickly approve the House-passed \nmeasure today and do it by unanimous consent. I am optimistic that the \n330-to-93 vote in the House yesterday will be enough to convince Senate \nRepublicans they shouldn't hold up this legislation any longer--330 to \n93. The process of reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank has taken \ntoo long. I hope we don't have to file cloture on this matter, but I \nwill if we must.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the Senate considered reauthorizing \nthis important legislation in March, 2 months ago. Senate Republicans \nhad an opportunity to support the measure then. Instead, all but three \nopposed it and the measure failed. American exporters have already \nwaited in limbo for 2 months to see whether Republicans will \ncome around in backing this business-friendly, job-creating measure. \nBusinesses shouldn't have to wait\n\n[[Page S3052]]\n\nany longer. We can't afford more of the partisan obstruction we saw on \nthis commonsense legislation last March. To get this to the President's \ndesk this Congress--and every piece of legislation we pass must get to \nhis desk or it doesn't become law--we need Democratic votes and \nRepublican votes. That is just a reality. It means we absolutely must \nwork together if we want to get anything done.\n\n\n                         Senator Richard Lugar\n\n  One man who has always been willing to extend a hand to colleagues \nacross the aisle is the senior Senator from Indiana, Senator Richard \nLugar. His first priority has always been getting things done for the \nAmerican people, whether that means keeping the world safe from nuclear \nwar or looking out for the Hoosiers back home. One of the most historic \npieces of legislation is known as Nunn-Lugar. It is an effort to reduce \nthe number of nuclear weapons in our country and in the Soviet Union. \nIt is a very important piece of bipartisan legislation, authored by \nSenators Lugar of Indiana and Nunn of Georgia. It is important \nlegislation.\n  Senator Lugar has been a great advocate for the people of Indiana as \nwell as a dedicated student of international affairs. I have the \nopportunity to call meetings with foreign dignitaries, and he is always \nthere, seated at the table. He has always put the American people, in \nmy estimation, first and his political party second. I was elected to \nthe Senate to serve each and every Nevadan--not only Democrats, though \nI am proud to be one--and Senator Lugar was elected to serve every \nHoosier, regardless of political affiliation, and he has done that so \nwell; it is why he has been in the Senate for more than three decades.\n  Throughout the history of this country, even in the most trying of \ntimes, times of great social and political unrest, our elected \nrepresentatives have worked together despite their differences to do \nwhat is right for all Americans. So I worry when I see dedicated \npatriots such as Senator Lugar drummed out by tea party zealots for \nbeing too willing to cooperate. But that is what happened on Tuesday. I \nworry when I hear a candidate for the U.S. Senate campaigning against \nbipartisanship and compromise between the two parties. That is really \nwhat he said, that there is too much compromise in Congress. That is \nwhat happened on Tuesday. I worry when a candidate for the U.S. Senate \nsays clearly that he will put political party and partisanship before \ncountry and compromise. But that is what happened on Tuesday. That is \nnothing to be proud of.\n  That kind of attitude is why longtime political observers Thomas Mann \nand Norman Ornstein described today's GOP as ``ideologically extreme'' \nand ``scornful of compromise.'' And it is why my friend Senator Lugar \nsaid the following yesterday in his concession speech:\n\n       Bipartisanship is not the opposite of principle. One can be \n     very conservative or very liberal and still have a bipartisan \n     mindset. Such a mindset acknowledges that the other party is \n     also patriotic and may have some good ideas.\n\n  I want to repeat that. This is what Senator Lugar said in his \nconcession speech yesterday:\n\n       Bipartisanship is not the opposite of principle. One can be \n     very conservative or very liberal and still have a bipartisan \n     mindset. Such a mindset acknowledges that the other party is \n     also patriotic and may have some good ideas.\n\n  We should all remember, regardless of what our party affiliation is, \nthat compromise has been the hallmark of this country for more than 200 \nyears, especially in the U.S. Senate--compromise.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I certainly share my friend the \nmajority leader's views about Senator Lugar's record, but he has 8 more \nmonths to be among us and to serve this country. I think an appropriate \ntime to celebrate his outstanding career would be when it comes to an \nend here in the Senate.\n\n\n                            Time for Action\n\n  With regard to what has been going on here in the Senate, the problem \nclearly is the majority, which seems not to be interested in \naccomplishing anything but, rather, turning the Senate floor into an \nopportunity for show votes for the President and his campaign.\n  Earlier this week the President repackaged a list of old ideas into a \nPost-it note checklist for Congress. He said he did not want to \n``overload'' Congress. Unfortunately, besides the weekly political show \nvotes to which I just referred to coincide with the President's \ncampaign schedule, the work that needs to be done isn't--no budget, \nnothing to prevent the largest tax hike in history, and House-passed \nbills sitting in the hopper.\n  While the President is trying to manufacture arguments he can run on, \nHouse Republicans have spent the last year and a half voting on and \npassing energy and jobs bills. In fact, more than two dozen jobs \nproposals are currently collecting dust on the majority leader's desk. \nOne after another, the House has passed a budget, a small business tax \nbill, bills to expand domestic energy production, and bills to reduce \nburdensome, job-killing regulations. Despite some saying nothing can \nget done in an election year, they are not done yet over in the House. \nI commend my House colleagues for their leadership, energy, and good \nwork.\n\n  I have a suggestion. Instead of focusing on his political Post-it \nnote checklist, the President and Senate Democrats should show some \nleadership and work with Republicans to move on critical progrowth \nbills. These proposals will help provide certainty and provide a much \nneeded boost to our economy. They would allow businesses to plan for \nthe future and to begin to hire again.\n  Common ground can be achieved on these jobs bills, and Republicans \nstand ready to work with Democrats to get them passed. With nearly 13 \nmillion Americans unemployed and millions more underemployed or giving \nup looking for work altogether, inaction and political gimmicks and \ngames are really just not acceptable. Action is required by this \nPresident and this Congress now, not after the election or by some \nfuture Congress or administration. The country's problems are far too \npressing. The American people expect us to work together for the good \nof our country.\n  This year the Senate should pass a budget. Three years without a \nbudget is completely unacceptable. Congress should also move on \ncomprehensive tax reform, a true all-of-the-above energy policy, and \nthe elimination of burdensome regulations that are hurting businesses \nand hindering job creation. And we can't stop there. Congress must act \nswiftly to put forth a plan to deal with the largest tax increase in \nU.S. history that is only--only--8 months away.\n  These are issues that can't be dealt with overnight. We need to start \nnow. And anyone who says there is no time to get these things done \neither hasn't been watching the Senate floor lately or does not believe \nthis country is headed toward a fiscal cliff. Where is the Democratic-\nled Senate and the President? Where are they? What are they waiting \nfor? What is the reason for the delay? The President giving another \nspeech loaded with the same old ideas that have failed before is not \ngoing to cut it anymore. The President's Post-it note checklist is \ninsufficient to handle the challenges we face as a nation, and, \nfrankly, it is completely counterproductive.\n  Yesterday the majority leader said Democrats are willing to make the \ntough choices. Well, we are waiting. We are waiting. And with all due \nrespect, we have a tough time believing our friends across the aisle \nwhen the only issues they care about these days are show votes \ncoordinated with the White House for political gain. So today let's \nstop the show votes that are designed to fail. Let's stop the blame \ngames. Let's come together and do what the American people expect us to \ndo. As I said yesterday, our offer still stands. We are ready when you \nare.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                       Reservation of Leader Time\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nleadership time is reserved.\n  There will now be 60 minutes of debate on the motion to proceed to \nH.R. 2072 equally divided between the majority leader and the minority \nleader or their designees, with the majority controlling the first 30 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page S3053]]\n\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the motion to \nproceed to the passage of the Export-Import Bank, legislation that has \ncome over from the House and passed the House with a vote of 330 to 93, \na pretty resounding vote in favor of moving forward on the Export-\nImport Bank, which is a major tool to financing manufacturing in the \nUnited States when they have products to be sold around the globe.\n  We hear the President talk all the time about the fact that we need \nto increase our exports. This is a very important tool that has existed \nfor decades in helping businesses across our country produce product \nand get sales into overseas markets, so the fact this legislation \npassed the House again with an overwhelmingly positive vote--and, I \nshould point out to my colleagues here in the Senate, without \namendment. It was not amended on the floor. That is, my colleagues on \nthe House side, both Republicans and Democrats, worked out such a \npositive proposal that it went to the House floor without amendment.\n  Now we have the chance to bring it up here and pass this legislation, \nand I urge my colleagues to do so very quickly because this legislation \nand this authorization for the Export-Import Bank is expiring at the \nend of this month.\n  So, yes, here we are again at the eleventh hour. Instead of giving \npredictability and certainty to a very important program, we are down \nto the last minutes about whether it is going to continue to operate in \nthe normal way that it does. I am here to ask my colleagues on the \nRepublican side of the aisle to move forward, do as your House \ncolleagues did, agree to the legislation, and let's get it out of here \nso people know in and across America that this program will continue.\n  I toured Washington State, which has many companies that benefit from \nthe Export-Import Bank. One of them was a company in Spokane, WA, \nSCAFCO, which happens to be one of the largest makers of grain silos in \nthe world and they export these grain silos. They are used in the \nUnited States, but they are used all over the world. I saw 200 workers \nthere who know firsthand how important it is to get this legislation \nadopted and moved forward, because it means sales of those grain silos \nall around the world. They have used this financing mechanism to expand \noverseas sales to 11 new countries and to make sure they were \ncontinuing to compete on an international basis.\n  If you look over the last 5 years, this bank has supported over $64 \nbillion of sales and exports in Washington State. Yes, some of those \njobs are related to aviation, but 83,000 related jobs in Washington \nState are small businesses, companies such as Sonoco in Moses Lake \nwhich is a machine shop, and they do repair parts for aircraft for 40 \ndifferent clients spread across the globe.\n  We were at another company in Yakima, a music company. If anybody has \nheard of Manhasset Music Stands, it is an unbelievable story of a \nsuccess of a company that has sales of over $1 million to various \ncountries around the globe; and people definitely like the fact that \nMade in America means quality and that they have been able to access \nall of these markets.\n  We saw a company in the Everett area, Esterline, which has built \nairplane parts and employs over 600 people, and has used this \nagreement. Basically, they build the overhead cockpit part of airplanes \nand they sell those to a variety of businesses all around the globe.\n  Without the financing of the Ex-Im Bank, these companies lose out on \nan international basis to the financing mechanisms that other countries \nhave, whether that is Canada, Europe, or other places. This program is \nvery successful and, I might add, adds billions of dollars back to the \nU.S. Government. This is not a program that costs us money. This is a \nprogram that basically generates revenue back to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I want to say to my colleagues, there were several things that were \nadded in the House bill--a GAO report on evaluating the banks and \ncapital market conditions, making sure they do an annual report on due \ndiligence and the purpose of the loan, additional requirements by \nTreasury, making sure we continue to oversee the Ex-Im Bank; so lots of \nlanguage in making sure there is transparency in the Ex-Im Bank \nfinancing mechanism.\n  This is a good resolution. I applaud my colleagues in the House, \nRepresentatives Hoyer, Cantor, and Boehner, who all worked on this \nagreement, and I hope my colleagues move quickly on it.\n  There is one thing we know right now. We need to do everything we can \nto help our economy and to help jobs. The Ex-Im Bank has been a proven \njob creator in the United States, helping U.S. companies compete \ninternationally. It has helped us pay down the deficit in the past. Now \nall we need to do is give it the certainty that it will continue to \noperate as of May 31 this year. So let's get on with this business of \nmaking sure we are focusing on the economy, and make sure, for the Ex-\nIm Bank, we proceed to this measure and pass it as soon as possible.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, let me associate myself with \nthe remarks of my colleague from the State of Washington, Ms. Cantwell.\n  I heard the Republican leader talk about a progrowth agenda. There is \nnothing more progrowth than exporting American goods and services \noverseas to the growing markets all over the world, and the Ex-Im Bank \nhas a long record of providing the foundation on which our businesses, \nsmall, medium, and large, can do that. So let's bring up what the House \nhas passed and move it through this Chamber as fast as possible.\n\n\n            stop the student loan interest rate hike of 2012\n\n  Mr. President, I mentioned I wanted to stand this morning and speak \non behalf of students all across America.\n  In my home State of Colorado, students and recent college graduates \nare literally struggling with a mountain of loan debt. As a mountain \nclimber myself, I understand that mountains can be overcome. But in an \neconomy such as this one, where recent college graduates are struggling \nto find work, we need to do more. We need to do everything we possibly \ncan to make college more affordable. And that is where we, the \nCongress, come in.\n  The interest rate, as we all know, on the federally subsidized \nStafford loans is set to double on July 1, barring congressional \naction, so we don't have much time to play political games here before \nthe mountain of debt facing our students begins to grow even higher.\n  Student loans play a crucial role in making higher education possible \nfor millions of Americans. For many Americans, higher education is the \ngateway to their future careers and to better paying jobs. That is a \ngood thing for our families and it is a good thing for our economy, \nagain referencing the Republican leader's concerns about a progrowth \nagenda.\n  More specifically, let me talk about what the federally subsidized \nStafford loans do. They are designed for American students from low- to \nmiddle-income families so that they too can afford to go to college. At \na time when students are facing escalating tuition costs and an \nuncertain job market after graduation, it would truly be irresponsible \nfor us not to act as soon as possible. But I have to report to you and \nour colleagues that we are being blocked from doing just that.\n\n  There is a commonsense proposal before us that would prevent these \nstudent loan interest rates from doubling, but it is being \nfilibustered. All these students want--all the young people we all know \nwant--is an opportunity to better themselves and contribute to our \nNation's economic growth. We have a chance to offer them that \nopportunity, but we have got to end the political games here and get to \nwork. We can't let partisanship stand in the way of a college education \nfor young Americans. It doesn't make sense, certainly out in my State \nof Colorado. Coloradans understand this, and they are telling me--as I \nthink they are in the Presiding Officer's State, and States all across \nthe country--just get it done. There is no time left to just get it \ndone.\n  I asked Colorado students through my Facebook page to contact me with \ntheir concerns so I could share them here on the Senate floor, and I \nwanted\n\n[[Page S3054]]\n\nto bring their voices directly to the Congress so we would all \nunderstand better what is at stake in Colorado and all over our country \nso it might give us some additional motivation. So I wish to share a \ncouple of stories here on the floor of the Senate.\n  Justyne Espinal is from Aurora. She is a single mother of two \nchildren. She is currently enrolled in nursing school after being \ndisplaced from her job in the mortgage industry. She enrolled in \nnursing school so she could provide for her family and contribute to \nthe workforce. She said:\n\n       I am just barely making ends meet and need the help of \n     student loans. Please don't double my interest rate.\n\n  Then there is Nicholas Collins, a senior communications major at the \nUniversity of Colorado. He is in the middle of preparing for final \nexams this week, but he took time to write to me, and he wrote:\n\n       Senator Udall, I will be graduating two weeks from today. I \n     could not imagine a future where students would be forced to \n     pay up to $1,000 more per year to pay off their loans . . . I \n     would not be in the position I am today if it wasn't for \n     federal aid.\n\n  The concerns that are expressed by Justyne and Nicholas are just a \ncouple of vivid examples of the concerns facing millions of American \nstudents.\n  As you know, and we all know, there is a broad consensus that we have \nto prevent these Stafford loans from doubling on July 1. However, many \nof our friends on the other side want to raid the Prevention and Public \nHealth Fund to offset the cost of these student loans. This fund is \naimed at preventing chronic disease and it was implemented as a part of \nthe Affordable Care Act. The Prevention and Public Health Fund helps to \nreduce chronic diseases, including diabetes and heart disease, while \nalso providing much-needed dollars toward immunization for children.\n  I understand that the health bill was controversial. But to continue \nattacking it, especially when students' futures are on the line, is \npuzzling, to say the least. While we could be closing unfair tax \nloopholes, as the underlying bill proposes, the Republicans here in the \nSenate are telling us we have to choose between a bright future for our \nstudents or preventing chronic disease for millions of Americans. That \ndoesn't make sense. This is about providing opportunity. To say we can \nno longer care for the sick or help prevent chronic disease if we want \nto help students is a false and, I might say, political choice.\n  There are plenty of tax loopholes, big oil subsidies and other \nsavings, that don't leave students, the sick, or hard-working Americans \nout in the cold. We owe it to people such as Justyne and Nicholas to \ncome together to find a way to ensure that American students continue \nto have access to affordable loans. I look forward to working with you \nand our colleagues here in the Senate to make sure we do right by our \nNation's students on this. I would urge all of us to end this impasse \nand, instead, work together. Let's roll up our sleeves, literally and \nfiguratively, and find the right solution. Let's prove to Coloradans, \nto the students in Colorado and to all the students across our country, \nthat the Senate can accomplish something important for our Nation's \neducation system, our country, and our way of life.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n                         Senator Richard Lugar\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise to just say a few \nwords about my good friend and my mentor in the Senate, Senator Richard \nLugar. I heard both leaders this morning mention Senator Lugar, and I \nthought I would rise for a minute to talk about him because I have been \nlucky to have him as a mentor since I arrived in the Senate. Senator \nMark Pryor organized for our class, when we came in, mentors, usually a \nsenior Democrat, senior Republican, and Senator Lugar was that mentor \nfor me. As a result of that, I have spent a great deal of time with \nhim, both in the Foreign Relations Committee and in a variety of \nmeetings and he has always given me very valuable advice. Above all, \nhis advice was to urge bipartisanship, not for its own sake but because \nit is what makes the Senate work and what allows us to move forward.\n  As one of the leaders pointed out, he is going to be with us for 8 \nmore months, but I think there was something very important in the \nstatement he made and I will read a few words and ask unanimous consent \nthe full statement be printed in the Record thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I want to read a few words from what he said \nafter he suffered this electoral loss. These are words we should all \nlisten to in the Senate because they are so wise. They give us advice \nand put us on a path we should be on. These are Senator Lugar's words.\n\n       Legislators should have an ideological grounding and strong \n     beliefs identifiable to their constituents. I believe I have \n     offered that throughout my career. But ideology cannot be a \n     substitute for a determination to think for yourself, for a \n     willingness to study an issue objectively, and for the \n     fortitude to sometimes disagree with your party or even your \n     constituents. Like Edmund Burke, I believe leaders owe the \n     people they represent their best judgment.\n       Too often bipartisanship is equated with centrism or deal \n     cutting. Bipartisanship is not the opposite of principle. One \n     can be very conservative or very liberal and still have a \n     bipartisan mindset. Such a mindset acknowledges that the \n     other party is also patriotic and may have some good ideas. \n     It acknowledges that national unity is important, and that \n     aggressive partisanship deepens cynicism, sharpens political \n     vendettas, and depletes the national reserve of good will \n     that is critical to our survival in hard times. Certainly \n     this was understood by President Reagan, who worked with \n     Democrats frequently and showed flexibility that would be \n     ridiculed today--from assenting to tax increases in the 1983 \n     Social Security fix, to compromising on landmark tax reform \n     legislation in 1986, to advancing arms control agreements in \n     his second term.\n       I don't remember a time when so many topics have become \n     politically unmentionable in one party or the other. \n     Republicans cannot admit to any nuance in policy on climate \n     change. Republican members are now expected to take pledges \n     against any tax increases. For two consecutive Presidential \n     nomination cycles, GOP candidates competed with one another \n     to express the most strident anti-immigration view, even at \n     the risk of alienating a huge voting bloc. Similarly, most \n     Democrats are constrained when talking about such issues as \n     entitlement cuts, tort reform, and trade agreements. Our \n     political system is losing its ability to even explore \n     alternatives. If fealty to these pledges continues to expand, \n     legislators may pledge their way into irrelevance. Voters \n     will be electing a slate of inflexible positions rather than \n     a leader.\n       I hope that as a nation we aspire to more than that. I hope \n     we will demand judgment from our leaders.\n\n  Those are the words of Senator Lugar. I think they are very wise \nwords. I think we should all read his whole speech and try to put the \nSenate on a better path.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Sen. Richard Lugar:\n       I would like to comment on the Senate race just concluded \n     and the direction of American politics and the Republican \n     Party. I would reiterate from my earlier statement that I \n     have no regrets about choosing to run for office. My health \n     is excellent, I believe that I have been a very effective \n     Senator for Hoosiers and for the country, and I know that the \n     next six years would have been a time of great achievement. \n     Further, I believed that vital national priorities, including \n     job creation, deficit reduction, energy security, agriculture \n     reform, and the Nunn-Lugar program, would benefit from my \n     continued service as a Senator. These goals were worth the \n     risk of an electoral defeat and the costs of a hard campaign.\n       Analysts will speculate about whether our campaign \n     strategies were wise. Much of this will be based on \n     conjecture by pundits who don't fully appreciate the choices \n     we had to make based on resource limits, polling data, and \n     other factors. They also will speculate whether we were \n     guilty of overconfidence.\n       The truth is that the headwinds in this race were \n     abundantly apparent long before Richard Mourdock announced \n     his candidacy. One does not highlight such headwinds \n     publically when one is waging a campaign. But I knew that I \n     would face an extremely strong anti-incumbent mood following \n     a recession. I knew that my work with then-Senator Barack \n     Obama would be used against me, even if our relationship were \n     overhyped. I also knew from the races in 2010 that I was a \n     likely target of Club for Growth, FreedomWorks and other \n     Super Pacs dedicated to defeating at least one Republican as \n     a purification exercise to enhance their influence over other \n     Republican legislators.\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\n       We undertook this campaign soberly and we worked very hard \n     in 2010, 2011, and 2012 to overcome these challenges. There \n     never was a moment when my campaign took anything for \n     granted. This is why we put so much effort into our get out \n     the vote operations.\n       Ultimately, the re-election of an incumbent to Congress \n     usually comes down to whether voters agree with the positions \n     the incumbent has taken. I knew that I had cast recent votes \n     that would be unpopular with some Republicans and that would \n     be targeted by outside groups.\n       These included my votes for the TARP program, for \n     government support of the auto industry, for the START \n     Treaty, and for the confirmations of Justices Sotomayor and \n     Kagan. I also advanced several propositions that were \n     considered heretical by some, including the thought that \n     Congressional earmarks saved no money and turned spending \n     power over to unelected bureaucrats and that the country \n     should explore options for immigration reform.\n       It was apparent that these positions would be attacked in a \n     Republican primary. But I believe that they were the right \n     votes for the country, and I stand by them without regrets, \n     as I have throughout the campaign.\n       From time to time during the last two years I heard from \n     well-meaning individuals who suggested that I ought to \n     consider running as an independent. My response was always \n     the same: I am a Republican now and always have been. I have \n     no desire to run as anything else. All my life, I have \n     believed in the Republican principles of small government, \n     low taxes, a strong national defense, free enterprise, and \n     trade expansion. According to Congressional Quarterly vote \n     studies, I supported President Reagan more often than any \n     other Senator. I want to see a Republican elected President, \n     and I want to see a Republican majority in the Congress. I \n     hope my opponent wins in November to help give my friend \n     Mitch McConnell a majority.\n       If Mr. Mourdock is elected, I want him to be a good \n     Senator. But that will require him to revise his stated goal \n     of bringing more partisanship to Washington. He and I share \n     many positions, but his embrace of an unrelenting partisan \n     mindset is irreconcilable with my philosophy of governance \n     and my experience of what brings results for Hoosiers in the \n     Senate. In effect, what he has promised in this campaign is \n     reflexive votes for a rejectionist orthodoxy and rigid \n     opposition to the actions and proposals of the other party. \n     His answer to the inevitable roadblocks he will encounter in \n     Congress is merely to campaign for more Republicans who \n     embrace the same partisan outlook. He has pledged his support \n     to groups whose prime mission is to cleanse the Republican \n     Party of those who stray from orthodoxy as they see it.\n       This is not conducive to problem solving and governance. \n     And he will find that unless he modifies his approach, he \n     will achieve little as a legislator. Worse, he will help \n     delay solutions that are totally beyond the capacity of \n     partisan majorities to achieve. The most consequential of \n     these is stabilizing and reversing the Federal debt in an era \n     when millions of baby boomers are retiring. There is little \n     likelihood that either party will be able to impose their \n     favored budget solutions on the other without some degree of \n     compromise.\n       Unfortunately, we have an increasing number of legislators \n     in both parties who have adopted an unrelenting partisan \n     viewpoint. This shows up in countless vote studies that find \n     diminishing intersections between Democrat and Republican \n     positions. Partisans at both ends of the political spectrum \n     are dominating the political debate in our country. And \n     partisan groups, including outside groups that spent millions \n     against me in this race, are determined to see that this \n     continues. They have worked to make it as difficult as \n     possible for a legislator of either party to hold independent \n     views or engage in constructive compromise. If that attitude \n     prevails in American politics, our government will remain \n     mired in the dysfunction we have witnessed during the last \n     several years. And I believe that if this attitude expands in \n     the Republican Party, we will be relegated to minority \n     status. Parties don't succeed for long if they stop appealing \n     to voters who may disagree with them on some issues.\n       Legislators should have an ideological grounding and strong \n     beliefs identifiable to their constituents. I believe I have \n     offered that throughout my career. But ideology cannot be a \n     substitute for a determination to think for yourself, for a \n     willingness to study an issue objectively, and for the \n     fortitude to sometimes disagree with your party or even your \n     constituents. Like Edmund Burke, I believe leaders owe the \n     people they represent their best judgment.\n       Too often bipartisanship is equated with centrism or deal \n     cutting.

I hope \n     we will demand judgment from our leaders. I continue to \n     believe that Hoosiers value constructive leadership. I would \n     not have run for office if I did not believe that.\n       As someone who has seen much in the politics of our country \n     and our state, I am able to take the long view. I have not \n     lost my enthusiasm for the role played by the United States \n     Senate. Nor has my belief in conservative principles been \n     diminished. I expect great things from my party and my \n     country. I hope all who participated in this election share \n     in this optimism.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in just 2 weeks, similar to many proud \nparents, I will be watching as my youngest daughter walks across the \ngraduation stage. For some students, this important milestone marks the \nend of their college days and the beginning of a professional career. \nThis achievement should be filled with hope for a great future, but for \nmany it will be a story saddled with student loan debt and uncertainty \nabout the economy, their job prospects, and their future.\n  As I have listened to many of my Democratic colleagues discussing the \nextension of a special interest rate for the subsidized Stafford loans, \nI continue to hear false statements that would lead one to believe \nRepublicans don't support extending this interest rate for students. \nThis is simply not true.\n  In my State of South Dakota, nearly 30,000 students received \nsubsidized Stafford loans during the 2010 2011 school year. While I \nsupport alleviating financial pressure on students, I did not support \nthe partisan legislation brought forward by Majority Leader Reid that \nwould extend subsidized Stafford loans while raising taxes on some \nemployers, not because the goal of the legislation is misguided but \nbecause the way the majority leader proposed to pay for the legislation \nis misguided.\n  Majority Leader Reid's legislation, similar to its Republican \ncounterpart, would extend the special rate of 3.4 percent for \nsubsidized Stafford loans that existed for the 2011 2012 school year to \nthe 2012 and 2013 school year. I agree with the extension of this \nspecial rate and would simply ask the majority leader to allow a vote \non the Republican alternative, which I might add, passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a bipartisan vote on April 27. I voted against \nmoving to the majority leader's bill because I disagree on two grounds \nwith the way my Democratic colleagues proposed to pay for the temporary \n1-year extension.\n  First, I fundamentally disagree with the idea of a permanent tax \nincrease on certain job creators to pay for a temporary 1-year \nextension. We are talking about permanent tax changes to pay for \ntemporary spending. That is bad policy. I furthermore believe any \ndiscussion about raising taxes should be addressed in a comprehensive \ntax reform discussion, not in a student loan bill.\n  Second, I disagree with diverting the payroll tax revenue away from \nthe Medicare and Social Security trust funds, where it would ordinarily \nbe directed. We saw this done during the health care bill a couple \nyears ago, where Medicare reductions and revenue increases that were \nsupposed to go to\n\n[[Page S3056]]\n\nextend the lifespan of Medicare were, in fact, used to pay for new \nspending. We cannot continue to try to fool the American people that we \nare somehow extending the lifespan of Medicare when we are spending \nthat money on new programs.\n  We are essentially double counting revenue and spending the same \nmoney twice. We cannot do that. We cannot do that anywhere else in the \ncountry, in this economy. Yet in Washington, DC, that has become the \npractice. What this would do is take changes in the Tax Code that would \nordinarily go into the payroll tax fund or Medicare trust fund and now \nthat is going to be used to pay for something else. This is a practice \nwe cannot continue; we cannot sustain. We all know our trust funds are \nheaded toward bankruptcy and continuing to raid them and use them for \nother purposes is simply a recipe for disaster.\n  I agree with the 37 business groups that wrote a letter to Leaders \nReid and McConnell strongly opposing the $9 billion tax increase on \nsmall businesses proposed in the majority leader's legislation. These \ngroups represent millions of employers, and they range from the \nNational Federation of Independent Business to the Independent \nCommunity Bankers, to the National Restaurant Association. These 37 \nbusiness groups all oppose the tax increases that would be included to \npay to keep the interest rate at 3.4 percent.\n  I believe there could be bipartisan support for a proposal that has \nbeen put forward by Senators Enzi and Alexander, who are both leaders \non education policy in the Senate. They proposed an alternative that \npays for a temporary 1-year extension of a 3.4-percent interest rate by \ntaking money from a slush fund created by ObamaCare in 2010. The \nPresident and Democrats have supported taking money from the slush fund \nin the past, so it seems odd that now they are suddenly up in arms in \nsupport of a slush fund that is supposedly aimed at prevention.\n  The President's own fiscal year 2013 budget proposal recommends using \nthe prevention slush fund for other Federal priorities. My Democratic \ncolleagues in the Senate supported taking $5 billion from the fund \nmerely 11 weeks ago. So there is broad support for the idea of \nprevention, but the recent record of the use of prevention dollars \nshows these dollars are not being spent wisely. Funds in the prevention \nslush fund can be used on almost anything in the name of prevention and \nwellness. For example, jungle gyms, bike paths, farmers' markets, those \nare the types of things this so-called prevention slush fund is being \nused for. Keep in mind that in 2010, my Democratic colleagues used the \n$9 billion in savings in Federal student program aid to pay for part of \nObamaCare instead of using that money to address the looming issue of \nthe scheduled return to these higher interest rates on student loans.\n  It only seems rational and fitting to use the money that came from \nthe student loan industry to address the interest rates for subsidized \nStafford loans. At least it strikes me as very logical that since these \nfunds were diverted from the student aid fund in the first place to pay \nfor ObamaCare, we ought to recapture some of those funds to help keep \nstudent loan interest rates at the lower 3.4 percent level.\n  It is particularly interesting that the President suddenly has taken \nsuch a deep interest in this issue, when in 2007 he didn't even show up \nin the Senate to vote for the original legislation that created the \ntemporary phased-down interest rate for subsidized Stafford loans. So \ndespite the President's rhetoric, the greatest threat to young people \nlooking for a job isn't the loan rates but the Obama economy.\n  This year's crop of college students looking for jobs is confronting \nan economy in which unemployment has remained above 8 percent for 39 \nstraight months. A recent Associated Press report found that one out of \nevery two recent graduates is jobless or underemployed within 1 year of \nfinishing school. Graduates who are lucky enough to find a job will \nearn 9 percent less than if they had graduated just a few years ago.\n\n  A Gallup poll released this week gives even more bad news for young \nadults. According to Gallup, underemployment for 18- to 29-year-olds \nhas hovered around 30 percent for most of the past year. Those \ngraduates lucky enough to find employment are more likely to find jobs \nas waitresses and bartenders than as engineers, physicists, chemists, \nand mathematicians.\n  On Tuesday, the President was out touting his to-do list for \nCongress. That is particularly interesting since the President had 3\\1/\n2\\ years to put policies in place that would strengthen the economy. \nHere is what our graduates are getting. Here is what that Obama economy \nhas brought about: Long-term unemployment is up 89 percent; the number \nof Americans who are on food stamps is up 45 percent; gas prices have \ndoubled; college tuition is up 25 percent; worker health insurance \ncosts are up 23 percent; and the Federal debt we are passing on to \nfuture generations is up 47 percent. The only thing that has gone down \non his watch is home values, which is down 14 percent.\n  Our country and our college graduates have had enough of the Obama \neconomy. Instead of the to-do list the President has put forward, we \nhave a to-stop list for you. Stop job-killing regulations that are \nhurting our small businesses' ability to create jobs, stop trying to \nraise taxes on small businesses and job creators who are the people who \nare going to hire our college graduates, stop blocking the Keystone XL \nPipeline which would help wean our country from the dependence we have \non foreign sources of energy, and stop the divisive use of class \nwarfare that does nothing but divide Americans.\n  It is time for the President and Congress to come to the realization \nthat we have to shift our focus away from election-year standoffs and \ncome together to focus on changing the course of our lagging economy so \nwe can once again put our young people back to work, which is the real \nobjective that should be our focus. These other issues, which are a lot \nof campaign gimmicks, a lot of opportunities to politicize this issue \nor that issue, are counterproductive in the long run. The floor of the \nSenate is being used, it seems more and more these days, to make \ncampaign points, political points, rather than to address the \nfundamental issues that are affecting Americans and our economy.\n  I would hope we can come together to work in a constructive way on \npolicies that will get Americans back to work, and that means doing \nsomething about these regulations which are crushing the ability of our \nsmall businesses to create jobs. We hear about it every single day.\n  When I travel my State of South Dakota or elsewhere around the \ncountry, I hear from businesses, the people out there trying to create \njobs, about regulations, about taxes, about the cost of things, their \ninputs going up. Those are the issues we ought to be addressing. We \nought to figure out how to reform the Tax Code, how to reduce Federal \nspending and reform the entitlement programs so we can save Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  We ought to look at what we can do to put in place a real all-the-\nabove energy strategy that would help keep energy costs affordable for \npeople out there creating jobs. In my view, those are the types of \nthings on which we ought to be focusing.\n  Frankly, we have seen a lot of action and activity in the other body, \nin the House of Representatives, many bills they have sent to the \nSenate that are small business bills that would address these very \nissues, such as the high cost of regulations, the issue of taxation, \nthe issue of energy independence--all these things that we believe \nwould lead us toward a stronger economy that would get Americans back \nto work and offer more opportunity to young people, to our college \ngraduates as they emerge from their programs of study this year and in \nyears to come.\n  Yet we continue to have the rhetoric on the floor of the Senate \nsuggesting that somehow Republicans are not in favor of keeping \ninterest rates low for student loans. Think about that. It is illogical \nto even suggest that. However, we do have a fundamental difference of \nfinance as to how we ought to pay for that. The other side suggests we \ncould pay for that by raising taxes on people who create jobs.\n  We believe we ought to go back and take the funds out of the \nprevention slush fund, which in the first place was created out of \ndollars that were allegedly saved when the Federal Government took over \nthe student loan program, which happened as a part of\n\n[[Page S3057]]\n\nObamaCare. Not a lot of people realize that because it got buried in \nthe whole debate over health care.\n  The student loan program, which used to be administered out of \nprivate lenders where they originated and serviced the loans, has now \nbeen taken over by the government. In doing so, savings were counted \nthat were then used to pay for the cost of the health care bill. So all \nwe are simply doing is saying the slush fund that was created by the \nfunds that supposedly were saved by moving the student loan program \ninto the government ought to be used for student loan fund programs to \nactually keep the funds that ought to be used to fund keeping the \ninterest rate low, down at 3.4 percent for college students today. As I \nsaid, it seems very fitting to me, very logical, and very intuitive \nthat would be the way we would fund this.\n  But to suggest for a minute that somehow Republicans in the Senate \nare not in favor of keeping interest rates at as low a rate as possible \nfor our college students is completely missing the point. It is massive \nelection-year politics, and I hope we can get away from that and focus \non not only a solution in the near term with this issue but also the \nbigger issue.\n  The bigger issue is the fact that I just mentioned, that literally \none-half of all college students who are coming out are either not \nfinding jobs or are underemployed. Those who are finding jobs are \nmaking significantly less than those who graduated just a few years \nago. That is an economic problem. That is a problem that needs to be \naddressed not by simply having a debate about student loans but what we \nare going to do to get this economy growing again and get American \nbusinesses creating jobs.\n  We need to make it less expensive and less difficult for American \nbusinesses to create jobs, not more expensive and more difficult, which \nis precisely what is happening as a result of the policies coming out \nof this administration in the form of regulations and many of the \nlegislative initiatives that are coming out of the Congress or at least \nproposed to come out of the Senate.\n  I wish to work with my colleagues on solutions that will put \nAmericans back to work and give our college graduates greater \nopportunity, greater hopes for a higher standard of living and higher \nquality of life, something many of us have inherited from those who \ncame before us. These opportunities are increasingly at risk and in \njeopardy because of the amount of spending and the amount of debt and \nthe policies coming out of Washington that are making it increasingly \ndifficult for us to come out from underneath an economy that has anemic \ngrowth and chronic high unemployment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. First, I wish to thank the Senator from South Dakota for \nhis leadership in this area and very much agree with the comments he \njust made. Last week, while home in Arkansas, I had the opportunity to \nvisit some of our State's excellent universities. While spending an \nafternoon at the University of Central Arkansas, I saw firsthand the \ninnovative ways that UCA promotes undergraduate education in all areas, \nincluding science, arts, nursing, and business. For instance, the \nuniversity's nursing program has entered into a partnership with a \nlocal hospital that will dramatically help address our State's growing \nnursing shortage.\n\n  One day later I was at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock to see \nits brandnew nanotechnology center. It is quite amazing. It is a state-\nof-the-art center that prepares students for a future in the exciting \nnew world of nanotechnology, which in layman's terms is working with \nmatter on an atomic and molecular scale.\n  Arkansas is well poised to take advantage of this exciting new world \nof economic opportunities and capitalize on nanotechnology \nbreakthroughs discovered in UALR and other universities throughout the \nState. By pooling the brain power of academic and corporate partners \nthroughout the State, the center's research is sure to lead to advances \nin the field of nanotechnology.\n  These innovative programs at UCA and UALR are perfect examples of how \nArkansas' universities are moving forward with the future in mind. Our \nhigher education institutions are in an elite class. We are blessed \nwith top-notch facilities and premier educators. But that comes at a \nprice.\n  The increasing mandates that Arkansas--and every State for that \nmatter--are facing as a result of ObamaCare hurts our ability to fund \nour State schools. The extra burden placed on the State's Medicaid \nProgram means much less money to spend for education. Our universities \nare forced to raise their tuition to cover the shortfall. Higher \ntuition puts the dream of college out of reach for many young \nAmericans. This is why the Stafford student loan program is so \nimportant. Loans help students overcome obstacles they face when it \ncomes to accessing a quality, affordable education. My three daughters \nattended college, so I am well aware of the financial toll tuition \ntakes on a family's finances.\n  So we have to fix this issue concerning the interest rate increases \nbefore July 1. These interest rates should not be allowed to double. \nBut the troubles facing young Americans are greater than rising \ninterest rates for student loans.\n  For our graduates, it doesn't matter from where one gets one's degree \nif there are no jobs to be had once a person has a diploma in hand, and \nthat is the problem with the job market our young people are graduating \ninto today.\n  The reality is it is a tough time to be young. We have the lowest \nemployment-to-population ratio for young adults since 1948. Over half \nof Americans under 25 who hold a bachelor's degree are unemployed or \nunderemployed. Nearly 25 million adults live at home with their parents \nnot out of choice but because they can't find work or earn enough to \nsurvive on their own. Any way we cut it, college graduates ready to \nchase the American dream have a huge roadblock awaiting them in this \neconomy. We have to stop this trend. We have to work together.\n  While giving Arkansas students access to the very best education \npossible at an affordable rate, we must also work to ensure there is a \nhealthy job market awaiting them upon graduation.\n  Earlier this week, the Senate majority brought forth its bill to \nextend the lower interest rate on federally subsidized Stafford college \nloans. I think everyone in this body agrees this needs to be done, and \nI am confident we will find a way to accomplish it before the deadline. \nBut the reason the Senate majority's proposal failed is that it is the \nwrong approach.\n  Their proposal funded the extension by raising taxes on our small \nbusinesses. This idea of taxing and spending our way out of our fiscal \nmess is why the economy has not rebounded. Continuing down this path \nwill only make it harder for graduates to enter the workforce.\n  Let's do what we all agree needs to be done and extend the low-rate \nloans, but let's be smart about how it is paid for. The proposal \nsupported on this side of the aisle is identical to the version that \npassed the House in a bipartisan manner. It freezes the rate for 1 year \nby using money from an unused ObamaCare account to pay for it. This \nmoney is just sitting there, obligated for a program that is not \noperating, and the President already proposed cutting it in his own \nbudget. It is likely this money will never be spent. So let's use it \nfor a reason we all support: protecting student loans.\n  Student loans are supposed to increase access to college by helping \nmillions of Americans earn a college degree. The student loan program \nshould be a gateway to the workforce, not a barrier. Any extension of \nthe low-rate loans paid for by tax increases is simply that--a \nbarrier--because tax increases stifle job creation. Let's fix the \nproblem without making our economic situation worse and get America \nworking again.\n  With that, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S3058]]\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. \n2072, the Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2012. I believe \nthis jobs legislation will help provide U.S. exporters and workers with \nan important tool to compete in the global marketplace.\n  The Export-Import Bank is the official export credit agency of the \nUnited States, and it assists in financing the export of U.S. goods and \nservices to international markets. Following the financial crisis, the \nbank experienced a dramatic increase in its activities as many \ncompanies struggled to find financing in the private market. Last year, \nthe bank committed almost $33 billion in support of U.S. exports, a new \nrecord.\n  The bank has been self-funding since 2008, returning nearly $2 \nbillion to the Treasury. In fiscal year 2011 alone, the bank generated \n$400 million to offset Federal spending and bring down the budget \ndeficit. When other countries are helping their own companies with \nexport financing, we cannot afford to unilaterally disarm in the face \nof this global competition.\n  The Export-Import Bank's charter directs it to use exports to support \nAmerican jobs, and last year the Export-Import Bank supported almost \n290,000 Americans jobs. These are jobs in cities and towns across the \nNation, at large companies as well as small businesses. In fact, last \nyear the Export-Import Bank financed more than $6 billion in exports by \nsmall businesses. In my home State of South Dakota, Ex-Im has worked \nwith large and small businesses to help export goods all over the \nworld.\n  Last September, there was unanimous bipartisan support when we passed \na 4-year reauthorization bill out of the Banking Committee. \nUnfortunately, that measure was blocked on the Senate floor in March.\n  The legislation before us today reflects a bipartisan compromise \ndeveloped in the House. While this bill is not perfect, I believe it is \nimportant to pass this legislation and ensure that the Export-Import \nBank is able to continue providing financing assistance to American \nexporters and workers.\n  This is a jobs bill. Earlier this week, the House passed this bill by \nan overwhelming majority, 330 to 93. This bill extends the \nauthorization of the bank until 2014. Like the Senate bill, this \nlegislation will increase the bank's lending authority to $140 billion. \nThis is a significant improvement over earlier drafts in the House to \nonly increase the cap to $113 billion. Adopting the Senate's proposed \nlending authority limit helped to improve this bill. There are also \nadditional provisions in the House bill similar to provisions in the \nSenate bill that will add transparency and accountability requirements \nfor the bank, improve the bank's information technology infrastructure, \nextend the bank's Sub-Saharan African Advisory Panel, and provide for \ngreater oversight of the bank's financing and any risks it might have \nto taxpayers.\n  I am also pleased the House included language that strengthens \nrestrictions against companies doing business with Iran. These \nprovisions, which reflect an earlier agreement by the House and Senate \ncommittees of jurisdiction, are vital to our efforts to increase the \npressure on Iran's illicit nuclear program. I believe they are \nimportant provisions that strengthen the bill, and I am glad the House \nincluded them.\n  Lastly, the legislation includes the Senate's language on domestic \ncontent. This language, which is supported by labor groups, has \nimportant protections in it to ensure that goods exported by the bank \ncontinue to be made in America. Although there were efforts in the \nHouse to weaken this provision, I am pleased to see the House accepted \nthe Senate's position on this important issue.\n  After multiple short-term extensions, I am relieved to see that this \nCongress will finally reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. I believe by \nreauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, we are taking an important step \nin supporting American businesses and workers. I commend Minority Whip \nHoyer and Majority Leader Cantor in the House for coming to an \nagreement. I also thank Majority Leader Reid for his tireless efforts \nin working to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank.\n  As chairman of the Banking Committee over the next few years, I will \ncontinue to closely monitor the efforts of the Ex-Im Bank to ensure \nthat it is effectively and efficiently supporting American exporters \nand workers. Today I urge all my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                        Password Protection Act\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, privacy is a fundamentally and almost \nuniquely American value. It is the reason the Colonies rebelled--one of \nthe major reasons they rebelled--against the British. The invasion of \nour homes by British soldiers without court approval, the lodging of \nthose soldiers in our homes without permission--the invasion of the \nfundamental rights of privacy was one of the basic reasons this Nation \nsought independence from the British. So throughout our history, \nprivacy has been a value, a fundamental right affirmed again and again \nin our courts, enshrined in our Constitution and ingrained in our way \nof life.\n  That is the reason so many of us were offended and regarded as \nreprehensible and repugnant a practice that was revealed recently--a \npractice involving employers coercing and compelling the disclosure of \nlog-in information, user names, and passwords to private accounts and \nprivate systems by job applicants. And the same kind of coercion and \ncompulsion applied to current or existing employees as a condition of \ntheir continuing in their jobs. That kind of practice is abhorrent, and \nit is the reason that yesterday I, along with a number of my colleagues \nfrom both this body and others from the House of Representatives, \nintroduced the Password Protection Act of 2012.\n  These practices are unacceptable for a number of reasons. An employer \nhas plenty of ways other than accessing private accounts--Gmail, \nstorage data, and accounts on Facebook or other social networking \nsites--to obtain information that is relevant to employer needs and \ninterests in offering a position to someone. There are other means that \nare adequate and acceptable. What is not acceptable is coercing and \ncompelling access to an applicant's e-mail account, which could contain \nall kinds of personal information that is inappropriate and unnecessary \nfor an employer to know, information that is irrelevant, in fact, to \nthe terms and duties of a person's employment.\n  Second, the disclosure itself endangers the security of that \napplicant's personal data as well as the Web sites themselves. Too many \ncareless companies too often have lost customer data or employee \ninformation, allowing it to be breached through poor security \npractices. That is the reason I have proposed a measure that would \nrequire safeguards of that data--a separate measure that is before this \nChamber now--to ensure adequate remedies when there are breaches and to \nrequire systems in place by employers to guard that information. An \napplicant who takes care to use encrypted networks or other personal \nsafeguards may find his or her personal information--financial data, \nmedical information--breached through no fault of his or her own simply \nbecause the company fails to take adequate steps to safeguard it.\n  There is another reason these practices are abhorrent; that is, \nidentity theft by the employer itself--a continuing danger. That kind \nof potential danger is a real one that certainly raises this interest \nvery squarely.\n  But maybe as important as any of these other interests is the danger \nof compromising the security of third parties--loved ones, family, \nfriends--who have entrusted the person who is\n\n[[Page S3059]]\n\napplying for a job or who is employed by a company that breaches its \nresponsibility by demanding this information. When an employer logs in \nto an employee's personal account, he sees that employee's e-mails with \nhis or her spouse or Facebook pictures of siblings and children. Those \nparties are completely unaware that one of their friends' or family \nmembers' employers may be reading their correspondence or looking at \ntheir pictures. Imagine a daughter who tells her mother of a pregnancy, \na son who acknowledges an addiction to a parent, a father who speaks of \nhis wife's illness in confidence to his children. Each has an \nexpectation of privacy that is betrayed and violated when an employer \ndemands log-in information, user names, or passwords from a job \napplicant or a current employee. The impact is not only on that \nemployee or job applicant but on innocent loved ones--friends, family--\nwhose confidential information, e-mails, and other data may be exposed.\n  Of course, when information is exposed in this way, there is the \ndanger of discrimination based on marital status, sex, gender, and \nother kinds of prohibited categories. So barring the compelled \ndisclosure of this information actually is an aid to the employer \nbecause it ensures that none of these hiring or firing decisions is \nbased on a prohibited category or discrimination.\n  The Password Protection Act addresses all these concerns and \nprohibits employers from forcing prospective or current employees to \nhand over personal, private financial information that has no place in \nthe hiring process. The bill prohibits an employer from compelling or \ncoercing an employee or prospective employee to provide access to a \nprivate system as a condition of employment. This means an employer \ncannot compel a prospective or current employee to provide his Gmail \npassword, and an employer cannot force an employee or prospective \nemployee to log on to a password-protected account so the employer may \nbrowse the account's content.\n  The Password Protection Act also very importantly prohibits \nretaliation, which is a danger with current employees. That retaliation \ncould take all kinds of forms, but the demand for log-in information, \nuser names, or passwords certainly creates a kind of presumption that \nthe refusal to do so prompts action that can be regarded as \nretaliation. An employer who violates these legally required duties is \nsubject to a penalty of $10,000 per violation.\n  This act will protect employees from unreasonable invasions of their \nprivacy--unreasonable invasions that have no commonsense basis--and it \nprevents unintended consequences. It doesn't prohibit social networking \nwithin the office on a voluntary basis, it does not bar employers from \nconducting valid investigations of misconduct, it does not prevent an \nemployer from controlling the company's own system--its own Facebook \naccount, for example--and it provides that States may exempt certain \ncategories of employees, such as individuals who deal with children who \nare under 13 years of age or Federal employees who may have access to \nclassified or secure national security information. The bill also \nprovides for reasonable exemptions that State law may make for State \nemployees who are involved, for example, in law enforcement or \ncorrections.\n\n  Like so many in this body, I have heard from countless Connecticut \ncitizens who are not only offended but outraged by these practices \nreported in the press. Fortunately, many employers have shown they get \nit, they understand this deeply held value, and they have rejected \nthese possible practices. Many who might have been contemplating \nengaging in them have likewise retreated and reversed their decisions. \nSo merely shining a light, pointing the spotlight, and raising the \nissue has brought many employers to understand the commonsense force of \nobjections to these practices.\n  I wish to thank grassroots groups, such as the 57,000 citizens at \nBold Progressives, who signed a petition at ProtectOurPasswords.org to \nlet Washington know--57,000 of them strong--they reject the idea that \ntheir employers will force them to hand over this personal, private \ninformation. I thank the activists at Access Now, who are similarly \ngenerating a groundswell of support for this initiative and working to \nprotect employees' rights on the job. I also wish to thank companies \nsuch as Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, and Google, which have cooperated \nand support this effort because they have an interest in preventing \ninvasions of privacy, demands for information that are unnecessary, \nrepugnant, reprehensible, and unacceptable. I thank all of them for \nworking with us on this legislation.\n  Finally, I thank Senators Schumer, Klobuchar, Shaheen, Wyden, \nSanders, and Akaka, as well as Representatives Heinrich and Perlmutter \non the other side of this body, for working with me in introducing this \nbill. I am hopeful the Congress will consider it promptly and \nsuccessfully because I think it sets a marker and provides a milestone \nin protecting individual privacy against abhorrent invasions in the \nworkplace and elsewhere that have no place in American life.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                      Student Loan Interest Rates\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, unless we act quickly, students across the \ncountry will face the largest increase of subsidized student loan \ninterest rates in more than 40 years. In the last 40 years, the \ninterest rates on subsidized student loans have never doubled from one \nyear to the next. Yet that is what is happening unless we act before \nJuly 1--just 52 days from now.\n  Unless my colleagues on the other side of the aisle relent and allow \nlegislation to fix this problem to come to a vote, we will see a \ndoubling of the student loan interest rate from 3.4 percent to 6.8 \npercent for all borrowing going forward for education in the United \nStates related to the subsidized Stafford loan program. I know the \nPresiding Officer of the Senate, Senator Brown of Ohio, has been taking \nan active leadership role on this front, along with Senator Harkin, to \nensure we can move effectively to prevent this doubling of the interest \nrate.\n  We are now in a time where, if you look across the financial \nindustry, borrowing rates are at historical lows. We are essentially \nproviding banks, through the Federal Reserve, with near zero percent \ninterest loans. So it is incomprehensible that at this time, we would \nactually double the loan rates we would charge students who are going \nto college. Students and families cannot absorb these increases. It is \na tough economy, and they are facing rising tuition and dwindling State \nsupport for higher education, making it more difficult and more \ncomplicated. To add to their burden by doubling this loan rate is bad \npublic policy.\n  This will not only directly affect middle-income Americans, but in \nthe longer run, it will affect the competitiveness, the productivity, \nand the success of our economy in a very competitive global economy.\n  We have to ensure also that we are not piling more and more debt on \nstudents. We have reached a point where student debt is becoming so \nextraordinarily difficult to bear that it inhibits people from going to \nschool and it inhibits them from pursuing various professions after \nthey graduate from college. If we add to this mountain of debt, we will \ncreate a huge financial problem going forward not just for the \nindividual borrowers, the student borrowers, but for our economy.\n  According to Georgetown University's Center on Education and the \nWorkforce, over 60 percent of jobs going forward will require some \npostsecondary education by 2018.\n  That underscores the essential need to go to college. In 2010, only \n38.3 percent of working-age adults had a 2-year or 4-year degree. So we \nare looking at a gap of the prepared individuals with a college \neducation versus those jobs in the not-too-distant future that will \nrequire a college education. In order to fill that gap, we have to get \nmore and more young people into school, into higher education and \nbeyond, and by doubling the rate we will not be achieving that goal and \nthat objective.\n  That is why I introduced the Student Loan Affordability Act in \nJanuary to permanently keep the interest rate low, and that is why I \nwas joined by Senator Brown of Ohio and Senator Harkin and many others, \nto step up and to make it quite clear that we cannot afford--for our \ncountry's sake and for the sake of many working-class\n\n[[Page S3060]]\n\nfamilies across the country--to double this rate.\n  We should be debating today the Stop the Student Loan Interest Rate \nHike Act. This is a fully paid-for 1-year extension of the current \nrate, to extend it for a year so we can look for a more permanent fix. \nMy colleagues on the other side of the aisle insist they agree that we \nhave to do this, yet they continue to filibuster this legislation. They \ncontinue to prevent us from bringing it to a vote. It is clear they \nhave an alternative view in terms of how we pay for it. Well, let's put \nthat to a vote, but let's not stop dead in its tracks a policy that \nboth sides claim has to be fixed and that we have to avoid the doubling \nof this interest rate.\n  What we have done is propose to fix this problem and pay for it in a \nfiscally responsible manner by closing a glaring, egregious loophole in \nthe Tax Code that enables certain wealthy individuals to shirk their \nresponsibility to pay payroll taxes. This loophole predominantly \nbenefits professional service providers such as accountants, lobbyists, \nand lawyers who derive all of their income from their professional \nlabor. But because they choose to mischaracterize their income as a \ndistribution from a subchapter S corporation instead of wages, they \navoid paying payroll taxes.\n  In 2005, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration issued \nan audit report calling for action on this loophole which was described \nas a ``multibillion dollar tax shelter.''\n  The report also described a disturbing trend of businesses changing \ntheir status to the subchapter S corporation for the purpose of \navoiding payroll taxes--not for the purposes of expanding employment, \nnot for the purposes of a new or more efficient way to use capital, but \nessentially a tax dodge to avoid payroll taxes.\n  The inspector general reported:\n\n       In fact, advising small businesses to shelter earnings from \n     self-employment taxes through the formation of S corporations \n     has become a cottage industry. A search of the Internet \n     yields multiple sites that offer advice, assistance, and \n     encouragement to sole proprietors to convince them to become \n     S corporations. The sole proprietors are advised that they \n     can save thousands of dollars a year in employment taxes \n     simply by incorporating. It is also possible on the Internet \n     to gauge the size of the savings using computer-generated \n     savings amounts based on the user's entries for anticipated \n     profits and chosen salary levels. Not surprisingly, the lower \n     the salary chosen, the higher the savings become, reaching \n     maximum savings at a salary level of $0.\n\n  Essentially what is being done in these professional corporations--or \nat least professional partnerships, these professional associations--is \nthat they have glommed onto a very clever tax shelter. You incorporate \nas a subchapter S; you have your employer pay the subchapter S \ncorporation; that subchapter S corporation pays you a modest minimal \nsalary, and the rest is dividends taxed at a different rate and not \nsubject to the payroll tax. We are trying to close the tax loophole. \nFollowing the indications of the inspector general, a simple Internet \nsearch confirms this finding.\n  For example, one Web site has a section entitled ``How to Reduce Your \nFICA Taxes If You Own an S-Corporation.'' That section provides a step-\nby-step instruction on how to use this loophole and even provides \nadvice on how to avoid being caught up in an audit. The Web site \nadvises owners of S corporations to pay themselves the lowest possible \nsalary to reduce their FICA taxes--even if the distributions they take \nare a product of their labor.\n  Here is how the Web site explains how to take advantage of this \nloophole: It explains that as an employee of your S corporation, your \nsalary is subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes, but the net \nprofit of the S corporation is not subject to payroll taxes. The Web \nsite goes on to explain:\n\n       . . . the idea is to pay yourself the lowest possible \n     salary to minimize social security and Medicare taxes. Then \n     you take the remaining net profit as a distribution, which is \n     not subject to payroll tax.\n\n  This is a loophole we are trying to fix. This loophole should be \nfixed regardless of how we use the proceeds; but, frankly, we have a \nsituation now where we have a pressing need to help families across \nthis country avoid a doubling of the interest rate on student loans, \nand we have an egregious loophole that will allow us to responsibly pay \nfor the maintenance of the lower interest rates. This seems to be an \nissue where public policy is well balanced.\n  We are told by our colleagues they agree with us you can't double the \ninterest rate. They should also agree with us you can't continue to \ntolerate this loophole; and this is not only an appropriate way, but, \nindeed, it seems to me the best way to achieve our objective of \npreventing the increase to doubling of the student interest rate.\n  We are working very hard to try to get this bill up for a vote. If \nthere are other proposals with respect to tax loopholes or the ways in \nwhich we can pay for this other than the proposal the House has \nsuggested--which is go into the prevention funds for health care \nreform, which to me is adding to and compounding not only our fiscal \nproblems but also going forward to our health care problems we are open \nto discussing them.\n  We are right now recognizing that unless we aggressively have \nprevention programs, our health care costs will explode going forward. \nEvery day, people talk about the increasing cost of obesity in this \nsociety. Well, how do you get essentially a handle on that? You have to \nhave resources for prevention, for counseling, for education, for \nnutritional programs. When we take those funds away, we run up the bill \nfor health care. That bill ultimately is being paid, in many cases, by \nthe same families who are struggling to find a way to send their \nchildren to college.\n\n  I urge all of my colleagues to move to get this bill on the floor. If \nwe want to debate about different methods about payment, that is fine; \nlet's take votes, and let's move on to passage.\n  I think we understand that time is running out. On July 1, the \ninterest rate will double. We have seen progress going back a few \nmonths. Our colleagues on the other side were proposing budgets that \nrecognized--indeed, supported--the doubling of this interest rate. In \nMarch and throughout the spring, they were assuming and they were \nsupporting measures to double the interest rate. The good news now is \nthey have said, no, you can't do that, we have got to keep the rate at \n3.4 percent at least for the next year.\n  We are one step closer to a solution, but the final step is going to \nhave to be responsibly paying for this proposal. And we have--Senator \nBrown, Senator Harkin, myself, Senator Harry Reid, and so many others--\nnot only a responsible way to pay for it, but we have underscored and \nhighlighted what is an egregious loophole, a tax shelter, a very clever \nploy to avoid paying taxes on your wages through the mechanism of a \nsubchapter S corporation magically converting them into dividends.\n  I think we can accomplish two important public policy goals in this \nlegislation: keeping interest rates on student loans at the current \nlevel, helping families send their children to school; and closing a \nglaring loophole for tax dodgers in our tax system.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I want to join Senator Reed of \nRhode Island, who just spoke very persuasively about the need to freeze \ninterest rates for Stafford loans for college students in America. He \nalso spoke, I thought very convincingly, about closing a tax loophole \nthat has clearly been used to avoid--legally--taxes by lobbyists, \nconsulting groups, lawyers--all of whom are using this tax loophole to \nthe tune of tens of thousands of dollars, in many cases. The case of \nformer Senator John Edwards and his law firm--not like most law firms \nbut in his law firm--and former Speaker Newt Gingrich, one a Democrat \nand one a Republican, have shown the size of this loophole and how it \ncan turn into tens of thousands of dollars. I am not accusing either of \nthese gentlemen of doing anything illegally--\n\n[[Page S3061]]\n\nonly taking advantage of a loophole we should close.\n  I come to the floor to make the case how important these subsidized \nStafford loans are to college students. In my State of Ohio--as in the \nState of the Presiding Officer, the State of North Carolina--we have \nhundreds of thousands of students using these Stafford subsidized \nloans; in Ohio, some 380,000; in North Carolina I assume it is not too \nfar off that. Students have enjoyed, if that is the right word, 3.4 \npercent interest rates on their loans rather than something higher.\n  What is discouraging is that this was a bipartisan effort. In 2007, \nthe year I came to the Senate, President Bush and Democrats, the \nmajority in both Houses, joining with many of my Republican colleagues \nin this body and the House of Representatives, locked in the subsidized \nStafford student loan rate of 3.4 percent for 5 years from 2007 until \nthis July. That expires in July. It was bipartisan then; it should be \nbipartisan now. But a couple days ago the Republicans filibustered. I \nam hopeful today or whenever this next vote is taken they will not.\n  I am going to, for 3 or 4 minutes, read a small number of letters, \nstories I have gotten from students in my State of Ohio who have come \nto my Web site and told us their stories. I urge people in Ohio to come \nto this Web site, brown.senate.gov/collegeloanstories. Just tell us \nyour story.\n  I am not so cynical, but I think when my colleagues start listening \nto people at home, listening to students--I was at Wright State College \nnear Dayton the other day and the University of Cincinnati and Cuyahoga \nin Cleveland. I met with students and I listened to their stories. \nSeveral of them stood and talked about what these student loans mean. \nAlready, the average student who graduates from an Ohio 4-year \nuniversity graduates with debt of about $27,000. That means it is much \nharder for them to start a family, to buy a car, to buy a home, to \nstart a business. That is why it is so important not to heap more \nburdens on them, put more debt on them.\n  I will close by reading three letters. Cody from Delphos, OH, \nnorthwest Ohio:\n\n       I graduated high school with the goal in mind to get my \n     doctorate in pharmacy. After five years of hard work I am 9 \n     months of practice rotations away from achieving my goal.\n       Along with that achievement comes a paralyzing amount of \n     college debt from attending a private university.\n       In addition, I have hopes of doing an additional two years \n     of residencies after I graduate to specialize in critical \n     care/trauma, but since residencies pay less than half of a \n     pharmacists salary I may not be able to go further and reach \n     my goal of becoming a clinical pharmacist specialized in \n     critical care/trauma.\n       Help me reach my goals by keeping interest rates low and \n     helping create affordable means by which those from low \n     income families can attend college without have to accumulate \n     the debt I have had to.\n       Allow youth to reach their full potential and be able to \n     serve society in their best capacity by finding a solution to \n     the rising cost of an education.\n\n  Nonya from Wooster, OH, east of where I grew up in Mansfield, about \n30 miles away, writes:\n\n       Going to College changed my life and my whole families \n     lives. The only reason I even considered going to college was \n     because my mom did. The only reason she was able to go was \n     student loans.

I was Pell \n     grant eligible. I took out Stafford loans. I also took out a \n     private loan from my parents' credit union and committed to \n     the full number of hours of federal work-study that I was \n     eligible for. Even as a college freshman, I was deeply aware \n     that the Pell grant, Stafford loans, and federal work-study \n     programs were giving me access to an excellent education that \n     otherwise would have been beyond my reach.\n       I worked hard in my classes, graduating Phi Beta Kappa and \n     summa cum laude in two majors: Chemistry and English. I \n     worked hard in my co-curricular activities, editing the \n     college literary magazine and serving as president of the \n     campus feminist organization. I also worked hard in my on-\n     campus jobs: grading papers for the French department, \n     tutoring in the Writing Center, mixing reagents in the \n     Chemistry stockroom, and washing dishes in the student union \n     diner.\n       With the outstanding education I had obtained--and a \n     manageable amount of student loan debt to repay--I chose to \n     go to graduate school in Chemistry. I earned a Ph.D. from \n     Stanford University in 2003 and am now a tenured professor of \n     Chemistry and Biochemistry at Oberlin College in Oberlin, OH. \n     I teach bright young people who are interested in making the \n     world a better place. I also conduct research on ovarian \n     cancer detection that has been funded by the NIH. This is my \n     dream job, and it began with the access to an excellent \n     education.\n       It breaks my heart to think that if I were a high school \n     senior today, I might not have the same opportunities to \n     achieve. The Stafford loans, Pell grant, and federal work-\n     study programs helped me become the educated person I am \n     today.\n\n  These three letters were not different from the others. I just picked \nthe top three my staff gave me from stories we have gotten because of \nour Web site. I will repeat the Web site: brown.senate.gov/\ncollegeloanstories.\n  This tells us about work ethic. It tells about opportunity.\n  I will illustrate it in one other way. I cannot do it as well as \nNonya and Rebecca and Cody did, but we all remember, if we paid \nattention to our history, in the forties and fifties, the GI bill gave \nliterally millions of young American men and women returning from \nserving their country the opportunity to go to school. What the GI bill \ndid was help millions of individual Americans, one at a time. But what \nthat did collectively is it raised all boats. It created a huge amount \nof prosperity for our country because all these people went to college.\n  A lot of these people bought homes. Colleges were growing and \nexpanding, creating more jobs. These people started businesses. These \npeople were productive workers. These people invented things because \nthey had the education, from going to college.\n  With these Stafford loans, it is not just helping Cody and Rebecca \nand Nonya and students today, it is helping all of us as a society, \nwhether one goes to college or not. Some people don't want to go to \ncollege. Fine. We have career centers and trade schools and community \ncolleges to learn welding, to learn carpentry, to learn how to be a \nhealth care worker, to learn rad tech, whatever people want to do, or \ngo to a 4-year college. Give them the opportunity because we don't just \nhelp millions of Americans or millions of individual young people, we \nhelp society as a whole when we do this.\n  I pray and beg my colleagues, please pass this, keep student loan \nrates manageable, interest rates manageable so we can have more \nRebeccas and Nonyas and Codys in our country. We will all benefit.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, during the worst recession since the \nGreat Depression, which we are now fortunately coming out of, the \nhighest the unemployment rate we ever got, even at the depths of that \nrecession, for people with a college degree was 4.5 percent. We saw \nunemployment rates of 18 percent, 20 percent for certain groups of \npeople--4.5 percent if one is a college graduate. It seems to me, first \nof all, that is an incredible stress test of the value of a college \ndegree in this 21st century in which we are living. We ought to be \nmaking it easier, not harder, for students to go to college. However, \nas we know, interest rates on Federal student loans are scheduled to \ndouble from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1, unless Congress can \nget out of its own way and do what is right. For the life of me, I \ndon't know why we\n\n[[Page S3062]]\n\ncannot come to an agreement. This is not a Democratic or Republican \nissue.\n  The cost of college has increased 550 percent since 1985. Two-thirds \nof students in this country rely on loans to afford college. In the \npast decade, average student loan debt has increased by more than 25 \npercent.\n  This, by the way, is not a function of people not doing the right \nthing. It is a function of the fact that median family income has \ncontinued to decline in this country for the first time in this \ncountry's history, while the cost of college has escalated like crazy. \nIf this increase goes through, it would add thousands of dollars of \ndebt to the more than 166,000 Coloradans who currently receive Federal \nstudent loans. Increasing the cost of loans for students already \nstruggling to repay their loans harms both individual students and our \nfragile economy.\n  When I visited the University of Colorado at Denver just last month, \nI heard firsthand from students about how important low-interest rates \nare to that ability to afford college. Many of the students I heard \nfrom were worried their student loan debt would prevent them from \nachieving their career goals or buying a house or making other \ndecisions they are confronting. In Colorado, the average student \ngraduates with more than $23,500 in debt. Just in the last hour, \nJeremiah shared the following story with me on Facebook. This is less \nthan an hour ago. He wrote:\n\n       I am studying geography and environmental science with an \n     emphasis on urban studies and planning at the University of \n     Colorado, Denver. I am the first of my family to attend \n     college and 100 percent of my schooling is paid for by grants \n     and student loans. I worry about the interest rate hike that \n     is bound to happen this summer, and with the economy not in \n     full recovery I worry even more about securing a job after \n     graduation and how to afford repayment of my loans, \n     especially if interest rates are to increase.\n\n  As the Presiding Officer probably knows, in her State and my State, \ncollege attendance is actually at a record high because there are young \npeople all over this country--certainly in my State--who have sought \nrefuge on our university campuses from an economy that doesn't have \njobs for them--which is a great place for them to be. It is a great \ninvestment in them and a great investment in our future. But for \nJeremiah and thousands of others, millions of other students just like \nthem, we are threatening, through our inaction, to actually drive up \nthe cost of college when that is where they need to be. That is the \nreason why, in the last 2 weeks, more than 1,300 Coloradans have \nwritten to my office to demand Congress act to prevent the student loan \ninterest rate from doubling.\n  Here is one letter I received from Kim Haas, who is from Granby, CO. \nShe wrote:\n\n       While I try to keep informed, I don't generally make a \n     point to contact my representatives. On the issue of student \n     loan rates doubling, I had to speak up.\n       My husband and I live in rural Colorado. I have been \n     working toward becoming a professional counselor. Because of \n     our remote location, I have done most of this online while \n     staying home with my son. This takes a lot of self-motivation \n     and time management skills. It also means taking on a lot of \n     debt. Please take the actions necessary to prevent my rates \n     from doubling. It is imperative to our financial, vocational, \n     and life success.\n\n  Her life success. I suspect that most of these students are not all \nthat interested in what party affiliation they are in. I think if they \nwere here on this floor, which is empty today, they could use some \nColorado common sense to actually get this done. In the Senate and in \nWashington today we are facing a filibuster even though we know in the \nend we are going to find a way to do what is right and keep these \ninterest rates from rising.\n  Also, our Facebook page is continually updated. This is from Phil \nTownsend who wrote in--and I thought this was a pressing question about \nwhat we are focused on today.\n  Here is how Phil put it:\n\n       If you had a loan that would take you a decade to pay off \n     even if you lived as cheap as possible and only ate ramen \n     noodles, would you want its rates doubled?\n\n  This is real life for the people we represent, and we should get this \nsorted out.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to come \ntogether and give our students all across the country the security they \nneed to pursue their education. For them this isn't a game. For the \npeople who came to the University of Colorado at Denver a month ago and \nshared their thoughts with me, this isn't a game. This is real life. It \nis their lives. It is their futures. They are relying on us to sort \nthis out and get it done, and we should.\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I want to take the opportunity to \ndiscuss the importance of reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank. Last \nmonth while in Colorado I had an opportunity to visit innovative \nbusinesses such as Coolerado, which creates energy-efficient air \nconditioners, Sandhill Scientific, which manufactures medical devices, \nand Leitner-Poma, which builds gondolas for ski resorts. They are \nbuilding the gondola that is being installed in Vail this year to mark \nVail's 50th anniversary. It was fun to see those American jobs being \ncreated for that great American industry.\n  All of these companies rely on financing options from the Export-\nImport Bank to help them compete in the international marketplace. In \nfact, while visiting Coolerado, I actually saw an 18-wheel truck back \nup to the loading dock at Coolerado to load a bunch of their devices to \nbe shipped to Europe as a consequence of the work they had done with \nthe Ex-Im Bank.\n  These are manufacturing jobs right here in the United States, stamped \n``Made in America'' on the outside of these devices, and we have been \nunable to get this through the Senate. Coolerado used credit insurance \nfrom the Export-Import Bank to help enter the international market.\n  As we emerge from the worst recession since the Great Depression, we \nshould look for more opportunities to support the next Coolerado, \nSandhill Scientific, or Leitner-Poma. Instead, we have been in this \nprolonged debate about the very existence of the bank, and now we are \nweeks away from the expiration of the bank's charter.\n  I am quite sure there is not a single one of our international \ncompetitors around the world that is engaged in this debate. In fact, \nthey are engaged in absolutely the reverse, which is the question of \nhow to create more exports for their domestic industries, and we should \nbe doing the same.\n  As we look to strengthen and to reverse that curve I talked about \nearlier of median family income falling and to see rising wages again \nin this country and create more jobs, we should be looking for \nopportunities to increase exports at small businesses like the ones I \nsaw in Colorado.\n  We face a profound structural issue in the economy today in this \ncountry. As I said on the Senate floor before, our gross domestic \nproduct is now higher than it was before we went into this recession, \nand productivity has been going off like a skyrocket since the early \n1990s. As we responded to competition from China and India, the use of \ntechnology to make businesses more efficient and the recession itself \ndrove productivity through the roof because firms had to figure out how \nto get through these difficult times with fewer people.\n  Median family income has fallen, and we have 23 or 24 million people \nin this economy who are either unemployed or underemployed. Wage growth \nand job growth--for the first time in the country's history--has \ndecoupled from GDP growth. That happened during our last recovery under \nthe previous administration. I make this statement not as a partisan \nobservation; that is just the time that it happened. We saw economic \ngrowth, but we didn't see wage growth and we didn't see job growth. Now \nI fear we are seeing the same sort of trend in our economy.\n  There are two important solutions. One I mentioned earlier, which is \nthat education is vitally important because if people are educated, \nthey are more likely to get a job in this 21st-century economy. \nRemember, the worst that the unemployment rate ever got for people with \na college degree was 4.5 percent.\n  The other part of that equation is innovation. It is businesses that \nstart tomorrow, next week, and the week after that are actually going \nto create jobs that are going to lift wages. This is one of the reasons \nI have been so glad to work with the Presiding Officer as we think of \nnew ways of approaching regulations at the FDA to ask the question: Are \nwe driving bioscience in the United\n\n[[Page S3063]]\n\nStates or are we driving venture capital offshore to look for other \nopportunities? We should be up day and night thinking about this in the \nSenate because that is how we are going to bring an alignment back \nbetween the economic growth the economists tell us we are having and \nthe job growth and the wage growth the people at home want to see.\n  There is a lot of talk in this Chamber about winners and losers and \nhow the government shouldn't pick winners and losers--we hear that a \nlot here--as if the current Tax Code isn't full of choices that have \nalready been made about winners and losers. A lot of those choices that \nhave been made have been made for the benefit of incumbents--not here \nbut incumbent enterprises. However, it is the innovators that we are \nleaving behind.\n  As we think about comprehensive tax reform, which I hope we get to \nsooner rather than later, I think on every one of these questions we \nshould be asking ourselves: Is this credit or is this incentive or is \nthis inducement more or less likely to drive job growth in the United \nStates, to drive incomes up in the United States, or to drive exports \nfrom the United States? If the answer to that is no, we should stop \ndoing it. This has to be more thoughtful than a fight between one \nnarrow interest and another narrow interest. I think the American \npeople are demanding that, and we should respond.\n  In the short term, the work in front of us now is to get this Export-\nImport Bank bill to the floor, to get it voted on, and to pass it as \nthey did in the House of Representatives yesterday.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I know we are on the motion to proceed \nto legislation dealing with the Ex-Im Bank. I rise today to urge my \ncolleagues to proceed to this bill and to move forward and pass H.R. \n2072, which would reauthorize the Export-Import Bank. We have a lot of \ndebate on this floor on how we can grow our economy and grow jobs. One \nof the areas where there is agreement is that if America is going to be \ntruly competitive in the 21st century, we have got to grow our export \nmarket.\n  Many American companies over the 20th century were blessed with the \nworld's largest, most vibrant domestic market. But that market is \nmaturing. On a going-forward basis, literally 95 percent of all the \nworld's customer base lies outside the boundaries of the United States. \nSo while maybe some of my colleagues may disagree with many of the \nPresident's goals, I think we would all agree that doubling of exports \nin a 5-year timeframe the President laid out at the beginning of his \nadministration is an area where there is great agreement.\n  If we are going to do that, we have to use all the tools we have \navailable because, unfortunately, right now American exports as a \npercentage of GDP rank behind Germany, Canada, China, Italy, France, \nthe UK, India, Brazil. We are way down in the middle of the pack. As \nthe Chair of the Banking Committee's International Trade and Financing \nSubcommittee, I have spent a lot of time and effort trying to get into \nthe details to see how we can make the Export-Import Bank one of the \ntools we have to help American businesses grow their exports, grow that \npercentage of GDP that depends upon trade, grow that ability to reach \nthat 95 percent of the customer base around the world, and to make sure \nthat this tool, which has been a successful tool for close to 45 years, \ngets reauthorized but also is reauthorized in a way that brings more \ntransparency and more accountability to this institution.\n  The bill we will have before us, hopefully later today, does that, \nbecause if we fail to act, the authorization for the Export-Import Bank \nexpires at the end of this month, and this tool that is so important to \ngrowing exports, growing jobs, candidly will be lost.\n  The bill we will take up, hopefully later today or shortly, \nreauthorizes the Export-Import Bank for 3 years. While I would have \npreferred a longer extension and a higher limit, higher absolute total \nloan limit, I am glad the bill we will deal with increases the bank's \nlending limit from $100 billion to $140 billion.\n  Remember, our Export-Import Bank is so much smaller than any of our \ncompetitors'. Even taking the lending cap up to $140 billion will still \nmean we will pale in comparison to our competitors. These other nations \nare who we are competing with. I think it is important that we compare \nhow our Export-Import Bank--which again in this last year made a \nprofit, returned money to the taxpayers, and has been profitable year \nin and year out--how our institution compares with those of our \ncompetitors: Canada, our largest trading partner, the Canada that has a \npopulation size about one-tenth--actually smaller than one-tenth the \nsize of the United States--has their equivalent Export-Import Bank \nthree times the size of our Export-Import Bank.\n  Every day our Export-Import Bank and the American companies it \nsupports face aggressive competition, as I mentioned, from China, \nBrazil, India, which all have very large export financing banks in \ntheir own right. In 2010 alone China did $45 billion in lending, two-\nthirds of that to a single company, lending that was supported by their \nexporting financing operations, while our domestic Export-Import Bank \ndid just $13 billion in total. So China, close to over 3 times, \nsupporting their institutions, one of our largest competitors, versus \nour support for our American industry at one-third the size.\n  That same year, Brazil, a country much smaller than ours, provided \n$18 billion in export finance; Germany, more than $22 billion; France, \nmore than $17 billion; all much more than what we do. Each of them only \nhas, as I mentioned, in total about one-fifth of our population.\n  So why would we, if we all agree that growing trade, growing exports, \ntrying to access that 95 percent of the customer base that would then \nsupport American companies that are going to hire American workers, why \nwould we unilaterally disarm and remove this tool from our toolbox as \nsome in this Chamber have suggested?\n  Ironically, because in our country, we do not provide, I believe, \nadequate export financing, many American companies have gone to foreign \nexport agencies, the result being if they get that foreign export \nsupport, oftentimes the price of that foreign export support means that \nsubcontractors to those American companies then have to come from those \nrespective countries, whether it is Canada, Brazil, India, et cetera, \nagain costing American jobs.\n  I think this is a commonsense tool. It is a tool that has had a solid \ntrack record. It is a tool that has never cost the American taxpayers a \ndime. It is one that needs our immediate attention. Again, I hope we \nwill get a large, overwhelming bipartisan majority of Senators who will \nreauthorize the Export-Import Bank, will reauthorize it at this $140 \nbillion level, will reauthorize it with the new transparency provisions \nthat I was proud to add to this legislation, will reauthorize it with \nsome of the new requirements in which the Export-Import Bank puts \ntogether a more comprehensive business plan, all additions that I \nworked on with my colleagues and added to this legislation.\n  That is, again, one more example where we can demonstrate to the \nAmerican people we can come and work together, trying to spur that kind \nof job growth and export growth we are all looking for.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCASKILL.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask that I be allowed to speak as in morning business for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Morality of free enterprise: charitable giving\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I have been coming to the floor to discuss \nwhy\n\n[[Page S3064]]\n\nfree enterprise is morally superior to all other economic systems. I \nhave explored how free enterprise promotes the pursuit of happiness \nproperly understood, by emphasizing earned success, and how it lifts up \nthe poor by raising living standards.\n  Today, I want to look at another way free enterprise lifts up the \npoor--by promoting the moral principles that make people more \ncharitable and more socially responsible.\n  This perspective sharply contrasts with President Obama's campaign \nnarrative about social responsibility. He and many of his supporters \npaint free enterprise as a system that inherently clashes with social \nresponsibility. In his telling, free enterprise is a system that mainly \npromotes Gordon Gekko-style ``greed'' and riches for those who least \ndeserve them--a system that must be reformed through higher taxes and \nlarger government.\n  Most of the policies he has supported during the last 3 years \ndemonstrate this perspective. The size and scope of the Federal \nGovernment has increased dramatically during his presidency. As he \ncampaigns to get reelected, his main theme is that the only way some \nAmericans can do better is if the government makes others worse off.\n  There is an important counterargument to this negative narrative. In \na new book, The Road to Freedom, American Enterprise Institute \nPresident Arthur Brooks provides a comprehensive explanation of the \nmorality of free enterprise and how it makes everyone better off by \ncreating a more positive society. As Brooks writes, the principles that \nunderpin free enterprise are moral principles, such as honesty, \nindustriousness, thrift, and opportunity. Those principles make people \nmore virtuous, not less.\n  Participants in free enterprise, for example, must be able to trust \nthat those with whom they do business--that they will honor their \ncontracts. By promoting greater trust and integrity, free markets \npromote the social and psychological linchpin of democratic prosperity.\n  Brooks elaborates:\n\n       The free enterprise system requires a culture of optimism \n     and trust to function correctly--a positive sum, win-win \n     mentality, and a desire for everyone to be better off. For \n     many people, it produces more prosperity than they need to \n     meet their daily requirements, a surplus that they will \n     choose to direct to charitable purposes.\n\n  The prosperity and positive outlook that stem from free enterprise \nencourages people to help the neediest and most vulnerable members of \nsociety. Indeed, it is no coincidence that the United States is a more \ncharitable country than those with bigger welfare states. Those who \nbelieve in and have benefited from the free-enterprise system believe \nthat everyone should have the opportunity to prosper, and they are \nwilling to help take responsibility for lifting others up. ``Charitable \ngiving appears to be part of most Americans' DNA,'' Brooks writes.\n  Americans are remarkably generous not only toward our fellow \ncitizens, but also toward those suffering abroad. On a per capita \nbasis, we give 3\\1/2\\ times as much to causes and charities as the \nFrench, 7 times as much as Germans, and 14 times as much as Italians. \nThese findings correlate to volunteering as well.\n  Seventy to eighty percent of Americans donate money to charity each \nyear. These donations add up to about $300 billion annually. The money \ngoes to religious causes and also secular activities, such as \neducation, health care, and social welfare. Americans also donate large \namounts of their time to help the less fortunate.\n  Indeed, there is a strong correlation between beliefs about the size \nof government and attitudes toward giving. As Brooks shows, those who \nbelieve in limited government give more to charity than those who hold \nmore statist views. That makes sense. After all, a statist might argue \nthat paying high levels of taxation is the equivalent of giving a lot \nto charity, since the government spends a large portion of its total \nrevenue on social programs. By contrast, free-marketers would argue \nthat government spending tends to crowd out private charity in ways \nthat are both socially and fiscally harmful.\n  Americans can take well-justified pride in their charitable giving. \nBoth in aggregate and relative terms, we are the most generous society \nthe world has ever known.\n  As budget and tax debates move forward, we must remember that raising \nthe top marginal tax rates could conceivably reduce charitable giving, \nbecause the biggest philanthropists would have less money to donate. \nThis is just one of the many unintended--and undesirable--consequences \nthat could result from the massive tax hike scheduled to take effect at \nthe end of this year. If excessively high rates of taxation were the \nbest way to cultivate a more generous and socially conscious citizenry, \nthen Europeans would give more to charity than Americans. But that is \nsimply not the case.\n  America's record on charitable giving demonstrates that free \nenterprise is the best way to boost charitable giving and foster the \ncivic virtues that underpin a broadly shared prosperity.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the ordinary middle-class family is \nstruggling to get a home loan. Tens of thousands of homeowners have \nlost their homes or are struggling to make payments on their home \nloans.\n  Meanwhile, Congress steadily dishes out billions of dollars in \ntaxpayer-subsidized loans to large profitable companies. Eighty percent \nof these export-import loans are given to companies that are in the \nFortune 500. So we are giving taxpayer loans to very profitable \ncompanies.\n  I am a great believer in capitalism, in the jobs corporations create. \nI defend profit and the benefits that accrue from leaving that profit \nlargely in the private sector. I am not one who clamors for punitive \ntaxes. I am not someone who thinks we need to punish corporations. But \nat the same time, I do not want my colleagues to construe that to mean \nI believe we should be subsidizing profitable corporations. I don't \nthink taxpayer-subsidized loans should go to profitable companies.\n  President Obama has been passing out loans to his campaign donors. He \nhas been using a campaign trough that he has set up over at the \nDepartment of Energy. Very wealthy multimillionaires and billionaires \nare getting loans through the Department of Energy, including Solyndra \nand BrightSource. People heavily involved in the President's campaign \nhave been getting subsidized loans.\n  Republicans have been rightly criticizing the President for these \nDepartment of Energy loans to Solyndra, BrightSource, and others. \nRepublicans have been correct in criticizing the President for trying \nto pick the winners and losers in energy production. Yet now a majority \nof Republicans are poised to vote for their own set of subsidized \nexport-import loans. In fact, they want to increase the export-import \nloans by nearly 50 percent and pick the winners and losers in the \nexport business. The Horse traders may disdain consistency, but the \nAmerican people value principled and consistent opposition to deficit \nspending. The American people know hypocrisy when they see it. The \nAmerican people know corporate welfare when they see it.\n  The Export-Import Bank, in fact, provided an $18 million loan to a \nsteel mill in China. Our steel industry has been in decline for decades \nand we loan $18 million to our competitors? Who in their right mind \nwould subsidize our Chinese competitors with loans? It makes no sense. \nCan we think of anything more insulting than loaning money to our \ncompetitors? Come to think of it, I might. We actually give foreign aid \nto China. We actually send China economic development assistance. Is it \nany wonder Congress has an 11-percent approval rating?\n  Many Americans are trying to hang on to their homes, struggling to \nmake the payments on their own home mortgage, while very profitable big \nbusiness is being given subsidized loans by the government. It makes no \nsense. What gives?\n  To add insult to injury, we are borrowing money from the same \ncountries we are lending the money to. So we borrow money from India \nbecause we\n\n[[Page S3065]]\n\nrun a deficit of over $1 trillion a year--we borrow money from India--\nand then we are sending it back to them in the form of taxpayer-\nsubsidized loans. It makes no sense.\n  Ex-Im loans, such as the loans to Solyndra and BrightSource, are \nsimply forms of crony capitalism. With trillion-dollar annual deficits, \nsurely we can vote to end corporate welfare. If companies are making \nbillions of dollars in profits, can we at least end the welfare we are \nsending to these corporations?\n  I urge a vote against reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank, and I hope my \nRepublican colleagues will see the inconsistency of criticizing the \nPresident on one hand for his crony capitalism and then turning around \nand doing the same thing.\n  I support not reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank, admitting it is \ncorporate welfare, and trying to save the taxpayers some of their hard-\nearned money.\n  Thank you very much, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                WEST Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Western \nEconomic Security Today Act, the WEST Act, which I recently introduced \nwith my good friend and colleague from Wyoming, Senator Barrasso. This \nbill is an outgrowth of our work with the Senate Western Caucus and the \nCongressional Western Caucus. These groups, which include my good \nfriend from Utah, Congressman Rob Bishop, and Congressman Steve Pearce \nfrom New Mexico, are truly leading the way. We have been doing the hard \nwork of identifying solutions that will promote job creation, boost \nAmerica's energy production, and put our Nation on a better fiscal \nfooting by encouraging economic growth.\n  We keep hearing from the Democratic leadership that Congress is \ndysfunctional. That may be. But it is not because of a lack of good \nideas. It is because--in an effort to help the President in his \nreelection and shield vulnerable Democrats--the decision was made to \npromote politically motivated show votes rather than sound job-creating \nlegislation.\n  Americans do not want higher taxes in the name of redistribution and \ngovernment-dictated fairness. They do not want bureaucrats in \nWashington figuring out how to spread the wealth around, as then-\ncandidate Obama put it in 2008.\n  What they want is economic opportunity and the security that comes \nwith it. They want the freedom and opportunity to pursue new ventures, \nstart new businesses, and save for their retirement and for their \nchildren's education.\n  If the Democratic leadership ever decides to listen to the American \npeople and advance reasonable legislation to grow the economy and \ncreate jobs, they could start with this WEST Act.\n  The WEST Act is a sound and solid bill, one that puts together some \nof the best ideas identified by the Western Caucuses, and my hope is it \nwill meet with bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  This bill could not come at a better time. The proposals in the WEST \nAct will go a long way toward generating the employment and economic \ngrowth that citizens and taxpayers are longing for.\n  The proposals in the WEST Act should not be controversial in the \nSenate. The President claimed his $\\1/2\\ trillion stimulus would create \nor save millions of American jobs. As it turned out, this was a hallow \npromise. But the WEST Act is the real deal. If the President and his \nparty are serious about stimulating the economy, this legislation is a \ngood way to do it and a good place to start.\n  The eight bills that Senator Barrasso and I have included in this \nWEST Act have all passed the House of Representatives. They are \ncommonsense, progrowth policies, and I am confident these proposals, if \nput to the vote of the American people, would pass overwhelmingly. They \ncertainly would in my home State of Utah. They should pass the Senate \nas well.\n  The bill has three main objectives.\n  First, we are going to put America back to work by producing more \nAmerican energy. Our bill ends the Obama administration's de facto \nmoratorium on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in a safe, responsible, \nand transparent manner. We set firm timelines for considering permits \nto drill, and we require the administration to move forward promptly to \nconduct offshore lease sales that have been delayed or cancelled in the \ngulf and Outer Continental Shelf.\n  The WEST Act sets a production goal of 3 million barrels of oil per \nday by 2027, reducing foreign imports by nearly one-third. At a time \nwhen every job counts, our bill would produce thousands of high-paying \njobs.\n  Second, our bill will help bring down energy prices, making it easier \nfor Americans to drive their cars and heat their homes. We could \nproduce over 1 million barrels of oil a day with our bill's elimination \nof confusion and uncertainty surrounding the EPA's decisionmaking \nprocess for clean air permits.\n  The bill prohibits the EPA Administrator from promulgating any \nregulation that takes into consideration the emission of a greenhouse \ngas in order to address climate change using the Clean Air Act.\n  And, third, our bill will protect agriculture by reducing unnecessary \nregulatory burdens. It amends the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act, or FIFRA, to ensure that National Pollutant Discharge \nElimination System permits are not needed for the application of \npesticides that are currently registered and regulated under FIFRA.\n  This provision of the bill will also ensure that diseases such as the \nWest Nile Virus can be managed through mosquito abatement. It is very \nimportant for communities in Utah to be able to address these issues \nwithout constantly seeking approval from Federal overlords.\n  The bill also stops the EPA from imposing more stringent dust \nstandards for 1 year. Additionally, it would afford States and \nlocalities the flexibility to address any rural dust issues before the \nFederal Government would have the authority to do so.\n  For the life of me, I do not understand the administration's stance \non energy production. The Department of Energy claims there are more \nthan 800 billion barrels of recoverable oil in oil shale in Utah, \nWyoming, and Colorado. This is more than the proven reserves of Saudi \nArabia. If we were able to develop this resource the way we are capable \nof doing, we could have a major impact on the jobless rate as well as \nthe cost of energy in our country.\n  Last month, one of largest oil companies in the world announced a \n$200 million investment in a commercial demonstration project for oil \nshale. The project will be in my home State, using technology developed \nby a Utah company.\n  Another major company that has been successfully developing \ncommercial oil shale for more than 80 years is opening offices in Salt \nLake City and seeking permits for a very large facility in my home \nState of Utah.\n  The State of Utah, local governments, and the business community \nsupport the development of these resources. Yet the President and his \nadministration are working to stop this at all costs. The most recent \nroadblock was the rewriting of the final 2008 three-State programmatic \nimpact statement to cut back by more than 70 percent the Federal lands \navailable for oil shale and oil sands development. Well, I believe \nstrongly that Interior Secretary Salazar has no authority whatsoever to \ntake that action.\n\n  I recently heard from an energy company in Utah that it is easier to \ndo business in Somalia than it is in the United States. Unfortunately, \nthat is not a surprising sentiment. But that is what we have come to \nexpect from President Obama. He talks a big game about fairness when it \ncomes to raising taxes, but his energy policies are both regressive and \nelitist.\n  In the interest of appealing to the environmental interests of his \nwealthy supporters, the administration leaves middle-class people \nbehind. Obstructing domestic energy production prevents the creation of \nhigh-paying jobs that provide good wages for families,\n\n[[Page S3066]]\n\nand it fails to bring down the high cost of fuel that hits middle and \nlower income families the hardest.\n  In fact, President Obama's energy agenda tops the list of pernicious \npolicies that hurt American families, hinder economic growth, and harm \nbusinesses by dramatically raising the costs of everyday life. The \nadministration's position is clear. The President wants to drive up the \ncost of gasoline and drive Americans out of their cars.\n  In 2008, when the President still harbored grandiose plans of \nchanging the course of world history, his Energy Secretary, Secretary \nChu, said his goal was to ``boost the price of gasoline to the levels \nin Europe.''\n  In the meantime, the President and his party suffered a humiliating \ndefeat in the 2010 elections. Now, faced with the prospect of going the \nway of President Carter this fall, the administration is trying to walk \nback this position.\n  With voters facing $4-a-gallon gasoline, Secretary Chu now claims he \nis doing everything he can to reduce the price of energy, and the \nPresident's advisers are suggesting that this is just a gotcha quote. \nIt is not. It represents the real view of the President and those in \nhis bubble.\n  The price of gasoline was no big deal to the President prior to being \nelected to the Senate and the White House. His short commute from his \nHyde Park house to the University of Chicago might not even have \nrequired a car. His wealthiest supporters, those being appealed to with \nhis anti-energy agenda, do not spend a significant amount of their \nincome on gasoline. When Warren Buffett flies in his private jet to \nmeet with the President to discuss plans for raising taxes on small \nbusinesses, he is not worried about the cost of jet fuel.\n  But for families who are now spending nearly $100 to fill up their \ncars, the cost of gasoline is a big deal. Members of the President's \nparty seem to get this. Even in the Senate, we see Democratic support \nfor the President's decision to hold up the Keystone Pipeline \ncollapsing, and for good reason.\n  The President's unilateral decision to kill that project might play \nwell at Midtown Manhattan fundraisers where wealthy elites have the \nluxury of supporting a radical environmental agenda without worrying \nabout the real-world consequences of that agenda for the middle class. \nBut it was bad for jobs, bad for the economy, and bad for American \nfamilies.\n  President Obama has said he wants to find an ``all-of-the above'' \napproach to energy production. He need look no further than the WEST \nAct.\n  Having said that, I would like to personally compliment my dear \nfriend and colleague, Senator Barrasso from Wyoming. He is the leader \nof our Western Caucus. Frankly, we could not have a better leader. He \nunderstands these issues very well. We in the West understand that we \nhave an obligation and we have the ability to be able to help this \ncountry from an energy standpoint in ways that it needs help. We have \nthe ability to be able to help save this country, and we intend to do \nso. This WEST Act would be a very good step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I rise to echo the comments made \nby my colleague, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah.\n  Throughout Senator Hatch's distinguished career, he has served this \nSenate and this Nation in a number of major leadership capacities. I am \nmost grateful for his ongoing leadership and the position he has taken \nin the Senate Western Caucus--that of being chairman of the caucus's \nSubcommittee on Public Lands.\n  Senator Hatch, along with Senator Moran and I, has laid out a clear \npath to energy security and job creation. The bill is called the \nWestern Economic Security Today Act, or the WEST Act.\n  President Obama told Congress he would ``keep trying every new idea \nthat works.'' He went on to say he would ``listen to every good \nproposal, no matter which party comes up with it.''\n  Well, last year Western Republicans laid out a clear path to energy \nsecurity and job creation for the Western United States and for the \ncountry. The report is entitled ``Jobs Frontier, Breaking Down \nWashington's Barriers to America's Red, White and Blue Jobs.''\n  President Obama should listen to and embrace the findings in this \nreport. The House of Representatives has passed key pieces of \nlegislation over the past year from this Jobs Frontier Report. These \nare pieces of legislation that will begin to generate quality jobs and \nincrease U.S. energy production.\n  These bills tackle key critical issues, such as encouraging energy \nexploration and production and removing unnecessary EPA regulations. \nThis legislation would create thousands--thousands--of jobs for \nAmericans.\n  The WEST Act contains language from eight of these bills already \npassed by the House that were part of the Jobs Frontier original \nreport. This legislation accomplishes many of the goals of the Jobs \nFrontier Report. It does it by increasing affordable American energy. \nIt does it by promoting agriculture and ranching. And it does it by \noverturning Washington's regulatory overreach.\n  The bottom line is this act is ready to create jobs now, today, and \nto set the Nation on the path to becoming more energy secure.\n  So I am here to congratulate Senator Hatch for bringing this \nimportant bill forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming. He has \nbeen such a great addition to the Senate. He has an intimate knowledge \nof western lands and their productivity and what they could do if we \nwere given the opportunity. He is just an all around good human being. \nI feel very grateful for his leadership, and I express my support for \nhis leadership of the Western Caucus. He is one of the finest people \nhere, and I personally want to thank him for the kind remarks he has \njust made.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, earlier this week, the conference \ncommittee on the surface transportation reauthorization--more commonly \nknown as the highway bill--met for its initial meeting. In the opening \nremarks that were made on Tuesday, it was encouraging that there seemed \nto be a general agreement on how important that Transportation bill is \nto our Nation.\n  As I will describe later, it is 2.9 million jobs that are associated \nwith this bill. I should be specific and say 2.9 million jobs a year, \nsince those jobs do not extend for eternity. But it is the most \nimportant piece of jobs legislation we could consider. I appreciated \nhearing from the Senator from Utah about the jobs concern of his energy \nproposal. Those are real jobs, they are immediate jobs. They are jobs \nthat everybody understands, building our roads, highways, and bridges.\n  These local construction jobs are not only important in and of \nthemselves, but they also help to maintain the transportation \ninfrastructure that lowers the cost of goods and helps our economy \nacross the board. We have had to close a bridge where I 95 crosses over \nthe Blackstone River in Pawtucket. It is reopening. In the meantime \npeople have to drive around 295. That costs time and fuel for \nshippers--and delays. It was an economic cost.\n  This is the real jobs bill that we can do something about. It is \npending right now in conference. So it is imperative not only that the \nconference get this bill done but that they get it done as soon as \npossible.\n  Why do I say that? Well, there was a deadline of March 31 to get a \nnew bill done, and the House of Representatives, unfortunately, did not \npass a highway bill by the March 31 deadline. So on the eve of the \nexpiration of that deadline, they passed an extension, and we are \noperating under that and a subsequent extension right now. The effect \nof that is not good for jobs. State departments of transportation and \nthe private sector companies that provide the services that rebuild our \nroads and highways cannot make long-range plans when funding is based \non short-\n\n[[Page S3067]]\n\nterm extensions. Particularly in this economy, our States, our \ncounties, and the companies that do this business simply cannot afford \nto extend themselves on contracts and on work where they do not know \nthat the highway funding is going to be there to backstop them when it \ncomes time to make the payments.\n  In many instances, for many products, a short-term extension actually \nrequires the underlying construction project to be dropped. In Rhode \nIsland, our State department of transportation, led by transportation \ndirector Michael Lewis, who is a very capable and experienced \nindividual, has shown me their list of 96 major projects that they plan \nto do this year. But because of the uncertainty here on the highway \nbill, because the conference has not produced a result yet, because we \nare still operating under the extension, he says that about 40 of those \nprojects may have to be shelved because until we get the bill done, he \ncannot count on Federal funds being there to help pay for them.\n  So every day, every week that goes by without a highway bill costs us \njobs. It does not just postpone the jobs, it actually costs us jobs. \nThe at-risk projects range from things as simple as lane striping to \nroad repaving to major bridge repairs.\n  What they all have in common is that each one of those transportation \nprojects means jobs for the construction workers who build them, the \nengineers who design them, and the companies that supply the materials. \nIt is not just me saying this. Standard & Poor's recently published a \nreport warning us that unpredictable Federal funding could stall our \nnational transportation projects. A quote from the report:\n\n       As construction season begins in the northern half of the \n     country, this continuing uncertainty in funding could force \n     states to delay projects rather than risk funding changes or \n     political gridlock come July. Once a long-term authorization \n     is approved, we believe it will provide an impetus for \n     transportation agencies to reconsider high-priority projects \n     that had been shelved because of lack of funding. But if the \n     authorization is extended by even more continuing \n     resolutions, such high-priority projects will remain in \n     limbo.\n\n  As time goes by, jobs evaporate. Continuing delays in transportation \nfunding are putting this year's construction season at risk and are \nmaking it impossible for States to keep their construction projects \nmoving. So it is not enough that we pass a highway bill out of this \nconference; it is imperative that we pass it soon. There have been \nenough delays already. We were supposed to have had it done on March \n31, except that the House never actually passed a highway bill.\n  The Senate bill, fortunately, provides a solid framework for action, \nand for rapid action. This Senate transportation bill, called MAP 21, \nfirst passed out of the Environment and Public Works Committee last \nyear, and it passed out of the Environment and Public Works Committee \non a bipartisan basis--indeed on a unanimous basis. There is not a lot \nthat every member of the Environment and Public Works Committee agrees \non. There is not a lot, frankly, that our chairman Barbara Boxer and \nour ranking member Jim Inhofe agree on. But we all agreed that this was \nan important piece of legislation and reported it out of the committee \non a unanimous basis. Then the bill came to the floor. There were no \nfast tracks, no ``hide the ball.'' This bill spent 5 weeks on the \nSenate floor. There were a great number of amendments that were \nconsidered during that period of deliberation. I believe the total is \nat 40 which were accepted either by vote or by agreement. And after \nthat long, open, transparent, robust, regular legislative process in \nwhich Republicans and Democrats both contributed, the bill passed with \nstrong bipartisan support of 75 Senators. That is pretty unusual around \nhere.\n  MAP 21 is projected to save or create 1.9 million jobs. As I said, \nthose are not jobs that last for eternity. The conjecture, I believe, \nis that they last for a year. This is 1.9 million jobs with a potential \nto create an additional million jobs through the increased investment \nin the TIFIA financing program, so a total of 2.9 million jobs.\n  In Rhode Island, that means the bill is expected to save or create up \nto 9,000 jobs. If its provisions for projects of national and regional \nsignificance are incorporated in the final bill, and if funding is \nprovided through our appropriations process, that number actually goes \nup, because some additional projects can be added that are overdue in \nRhode Island for work.\n  So MAP 21, the Senate highway bill, is a true compromise bill. It \nreflects the hard work of Chairman Boxer and Senator Inhofe, and it is \na strong bipartisan signal from this body as to what our transportation \nbill should look like. Procedurally, the conference committee is \nreconciling this Senate bipartisan compromise bill with basically an \nempty envelope of a bill, a 90-day extension passed by the House, with \nan authorization to go to conference. Some controversial provisions \nwere thrown in, unfortunately, that will make things more difficult and \nslower to get done, and more difficult and slower is not good when you \nare talking about passing the highway bill and the construction season \nis already beginning to get underway.\n\n  The most acceptable action and the one in the best interests of our \ncountry, the one in the best interests of our economy, the one in the \nbest interests of our infrastructure, the one in the best interests of \njobs in these construction projects, would be for the conference \ncommittee to report out the bipartisan Senate bill without a lot of \ncontroversial riders so that we can get a long-term reauthorization \nsigned into law while there is still a full construction season ahead \nand get hard-working Americans back to work rebuilding--as every \nAmerican knows we need to do--our Nation's beat-up and decrepit \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  I am pleased the conference is off to a good start. I am sorry we had \nto wait this long to get to this point. It would have been nice to have \nhad this done on March 31 when the deadline came. But now that we are \nhere, I urge all of the conferees to come to a quick resolution that \nhonors the extensive bipartisan work that went into the Senate bill \nwhich has gotten us to this point.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I am here to speak, I believe, for the \ngreat majority of Americans who believe the time is long overdue for \nthe Federal Government to fulfill its commitment and its responsibility \nto end the lawlessness at our borders. Only then can we put this \nmatter, the deep frustrations that are occurring, behind us and move \nour country forward in a positive and united way.\n  Immigration security is especially important in these economic times. \nIllegal labor does, in fact, depress wages and makes it more difficult \nfor out-of-work Americans to find good-paying jobs. Immigration \nsecurity is also vital to stopping cartels that are creating violence \naround our borders and in our cities. The Federal Government has a duty \nto protect those living in communities which suffer every day from \npreventable drug and gang violence.\n  There is nothing compassionate about looking the other way when we \ncan take concrete actions to make our schools and communities safer in \nevery part of the country. There is nothing compassionate about a \npolicy which makes it harder to protect not only Americans but \nimmigrants who live in our country from gang violence that occurs in \ncities and at our border today.\n  Unfortunately, instead of compelling sanctuary jurisdictions, such as \nthe city of Chicago, to cooperate with Federal law enforcement \nofficers, the administration has gone after those States that are \ntrying to assist the Federal Government to end the lawlessness in our \ncountry. Under the administration's new ``prosecutorial discretion'' \nguidelines, if the Department of Homeland Security doesn't consider \nsomeone a priority, that individual's deportation proceedings are \nclosed and they are allowed to remain in the country. So far, the \nadministration has granted this form of backdoor amnesty to almost \n17,000 aliens illegally in the country, some of whom have been \nconvicted of crimes.\n\n[[Page S3068]]\n\n  The administration has also been resistant to the popular E-Verify \nprogram, never once including it in any of its jobs or economic plans. \nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, has effectively ended \nworksite enforcement operations, meaning employers can continue to hire \nillegal workers rather than out-of-work Americans.\n  A determined President could take meaningful steps to stem the tide \nof illegality. I have been encouraged by Governor Romney's commitments \non this issue. This is something I have worked at for some time, and I \nam absolutely convinced that with consistent, smart, effective \nleadership and a commitment on behalf of this country to end the \nlawlessness, it can be done and done quicker and with less difficulty \nthan most people realize.\n  For example, Governor Romney recounted the following conversation he \nhad with a Border Patrol agent, and it is so similar to ones I have had \nwith Mr. Bonner, who headed the National Border Patrol Council. This is \nthe conversation as Governor Romney recounted it:\n\n       They said, when employers are willing to hire people who \n     are here illegally, that's a magnet, and it draws them in. \n     And sanctuary cities, giving tuition breaks to the kids of \n     illegal aliens . . . those things also have to be stopped. If \n     we want to secure the border, we have to make sure we have a \n     fence, determining where people are, enough agents to oversee \n     it, and turn off that magnet. We can't talk about amnesty, we \n     cannot give amnesty to those who have come here illegally.\n\n  That is what Governor Romney said he was told by the agents who have \nto deal with this every day and who try to do their job professionally, \nand I think that is correct. That is what they are telling me. That is \nwhat law enforcement officers have told me for some time.\n  Another example of how our country is so out of control is this \ngovernment's failure to follow the rule of law with regard to Child Tax \nCredits.\n  The Treasury Department's own inspector general for Tax \nAdministration, who analyzes problems within the agency and issues \nreports, reported that in 2010 the Internal Revenue Service paid \nillegal aliens a staggering $4.2 billion in child tax credits for \ndependents, a great deal of whom don't even live in the country. This \nhas been going on for years. This cannot continue. It must be stopped, \nand fixing it can't be delayed.\n  The Treasury IG report states:\n\n       Although the law prohibits aliens residing without \n     authorization in the United States from receiving most \n     Federal public benefits, an increasing number of these \n     individuals are filing tax returns claiming the Additional \n     Child Tax Credit, a refundable tax credit intended for \n     working families. The payment of Federal funds through this \n     tax benefit appears to provide an additional incentive for \n     aliens to enter, reside, and work in the United States \n     without authorization, which directly contradicts Federal law \n     and policy to remove such incentives.\n\n  That is from the inspector general for Tax Administration at the U.S. \nTreasury Department, not my language. Of course, that is exactly \ncorrect. That is exactly correct. How could it be otherwise?\n  In a press report from Indiana, one of the illegal aliens admitted \nhis address was used to file tax returns by four other undocumented \nworkers who don't even live there. Those four workers claimed 20 \nchildren live inside that one residence, and as a result the Internal \nRevenue Service sent the illegal immigrants tax refunds totaling \n$29,608. A tax credit is not a tax deduction, it is a direct payment, a \ndirect transfer of wealth through the tax system to an individual--\n$29,608.\n  The Treasury inspector general's report further stated:\n\n       Millions of people are seeking this tax credit who, we \n     believe, are not entitled to it. We have made recommendations \n     to the IRS as to how they could address this issue, and they \n     have not taken sufficient action, in our view, to solve the \n     problem.\n\n  Well, that is not acceptable. Now, $4 billion is a great deal of \nmoney. Four billion dollars a year is about $10 million a day. They \nfound that $4 billion was doled out to people who received this one \nbenefit illegally. No wonder we have people taking vacations to Las \nVegas on the government's dime. No wonder we are giving $\\1/2\\ billion \nloans to failed companies like Solyndra. What are we doing here in \nWashington?\n  So I say it is time to end this. I would note that the House of \nRepresentatives has voted to end this, and so it is now time to see \nwhat this Senate will do. We need to act to end it also.\n  I have been in the Senate for 15-plus years, and being on the \nJudiciary Committee, we have seen the debate over immigration move \nforward, sometimes encouragingly and sometimes discouragingly. But \nevery few years, it seems that the Washington masters of the universe \nwho have willfully and deliberately failed to follow through on \nconsistent promises to end immigration illegality begin to discuss some \nform of amnesty. They continue to incentivize the illegality but remain \nunwilling to take the necessary steps--not impossible steps--to secure \nthe border on behalf of all citizens.\n  For example, just this week my good friend and able Senator, Mr. \nDurbin, said that the DREAM Act is a bill that says: If you graduate \nhigh school and you have no serious problems when it comes to criminal \nconvictions or moral issues and you either complete service in the \nmilitary or 2 years in college, we will put you on a path to becoming \nlegal and becoming a citizen.\n  But we have examined that legislation in its most recent version, and \nit would really in effect grant amnesty to millions of people here \nillegally regardless of whether they go on to finish high school, \nfinish college, or serve in the military. That is what the legislation \ndoes. And the bill is certainly not limited to children. It would apply \nto illegal immigrants who are in their thirties now. Because the bill \nhas no cap, no limit, no sunset, no ending, it would allow people to \nremain eligible for the rest of their lives, at any age, to claim this \nbenefit. Once they are naturalized, those granted DREAM Act amnesty \nwould then have the right to legally petition for entry into the United \nStates of their family members, including their adult brothers and \nsisters and the parents who caused their illegal presence in the United \nStates to begin with, easily tripling the number of green card holders.\n  This is a big issue. We need to be careful about these things. We \nneed to consider what we are doing here.\n  The bill's provisions are so broad, they are open to those who have \neven multiple misdemeanor criminal convictions that could include drunk \ndriving and certain sexual offenses. But the bill goes further, \noffering safe harbor protection to those here illegally, those who have \npending deportation proceedings against them. Those deportation \nproceedings have to stop even when the individual might pose a risk to \nAmericans when that deportation may be based on the commission of \nserious crimes.\n  This is especially dangerous because the safe harbor would also apply \nto those from terror-prone regions in the Middle East. In fact, the \nDREAM Act altogether ignores the lessons of 9/11, going so far as to \nopen eligibility to those who previously defrauded immigration \nauthorities, as did many of those 9/11 hijackers.\n  So you say: Well, Jeff, what are we going to do? What can we do here? \nYou say no, no, but we need to have a plan. We need to do something.\n  Please, colleagues, think this through. The way forward for our \ncountry, the right way, the way to end the bitterness and develop \ncommon solutions for all residents is, first, secure the border, as \nAmericans have asked their government to do year after year and this \nCongress and this administration have failed to do so.\n  We must rebuild the trust, the trust of the American people, before \nother actions are taken. How commonsensical is that? People have a \nright to believe we will promise enforcement and give amnesty. That has \nbeen the pattern. We give the amnesty but don't do the enforcement. \nThat is why people are upset with Washington. Why shouldn't they be? It \nhas gone on for several decades. It has gone on since I have been in \nthe Senate. We have to follow through on the commitments that have been \nmade to the American people to do what we promised. It is time to end \nthe lawlessness, not surrender to it.\n  With determined leadership from the White House and support in the \nCongress, we can, in just a few years, I am totally convinced, solve \nthe problem at our border, restore the rule of law, put an end to the \nborder violence, and create a sane, just, and lawful system of\n\n[[Page S3069]]\n\nimmigration for America--a system that we can be proud of, a system \nthat befits a nation as great as ours.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    National Travel and Tourism Week\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, with summer approaching, the travel \nseason will soon be in full swing, and this week we celebrate National \nTravel and Tourism Week. It is a time to call attention to the \nimportance that travel and tourism play in our national economy and in \nthe creation of jobs.\n  I know the Presiding Officer understands this issue very clearly \nbecause, for his State of Alaska, like the State of New Hampshire, \ntravel and tourism is a very important industry. The fact is that the \ntravel and tourism industry is one of the top 10 industries in 48 \nStates, and it supports over 14 million American jobs. In New \nHampshire, travel and tourism is our second largest industry, and it \nsupports over 60,000 jobs in New Hampshire.\n  The Travel Promotion Act, which Congress passed in 2010, and of which \nI was very proud to be one of the cosponsors, will help the United \nStates compete for foreign travelers. This year we will begin to see \nthe impact of this landmark legislation.\n  For most of our history, the United States has been one of a very few \ndeveloped countries that did not advertise overseas. The Travel \nPromotion Act changes all of that because it created what is called \nBrand USA. It is a low-cost public-private partnership, and Brand USA \nhas just started rolling out an advertising campaign for America. Brand \nUSA is going to leverage millions of dollars in contributions to the \nprivate sector to help encourage more foreign travelers to bring their \ndollars to the United States. This is important because what we have \nlearned in New Hampshire is that overseas visitors tend to stay longer \nwhen they get to America and they tend to spend more money. For the \nfirst time we are going to be advertising overseas to attract visitors \nto come to the United States.\n  But there is even more we can and should do working together to \nsupport the travel sector. Traveling and tourism rely on a good \ninfrastructure, on keeping our highways, our bridges, and our airports \nrunning. That is essential for the travel industry to grow. That is why \nit was so important that this year--after many years of trying--we \nfinally reauthorized the FAA, and with that legislation are putting in \nplace a new NextGen system of air traffic control that is going to \nallow our airplanes to get from point to point faster and more \nefficiently.\n  That is why it is so critical that we pass the highway bill that is \npending in Congress, which is at a committee of conference. We passed \nthat bill in the Senate on an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, and now \nwe need to get this bill out of the Congress.\n  We also need to look at ways to improve our visa system so we can \nmake it easier for foreign travelers to come to the United States. We \nneed to pass legislation--and there are several bills that have been \nintroduced--that will help us clear the backlog of visa applications so \nwe can make sure those travelers who want to come to the United States \nare going to be able to do so, again bearing in mind that those \noverseas visitors tend to stay longer and spend more money.\n  I want to conclude by highlighting what is an exciting new campaign \nin New Hampshire to help build New Hampshire's reputation as a world-\nclass travel destination with something to offer for everyone. I know a \nlot of people have been to New Hampshire every 4 years as part of our \nPresidential primary. A lot of people are familiar with our State's \nslogan, ``Live Free or Die.'' This slogan actually captures what was \nuttered by GEN John Stark, who was a Revolutionary War general talking \nabout the British during the Revolution. A few days ago our State \nDivision of Travel and Tourism Development launched a new campaign to \npromote New Hampshire to show the world what we have to offer as a \nunique travel destination, and that campaign very cleverly plays on our \nfamous State slogan. We can see in this advertisement ``Live Free and \nExplore.'' It is one of our beautiful lakes. We can see the family out \ncanoeing.\n  We also have another one, ``Live Free and Reconnect.'' Here is a \nfamily out hiking. We can see some of our mountains in the background. \nThey are not quite as high as the mountains in Alaska, but we think \nthey are a great place for families to come and explore. Hikers can \nenjoy and reconnect and relax.\n  This one is ``Live Free and Discover.'' Again, kids getting ready to \njump into one of our lakes. We can see the wilderness in the \nbackground. This is another great example of one of the opportunities \nNew Hampshire has to enjoy our beautiful State.\n  We are very proud of what New Hampshire has to offer. We have a new \nlogo that shows how you can visit our travel and tourism site on the \nWeb and see what New Hampshire has to offer. We hope all of those who \ncome to experience our Presidential primary will come back every 4 \nyears and maybe in the meantime look at what we have to offer for \nenjoying the natural beauty and activities of the State. We would like \nthat, but I understand that all of us here in Washington have very busy \nschedules and sometimes finding time to travel is difficult. \nFortunately, soon we are going to have a great opportunity for everyone \non the Hill to experience what New Hampshire has to offer without even \nleaving the building. On June 6, the New Hampshire State Society and \nour office are going to be hosting a reception called ``Experience New \nHampshire.'' It is a great opportunity to experience New Hampshire's \nsignature hospitality, our history, our culture, and our scenic beauty. \nI invite all of my colleagues to enjoy New Hampshire beverages, to \ntaste some of the menus from our historic grand homes, our charming \ninns, and to come and celebrate with us.\n  As we celebrate travel and tourism this week, I hope all of us will \ntake a few minutes to reflect on the importance of this industry to our \nState and local economies and to the country.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to \nproceed to Calendar No. 396, H.R. 2072, which is an act to reauthorize \nthe Export-Import Bank of the United States be adopted; that there be \nno amendments, motions or points of order in order to the bill other \nthan budget points of order and the applicable motions to waive; that \nthere be 1 hour of debate equally divided between the two leaders or \ntheir designees prior to a vote on passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I would ask \nthe majority leader to modify his request to accommodate a few \namendments.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the request be modified to \nallow the following amendments: Corker No. 2102, financing for \ntransactions subsidized by export credit agencies; Vitter No. 2103, \nprohibitions on funds used for energy development outside of the United \nStates; Toomey No. 2104, a $40 billion increase contingency; Lee No. \n2100, phaseout; and Paul No. 2101, limitation on Ex-Im support.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \nlisted amendments, the bill be read three times and the Senate proceed \nto vote on the passage of the bill with a 60-vote threshold. Before the \nChair rules, I would say the sponsors of the amendments would be \nprepared to enter into short time agreements in order to facilitate \nconsideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, these \namendments that have just been listed, we are familiar with three of \nthem. The other\n\n[[Page S3070]]\n\ntwo I have not had the chance to review nor has my staff, and I do not \nthink anyone else has. We will be happy to continue to study these. I \nwill take a look at them--happy to do that.\n  The only thing I would say is that--and I have other things to say, \nand I know my friend the assistant Republican leader has places to go, \nso I would give a statement later. But based on what I have just said \nand what I am going to say, I object.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I hope we can continue to \nwork together. As to the original request then, we would have to pose \nan objection as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to both requests.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday, the House sent the Senate a \nbipartisan reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank. The bill the \nHouse passed reflects the negotiated agreement that was struck between \nRepublican and Democratic leaders. They worked hard to come up with an \nagreement.\n  As one would expect with an agreement of that nature, the House \npassed it with a very strong vote. The vote was 330 to 93. Every single \nDemocrat voted for the measure. Only the far right tea party wing of \nthe House Republican caucus voted against the bill--93 of them. So it \nwas 330 to 93.\n  The House considered no amendments. The House passed the bill on a \nsuspension calendar. For those of us who served in the House, that is a \nbill that comes up and there is almost no debate. It takes a two-thirds \nvote to pass it. They do it for noncontroversial items. This measure is \nnoncontroversial. It should have never been controversial. We brought \nit up 2 months ago, and we were stunned when the Republicans would not \nlet us move forward on it.\n  So the House did the right thing yesterday. This is the sort of bill \nthe Senate should now simply pass without amendment. It is so unusual \nhere. I have been in Congress 30 years. But this is a new one. Even \nbills that they agree on they want to mess around with. In years past, \nthis would have gone through just like this. Forget about what took \nplace 2 months ago. But now the House passed something 330 to 93, and \nwe are here playing around with it. It should be done. We should have \npassed it yesterday. This thing is going to expire.\n  It is hard to comprehend what the new mantra of the Republicans in \nthe Senate is. I do not get it. As I indicated in earlier days, the \nSenate would have passed this bill by unanimous consent, as we have \ndone before, this same legislation. But these days, the far right tea \nparty wing of the Senate Republican caucus--I used to just talk about \nthe House wing of the tea party, but it is over here now--thinks \neverything has to be a fight--everything.\n  So we are going to have to have a vote on this rather than do it by \nunanimous consent. The bank will hit its lending limit any day. Its \ncurrent authorization ends at the end of this month, May. So it will be \nvery important we work to pass the House bill as quickly as possible. \nIf we amend the bill and send it back to the House, we have to start \nall over again. The House is basically not in session this month, under \ntheir very difficult schedule of working 2 weeks on and 1 week off and \nthen sometimes longer than that. I do not know when they are going to \nbe here. It would be so much better, on a noncontroversial, very \nimportant piece of legislation--last year, 300,000 jobs--not 30,000 but \n300,000.\n  We understand the Senate Republican caucus wants to offer amendments. \nThe amendments are--I do not know for sure, but just glancing at them, \nI think they may be relevant. We will take a close look at them. There \nis no question the ones I am familiar with are efforts to gut the \nprogram. One of the amendments just eliminates it. How about that?\n  So we are going to continue looking at the amendments we have and \nthose we have not studied and look at them. I will try to be \nreasonable. So as we do that, we are going to vote on this. I am going \nto file cloture in just a second, which I hate to do--another motion to \nproceed. Boy, if there were ever a time when Tom Udall and Jeff Merkley \nwere prophetic, it is tonight. These two young, fine Senators said it \nwas time to change the rules in the Senate. We did not. They were \nright. The rest of us were wrong or most of us anyway. What a shame.\n  Here we are wasting time because of the Republicans. This week we \nhave accomplished a lot. We had a vote on a judge and we voted on \ncloture on the Republicans defeating our ability to get something done \nwith student loans. That is our workload this week. I know it has been \ntough.\n  That was sarcastic, of course, but it is just absolutely mindless \nwhat is going on. Then, to top it off, one of the finest Members of the \nSenate we have ever had was defeated yesterday by a man--listen to \nthis--who campaigned on the platform that there is too much compromise \nin the Senate. He is going to come back here and not compromise with \nanybody on anything. Now that is what we need in the Senate, more \npeople who are willing to do nothing but fight.\n  I am going to do whatever I have to do to take the steps to keep this \nmeasure moving forward. I hope we can do it next week. I hope we can do \nit without a lot of trouble, of which we already have too much.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have a cloture motion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 396, H.R. 2072, an Act to reauthorize \n     the Export-Import Bank of the United States, and for other \n     purposes.\n         Maria Cantwell, Tim Johnson, Harry Reid, Mark Begich, \n           Mark Udall, Tom Udall, Patrick J. Leahy, Sherrod Brown, \n           Jack Reed, Charles E. Schumer, Richard Blumenthal, \n           Richard J. Durbin, Kay R. Hagan, Daniel K. Inouye, \n           Michael F. Bennet, Kent Conrad, Benjamin L. Cardin.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I am finished. But I wish to say again for those who are \nlistening here or watching, Senator Udall and Senator Merkley wanted to \ndo something to change the rules regarding filibusters. If there was \nanything that ever needed changing in this body, it is the filibuster \nrule.\n  It has been abused, abused, and abused by my Republican colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's \nactions on trying to move us forward on a very important jobs bill. The \nExport-Import Bank is a way to fund manufacturers in the United States \nso their products can be sold around the globe. It is kind of similar \nto a Small Business Administration finance program for exports.\n  We know the President has said we need to increase exports. This is a \nprogram that has been in place for decades, never controversial at this \ndegree. Now all of a sudden we are, weeks before the authorization \nexpires, sitting here arguing over whether we can move forward on this \nbill.\n  I have great respect for the Senate. But there are some times when \nthe Senate does not get to work out a deal, and we are presented with \nsomething that has been worked out by the House of Representatives. We \ncan go back to what the majority leader said, how we got in this spot; \nthat is, objecting to every motion to proceed, objecting to every \nmotion to proceed. Pretty soon all the work stacks up. We try to move \nlegislation and every motion is objected to. So the consequence is we \nrun out of time and we run out of a way to get to a compromise.\n  In this case, guess what happened. The House came up with a \ncompromise. The House, even to the degree that some of the amendments \nthat some of my colleagues wanted to offer, got implemented into the \nHouse compromise bill that now passed the House of Representatives \nwith, whatever, 300-plus votes to 93.\n  With my colleagues, basically, continuing to just try to derail the \nnormal process, we have had to take now a House bill that I think \nencompasses many of the things people wanted to\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\nsee either in reforms or ways to make the bank more transparent or ways \nto make sure we are focusing on things that are going to help U.S. \nmanufacturers win the day in a very competitive market.\n  So I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, yes; Mr. \nBoehner and Mr. Cantor worked out a compromise. So now we can again \ntake more time here and analyze it and see whether you agree with that. \nI certainly like when the Senate works out agreements, and oftentimes \nwe have asked our House colleagues to vote on them. But we now have the \nstudent loan bill that needs to be done, this Export-Import Bank that \nneeds to be done, and many other important economic agenda items we \nshould get to for this country.\n  I hope when the cloture motion comes forward, my colleagues will \nrealize the only thing people are trying to do now--they can vote no on \nthe program if they don't like it because they are primarily amendments \nto defund the bank. These are not perfecting amendments to a compromise \nthat has been worked out. They want to express their opposition. They \nwill have a chance to do that.\n  I hope for the sake of thousands of jobs in the United States, for \nthe sake of U.S. competitiveness in a global market, where these \ncompanies are competing with other companies around the globe, my \ncolleagues will realize this is a compromise piece of legislation. \nLet's get it done next week and onto the President's desk so we can go \nabout winning more jobs in a very competitive global economy. That is \nwhat we need to do. Holding out 1 more, 2 more, or 3 more days, or \nanother week just to get an amendment saying you hate the Ex-Im Bank, \nthat is not the way to get things done for America.\n  I hope my colleagues will support moving ahead so we can get this \nonto the President's desk.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/10/senate-section/article/S3071-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3071-S3073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n AWARDING A CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO MEMBERS OF THE CIVIL AIR PATROL\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The volunteer members of the Civil Air Patrol \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``CAP'') during \n     World War II, civilian men and women ranging in age from 18 \n     to 81, provided extraordinary public and combat services \n     during a critical time of need for the Nation.\n       (2) During the war, CAP members used their own aircraft to \n     perform a myriad of essential tasks for the military and the \n     Nation within the United States, including attacks on enemy \n     submarines off the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the \n     United States.\n       (3) This extraordinary service set the stage for the post-\n     war CAP to become a valuable nonprofit, public service \n     organization chartered by Congress and the Auxiliary of the \n     United States Air Force that provides essential emergency, \n     operational, and public services to communities, States, the \n     Federal Government, and the military.\n       (4) The CAP was established, initially as a part of the \n     Office of Civil Defense, by air-minded citizens one week \n     before the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on \n     December 1, 1941, ``out of the desire of civil airmen of the \n     country to be mobilized with their equipment in the common \n     defense'' of the Nation.\n       (5) Within days of the start of the war, the German Navy \n     started a massive submarine offensive, known as Operation \n     Drumbeat, off the east coast of the United States against oil \n     tankers and other critical shipping that threatened the \n     overall war effort.\n       (6) Neither the Navy nor the Army had enough aircraft, \n     ships, or other resources to adequately patrol and protect \n     the shipping along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of \n     the United States, and many ships were torpedoed within sight \n     of civilians on shore, including 52 tankers sunk between \n     January and March 1942.\n       (7) At that time General George Marshall remarked that \n     ``[t]he losses by submarines off our Atlantic seaboard and in \n     the Caribbean now threaten our entire war effort''.\n       (8) From the beginning CAP leaders urged the military to \n     use its services to patrol coastal waters but met with great \n     resistance because of the nonmilitary training and status of \n     CAP pilots.\n       (9) Finally, in response to the ever-increasing submarine \n     attacks, the Tanker Committee of the Petroleum Industry War \n     Council urged the Navy Department and the War Department to \n     consider the use of the CAP to help patrol the sea lanes off \n     the coasts of the United States.\n       (10) While the Navy initially rejected this suggestion, the \n     Army decided it had merit, and the Civil Air Patrol Coastal \n     Patrol began in March 1942.\n       (11) Oil companies and other organizations provided funds \n     to help pay for some CAP operations, including vitally needed \n     shore radios that were used to monitor patrol missions.\n       (12) By late March 1942, the Navy also began to use the \n     services of the CAP.\n       (13) Starting with three bases located in Delaware, \n     Florida, and New Jersey, CAP aircrews immediately started to \n     spot enemy submarines as well as lifeboats, bodies, and \n     wreckage.\n       (14) Within 15 minutes of the first Coast Patrol flight, \n     the pilot had sighted a torpedoed tanker and was coordinating \n     rescue operations.\n       (15) Eventually 21 bases, ranging from Bar Harbor, Maine, \n     to Brownsville, Texas, were set up for the CAP to patrol the \n     Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of the United States, with \n     40,000 volunteers participating.\n       (16) The CAP used a wide range of civilian-owned aircraft, \n     mainly light-weight, single engine aircraft--manufactured by \n     Cessna, Beech, Waco, Fairchild, Stinson, Piper, Taylorcraft, \n     and Sikorsky, among others--as well as some twin engine \n     aircraft such as the Grumman Widgeon.\n       (17) These aircraft were painted in their civilian prewar \n     colors (red, yellow, blue, etc.) and carried special markings \n     (a blue circle with a white triangle) to identify them as CAP \n     aircraft.\n       (18) Patrols were conducted up to 100 miles off shore, \n     generally with 2 aircraft flying together, in aircraft often \n     equipped with only a compass for navigation and a single \n     radio for communication.\n       (19) Due to the critical nature of the situation, CAP \n     operations were conducted in bad weather as well as good, \n     often when the military was unable to fly, and in all seasons \n     (including the winter) when ditching an aircraft in cold \n     water would likely mean certain death to the aircrew.\n       (20) Personal emergency equipment was often lacking, \n     particularly during early patrols where inner tubes and kapok \n     duck hunter vests were carried as flotation devices since \n     ocean worthy wet suits, life vests, and life rafts were \n     unavailable.\n       (21) The initial purpose of the CAP was to spot submarines, \n     report their position to the military, and force them to dive \n     below the surface, which limited their operating speed and \n     maneuverability and reduced their ability to detect and \n     attack shipping.\n       (22) It soon became apparent that there were opportunities \n     for CAP pilots to attack submarines, such as when a Florida \n     CAP aircrew came across a surfaced submarine that quickly \n     stranded itself on a sand bar. However, the aircrew could not \n     get any assistance from armed military aircraft before the \n     submarine freed itself.\n       (23) Finally, after a number of these instances, a decision \n     was made by the military to arm CAP aircraft with 50 and 100 \n     pound bombs, and to arm some larger twin engine aircraft with \n     325 pound depth charges.\n       (24) The arming of CAP aircraft dramatically changed the \n     mission for these civilian aircrews and resulted in more than \n     57 attacks on enemy submarines.\n       (25) While CAP volunteers received $8 a day flight \n     reimbursement, their patrols were accomplished at a great \n     economic cost to many of the members of the CAP who--\n       (A) used their own aircraft and other equipment in defense \n     of the Nation;\n       (B) paid for much of their own aircraft maintenance and \n     hangar use; and\n       (C) often lived in primitive conditions along the coast, \n     including old barns and chicken coops converted for sleeping.\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\n       (26) More importantly, the CAP Coastal Patrol service came \n     at the high cost of 26 fatalities, 7 serious injuries, and 90 \n     aircraft lost.\n       (27) At the conclusion of the 18-month Coastal Patrol, the \n     heroic CAP aircrews would be credited with the following:\n       (A) 2 submarines destroyed or damaged.\n       (B) 57 submarines attacked.\n       (C) 82 bombs dropped against submarines.\n       (D) 173 radio reports of submarine positions (with a number \n     of credited assists for kills made by military units).\n       (E) 17 floating mines reported.\n       (F) 36 dead bodies reported.\n       (G) 91 vessels in distress reported.\n       (H) 363 survivors in distress reported.\n       (I) 836 irregularities noted.\n       (J) 1,036 special investigations at sea or along the coast.\n       (K) 5,684 convoy missions for the Navy.\n       (L) 86,685 missions flown.\n       (M) 244,600 total flight hours logged.\n       (N) More than 24,000,000 miles flown.\n       (28) At least one high-level German Navy Officer credited \n     the CAP with being the primary reason that submarine attacks \n     were withdrawn from the Atlantic coast of the United States \n     in 1943, when he said that ``[i]t was because of those damned \n     little red and yellow planes!''.\n       (29) The CAP was dismissed from coastal missions with \n     little thanks in August 1943 when the Navy took over the \n     mission completely and ordered the CAP to stand down.\n       (30) While the Coastal Patrol was ongoing, the CAP was also \n     establishing itself as a vital wartime service to the \n     military, States, and communities nationwide by performing a \n     wide range of missions including--\n       (A) border patrol;\n       (B) forest fire patrol;\n       (C) courier flights for mail, repair and replacement parts, \n     and urgent deliveries;\n       (D) emergency transportation of personnel;\n       (E) target towing (with live ammunition being fired at the \n     targets and seven lives being lost) and searchlight tracking \n     training missions;\n       (F) missing aircraft and personnel searches;\n       (G) rescue of aircraft crash survivors;\n       (H) radar training flights;\n       (I) aerial inspections of camouflaged military and civilian \n     facilities;\n       (J) aerial inspections of city and town blackout \n     conditions;\n       (K) mock bombing attacks on cities and facilities to test \n     air defenses;\n       (L) aerial searches for scrap metal materials;\n       (M) support of war bond drives;\n       (N) airport guard duties;\n       (O) support for State and local emergencies such as natural \n     disasters;\n       (P) recruiting for the Army Air Force; and\n       (Q) a cadet youth program which provided aviation and \n     military training.\n       (31) The CAP flew more than 500,000 hours on these \n     additional missions, including--\n       (A) 20,500 missions involving target towing (with live \n     ammunition) and gun/searchlight tracking which resulted in 7 \n     deaths, 5 serious injuries, and the loss of 25 aircraft;\n       (B) a courier service involving 3 major Air Force Commands \n     over a 2-year period carrying more than 3,500,000 pounds of \n     vital cargo and 543 passengers;\n       (C) southern border operations flying more than 30,000 \n     hours, with 7,000 reports of unusual sightings including a \n     vehicle (that was apprehended) with 2 enemy agents attempting \n     to enter the country;\n       (D) a week in February 1945 during which CAP units found \n     seven missing Army and Navy pilots; and\n       (E) a State in which the CAP flew 790 hours on forest fire \n     patrol missions and reported 576 fires to authorities during \n     a single year.\n       (32) On April 29, 1943, the CAP was transferred to the Army \n     Air Forces, thus beginning its long association with the \n     United States Air Force.\n       (33) Hundreds of CAP-trained women joined military women's \n     units including the Women's Air Force Service Pilots (WASP) \n     program.\n       (34) Many members of the Women's Air Force Service Pilots \n     program joined or rejoined the CAP during the post-war period \n     because it provided women opportunities to fly and continue \n     to serve the Nation that were severely lacking elsewhere.\n       (35) Due to the exceptional emphasis on safety, unit \n     discipline, and pilot discipline, and the organization of the \n     CAP, by the end of the war only 64 members of the CAP had \n     died in service and only 150 aircraft had been lost \n     (including its Coastal Patrol loses from early in the war).\n       (36) There were more than 60,000 adult civilian members of \n     the CAP in wide range of positions, and CAP aircrews flew a \n     total of approximately 750,000 hours during the war, most of \n     which were in their personal aircraft and often at real risk \n     to their lives.\n       (37) After the war, at a CAP dinner for Congress, a quorum \n     of both Houses attended with the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President thanking the CAP for its \n     service.\n       (38) While air medals were issued for those participating \n     in the Coastal Patrol, little other recognition was \n     forthcoming for those efforts or for the other services the \n     CAP volunteers provided during the war.\n       (39) Despite efforts to end the organization at the end of \n     the war, the CAP had proved its capabilities and strengthened \n     its ties with the Air Force and Congress.\n       (40) In 1946, Congress chartered the CAP as a nonprofit, \n     public service organization and in 1948 as the Auxiliary of \n     the United States Air Force.\n       (41) Today the CAP conducts many of the same missions it \n     performed during World War II, including a vital role in \n     homeland security.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I will speak about S. 418, which we just \npassed. I thank all my colleagues for allowing it to go through on a \nunanimous consent basis.\n  This bill awards a Congressional Gold Medal to the World War II \nmembers of the Civil Air Patrol. I introduced this legislation last \nyear, and it currently has 85 cosponsors.\n  This legislation will offer long overdue recognition to a small group \nof people who answered the call to duty at our Nation's time of maximum \ndanger.\n  Seventy years ago, during the height of World War II, Civil Air \nPatrol members in small aircraft began searching for German U-boats off \nthe Atlantic Coast. This was a time of great peril for the Nation when \nover 400 ships were sunk in U.S. waters, many in view of Americans on \nshore, and the military didn't have enough aircraft and ships to stop \nthis carnage. That is why the Civil Air Patrol answered the call.\n  Their mission was highly unusual because these pilots were civilian \nvolunteers flying their own airplanes in combat operations, often at \ntheir own expense. The mission was for Civil Air Patrol aircraft to \nforce the U-boats below the surface of the water, making their attacks \non shipping much more difficult and time consuming. As soon as the \nCivil Air Patrol pilots took to the air, they spotted so many U-boats \nthat the military quickly armed their aircraft with small bombs and \ndepth charges. From Maine to Texas, Civil Air Patrol aircraft flew \nthese missions in pairs up to 100 miles offshore, in all seasons, often \nin bad weather. These CAP, as they are known, put themselves at great \nrisk, flying over water at low levels with only a compass, one radio, \nand minimal survival gear to help if they got into trouble. Many pilots \nhad to ditch in the water. Twenty-six pilots lost their lives and 90 \naircraft were lost.\n\n  During an 18-month period, the Civil Air Patrol flew over 24 million \nmiles on its antisubmarine coastal patrols. It spotted 173 U-boats, \nattacked 57, and sank or damaged 2. It also escorted over 5,600 convoys \nand reported 17 floating mines, 36 bodies, 91 ships in distress, and \n363 survivors in the water. Most importantly, CAP's constant\n\n[[Page S3073]]\n\npresence over the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico was a major factor in \npushing enemy operations away from the coast and protecting vital \nshipping and cargo up and down our coastlines.\n  In 1943 German U-boat attacks ceased off the Atlantic coast of the \nUnited States. One high-level German officer credited the Civil Air \nPatrol with being the primary reason for withdrawal, saying, ``It was \nbecause of those damned little red and yellow airplanes.''\n  As the U-boat threat ended, Civil Air Patrol expanded its homeland \nsecurity and emergency operations to include search and rescue, border \npatrol, forest fire patrol, and disaster relief in every State in the \nNation.\n  By war's end, nearly 60,000 members had participated in the Civil Air \nPatrol and flew 75 million miles over 750,000 hours in support of \ncritical homefront missions. Its volunteers ranged in age from 18 to \nover 80. Many served for the entire war, while others, most of whom \nlater joined the military, served for shorter periods. A substantial \nnumber received ``belligerent'' certificates indicating they had \nparticipated in combat-related duty with the Civil Air Patrol.\n  The individual accounts of Civil Air Patrol pilots' performance and \nheroism are too numerous to recount, but just a few examples can \nillustrate the valor with which they served.\n  For instance, Maj. Hugh Sharp and Lt. Eddie Edwards from Rehoboth, \nDE, landed their Sikorsky amphibian in high seas to rescue two other \nCAP airmen who had to ditch their plane. They found one crew member who \nwas badly hurt, but they were unable to take off due to a pontoon \ndamaged during a rough landing in 10-foot seas. They made a decision to \ntaxi the aircraft back to land, but they quickly discovered that the \ndamaged amphibian listed too far to the left and it didn't make much \nprogress. It just sort of went around in circles. So Eddie volunteered \nto climb to the end of the right wing to keep the plane in balance. The \nnext day, when a Coast Guard ship met the aircraft, Eddie had to be \ncarried from the wing after holding on tightly for 11 hours in freezing \nand wet conditions. Both pilots were awarded the first Air Medals of \nthe war by President Roosevelt.\n  Capt. Francis ``Mac'' McLaughlin flew coastal patrol missions from \nDaytona Beach, FL, for 17 months. During that time, he, along with \nAlbert Crabtree, ditched a Fairchild 24 aircraft in the Atlantic and \nfloated in a life raft for several hours until the Coast Guard picked \nthem up. They quickly became members of the ``Duck Club,'' an exclusive \norganization that recognized those who survived a CAP ditching. There \nwould soon be many in that club, as I mentioned. When the coastal \npatrol ended, Mac went to Massachusetts to tow aerial targets, the \nCAP's second most dangerous duty after the coastal patrol. Seven CAP \npilots and observers would be shot down and killed during gunnery \npractice. Mac, who served the entire war on Active Duty with the Civil \nAir Patrol, passed away at the end of 2011.\n  Another CAP veteran was Lt. Charles Compton, who flew from Coastal \nPatrol Base 1 at Atlantic City, NJ, on antisubmarine and convoy escort \nmissions. He recently noted:\n\n       Convoys could be attacked at any time. We had a war going \n     on and the threat of German submarines off the east coast. \n     Our job was to make it less easy for the German submarines to \n     surface without being detected.\n\n  Charles, who lives near Chicago and turned 95 last summer, remembers \nthat during these dangerous missions, pilots often used sunken ships as \npoints of reference to help them navigate when over water. He added \nthat, unfortunately, sunken ships were plentiful at that time. Recently \nrecognized for his service with Civil Air Patrol's Distinguished \nService Award, he credits the exceptional efforts of his fellow \nAtlantic City squadron members for the honor he received.\n  These are just three stories, but they are illustrative of Civil Air \nPatrol's many World War II heroes. More importantly, these stories \nserve as a powerful reminder of the dedication and service that all \ngave to our Nation.\n  When the war ended, Civil Air Patrol members received the recognition \nthey deserved. Over time, however, their story was lost to much of the \nNation. This Congressional Gold Medal will ensure that this story is \ntold over and over to future generations and recognizes the Civil Air \nPatrol and its World War II members for their critically important \nservice to our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/10/senate-section/article/S3073-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3073-S3075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CARBON POLLUTION\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I want to speak about the ongoing and \ndeliberately overlooked problem of carbon pollution and what it is \ndoing to our planet.\n  In the context of these remarks, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record an article entitled ``Game Over for the \nClimate,'' written by Jim Hansen and published in yesterday's New York \nTimes.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From The New York Times, May 9, 2012]\n\n                       Game Over for the Climate\n\n                           (By James Hansen)\n\n       GLOBAL warming isn't a prediction. It is happening. That is \n     why I was so troubled to read a recent interview with \n     President Obama in Rolling Stone in which he said that Canada \n     would exploit the oil in its vast tar sands reserves \n     ``regardless of what we do.''\n       If Canada proceeds, and we do nothing, it will be game over \n     for the climate.\n       Canada's tar sands, deposits of sand saturated with \n     bitumen, contain twice the amount of carbon dioxide emitted \n     by global oil use in our entire history. If we were to fully \n     exploit this new oil source, and continue to burn our \n     conventional oil, gas and coal supplies, concentrations of \n     carbon dioxide in the atmosphere eventually would reach \n     levels higher than in the Pliocene era, more than 2.5 million \n     years ago, when sea level was at least 50 feet higher than it \n     is now. That level of heat-trapping gases would assure that \n     the disintegration of the ice sheets would accelerate out of \n     control. Sea levels would rise and destroy coastal cities. \n     Global temperatures would become intolerable. Twenty to 50 \n     percent of the planet's species would be driven to \n     extinction. Civilization would be at risk.\n       That is the long-term outlook. But near-term, things will \n     be bad enough. Over the next several decades, the Western \n     United States and the semi-arid region from North Dakota to \n     Texas will develop semi-permanent drought, with rain, when it \n     does come, occurring in extreme events with heavy flooding. \n     Economic losses would be incalculable. More and more of the \n     Midwest would be a dust bowl. California's Central Valley \n     could no longer be irrigated. Food prices would rise to \n     unprecedented levels.\n       If this sounds apocalyptic, it is. This is why we need to \n     reduce emissions dramatically. President Obama has the power \n     not only to deny tar sands oil additional access to Gulf \n     Coast refining, which Canada desires in part for export \n     markets, but also to encourage economic incentives to leave \n     tar sands and other dirty fuels in the ground.\n       The global warming signal is now louder than the noise of \n     random weather, as I predicted would happen by now in the \n     journal Science in 1981. Extremely hot summers have increased \n     noticeably. We can say with high confidence that the recent \n     heat waves in Texas and Russia, and the one in Europe in \n     2003, which killed tens of thousands, were not natural \n     events--they were caused by human-induced climate change.\n       We have known since the 1800s that carbon dioxide traps \n     heat in the atmosphere. The right amount keeps the climate \n     conducive to human life. But add too much, as we are doing \n     now, and temperatures will inevitably rise too high. This is \n     not the result of natural variability, as some argue. The \n     earth is currently in the part of its long-term orbit cycle \n     where temperatures would normally be cooling. But they are \n     rising--and it's because we are forcing them higher with \n     fossil fuel emissions.\n       The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has \n     risen from 280 parts per million to 393 p.p.m. over the last \n     150 years. The tar sands contain enough carbon--240 \n     gigatons--to add 120 p.p.m. Tar shale, a close cousin of tar \n     sands found mainly in the United States, contains at least an \n     additional 300 gigatons of carbon. If we turn to these \n     dirtiest of fuels, instead of finding ways to phase out our \n     addiction to fossil fuels, there is no hope of keeping carbon \n     concentrations below 500 p.p.m.--a level that would, as \n     earth's history shows, leave our children a climate system \n     that is out of their control.\n       We need to start reducing emissions significantly, not \n     create new ways to increase them. We should impose a \n     gradually rising carbon fee, collected from fossil fuel \n     companies, then distribute 100 percent of the collections to \n     all Americans on a per-capita\n\n[[Page S3074]]\n\n     basis every month. The government would not get a penny. This \n     market-based approach would stimulate innovation, jobs and \n     economic growth, avoid enlarging government or having it pick \n     winners or losers. Most Americans, except the heaviest energy \n     users, would get more back than they paid in increased \n     prices. Not only that, the reduction in oil use resulting \n     from the carbon price would be nearly six times as great as \n     the oil supply from the proposed pipeline from Canada, \n     rendering the pipeline superfluous, according to economic \n     models driven by a slowly rising carbon price.\n       But instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to \n     make fossil fuels pay their true costs, leveling the energy \n     playing field, the world's governments are forcing the public \n     to subsidize fossil fuels with hundreds of billions of \n     dollars per year. This encourages a frantic stampede to \n     extract every fossil fuel through mountaintop removal, \n     longwall mining, hydraulic fracturing, tar sands and tar \n     shale extraction, and deep ocean and Arctic drilling.\n       President Obama speaks of a ``planet in peril,'' but he \n     does not provide the leadership needed to change the world's \n     course. Our leaders must speak candidly to the public--which \n     yearns for open, honest discussion--explaining that our \n     continued technological leadership and economic well-being \n     demand a reasoned change of our energy course. History has \n     shown that the American public can rise to the challenge, but \n     leadership is essential.\n       The science of the situation is clear--it's time for the \n     politics to follow. This is a plan that can unify \n     conservatives and liberals, environmentalists and business. \n     Every major national science academy in the world has \n     reported that global warming is real, caused mostly by \n     humans, and requires urgent action. The cost of acting goes \n     far higher the longer we wait--we can't wait any longer to \n     avoid the worst and be judged immoral by coming generations.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The article begins with two simple sentences: \n``Global warming isn't a prediction. It is happening.''\n  He talks about the dangers of the Canada tar sands and what that \nmeans for us if we go ahead with that project. His conclusion is this:\n\n       If Canada proceeds, and we do nothing, it will be game over \n     for the climate.\n       Canada's tar sands, deposits of sand saturated with \n     bitumen, contain twice the amount of carbon dioxide emitted \n     by global oil use in our entire history.\n\n  He looks at the recent extreme weather that people--not only across \nthe country but across the world--have been noticing. He concludes:\n\n       We can say with high confidence that the recent heat waves \n     in Texas and Russia, and the one in Europe in 2003, which \n     killed tens of thousands, were not natural events--they were \n     caused by human-induced climate change.\n\n  So the risk we face is a real one, and we are actually seeing it \nbegin to happen in present time. He says:\n  The tar sands contain enough carbon--240 gigatons--to add 120 parts \nper million to our atmosphere. As I have said before on the Senate \nfloor, we have lived for 8,000 centuries within a range between 170 and \n300 parts per million of carbon in our atmosphere. That is the \nbandwidth within which the human species has lived on this planet, and \nwe have gone rocketing out of that bandwidth in recent years. We are \nnow at 390 parts per million out of a bandwidth, for 800,000 years, \nbetween 170 and 300 parts per million. The tar sands would add 120 \nparts per million to that. That would take us to 510, if my math is \nright.\n  Tar shale--a close cousin of tar sands found mainly in the United \nStates--contains at least an additional 300 gigatons of carbon.\n  This shows the folly of what Dr. Hansen describes:\n\n       . . . as a frantic stampede to extract every fossil fuel \n     through mountaintop removal, longwall mining, hydraulic \n     fracturing, tar sands and tar shale extraction, and deep \n     ocean and Arctic drilling.\n\n  Jim Hansen is somebody who is worth listening to. He has been writing \nabout this now for more than 30 years,\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a posting by \nNeil Wagner entitled ``Hansen Had It Right in 1981 Climate Report.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Hansen Had It Right in 1981 Climate Report\n\n                            (By Neil Wagner)\n\n       A recently rediscovered 1981 paper, written by NASA \n     atmospheric physicist James Hansen and others, has been \n     analyzed and found to be impressively accurate about the \n     course of climate change since its publication.\n       The 10-page paper (available at this link), which was \n     published in the journal Science, had been overlooked for \n     decades when researchers Geert Jan van Oldenborgh and Rein \n     Haarsma from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute \n     uncovered it and began scouring its contents.\n       The paper's impressive prognostication is the best kind of \n     vindication for Hansen, who has suffered more than his share \n     of the slings and arrows from climate deniers in the media, \n     such as Fox News, Rush Limbaugh, and Andrew Breitbart. He's \n     also taken hits from ``climate confusionist'' Physicist \n     Freeman Dyson, and has charged that the Bush administration \n     tried to silence his warnings about global warming's urgency.\n       Deniers of climate change often look for boogeymen in their \n     attempts to disprove the phenomenon's existence. As a means \n     of putting a face on the ``global warming hoax,'' an \n     individual is often singled out for attack. In his new book, \n     The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars, scientist Michael E. \n     Mann calls this technique the Serengeti Strategy, since the \n     technique is akin to lions singling out vulnerable prey from \n     a herd.\n       The links below provide current information about some of \n     the paper's projections: Atmospheric carbon increase, \n     Formation of drought prone regions, Sea level rise, Antarctic \n     ice erosion, Opening of the Northwest Passage.\n       The complex world of climate science rarely enjoys such \n     clear and simple validation. When such an opportunity \n     presents itself, we owe it to ourselves to make some noise \n     about it. Haarsma and van Oldenborgh's findings should be \n     shouted from the rooftops.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. He says:\n\n       A recently rediscovered 1981 paper, written by NASA \n     atmospheric physicist Jim Hansen and others, has been \n     analyzed and found to be impressively accurate about the \n     course of climate change since its publication.\n       The 10-page paper . . . which was published in the journal \n     Science, had been overlooked for decades when researchers \n     Geert Jan van Oldenborgh and Rein Haarsma from the Royal \n     Netherlands Meteorological Institute, uncovered it and began \n     scouring its contents.\n       The paper's impressive prognostication is the best kind of \n     vindication for Hansen, who has suffered more than his share \n     of the slings and arrows from climate deniers in the media . \n     . .\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       The complex world of climate science rarely enjoys such \n     clear and simple validation. When such opportunity presents \n     itself, we owe it to ourselves to make some noise about it.\n\n  With appreciation to Jim Hansen, how the actual science has borne him \nout over the past 30 years, and with respect for the predictions he \nmakes, we should as soon as we can begin to address ourselves to this \nproblem.\n  Jim is not alone. An array of scientific organizations wrote us all a \nletter back in October of 2009 whose conclusion is pretty clear and \nstark in scientific language:\n\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear that \n     climate change is occurring and rigorous scientific research \n     demonstrates that the greenhouse gasses emitted by human \n     activities are the primary driver. These conclusions are \n     based on multiple independent lines of evidence and contrary \n     assertions are inconsistent with an objective assessment of \n     the vast body of peer reviewed science.\n\n  We act as if it is something new, but, in fact, it is not. The \ndetermination that carbon dioxide would warm the planet as it increased \nits concentration in the atmosphere was figured out around the time of \nthe American Civil War by an Irish scientist who worked in England \nnamed John Tyndall. What Tyndall discovered we have proven to be true, \nas since then we have dumped gigaton after gigaton of carbon into our \natmosphere, loading it up to the point now, as I said before, that we \nare well outside the bounds that have protected our species for 800,000 \nyears on this planet.\n  The scale of what 8,000 centuries means is perhaps best measured \nagainst the time that scientists now believe man first began to engage \nin agriculture, first started scratching the earth and putting seeds \ninto the ground. Before then, we were primarily hunter-gatherers, \nleading a very primitive life. So we have gone from beginning to \nscratch the earth and plant things to be, 10,000 years later, the \nspecies we are. We lived within this bandwidth of 170 to 300 parts per \nmillion for 8,000 centuries. To veer outside of it is significant and \nhazardous.\n  I am delighted that Mr. Hansen, despite all the abuse that has been \nheaped on him, continues his work. I hope the time comes when we start \nto listen to the voice of what our planet is telling us, the voice of \nwhat our scientists are telling us, the voice of what our children are \ntelling us, and not just the voice of what the lobbyists for the \npolluting industries--particularly the oil and gas industries--are \ntelling us.\n  Frankly, the lobbyists for the polluting oil and gas industries are \nnot\n\n[[Page S3075]]\n\ntelling us the truth. They are not telling us the truth. The truth is \nbecoming increasingly apparent, and the problem is that as time goes by \nyou can reach tipping points that are irrecoverable. It would be really \ntragic for us to look back and think, if we had been able to act on \ntime, if we had listened on time to the signals of our Earth, our \nplanet, the signals that are plainly in our face, we could have made a \nworld that was better and safer for our children. But, instead, in our \nfolly, in our greed, in our willingness to listen to the falsehoods of \nthese polluters, we shot past that point, and there is no way to \nrecover it now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/10/senate-section/article/S3075-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I rise on the Senate floor today to pay \ntribute to Mary Leahy, director at the Central Vermont Adult Basic \nEducation--sister, friend, and lifetime educator--who is retiring this \nmonth.\n  For 40 years, Central Vermont Adult Basic Education has provided free \nliteracy services for adults and out-of-school youth. Thirty-seven of \nthose years, Mary Leahy has been at the helm. In her role as codirector \nat Central Vermont Adult Basic Education, Mary dedicated herself to \npreparing lower skilled workers to meet the demands of the shifting \neconomy.\n  Whether it was attending townhalls, community centers and libraries, \nor knocking on doors directly, Mary has spread the word. She has \nrecruited members for this program all over the State.\n  I have seen the joy in the face of a grandfather able to read a \nchildren's story to a grandchild--something the grandfather was not \nable to do for that child's parent because he could not read when they \nwere a child.\n  In a recent article honoring Mary in the Times Argus, Vermont Poet \nLaureate Sydney Lea said these kind words about Mary:\n\n       This has been way beyond a job for Mary; it's really a \n     vision of humanity that she's been dedicated to. I have an \n     admiration for her that is pretty close to boundless.\n\n  I agree with my friend Sydney. Mary's lifelong passion for learning \nhas enabled countless Vermonters to gain the critical skills needed to \nparticipate in today's workforce. In our country today, 88 million \nadults face at least one educational barrier, such as no high school \ndiploma or no college, and only 3 to 4 percent of the workers with the \nmost limited literacy proficiencies receive the basic skills training \nfrom their employers. Under Mary's guiding hand, Central Vermont Adult \nBasic Education has allowed Vermonters, young and old, to reach their \nfull potential and to be successful both in the classroom and in the \nworkforce--I might add parenthetically, also just in their everyday \nlives.\n  As her older brother, I have known Mary all her life. She is a \nloving, intelligent, and hard-working person. She has the soul and \ntalent of an artist and the generosity of a saint in sharing her talent \nand commitment.\n  I am so proud of Mary, and I ask unanimous consent that the Times \nArgus article ``Closing a Chapter'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From The Times Argus, April 30, 2012]\n\n   Closing a Chapter: Mary Leahy Ends Career at adult Basic Education\n\n                           (By David Delcour)\n\n       Pages turn, chapters end, books close, and Mary Leahy--a \n     woman who has dedicated her life to literacy in central \n     Vermont--knows that better than most.\n       On Tuesday, Leahy plans to put the proverbial ``period'' at \n     the end of her 37-year career with Central Vermont Adult \n     Basic Education. The Marshfield woman's name has become \n     synonymous with the organization where she's worked for \n     nearly four decades.\n       And Leahy will tell you she's treasured every minute of it.\n       ``I'm surprised I'm leaving,'' Leahy said during a Friday \n     afternoon interview at CVABE's office on Washington Street in \n     Barre. ``This is what I am because the work is every bit at \n     the center of my heart.''\n       For those unfamiliar with CVABE, ``the work'' involves \n     providing ``free, individualized and confidential academic \n     services'' to folks who range in age from 16 to 90-something.\n       Many are high school dropouts, some are immigrants \n     struggling to learn English, and still others are challenged \n     by a growing ``digital divide'' that didn't exist back in \n     1975 when a much younger Leahy ditched her job as a high \n     school art teacher to try something completely different.\n       Seated in an armchair located in the shadow of a paper \n     mache version of Barre's ``Stonecutter'' memorial--this one \n     holding a book in an outstretched hand, instead of a hammer \n     at his side--Leahy said she has never regretted enlisting as \n     a foot soldier in one of the earliest fronts in the ``War on \n     Poverty.''\n       ``When this job opened up, I went for it and it's grabbed \n     every single bit of imagination that I have,'' she said. ``It \n     has been endlessly interesting and incredibly rewarding.''\n       It was also real work, according to Leahy.\n       ``Back then all of us were working out of our cars and \n     going here and there and everywhere,'' she recalled. ``I've \n     tutored in barns, I've tutored in churches, I've tutored in \n     restaurants . . . wherever people were and (wherever they) \n     felt comfortable.''\n       Leahy's initial assignment was to expand the then-loose-\n     knit, Barre-based program into five communities in \n     Washington, Orange and Lamoille counties.\n       ``That meant literally going through the hills and knocking \n     on doors and saying: This is a program, it's free, and do you \n     know anybody . . . who would find it helpful?'' she recalled.\n       Those trips, Leahy said, were as much a search for \n     ``students'' as they were an attempt to recruit volunteers, \n     whom, she is quick to note, have long been the backbone of \n     CVABE.\n       That outreach paid off, according to Carol Shults-Perkins, \n     who joined CVABE two years before Leahy and is the other half \n     of the organization's long-standing ``executive team.''\n       ``We've been delivering, and committed to delivering \n     community-based services here in central Vermont for more \n     than 40 years now, but it really was Mary (Leahy) who began--\n     community by community, town hall by town hall, library by \n     library engaging individual community members . . . and \n     ensuring that community partnership and community \n     participation has been part and parcel of the community-based \n     services we provide.''\n       According to Shults-Perkins, who will soon assume the role \n     as CVABE's first executive director, the thought of running \n     the organization without Leahy sharing the helm is going to \n     take some getting used to.\n       ``We have worked as a team for 35 years,'' she said. ``You \n     can't replace Mary (Leahy).''\n       Shults-Perkins won't get any argument from Newberry \n     resident and Vermont Poet Laureate Sydney Lea. Lea, an 18-\n     year member of CVABE's board of directors and its current \n     president, thinks highly of the woman who recruited him \n     during a chance encounter in a hospital parking lot.\n       ``This has been way beyond a job for Mary (Leahy); it's \n     really a vision of humanity that she's been dedicated to,'' \n     Lea said.\n       ``I have an admiration for her that is pretty close to \n     boundless,'' he added, noting when he had to pick someone to \n     install him as poet laureate last year, he turned to Leahy.\n       ``She (Leahy) was the first person who came to mind,'' he \n     said. ``No fellow poets, no academics, just Mary.''\n       A soft-spoken, silver-haired woman, with kind eyes and a \n     tendency to deftly shift the focus of a conversation away \n     from herself, Leahy speaks passionately about the importance \n     of adult education, the courage of those who avail themselves \n     to the services CVABE provides, and the commitment of an \n     ever-changing cadre of volunteers who ``find the time in \n     their busy schedules to make a difference.''\n       It's a recipe that works, according to Leahy, who spent one \n     of her last days on the job pitching the merits of a program \n     that has been her life's work.\n       ``We're really the earliest of early ed(ucation) \n     programs,'' Leahy said. ``If parents are really important to \n     their children's academic success, then for the parents who \n     missed out on their own education, it stands to reason their \n     child is not going to be on an equal playing field with other \n     kids . . . That's where we come in.\n       ``If we can place ourselves in the public imagination as \n     part of the warp and weave of the entire fabric of education, \n     then we're there for people whose time is right,'' she said. \n     ``When they're ready to learn (and) they want to learn, we're \n     here to help.''\n       Leahy said she is in the process of sifting through an \n     office filled with notes, letters, and student work that \n     underscore the life-changing nature of a basic education.\n       ``It's like a memory tunnel,'' she said. ``I'm unearthing \n     all these wonderful things.''\n       One was a note from a then-newly computer literate woman \n     who thanked her CVABE teacher for helping her master modern \n     technology.\n       ``She was 90,'' Leahy said of the woman.\n       Although Leahy believes it is time for her to retire from \n     CVABE, she said she won't be going far and will likely add \n     her name to the organization's roster of volunteers.\n       ``I'll be around,'' she said.\n\n[[Page S3076]]\n\n       Leahy will also be missed, according to Lea, who penned a \n     poem--``Her Eyes''--that he read at her recent retirement \n     party.\n       Here is what Lea wrote:\n\n                                Her Eyes\n\n     --for Mary Leahy, on her retirement\n     I asked your friends about your eyes--what color\n     They were, in a few short words. The answers ranged\n     From what I'd expect, like sparkling, penetrating,\n     To ones that were anything but: the earliest green\n     Of spring, said one, another brook trout green.\n     And yet the words they used around the colors\n     They'd chosen made a chorus: compassion, kindness,\n     Acceptance, faithfulness, honor. What can I add?\n     Only that in my knowing and loving you\n     These years, I've beheld within those eyes a shine\n     That none of us will ever quite describe:\n     A certain mystery flicker born of watching\n     Pain for years yourself, and from its kindling\n     In them what we, in our own crude ways, name hope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/10/senate-section/article/S3076-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a bill I \nintroduced yesterday, the Army Arsenal Strategic Workload Enhancement \nAct of 2012.\n  I am grateful to be working with seven of my colleagues on this \nissue: Senator Kirk, Senator Grassley, Senator Harkin, Senator Pryor, \nSenator Boozman, Senator Schumer and Senator Gillibrand. Each of us \nunderstands the strategic contributions that arsenals make to our \nnational defense. I am pleased that we have a bipartisan bill to put \nthose capabilities on a firm footing for the future.\n  I know that the men and women at Rock Island Arsenal in my home State \nof Illinois deserve that firm footing. I was there just last month, \nseeing again for myself their good work to equip our troops.\n  The Joint Manufacturing and Technology Center, JMTC, employs some \n1,700 highly skilled workers, at least half of whom are veterans. The \nJMTC is the heart of Rock Island's 8,600-person workforce, every one of \nthem dedicated to providing our troops with what they need.\n  For more than 10 years now, they have made critical weapons, parts \nand materiel for our men and women on the front lines of Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Very often, they have produced items in a crisis, when no \none else including the private sector could do it. And they have made \nit by the deadline and kept it affordable.\n  The arsenal has made things like up-armored HMMWV kits to protect \nagainst improvised explosive devices, IEDs, at a time in the war when, \nfrankly, we were caught flat-footed by the threat. They have produced \nportable tool sheds so that vehicle maintenance can take place in \ntheater instead of having to pull those vehicles off the front lines. \nWhen the Army depleted its stock of a small but critical component for \nartillery repair, Rock Island stepped up to provide it on short notice.\n  These are the little-known, lifesaving contributions made by this \narsenal.\n  So my colleagues and I have come together on a bipartisan basis to \nmake sure this strategic asset has a strong future. Our bill would \nrequire the Army to create a strategic plan to ensure each arsenal \nreceives the workload it needs to keep its workers' skills sharp. The \nArmy does this type of systematic planning for some of its \nsubdivisions, but not for arsenals. This bill addresses that.\n  Our bill also would ensure that these arsenals can compete for any \nmilitary contract, defense-wide. Too often, arsenals are passed over in \nthe contract process. But this bill will ensure these connections \nhappen.\n  Rock Island's highly skilled workforce has a proven track record. It \nis in everyone's interest to strengthen this competition.\n  These two core provisions will help to ensure the long-term health of \nRock Island Arsenal. They build upon a bipartisan effort last year by \nthe Illinois and Iowa delegations to expand the arsenal's ability to \nenter into public-private partnerships. We have seen how these \npartnerships can drive innovation in new areas like titanium and metal \nalloys. And they cost the government nothing, all the while assisting \nin keeping the factory warm and these critical skills available when \nour country needs them when our troops need them.\n  I appreciated Senator Levin and Senator McCain working with us \nthrough the National Defense Authorization Act last year to ensure \nthese provisions were included. I look forward to working with them \nthis year as well.\n  Rock Island Arsenal is a little-known gem in our military with great \nimportance for our country. I hope we may continue to support their \ncritical role by advancing the ideas I have discussed today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/10/senate-section/article/S3076-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3076-S3078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING THE BUSH VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \ndedication and devotion shown by a group of men and women to their \nlocal community. The longstanding services of the Bush Volunteer Fire \nDepartment in Laurel County, KY, has been on the cutting edge of rural \nand volunteer fire departments in the State of Kentucky since the \ndepartment's beginnings in 1975.\n  What is so inspiring about the individuals in the Bush VFD is that \ndespite the obstacles placed before them, they have always persevered \nand prevailed. While the men and women of the department have \nexperienced many successes and accomplishments, I think it is safe to \nsay that these individuals feel that their biggest achievement is the \nopportunity to serve and protect their fellow citizens in the face of \ndanger.\n  The Bush Volunteer Fire Department was conceived of by a group of 13 \nlocal men who saw a flaw within their community. At the time, the \nLaurel County Fire Department presided over the Bush community, but the \nLCFD was over half-an-hour away. The 13 men in Bush decided that the \nLCFD was just too far away, and for the safety of their citizens, it \nwas time to assemble a firefighting unit closer to home. The LCFD \ndonated a 1947 K-model International fire truck, and just like that, \nthe Bush Volunteer Fire Department was born.\n  Since the beginning of the department, the men and women at BVFD have \nsought to become the best that they could possibly be, by implementing \nnew and innovative practices at each and every turn in the road. In \nless than a year since their start in 1975, the department had secured \nfunds to develop a fire station to house its truck and equipment. Bush \nVFD was also the third rural volunteer department in the Commonwealth \nof Kentucky to receive a Class 7 rating from ISO.\n  In 2011, the department began a junior firefighter program to enlist \nthe help of eager youth in the community in a safe and beneficial way. \nIn 2011, BVFD also enlisted its first female member, Whitney Minton, \nwho joined in alongside her father Rick. These changes, and others, \nhave assisted the Bush Volunteer Fire Department in attaining much of \nthe success it knows today.\n  I am encouraged by the passion for service of the men and women \nfirefighters and EMTs of the Bush Volunteer Fire Department. Former \nBush Chief Ernest Rudder has had the pleasure of following in his \nfather's footsteps, Birchell L. Rudder, in working in the fire house. \nErnest's son Marc joined the ranks once he had reached the proper age, \nand now his son Noah is anxious to be the fourth generation of Rudders \nto enter firefighting. The Bush Fire Department is truly a family \naffair for families like the Rudders.\n  I wonder if those 13 men who took it upon themselves in 1975 to enact \nchange in their community ever thought their dream of a volunteer fire \ndepartment would become such a huge success. Although this story is \ncommon in our country, let us not go without recognizing those who set \nthemselves apart in pursuit of a better future, like those in the Bush \ncommunity.\n  Mr. President, at this time I would like to ask my colleagues in the \nUnited States Senate to join me in paying tribute to the outstanding \nservice of the many volunteers over the course of the lifetime of the \nBush Volunteer Fire Department.\n\n[[Page S3077]]\n\n  There was recently an article published in the Sentinel-Echo: Silver \nEdition, an eastern Kentucky local periodical magazine, highlighting \nthe many years of service given by the Bush Volunteer Fire Department. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition]\n\n                          They Answer the Call\n\n                            (By Sue Minton)\n\n       Imagine waking in the middle of the night with your home \n     engulfed in a sea of black smoke, or out for an afternoon \n     drive when you spot a cloud of smoke billowing from a distant \n     hillside. The first call you make is to the county dispatch. \n     Pagers buzz in pockets and on tables of volunteer \n     firefighters, summoning them to their stations. And they \n     always come.\n       Members of the Bush Volunteer Fire Department have been \n     answering these calls for almost 37 years.\n       In April 1975, 13 men from the Bush community met at \n     Providence Baptist Church for the purpose of organizing a \n     fire department to protect the lives and property within \n     their community.\n       The reason for starting the department, according to Dennis \n     Minton, charter and current board of trustees member, was--\n     ``The Laurel County Fire Department was responding to calls \n     in the county. It could be as long as 30 minutes from the \n     time they received the call until they arrived at the scene \n     (in the old Bush community). By this time, in most cases, the \n     structure was on the ground or fully involved. The residents \n     needed and deserved better protection within their \n     community.''\n       A fire department was organized and they received their \n     first truck before they found a home.\n       ``The Laurel County Fire Department donated the department \n     a used 1947 K-model International,'' said Ernest Rudder, \n     charter member and captain. ``Because we didn't have a \n     building, the truck was parked at different firemen's \n     homes.''\n       With fundraising and donations, in less than a year a two-\n     story building was constructed off east Ky. 80 on Ky. 1803 \n     adjacent to the ``old'' Bush School. To repay a proposed \n     loan, in May of 1976 the fire department proposed a tax rate \n     of .08 cents per $100 on real-estate property. Today, that \n     tax rate has been lowered to .0570 cents. The primary purpose \n     of the loan was to pay for fire hydrants and dry hydrants, \n     which were installed throughout the district.\n       This move paved the way for the district to receive a Class \n     7 rating from ISO. ``We were the third rural volunteer \n     department in the Commonwealth of Kentucky to be granted this \n     rating,'' Rudder said. ``This move also substantially lowered \n     insurance rates for some homeowners.''\n       Under the leadership of its first chief, Kenneth Smith \n     (1975 to 1984), the department grew in manpower and \n     equipment. But, at 3:43 a.m. on June 20, 1984, members of the \n     fire department responded to a blaze at the last place they \n     would have expected their own station.\n       Daybreak found the firefighters still on the scene, and the \n     realization was sinking in they had lost their building and \n     all their equipment.\n       The loss of the building was a major blow for the firemen \n     and the community, but the Bush residents were never without \n     fire protection. Other departments in and outside the county \n     volunteered their service and equipment.\n       ``One of the trucks brought to the fire by Laurel County \n     Fire Department stayed until we got a new truck,'' Rudder \n     said. ``Bell County Fire Department also sent a tanker for us \n     to use.''\n       In January 1985, the community and county were invited to a \n     dedication and open house for the newly rebuilt fire station.\n       The new station grew both in size and membership from 13 \n     charter members without a fire truck or station into a roster \n     of 42 active volunteers, seven of whom are EMTs; three Class \n     A pumpers; and two tankers.\n       Bush Fire Department proudly protects more than 10,000 \n     people living in an area of 35 square miles and operates out \n     of two stations--Fire Station No.2, opened in 1993, is \n     located on east Ky. 80 in the Lick Fork community. \n     ``Congressman Hal Rogers gave the dedication address,'' \n     Rudder said.\n       Six chiefs were elected to command the department over the \n     years; the current is Phillip Williams, and the longest \n     serving chief was Don Minton (1999 to 2010).\n       The fire chiefs, along with their men, have one thing in \n     mind: ``to serve and protect the Bush community.'' And this \n     they are doing by continuing their training and recruiting \n     new members.\n       In 2011, the department initiated a junior firefighter \n     program.\n       Also in 2011, Whitney Minton became the first female member \n     of the department, joining her father, Rick, a sergeant.\n       In volunteer fire departments, and for many in close-knit \n     rural communities, it is natural that one generation would \n     follow the next on the department roll.\n       And it was a given that Marc Rudder would follow in the \n     footsteps of his father, Ernest Rudder.\n       Marc Rudder knew that he would grow up to become a \n     firefighter. ``Being able to watch the firefighters help the \n     people of the community in their time of need played a major \n     role in the factor of me wanting to be a fireman,'' Marc \n     Rudder said.\n       ``I feel that the fire department is something that I have \n     always known,'' he added. ``I always played `fireman' as a \n     child. I did not know childhood without the fire department. \n     I got to play with small toy fire trucks and big real fire \n     trucks.''\n       ``Yes, he has been interested in all things fire or EMS \n     since he was just a small child,'' Ernest Rudder added. \n     ``Like he said, his first toys were fire trucks, ambulances \n     and police cars. It is just natural that he would want to be \n     a firefighter.''\n       ``Marc was with me at the fire department meetings from the \n     time he was a small boy.'' he added. ``He was around the \n     volunteers and he learned as we did.''\n       At that time, the fire department didn't have a junior \n     firefighter program, so Marc could not join the department. \n     But by the time he was 16 years old, he was taking classes \n     with the other firemen. ``When he could `officially' be on \n     the roster, he was ready to be certified with his required \n     150 hours of training,'' his father said.\n       ``One of my first jobs was as an EMT with Ambulance Inc. of \n     Laurel County,'' Marc Rudder said. ``And I feel this was due \n     to the influence the fire department had on me.''\n       His exposure to the volunteers at Bush Fire Department has, \n     in a round-about way, given him that experience that is now \n     his life's career.\n       Rudder, who is the State Fire Rescue Training Area 13 \n     Coordinator with the Kentucky Fire Commission, said the \n     knowledge he learned at the Bush Fire Department has helped \n     him each day in his job.\n       ``I feel that coming from a volunteer department serving a \n     rural community has a great benefit over many other people \n     that I work with across the country.''\n       He coordinates an office that provides training and \n     assistance to 67 fire departments in eight counties in \n     southeastern Kentucky. His office is also an assisting agency \n     to the fire departments in the area for any information that \n     they might need to better serve their communities. Rudder has \n     studied at the National Fire Academy in Maryland and also \n     serves on committees across the region, state, nation, and \n     world.\n       The fourth generation of the Rudder family, Noah, can't \n     wait to follow in the footsteps of his great-grandfather, \n     grandfather and father.\n       His great-grandfather, Birchell L. Rudder, was an original \n     member of the board of trustees, being elected in 1975, \n     elected chairman of the board of trustees in 1979, and served \n     as chairman until 1996, but remained on the board until his \n     death in 2002.\n       Noah Rudder, a seventh-grader at North Laurel Middle \n     School, has been coming to the Monday night meetings like his \n     father, Marc, for a long time. He is just waiting until he is \n     old enough to become a junior firefighter.\n       ``I like to go to the fire department because I know all \n     the people and they are like family to me. And I enjoy \n     learning about firefighting and seeing the equipment,'' he \n     said.\n       ``Incidentally, Noah is an authority on all things having \n     to do with 9/11,'' his grandfather added.\n       Also, Noah's aunt, Dawn, and her husband, Frank Kilby, are \n     members of the Laurel County Volunteer Fire Department.\n       ``The department is comprised of members from all walks of \n     life and everyone brings something to the table,'' Ernest \n     Rudder said. ``During an emergency, we are all business. We \n     are a department of friends and neighbors. But we are always \n     willing to welcome another member.''\n       ``We like what we do. We volunteer our time to help people \n     when they need it. It's giving back to the community. And the \n     department has an excellent relationship with the community. \n     They visit schools to present fire-safety programs, allow \n     children to climb onto their fire trucks, and participate in \n     local parades and other civic functions.''\n       From its earliest beginnings, the Bush Volunteer Fire \n     Department has realized the importance of training for this \n     most hazardous job. Proper training ensures that the best \n     interests of the citizens are being served and they are able \n     to return to the station without the life of a firefighter \n     being harmed or lost.\n       Requirements for being a certified firefighter in Kentucky \n     are the same, but Bush requires each member to obtain at \n     least 20 additional hours of training a year.\n       ``Many of the members are certified or currently obtaining \n     emergency medical technician training, which requires more \n     training every two years,'' Marc Rudder said.\n       ``This training will enable the EMTs to provide medical \n     care to the community and assist the EMS agency.''\n       Because of the extensive training Bush Fire Department \n     members receive, they hold the honor of being five-time \n     Kentucky Firefighter Olympic Champions, having won the title \n     in 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993. The team retired \n     undefeated.\n       ``Firefighters have become more aware of the dangers of \n     being firefighters, EMS workers and police officers since 9/\n     11,'' he continued. ``Many new training requirements have \n     come about since Sept. 11, 2011, and I believe the people who \n     want to be firefighters realize the dangers and the great \n     responsibility that being a firefighter entails. I imagine \n     all the\n\n[[Page S3078]]\n\n     fire departments have gotten better and train harder because \n     of 9/11.''\n       Every firefighter is by law a ``peace officer'' and duty-\n     bound to report anything unseemly they come across.\n       In the post-9/11 world we live in today, firefighters are \n     expected to do even more to safeguard the lives of residents \n     in their districts. They must be able to address all hazards, \n     not just fires.\n       As ``first responders,'' firefighters can provide \n     information to emergency-response agencies that have not yet \n     arrived on the scene. They can determine the situation and \n     decide what resources are required, whether it be an \n     ambulance, law enforcement, hazmat team, or an arson \n     investigator.\n       House fires kill and injure thousands yearly, and cost many \n     more their valued possessions and memories.\n       ``The activity report for 2011 has Bush Volunteer Fire \n     Department responding to 102 calls,'' Ernest Rudder said. \n     ``Thankfully, only nine were structure fires. We had several \n     grass fires and about five or six vehicle fires. The vast \n     majority of our calls these days are to assist Ambulance Inc. \n     of Laurel County with automobile accidents or to answer and \n     investigate residential smoke or fire alarms.''\n       Rudder said it would be hard to designate the most \n     dangerous fire the department had responded to over the \n     years. ``But the Blackwater Church fire was really big with a \n     roof collapse. The big fires in the city of London that we've \n     assisted with and the fires at Chaney Lumber were big and \n     dangerous. We've never had anyone seriously hurt, but \n     recently, on a mutual-aid fire with Laurel County, two of our \n     men were knocked down when the garage doors and ceiling fell \n     on them. Luckily, there were several other firemen there who \n     pulled them to safety.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/10/senate-section/article/S3078-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3078-S3079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO KENTUCKY WORLD WAR II VETERANS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of a group of men \nfrom the Commonwealth of Kentucky who all acted bravely and valiantly \nduring their time of service in the United States Armed Forces in World \nWar II. Glenn Combs, Toleman Combs, Mansell Stone, Benjamin Garrison, \nWalter Garrison, Rufus Miller, Earl Hobbs, and Elvy Roberts, who are \nall from different towns and hollers in Clay County, KY, each has a \nfascinating story of his experiences while in the military. And it is \nmy hope to share a few of those with you today.\n  When the United States of America decided to enter the Second World \nWar, we did so with an insurmountable level of patriotism, dedication, \nand determination to defeat the Axis Powers. Men were going to extreme \nlengths to enlist and answer the call to serve their country, and \nprotect freedom and democracy in the foreign countries around the world \nin which it was being tested.\n  Earl Hobbs, one of the men in this group of eight, had learned that \nhe was just 2 pounds shy of the minimum weight required by the U.S. \nArmy at the time of his enlistment. Upon hearing this news, he \nhurriedly ran to the nearest convenience store and purchased 3 square \npounds of bananas. He gobbled them down right there outside the \ngrocery, every last one of them. Later that day he passed the physical, \nincluding the weight requirement, and was an official member of the \nU.S. Armed Forces. It was instances like Earl's that truly inspire me; \ninstances of men and women going to such great lengths to secure their \nfreedom and the freedom of the ones that they love.\n  Earl's action that day so long ago was just one of many from what we \ncall the ``Greatest Generation.'' Men and women alike across the Nation \nassumed new and unfamiliar assignments and positions that they may not \nhave been comfortable with, all for the cause of defending liberty and \nsecuring freedom. We must look to the veterans of not only the Second \nWorld War, but the veterans of all the Nation's conflicts and \nstruggles, with the utmost respect. We must not take for granted the \ninalienable rights we have so passionately fought to gain and maintain, \nand we must never forget those who have made the greatest sacrifice \nmade by many on behalf of those rights.\n  I truly cherish the opportunity to stand on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate today to speak on behalf of these eight men and relate a true \nstory of a local Kentucky ``Band of Brothers'' who decided to honor God \nand country and selflessly serve all those who inhabit this great \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in commemorating the \ngreat contributions of Glenn Combs, Toleman Combs, Mansell Stone, \nBenjamin Garrison, Walter Garrison, Rufus Miller, Earl Hobbs, and Elvy \nRoberts to the cause of freedom.\n  In July of 2011 there was an article published in the Manchester \nEnterprise, Clay County's local newspaper, which featured the truly \nunique journey these eight World War II veterans have experienced in \ntheir lifetimes. I ask unanimous consent the said article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n            [From the Manchester Enterprise, July 28, 2011]\n\n                       A Chapter in WWII History\n\n       Note: This week's feature story covers eight individuals \n     who aided their country to take part in World War II. This \n     story was graciously sent in by Ted Garrison.\n       After a thorough debate on the world situation, expressing \n     their personal opinions and obligations for a month, they \n     made a decision. They would honor God and country, and defend \n     the Republic of the United States in WWII.\n       Glenn and Toleman Combs, Mansell ``Dude'' Stone, and \n     Benjamin and Walter Garrison enlisted in the U.S. Army. \n     Another of the Garrison brothers, Theo, wanted to join, but \n     he was informed that it would be more important to the war \n     effort for him to remain at home and continue to mine coal.\n       When I first began my research on this small group, I \n     thought Rufus ``Jamup'' Miller and Earl Hobbs were with them. \n     I found that they entered the military at a different date, \n     but these men (as did so many others) endured enormous \n     hardships during their service, so I decided it necessary to \n     include them in this brief history of patriotism and uncommon \n     valor.\n       The small group of recruits departed Manchester on October \n     16, 1940, to be inducted into the military at Ft. Thomas, KY. \n     Walt Garrison was 18 years old at that time. Walt and a \n     friend from Kentucky earned the top scores for expert \n     riflemen in their company. Later, Uncle Walt laughed and \n     blamed snow for causing him to lose to his friend by one \n     point the day they were at the rifle range.\n       Toleman Combs, Ben Garrison, and Walt Garrison were \n     assigned to Anti-Tank Company of the 10th Infantry Regiment \n     attached to Lt. General George S. Patton's 1st Armored \n     Division of the 3rd Army. Glenn Combs was assigned to \n     Headquarters training and was a Glider Wing of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division.\n       I believe we should mention that Capt. Elvy Roberts, born \n     on Beech Creek in Clay County, commanded a Glider Wing in the \n     101st Airborne at Normandy. He also participated in two \n     parachute jumps there. Elvy Roberts made a career of the U.S. \n     military and led the 6th Army as a Lt. General in Vietnam.\n       The 10th Infantry, with other Army units, including \n     segments of the 101st and 82nd Airborne, were stationed in \n     Iceland. The troops weren't informed that this location was \n     actually a staging area in preparation for the Normandy \n     invasion. Normandy was one of the most important events of \n     WWII. They shipped out of Iceland bound for an unknown \n     destination. After arriving offshore, the 10th Infantry \n     Regiment stayed aboard ships during the first three days of \n     the battle. Their orders were to wait until inclement weather \n     cleared enough to move the tanks and anti-tank guns onto the \n     beaches.\n       The day before the landing, in the pre-attack briefing, \n     they learned the location was Normandy, and details of the \n     mission were revealed. At that time, they were unaware that \n     their friend, ``Dude'' Stone, was in the initial attack on \n     the German-held beaches. Soldiers of the 82nd and 101st \n     Airborne had already fought a fierce battle, starting June 3, \n     1944. ``Dude'' had gone in with a glider wing. There were 200 \n     men in his wing, and only nine survived.\n       10th Infantry Regiment and other units prepared to attack. \n     The Anti-Tank company departed the USS Republican by landing \n     crafts and stormed the beach on June 6 at 6:30 AM. Uncle Walt \n     said, ``The scene was terrible, but we had a job to do. We \n     could see fortifications blown apart, tank wreckage, and the \n     bodies of American airborne troops lying on the beach.''\n       I asked him if he was afraid when they hit the beach, and \n     he answered, ``No, but I was very angry when I saw how the \n     Germans had treated our soldiers.'' American troops had \n     sustained approximately 6,036 casualties during the first \n     hour of the invasion and over 2,400 at Omaha Beach alone, but \n     they had gained a toehold.\n       American troops were able to fight their way over the \n     beaches and hundred-foot high cliffs to move ahead a few \n     miles and dig in for approximately 24 hours, thus securing \n     the area. This was a process they repeated, moving the line \n     forward. During these advances, Uncle Walt and a soldier of \n     German ancestry performed sniper and reconnaissance duty for \n     their company. On one occasion near the Modelle River in \n     France, A-T Company came under mortar and rifle fire from a \n     small town. Walt and Wolfgang split up and worked their way \n     toward each end of the village, firing on the enemy positions \n     as they moved in. When they were close, Wolfgang yelled to \n     the enemy troops using the German language, telling them they \n     were surrounded and ordered them to surrender.\n       Approximately 150 German soldiers surrendered. There was at \n     least one SS Trooper with them. Walt and Wolfgang referred to \n     that episode as their Sgt. York Trick!\n\n[[Page S3079]]\n\n       Earl Hobbs was discovered to be two pounds under the \n     required body weight at the induction center. He ran to a \n     nearby grocery store, bought three bounds of bananas, \n     hurriedly ate the fruit and passed the physical. Was this an \n     example of youthful patriotism or what?\n       After basic training, Earl was schooled in armor at Ft. \n     Knox, KY. He was assigned to a tank crew in the 1st Armored \n     Division. During a battle near Algeria, Africa, his tank was \n     disabled and the crew was forced to evacuate. They were \n     captured by German soldiers and taken to a POW camp, Stalag \n     3B in Berlin, Germany, where he was a prisoner for 27 months.\n       While he was in this camp, fellow Clay Countian Squire \n     Baker was incarcerated there for three or four months, then \n     moved out to a different location. Squire and surviving \n     members of their bomber crew had been shot down and captured. \n     Stalag 3B was liberated by Russian allies. Earl said, ``The \n     Russians were much more cruel than our former German \n     captors.''\n       Rufus ``Jamup'' Miller, Jr. was inducted into the military \n     at Cincinnati, Ohio, August 13, 1943. After basic training at \n     Camp Blanding, Florida, he was assigned to K Company of the \n     339th Infantry, Third Battalion. They were heavily involved \n     in the assault on the Gustav line.\n       This location was in Italy. K Company's losses were very \n     heavy, nearly 55 percent. Most of the casualties in K Company \n     were from the minefields. However, they also encountered \n     mortar, rifle, and machine-gun fire. ``Jamup'' was among the \n     wounded. The 339th Infantry was one of the three regiments of \n     the 85th Infantry Division. In WWI, they were nicknamed the \n     ``Polar Bears.''\n       The 85th had a proud and famous history. The second time \n     ``Jamup'' was wounded was in the North Apennines Campaign in \n     bitter fighting east of Mount Verruca. He was also involved \n     in the PO Valley campaign as well as the Rome-Arno Campaign. \n     After being wounded twice, Miller was transferred to the \n     military police. June 5th, 1944, the 339th did their victory \n     march through Rome.\n       Glenn Combs was at the induction center when doctors \n     decided his feet were a little flat for the infantry. He went \n     through basic training and into Headquarters Company of the \n     1st Armored Division. In December of 1942, they traveled to \n     North Africa by ships. Glenn was involved in battles at \n     Anzio, Kasserine Pass, Tunisia, and Algeria. After avoiding a \n     near disaster at Kasserine Pass, the commanding general was \n     relieved and Col. Robinett was placed in charge of \n     operations. Because of his excellent strategy and leadership \n     in attaining victory in a very negative situation, Col. Paul \n     ``Little Man'' Robinette was promoted to Brig. General. \n     Kasserine Pass was considered to be the first major battle \n     won by American forces in North Africa. Glenn Combs was \n     promoted from staff sergeant to junior warrant officer, and \n     in a few months to chief warrant officer. Glenn said, ``One \n     of the reasons I was promoted through the enlisted ranks to \n     officer was due to so many men getting killed in my \n     company.''\n       These men served approximately five years. Walt Garrison \n     was one of the fortunate. He didn't receive a scratch. Uncle \n     Ben wasn't so lucky. He was wounded in the shoulder by \n     shrapnel from an exploding artillery shell on a hill near the \n     Moselle River in France.\n       Walt Garrison was one of those veterans who could talk \n     about his war experience. Ben, ``Dude,'' ``Jamup,'' and many \n     others were too scarred emotionally, mentally, and physically \n     to recall their combat duty.\n       I apologize that I'm unable to provide more complete \n     information concerning the sacrifices these men made for our \n     country. They and many more of those veterans are heroes and \n     should never be forgotten. The American people who lived \n     during the WWII era earned a reputation as ``The Greatest \n     Generation.'' I truly believe they deserve that compliment. \n     Not only in military service, but also in different walks of \n     life, many of them had exemplary attitudes and \n     accomplishments.\n       At this time, Glen Combs is the only one of these men still \n     living. He is 92 and in poor health.\n       Toleman Combs passed away November 29, 1995, and is buried \n     at Nancy, KY. Rufus ``Jamup'' Miller died February 3, 1997, \n     and is buried in Manchester. Benjamin Franklin Garrison died \n     at Wilmore Veteran's Hospital December 27, 1997, and is \n     buried at Memorial Gardens in Manchester. Walter Garrison \n     passed away on May 22, 2002.\n       Years ago, Uncle Walt decided to be buried with some of the \n     soldiers he served with at Normandy. He was laid to rest in \n     Butler County Memorial Park ``Field of Honor'' near Hamilton, \n     Ohio.\n       Earl Hobbs died November 25, 2003, and is buried at \n     Memorial Gardens in Manchester.

This award is given to musicians whose \nlifetime contributions to the field of popular song demonstrate the \nstandard of excellence associated with George and Ira Gershwin. Mr. \nBacharach received this award jointly with cowriter Hal David, which is \nthe first time in the history of this award that it has gone to a \nsongwriting team. This prestigious honor not only celebrates their \nwork, but it places them among the ranks of Paul Simon, Paul McCartney, \nand Stevie Wonder, all previous recipients.\n  Born in Missouri and raised in New York, Burt built a name for \nhimself over his six-decade career as one of the country's most \nrespected and honored songwriters. His partnership with Hal David \ncreated such beloved songs as ``Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head,'' \n``What the World Needs Now is Love,'' ``Walk on By,'' and ``Alfie.'' \nThe duo first began collaborating in the 1950s at the Famous Paramount \nMusic Company, and among their first big hits were ``The Story of My \nLife,'' made famous by Marty Robbins, and ``Magic Moments,'' performed \nby Perry Como.\n  Following on their first successes, between 1962 and 1972 their songs \nwere almost continuously on Billboard Magazine's singles chart. During \nthis time they worked with an array of singers, including Dionne \nWarwick, B.J. Thomas, Dusty Springfield, The Carpenters, Tom Jones, \nJackie DeShannon, Gene Pitney, and Herb Alpert. Together, Burt and Hal \nhave written numerous hits that have helped launch the careers of some \nof America's most celebrated musicians.\n  Mr. Bacharach, one of the most honored and successful composers of \nour time, has earned three Academy Awards and eight Grammy Awards. \nThese include the 1997 Grammy Trustees Award, which he shares with \nDavid, and the 2008 Lifetime Achievement Award. Even after being \ninducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, he is still touring and \nperforming all over the world.\n  I ask my Senate colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Mr. \nBurt Bacharach on this well-deserved honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/10/senate-section/article/S3079-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO PATROLMAN BEN CAMPBELL\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Patrolman Ben \nCampbell of Copley, OH, for being honored as a 2012 National \nAssociation of Police Organizations (NAPO) TOP COPS award recipient for \nthe brave and heroic actions he has displayed in the line of duty.\n  On August 7, 2011, Officer Ben Campbell responded to a report of \nshots fired in a Copley Township neighborhood and he found a very \ngrisly scene. An armed suspect had shot eight people, killing seven, \nand was still at large in the neighborhood. Without waiting for backup, \nOfficer Campbell took off on foot after the suspect. As he scoured the \narea, he heard more gunshots and ran in their direction. Suddenly he \nfound himself in an open area, with no protection, but surrounded by \ntrees and houses, any one of which could be concealing the shooter. \nMoments later, the suspect stepped out from behind a house and pointed \nan automatic pistol directly at Officer Campbell. Officer Campbell \ncommanded the shooter to drop his weapon, and when the man refused, the \nOfficer had no choice but to shoot, killing the suspect.\n  It was a horrible tragedy, but without Officer Campbell's \nunhesitating courage, it would have been far worse. A subsequent \ninvestigation confirmed this when more than 200 rounds of ammunition \nwere discovered in the suspect's car.\n  For his commitment to the Copley community, as well as his tremendous \nacts of bravery on August 7, 2011, I would like to recognize and thank \nMr. Campbell for his service and congratulate him on receiving the \nNational Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) TOP COPS award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/10/senate-section/article/S3079-3", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3079-S3080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            2011 U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION HONOREES\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, every year the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration, SBA, honors our country's local entrepreneurs, \nhardworking Americans who have built businesses from ideas and created \njobs for their communities. I would like to congratulate the eight \noutstanding entrepreneurs from Connecticut who were recognized in 2011, \nmost especially, A. Gregory Bachmann of Torrington, Connecticut's DYMAX \nCorporation, who\n\n[[Page S3080]]\n\nwas named 2011 Connecticut Small Business Person of the Year.\n  The SBA has advocated for small businesses in Connecticut since 1953, \nproviding assistance through the Federal Small Business Innovation \nResearch, SBIR, Program, facilitated at Connecticut Innovations. This \nsupport has included more than $500 million of financing, education and \ntraining, and procurement aid for individuals with big ideas and \nbusinesses wanting to expand by taking technological risks.\n  The winner of the Small Business Person of the Year award must meet \neight sets of criteria, including staying power, growth in number of \nemployees, increase in sales and/or unit volume, current and past \nfinancial performance, innovativeness of product or service offered, \nresponse to adversity, contributions to community-oriented projects, \nand the products exported and markets served.\n  In 1979, Mr. Bachmann inherited the business his parents had started \nin their basement. Now, DYMAX makes its home in a 100,000 square foot \nbuilding and operates facilities globally, including in Germany, China, \nHong Kong, and Korea. It offers innovative technology, such as \nadhesives, coatings, epoxies, masking resins, and light-curing systems, \nto manufacturers who rely on innovative solutions for reliable, cost-\neffective, and quick automated assembly. Most recently, DYMAX has \nsuccessfully experimented with UV and LED technology as a cutting-edge \nway for companies to grow. In addition to the tremendous progress Mr. \nBachmann has made since his parents' vision, I commend him for ensuring \nthat his company remains environmentally conscious while making \nremarkable strides in research and development. DYMAX also gives back \nto Connecticut's less fortunate, and has received an award from United \nWay of Northwest Connecticut for ``conducting the most unique employee \nincentive program'' for contributions to their annual food drive.\n  In addition to the title of Small Business Person of the Year, the \nSBA recognizes seven other businesses or individuals in Connecticut \nevery year as Minority Small Business Champion, Veterans Advocate \nChampion, Explorer of the Year, the Jeffrey Butland Family Owned \nBusiness of the Year, Region One Subcontractor of the Year, Women in \nBusiness Champion, and Financial Services Champion.\n  Clayton Williams and Dennis Brown are two of the 2011 awardees who \nare driven by their passion for the potential of small businesses and \nthe ways they can transform lives. I have seen firsthand the tremendous \nroots local businesses have set in New Haven and the central part they \nplay in the city's community, so it is no surprise that Mr. Williams, \nthe city of New Haven's small business development officer, received \nthe 2011 Minority Small Business Champion award. He has worked \ntirelessly on behalf of minority entrepreneurs as part of the Office of \nEconomic Development to help fund and sustain the best, most promising \nideas in the New Haven area. Veterans Advocate Champion Dennis Brown \nwas awarded for his service as vice president of Business Counseling \nfor Connecticut Community Investment Corporation, a nonprofit that \nworks with small business owners to secure loans and develop strategy. \nA veteran and recipient of an SBA veteran's loan in 1982, Mr. Brown \ndemonstrates that dreams can be realized with persistence. I applaud \nthe SBA for recognizing the importance of providing for our Nation's \nheroes who wish to run their own businesses once returning home.\n  In addition, every year the SBA names an Explorer of the Year in \nConnecticut, acknowledging that risk confronts business owners every \nday. 2011 winner, On Site Gas Systems of Newington and its president, \nFrank X. Hursey, are committed to the most cutting-edge solutions and \ndesigns for reliable sources of gas used by a comprehensive set of \nindustries, including emergency response, food preservation, \nautomobile, and by our military.\n  Often, it is family owned businesses, hoping to continue the legacy \nof previous generations that become reliable sources of products or \nservices central to their communities. The SBA named Jim Nilsson, owner \nand managing partner of Geissler's Supermarkets of South Windsor, as \nthe 2011 Jeffrey Butland Family Owned Business of the Year. In 1923, \nGeissler's was a small storefront, and now it offers online shopping \nand delivery. Often family businesses in Connecticut also win other \ncategories, and in 2011, the SBA honored Region 1 Subcontractor of the \nYear Thomas Dolan, Jr., for his work as president of Hi-Rel Products in \nEssex. Hi-Rel Products was started in the early 1970s by Mr. Dolan's \nfather, who worked out of his Old Saybrook home to experiment with \nreliable precision components for microelectronics. Now, this \ntechnology has applications across a wide range of industries. \nCurrently, Hi-Rel employs approximately 100 people in the United \nStates, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n  Lastly, I would like to recognize Margaret Sheahan, 2011 Women in \nBusiness Champion, and Patrick Lorent, 2011 Financial Services \nChampion, for their work in Connecticut in the legal and financial \nlending industries, respectively. Ms. Sheahan is founding partner of \nMitchell & Sheahan of Redding and provides important legal counsel in \nemployment and union disputes. Mr. Lorent was honored by the SBA for \nhis role as vice president and manager of People's United Bank \nGovernment Lending Department where he connects United Bank with \nnational, statewide, and local lending programs. This important work \nprovides vital lifelines to the small businesses of Connecticut that \ncan continue to focus on research and development without worrying \nabout their protection and sustenance.\n  The SBA continues to raise awareness and support for Connecticut's \nlocal entrepreneurs with their annual awards. The SBA and its 2011 \nhonorees are inspirational, showing our Nation's budding business \nowners and leaders how to grow an idea to global proportions--driven by \nthe most advanced research and technology and steadfast confidence in \nthe American legacy of starting from the beginning to achieve \ngreatness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/10/senate-section/article/S3080-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3080-S3081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PHARMACY COMPETITION AND CONSUMER CHOICE ACT\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Pharmacy \nCompetition and Consumer Choice Act, S. 1058. In light of the Federal \nTrade Commission's recent decision to allow the merger of two Pharmacy \nBenefit Managers, creating the largest PBM in our nation, I call on my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this vital piece of legislation. \nThe Pharmacy Competition and Consumer Choice Act, if enacted, would \nhelp protect patients and providers from soaring health-care costs and \npotentially anticompetitive conduct by PBMs, who are the middlemen in \nthe prescription drug industry.\n  Over the past several years, I have spoken with many of Mississippi's \npharmacists who feel powerless against PBMs and their overreaching \ninfluence in their industry. In Mississippi, where over 1 million \nindividuals live in rural, medically underserved areas, community \npharmacists play a pivotal role in providing health care to patients. \nThese pharmacists, often the only health-care providers in an area, \ndevelop trusting relationships with their customers and communities. \nThis legislation will help level the playing field between community \npharmacies and PBMs, while ensuring Americans have access to the \nproviders of their choice.\n  While a few States, such as my State of Mississippi, regulate the \nactivities of PBMs, these powerful players in health care remain \nlargely unregulated by the Federal Government. PBMs compete across \nstate lines in our country, and this legislation would provide national \nanti-fraud oversight in each of our 50 States.\n  The need for this legislation is clearer now than ever. With the \nupcoming merger, one company will control 40 percent of the market. As \none FTC Commissioner appropriately stated, it will be a ``game \nchanger.''\n  I am an unyielding supporter of free markets, and I strongly believe \nthis legislation would facilitate a more transparent, competitive, and \nfair marketplace for PBMs, pharmacies, providers, and patients. On \nbehalf of the millions of Americans and businesses affected by the \nmarket practices of Pharmacy Benefit Managers, I urge my colleagues to \npass the Pharmacy Competition and Consumer Choice Act.\n\n[[Page S3081]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/10/senate-section/article/S3081-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO RETIRED CAPTAIN THOMAS JEROME HUDNER, JR.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today in tribute to \nretired United States Navy Captain Thomas Jerome Hudner, Jr. of \nConcord, MA, a true American hero. For his uncommon valor and \ndedication to the highest principals of our military, the Navy \nannounced this week it will name the Arleigh Burke class guided-missile \ndestroyer DDG 116 the USS Thomas Hudner.\n  It is a distinct honor, for an individual to have a Navy vessel \ncommissioned in their name; it is an extremely rare honor indeed for a \nwarship to be named after a living person. Yet there are few, if any, \npeople more deserving of this honor than Tom Hudner.\n  A native of Fall River, MA, Hudner was a student at Philips Exeter \nAcademy when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. Already a leader on \nhis school's athletic fields and in its student government, he \nresponded to the call of duty and was admitted to the U.S. Naval \nAcademy. Though World War II ended before his commissioning at \nAnnapolis, Hudner began a storied Navy career that would ultimately \nearn him our nation's highest military honor.\n  During his first few years in the Navy, Hudner served as a \ncommunications officer aboard various warships before being accepted to \nthe Navy's flight school in Corpus Christi, TX. After earning his \n``wings of gold,'' Hudner became one of the ``Fighting Swordsmen'' of \nStrike Fighter Squadron 32 (VF 32) aboard the aircraft carrier USS \nLeyte. Just a few years after the racial integration of the US \nmilitary, Hudner began flying with a young ensign named Jesse LeRoy \nBrown, the Navy's first black pilot. Brown was born and raised in the \nsegregated deep south town of Hattiesburg, MS, a world away from \nHudner's upper middle class home in Fall River and the fields of \nHudner's alma mater Philips Exeter Academy.\n  The relative calm of post-war life as a Naval Aviator aboard the \nMediterranean-based USS Leyte would not last long. In the summer of \n1950, less than a year after Hudner's flight certification, North \nKorean Communist forces invaded the Republic of Korea. Within months, \nPresident Truman would order the Leyte into action off the coast of \nKorea where Hudner and his wingman, Jesse Brown, immediately began \nflying reconnaissance and attack sorties against Communist positions. \nNot long after VF 32 joined the fight, China invaded and threatened to \noverrun US positions.\n  There are no routine missions in wartime, especially when flying \nclose air support over enemy positions. Such was the case on the \nafternoon of December 4, 1950 when Hudner and Brown were on a mission \nto destroy enemy targets near the Chosin Reservoir. About an hour into \nthe mission, Brown's Corsair was hit by enemy fire, began to lose fuel \nand he was forced to crash land his aircraft into a snowy mountainside.\n  The events that transpired over the next few hours became enshrined \nin the history of American Naval Aviation.\n  Despite exposure to hostile ground fire, Hudner continued to make low \npasses over Brown, who was trapped in the wreckage of his destroyed \naircraft. And, when Hudner saw that his wingman's plane was burning, he \ndeliberately crash-landed his own aircraft and though injured in the \nviolent landing, ran to Brown's rescue. You see for Hudner, never \nleaving one's wingman was more than a guideline, it was a covenant. \nHudner, later a rescue helicopter pilot, tried in vain to free Brown \nfrom the wreckage. With night falling and Ensign Brown lapsing in and \nout of consciousness, Hudner was finally forced to evacuate the bitter \ncold crash site. Brown's final words to Hudner were to tell his wife, \nDaisy, that he loved her. He would have the chance to do just that in \nperson. On April 13, 1951, Daisy Pearl Brown was in the audience when \nPresident Harry S. Truman presented Thomas J. Hudner, Jr. with the \nMedal of Honor for his heroic attempt to save Ensign Brown.\n  Over the next two decades, Hudner would continue to serve with \ndistinction in the United States Navy. In addition to flying many of \nthe Navy's newest jet fighters, Hudner's career would take him from \nvarious ships and air bases where he served in positions of increasing \nresponsibility, including as executive officer of the USS Kitty Hawk \nduring the Vietnam War.\n  Hudner and Daisy Pearl Thorne, she had since remarried, remained \nfriends, their lives intertwined by the events decades earlier on a \nsnowy mountainside on the other side of the globe. In fact, the two \nfriends would be together at another ceremony some 22 years later when \nthe US Navy commissioned the first American warship in honor of an \nAfrican American, the USS Jesse L. Brown.\n  Hudner retired from the US Navy at the rank of captain in 1973, and \nwhile his day-to-day service in the Navy would end, this American hero \nwould continue to serve his fellow veterans through the USO and a \nvariety of veterans' organizations. For most of the 1990s, Hudner \nserved with distinction as Commissioner of the Massachusetts Department \nof Veterans Affairs.\n  In closing, I will quote Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus:\n\n       Thomas Hudner exemplifies the core values of honor, courage \n     and commitment the Navy holds dear. Naming the Navy's next \n     DDG for him will ensure his legacy will be known, honored and \n     emulated by future generations of sailors and Marines who \n     serve and all who come in contact with this ship.\n\n  I thank Captain Hudner for his lifetime of exceptional service to our \nnation and his dedication to his fellow veterans and wish him and his \nwife Georgia all the very best in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/10/senate-section/article/S3081-2", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3081]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   2012 ACADEMIC DECATHLON CHAMPIONS\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

He is also survived by his sister-in-law, Nancy, and many nieces \nand nephews.\n  Robert Shain had an honorable and extensive career which began upon \nhis graduation from the Military Academy at West Point in 1959. He \nserved in the US Army for 20 years as an infantry officer as well as a \nfixed-wing and helicopter pilot. He completed two tours of duty in \nVietnam and was awarded the Legion of Merit, two Distinguished Flying \nCrosses, two Bronze Stars, 27 Air Medals with V for valor, Meritorious \nService Medal, Vietnamese Medal of Honor, and Vietnamese Cross of \nGallantry. He served as commander of the Executive Flight Detachment \nand pilot of the presidential helicopter,\n\n[[Page S3082]]\n\nArmy One, for presidents Nixon and Ford from 1973 to 1976.\n  Following his retirement, he enjoyed a long professional career in \nthe aeronautics industry. He was an active supporter of the National \nRifle Association and a member of the Military Officers Association. \nHowever, I understand that his greatest joy in life was spending time \nwith his loving family.\n  Bob Shain lived every aspect of his life whether service to his \ncountry, to his family, or to his business with unrivaled pride and \ndignity.

Mr. President, I would like to congratulate \nProfessor James Olesen from the Department of Music at Brandeis \nUniversity, the winner of the 2012 Festival of the Creative Arts Award \nfor Distinguished Contribution to the Arts.\n  The Festival, which began in 1952, celebrates the idea that ``art \nactivates dreams, revolution, and the future,'' and Professor Olesen's \ncareer is certainly deserving of this special recognition amid the \ncreativity and community of the Festival that blooms on the Brandeis \ncampus every spring.\n  Professor Olesen has spent his career striving for excellence and \nfostering musical greatness in his students as the Choral Director at \nBrandeis since 1972. He has served as Music Department Chair and \ncollaborated with faculty members and other departments on various \nmusic programs. He was instrumental in the creation of the Office of \nthe Arts and School of Creative Arts.\n  Throughout his long and illustrious career, Professor Olesen has sung \nas a professional chorister with numerous conductors, including Charles \nMunch, Gustav Meier, Leopold Stowkowski and the founder of the \nFestival, the legendary Leonard Bernstein.\n  Professor Olesen also has performed with premier musical \norganizations including the American Symphony Orchestra, the New York \nPhilharmonic Orchestra, the Robert Shaw Chorale and the American Ballet \nTheater at venues including Carnegie Hall, the Metropolitan Museum of \nArt and the Metropolitan Opera.\n  Professor Olesen has also recorded for Columbia, RCA and Decca \nRecords.

Mr. President, today I am submitting--for the third year \nin a row--resolution to designate June 27 as National Post-Traumatic \nStress Disorder Awareness Day. That date was inspired by the birthday \nof North Dakota National Guard Staff Sergeant Joe Biel. Staff Sergeant \nBiel served two tours of duty in Iraq as a Trailblazer, part of a unit \nresponsible for route clearance operations. Each day, Joe's mission was \nto go out with his unit to find and remove Improvised Explosive Devices \nand other dangers from heavily traveled roads to make it safe for \ncoalition forces and Iraqi civilians to travel. Joe lost his post-\ndeployment struggle and, suffering from PTSD, tragically took his own \nlife 6 months after returning home. There is no doubt that Joe Biel is \na hero who gave his life for our country.\n  I learned of Joe's story because friends from his platoon, the 4th \nPlatoon, A Company, of the North Dakota National Guard's 164th Combat \nEngineer Battalion, have organized an annual motorcycle ride across the \nState of North Dakota in his memory. The Joe Biel Memorial Ride serves \nas a reunion for the 164th, a memorial for a lost friend, and a beacon \nto those suffering from PTSD and other mental health issues across the \nregion. The key point made to me by the event's organizer, Staff \nSergeant Matt Leaf, is that we have to raise awareness of this issue so \nthat the lives of service members, veterans, and other PTSD sufferers \nand their families can be saved.\n  For many, the war does not end when the warrior comes home. All too \nmany service members and veterans face PTSD symptoms like anxiety, \nanger, and depression as they try to adjust to life after war. We \ncannot sweep these problems under the rug. PTSD is real. We know PTSD \nis caused by a traumatic event. We also know that we are sending our \ntroops into combat situations where they are going to experience \ntraumatic events. We know that the percentage of PTSD diagnoses \nincreases with each deployment into combat. We know, as a nation, that \nwe must take responsibility to help our sons and daughters cope with \nwhat they have experienced. We owe them that much.\n  When our troops came home from Vietnam, we ignored their health \nconcerns for far too long. When our troops came home from the first \nGulf War we tried to make sure the government was doing all it could to \nresolve their health concerns. PTSD is this conflict's Gulf War \nIllness. The Department of Defense has created a Defense Center of \nExcellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury and \nteams with the National Institute for Mental Health and universities to \naddress PTSD. The Department of Veterans Affairs has likewise \nestablished the National Center for the study of PTSD. These \ndepartments have made significant advances in the prevention, \ndiagnosis, and treatment of PTSD and its symptoms to help us live up to \nour responsibility.\n  But more can and must be done. We need to ensure that these efforts \nare coordinated. In 1995, a President's Advisory Commission was created \nto conduct an independent, open, and comprehensive review of government \nactivities relating to Gulf War illness. Today, I am calling on \nPresident Obama to establish a new Presidential Advisory Commission to \nconduct a similar review of the Government's efforts to address PTSD in \norder to maximize the time and treasure we are spending on solving this \nproblem. We owe it to those who have served.\n  I am proud that Staff Sergeant Leaf and his fellow Trailblazers \ncontinue the annual Joe Biel Memorial Bike Ride, to be held on Memorial \nDay this year. am proud that I was able to help boost their efforts to \nbring attention to this issue by creating a National PTSD Awareness \nDay. I am proud to introduce this Resolution once again. Actions like \nthese garner attention and help to eliminate the stigma surrounding \nmental health issues. They are about letting our troops and veterans \nknow it is okay to come forward and say they need help--that it is a \nsign of strength, not weakness, to seek assistance. And they help show \nthat we can, and we must, do more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/10/senate-section/article/S3090-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3090-S3091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 456--COMMEMORATING AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE DEDICATION \n  AND SACRIFICE MADE BY THE FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT \n      OFFICERS WHO HAVE BEEN KILLED OR INJURED IN THE LINE OF DUTY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \nCoons, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \nTester, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Baucus, \nMrs. Feinstein, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr. Sessions) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now proceed to the consideration of H.R. 4967, which was \nreceived from the House and is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4967) to prevent the termination of the \n     temporary office of bankruptcy judges in certain judicial \n     districts.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Coons for a second \ntime on the passage of legislation that will reauthorize 30 temporary \nbankruptcy judgeships in districts around the country. I was pleased to \nsupport Senator Coons' very strong and persistent efforts on this \nimportant legislation. The Judiciary Committee reported this \nlegislation favorably on December 15, 2011.\n  The Senate passed the first version of this legislation on April 19. \nDespite the good intentions of everyone involved, a technical error was \ndiscovered after transmittal to the House of Representatives. Senator \nCoons worked quickly with the House Judiciary Committee to resolve that \ntechnical issue and, on May 9, the House took up and passed a perfected \nbill.\n  As I noted the first time the Senate acted on this legislation, the \nbill we pass today, when enacted, will reauthorize 30 temporary \njudgeships in 14 States and Puerto Rico. All of these positions have \nalready expired, and without this legislation, upon retirement or \ndeparture of the judges in these positions, they could not be filled \nagain. Needlessly reducing the resources of our bankruptcy courts does \nnothing but put more pressure on Americans who are already navigating a \ndifficult economic environment. This legislation should help avoid that \nand provide some small degree of relief to overburdened bankruptcy \ncourts around the country. Quite frankly, I think we should be doing \nmore and hope we will continue to make sure the Federal Judiciary has \nthe resources it needs to serve all Americans.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I will note once again my \nconcern with a portion of the legislation the Senate passes today. In \norder to secure passage of this legislation, Senator Coburn insisted \nupon adding a section to the bill that purports to tell future Senate \nand House Judiciary Committees how to conduct their business. \nUnfortunately, the perfected bill we pass today retains this provision. \nSenator Coburn's amendment would dictate that before any of these 30 \njudgeships could be reauthorized again, the Senate and House Judiciary \nCommittee's would be required to take certain steps and require a \nreport from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, AO. \nAs a member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Coburn knows that this \nis precisely what committees do in the ordinary course of\n\n[[Page S3103]]\n\nthe consideration of legislation and what was done during the \ndevelopment of this legislation. Senator Coons worked with the AO, \nwhich made recommendations, and with bankruptcy judges in a variety of \ndistricts to determine where need was greatest. To codify an \nunenforceable mandate nominally imposed on future Congresses is \nunnecessary and unwise.\n  Once again I take the opportunity to thank and congratulate Senator \nCoons for his hard work and attention to this issue. This would not be \npassing again without his diligence, focus, and legislative skill. He \nhas now done twice what has seemed impossible to do once.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe read three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4967) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/10/senate-section/article/S3103-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to S. Res. 456, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 456) commemorating and acknowledging \n     the dedication and sacrifice made by the Federal, State, and \n     local law enforcement officers who have been killed or \n     injured in the line of duty.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the Senate for agreeing to this \nresolution to honor the men and women who serve in law enforcement and \nto officially recognize May 15 as National Peace Officers Memorial Day.\n  Despite the progress that has been made in improving officer safety, \nthere is much work to be done. The year 2011 was an especially tragic \none for the law enforcement community. Last year, 163 State and Federal \nlaw enforcement officers lost their lives in the line of duty. This is \nan increase from 2010 and a grim reminder of the sacrifices far too \nmany individuals make serving their communities and fellow citizens. \nThe Senate should continue to do all it can to support officer safety.\n  To recognize these sacrifices, as they do every year, law enforcement \nofficers and their families from across the United States will come to \nWashington to pay tribute and honor the men and women who have lost \ntheir lives. And as I do each year, I will stand with them.\n  In 1962, President Kennedy designated May 15 as National Peace \nOfficers Memorial Day. Once again I am proud to have introduced a \nresolution officially recognizing that designation and honoring these \nmen and women, and all of those that came before them. I am glad we \npassed this official recognition today.\n  The safety of law enforcement officers across the United States \nshould be something on which we can all agree. I hope the quick passage \nof this resolution will foreshadow future bipartisan work on behalf of \nthe men and women who work day after day to protect all of us.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I will take a moment to recognize the \nsignificance of that measure. I know the Presiding Officer, in his many \nyears as attorney general of the State of Connecticut, became keenly \naware of the sacrifices our law enforcement officers are too often \ncalled upon to make to protect our communities. In the State of Rhode \nIsland, we recently lost a Providence police officer who was killed in \nthe line of duty. So it is a somber and important act that we take.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 458\n\n       Whereas, on May 15, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed \n     into law an Act that established a Department of Agriculture \n     (12 Stat. 387, chapter 72);\n       Whereas President Lincoln gave the Department of \n     Agriculture general authority to acquire and spread useful \n     information on agricultural subjects and to assist in the \n     development and use of new and valuable seeds and plants;\n       Whereas, in 1862, President Lincoln also signed into law \n     the Act entitled ``An Act to secure homesteads to actual \n     settlers on the public domain'' (commonly known as the \n     ``Homestead Act of 1862''; 12 Stat. 392, chapter 75) and the \n     Act of July 2, 1862 (commonly known as the ``First Morrill \n     Act''; 12 Stat. 503, chapter 130), which, along with the \n     creation of the Department of Agriculture, lay the foundation \n     for Federal agricultural policy;\n       Whereas, in the 1850s, there was 1 farmer for every 2 \n     people in the United States, while today the average farmer \n     in the United States feeds more than 150 people;\n       Whereas the United States is now the second largest \n     producer and the largest exporter of agricultural products in \n     the world;\n       Whereas the role of the Department of Agriculture has \n     expanded to include functions impacting nearly every aspect \n     of the rural United States and beyond;\n       Whereas the Department of Agriculture helps to ensure the \n     safety of the food supply of the United States, provides \n     conservation assistance, collects market data, provides\n\n[[Page S3104]]\n\n     nutrition assistance, protects the health of plants and \n     animals, supports rural communities, conducts agricultural \n     research, maintains risk management tools for producers, and \n     promotes agricultural exports; and\n       Whereas the professionalism, dedication, and work ethic of \n     the public servants at the Department of Agriculture provide \n     a shining example of why President Lincoln called the \n     Department of Agriculture the ``People's Department'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the men and women of the Department of \n     Agriculture on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the \n     Department;\n       (2) celebrates the growth and success of agriculture in the \n     United States and\n       (3) honors the farmers and ranchers of the United States, \n     whose ingenuity, adaptability, and skill have created the \n     safest and most abundant food supply in the history of \n     mankind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/05/10/senate-section/article/S3104-1", "month": "05", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.
