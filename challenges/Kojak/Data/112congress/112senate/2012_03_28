Madam President, today the Senate will consider the \nnomination of a woman by the name of Miranda Du to be a U.S. district \njudge for the District Court of Nevada. I was very pleased to recommend \nthis woman because she is such an experienced litigator and very proud \nNevadan.\n  Ms. Du has enormous love for the State and this country and a \ntremendous dedication to public service. Her story is about as \ninspiring as it gets, and it proves without any question the American \ndream is alive and well.\n  Nevada's Asian Pacific population is less than 10 percent. But if \nconfirmed, Ms. Du will be the first Asian American Federal judge in the \nhistory of the State of Nevada.\n  Miranda Du left Vietnam when she was 8 years old with her family in a \nboat. She was one of the boat people. She was born in Vietnam. She and \nher family survived the war, and they left. They left voluntarily \nbecause they could not get out any other way. I said they left \nvoluntarily--they sneaked\n\n[[Page S2116]]\n\nout and got on a boat and took off. They wound up in Malaysia. She \nspent more than 2 years in a refugee camp in Malaysia--this little \ngirl. She was then, with her family, taken to Alabama: Vietnam, \nMalaysia, Alabama.\n  When she got there, she enrolled in an American school for the first \ntime. She did not know how to speak English, and that is an \nunderstatement. But as a third grader, everyone recognized how smart \nshe was. She picked up the language very quickly. Miranda Du speaks--it \ndoes not matter if she had an accent, but she has none--today as well \nas you or I.\n\n  Her family, after living in Alabama--where her father worked on a \ndairy farm--eventually worked their way to California. She continued to \nbe pointed out as always one of the smartest in any class. She was able \nto go to college. She got a degree in history and economics from the \nUniversity of California at Davis and a law degree from one of the \nfinest law schools in the world, the University of California, \nBerkeley--the famous Boalt Hall. She did well wherever she went to \nschool.\n  After law school, she moved to Nevada. She joined at that time a law \nfirm McDonald Carano Wilson, which is a very respected law firm. Bob \nMcDonald, the founder of that firm, was a protege of the famous Nevada \nSenator Pat McCarran, and he was involved in politics. He was a very \nprominent lawyer until he died a couple years go. Don Carano is also a \nvery well known, famous man in Nevada, a lawyer, and he has done \nextremely well. He owns major hotels and casinos. He is one of the \nbiggest producers of wine in the State of California. Spike Wilson was \na long-time Nevada State senator. They are just a very fine group of \npeople, these three men who started this law firm.\n  She was made a partner of the law firm in 2002. Her specialty is \nlitigation. She is a trial lawyer and a very good one. She specializes \nin complex civil litigation and also employment law. She has appeared \nbefore the State and Federal courts in all phases of litigation--trial \nlawyer, an appellate lawyer before the Nevada Supreme Court, and the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  She has the support of a bipartisan coalition of Nevada officials, \nincluding the Governor. By the way, the Governor was one of my \nappointments to the Federal bench. He was a Federal judge, Brian \nSandoval, and a good Federal judge. He resigned that position and ran \nfor Governor against my son, and he won. He is a fine man. He is my \nfriend, and he has come out vocally and very publicly that this woman \nis a great lawyer and should be on the bench--something he should know \na little bit about.\n  She has received vocal support from the Lieutenant Governor, also a \nRepublican; the mayor of Reno, also a Republican. In fact, Governor \nSandoval wrote to the Judiciary Committee to say, Du ``has exhibited \ngreat character and is well respected in the legal community.'' He has \ngiven her his unqualified support.\n  Republican Lt. Gov. Brian Krolicki called Ms. Du ``intelligent, \ninquisitive, reliable and dedicated.'' The Republican mayor of Reno--\nwith whom, by the way, we had a visit yesterday--Bob Cashell said Du \n``will be a great addition to our federal bench.''\n  In addition to being an experienced litigator, she is also an \noutstanding citizen. She is involved in the northern Nevada community. \nThere are many things she has done, but she served on the Nevada \nCommission on Economic Development. She has also served as a court-\nappointed special advocate representing abused and neglected children. \nShe now, and has in the past for a number of years, mentored high \nschool students in Reno, NV. She is a fine example to those students.\n  I have had the good fortune to be able to forward to Presidents about \n10 names, and I have never been more proud of one than Miranda Du. I \nrepeat, if there were ever a success story, it is this woman who was \nborn in Vietnam, took a boat and wound up in Malaysia, came from \nMalaysia to America, to Alabama, to California, and is now one of the \nmost respected lawyers we have in the State of Nevada. This is what \nAmerica is all about.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, will the Senator from Nevada yield just \nfor a comment?\n  Mr. REID. I sure will.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank him for honoring those who came to this country \nwho fled reeducation camps and execution in a most horrible, brutal \nregime period. The enormous contribution those individuals and their \nchildren now have made to our Nation, our economy, our political scene, \nis remarkable and one of which all of us should be extremely proud. I \nthank the Senator from Nevada for recognizing those individuals' \ncontribution.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this is coming from a person who was held \nfor 7 years in a prisoner-of-war camp in that country. So I think \nanyone hearing this--and there are lots of people watching this--should \nunderstand what John McCain just said. John McCain and I have battled \non a number of substantive issues over the years, but I do not think \nthere is anyone--at least I speak from my perspective--for whom I have \nmore admiration and respect than John McCain, who has done so much for \nhis country.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the leader for his generous and \nkind remarks. As he said, he and I have done battle on the honorable \nfield of combat, but I think the feeling of respect and appreciation \nand admiration is mutual. I thank the leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/28/senate-section/article/S2116-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, yesterday afternoon I came to the \nfloor to suggest that what has been happening in the Senate this week \nis precisely the kind of thing the American people do not like about \nWashington.\n  Gas prices have more than doubled under President Obama and the \nDemocratic-controlled Senate. This is a problem that affects every \nsingle American, that drives up the cost of everything from commuting \nto groceries. Yet the Democratic response is to propose legislation \nthat even they admit does not do a thing to lower the price of gas.\n  We have seven Democrats, in fact, on record saying the bill does not \ndo a thing to lower gas prices. One of them has called it laughable. \nBut this is apparently the best our friends on the other side can do. \nIt is the most, apparently, they are willing to do. At a time when gas \nprices are at a national average of nearly $4 a gallon, this is what \npasses for a response to high gas prices for Washington Democrats: a \nbill that simply does nothing about it.\n  But it even gets worse than that because not only is the Democratic \nsolution to high gas prices a bill that even they admit does nothing to \nlower gas prices, they will not even allow Republicans to offer any \namendments that would help. Not only are they pushing a bill that will \nnot lower gas prices, they are blocking any measure that would actually \nmake a difference.\n  So at a moment when working Americans are struggling with high gas \nprices, the message Democrats in Washington are sending this week is \nsimple: Get used to it. Get used to it because they have nothing--\nnothing--but a phony proposal aimed at distracting people from the fact \nthat they have nothing to offer.\n  Maybe the reason they voted yesterday to get off their own bill is \nthey realized the American people were on to them. Maybe they realized \nthey did not have the political issue they thought they did. Well, my \npoint is that they should be more concerned about helping Americans \nthan helping their own campaigns.\n  So if Democrats will not allow us to offer any proposals to address \nthis crisis, we are still going to talk about\n\n[[Page S2117]]\n\nthem anyway because Americans need to know there are some things we \ncould do about this issue. We could actually have an impact on high gas \nprices right here in Congress. They need to hear us debate these ideas, \nand they need to know Democratic leaders in the Senate will not even \nallow a vote on any of these ideas.\n  This whole episode is completely unacceptable. Hopefully, at some \npoint, a number of Democrats will recognize this--will recognize that \nthis should be about more than political games. We ought to actually \ntry to accomplish something.\n  This issue affects real people. For them, it is an urgent matter. \nDemocrats should summon the same urgency in dealing with it. We were \nsent here to solve problems, not to hide from them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/28/senate-section/article/S2117-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          KENTUCKY BASKETBALL\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, something very special in the world \nof sports is happening in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Kentucky is well known as the home of the Kentucky Derby, often \ncalled the greatest 2 minutes in sports. But this coming Saturday, \nMarch 31, we will witness one of the greatest moments in Kentucky \nsports history. Two of the most storied and winningest programs in all \nof college basketball, the University of Louisville and the University \nof Kentucky, will meet this Saturday in the 2012 NCAA Tournament Final \nFour. The two teams will face off in a semifinals game in New Orleans, \nand the winner of that game will contest for the national championship \nnext Monday night.\n  In my State of Kentucky, the rivalry between UofL and UK is indeed a \npassionate one. From birth, it seems, Kentuckians are raised to root \nfor one of these two teams; you either wear red for the Louisville \nCardinals or blue for the Kentucky Wildcats. The two teams boast two \nlegendary coaches, Rick Pitino and John Calipari. The teams have met \nevery year since 1983, and they have met in the NCAA tournament four \ntimes in the past--most recently in the Mideast Regionals way back in \n1984. Between them, they have 24 visits to the Final Four. But never \nhave these two teams faced each other in the Final Four with the stakes \nso high. If the excitement and frenzy and turbulence that has been \nstirred up in Kentucky could be harnessed, we could solve our energy \ncrisis. Basketball fans from Kentucky have been waiting their whole \nlives for this game.\n  On Saturday, we will prove that these two schools have the best \nrivalry in all of college basketball and that the Commonwealth of \nKentucky is the best college basketball State in the Nation.\n  Let me say that again so my friends in North Carolina can hear it. \nUofL and UK have the best rivalry in all of college basketball, and the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky is the best college basketball State in the \nNation.\n  But only one team can win on Saturday.\n  I am actually an alumnus of both schools. I attended the University \nof Louisville as an undergraduate, and I went to law school at the \nUniversity of Kentucky.\n  I don't know who will win Saturday's game, but whoever the winner is \nwill go on to defeat either Kansas or Ohio State and bring the national \nchampionship back home to Kentucky where it belongs. So count me in \nwith my fellow Kentuckians and college basketball fans everywhere as we \ntune in this Saturday to see history in the making. It is going to be \nreally exciting to watch.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/28/senate-section/article/S2117-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in \ncolloquy with a number of my colleagues for the next 30 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I come to the floor today, as I have \nover the last 2 years since the health care law was passed, with a \ndoctor's second opinion. I do that as someone who has practiced \nmedicine and taken care of families across the country--primarily in \nWyoming--for a quarter of a century, listening to them, trying to care \nfor them, and knowing that what the American people want is the care \nthey need, a doctor they want, at a price they can afford.\n  During the last 2 years since the health care law was passed, the \nAmerican public has found out that now that it has passed, they get to \nknow what is in it, they don't like what they are seeing. Instead of \nproviding patients with the care they need from the doctor they want \nand at a cost they can afford, they are seeing time and time again a \nsignificant change and the promises the President has made broken.\n  I am here with my colleagues to talk about some of these concerns. I \nsee the Senator from Arizona, who has heard the promises made. I know \nthat when he goes to townhall meetings and talks to people, they have \nfound out that the costs they were promised would go down have gone up \ninstead. The opportunity of patients to keep the care they want and the \ndoctor they want--they are not able to do that. Is that what the \nSenator from Arizona has been finding?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague for his continued \nleadership on this issue and his eminent qualifications to address it \nand help educate the American people about what is at stake.\n  I think this colloquy we are having has to be considered in the \ncontext of the arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court. I think my \ncolleague from South Carolina, Senator Graham, will mention that we \nshould not draw too many conclusions from the questions that are asked \nby the Justices of the Supreme Court.\n  One of the things I find when I watch the talk shows--and I ask the \nSenator from Wyoming this--the first thing they say is that the most \nimportant thing about ObamaCare is that parents can keep their children \non their health insurance plan until they reach age 26. Well, you know, \nI think all four of us right now would be glad to put that into law as \nan amendment in a New York minute. If they want to keep their children \nhome living in the basement until they are 30, that is fine. But for \nthat to be the centerpiece, saying that this is why we have to preserve \nObamaCare, is, of course, a bad joke.\n\n  What we are arguing about here is the thousands of pages--I guess the \nSenator from Wyoming knows--is it 100,000 pages of regulations that \nhave been already issued to try to implement this plan?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Also, we have promised to repeal and replace ObamaCare, \ndepending on not only the Supreme Court decision but the will of the \npeople as expressed, perhaps, next November.\n  Of the areas that I think we have not focused enough attention on, \none is the unsavory process that resulted in passage of this \nlegislation--behind closed doors and everybody at Blair House \nbludgeoning the AMA and the pharmaceuticals and the deals that were cut \nhere.\n  Another area was a promise made by the President that he would \nconsider--it wasn't committed to, I will admit--medical malpractice \nreform. And here we are talking about 20 to 30 percent of the health \ncare costs in America\n\n[[Page S2118]]\n\nwhich, in the view of some, can be attributed to the unnecessary tests \nthat are being administered and prescribed by physicians and health \ncare providers because of their fear of ending up in court. Yet, in all \nof this bill, there is not one mention that I know of that has a \nmeaningful approach to medical malpractice reform.\n  Since the Senator from South Carolina not only is an expert on the \nSupreme Court, but also he is one of the trial lawyers' Republican \nfavorites, maybe he could address that aspect of medical care as well.\n  Would the Senator from Wyoming comment on that?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I agree with my colleague from Arizona that there are a \nnumber of things that continue to drive up the cost of health care. One \nof the things I believe should have been included in the health care \nlaw--I would think we could actually lower the cost of care, lower \nunnecessary testing, and part of that--all of the studies show--is \ndoing away with these junk lawsuits that result in significant numbers \nof additional expensive tests being done. It seems to me that we spend \nmore time trying to protect the doctors than trying to help the \npatients.\n  Even in a rural State such as Wyoming--and I see my colleague from \nSouth Dakota on the floor--this is a national concern and should have \nbeen included in any health care law that was supposed to target \nlowering the cost. That is what the President promised in the \nbeginning, that families would see their health care premiums go down \nby $2,500 per year. Instead, the premiums have gone up by about $2,100 \nyear.\n  My colleague from South Carolina has cosponsored legislation to try \nto give States the opportunities to opt out of a number of provisions \nof the health care law because they are onerous as to the costs and \nwhat is happening in the States and for people at home. If you look at \nthe President's proposals, I would think that any national health care \nlaw ought to look at certain components of things that actually bring \ndown the cost of care. With this one-size-fits-all approach and the \ndemand that everyone buy government-sponsored or government-approved \nhealth care insurance, the rates are going up instead.\n  I turn to my friend from South Carolina and ask him about that, plus \nthe unfunded mandates that are forced on the States with Medicaid, \nwhich is a significant part of what is being discussed today in the \nSupreme Court.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will be glad to discuss that. I have enjoyed the \nopportunity to create legislation that would allow States to opt out of \nMedicaid's expansion under this bill. About 30 percent of the people in \nSouth Carolina will be eligible for Medicaid by 2014 when this law is \nfully implemented. It is the second largest expense in South Carolina. \nWith the matching requirement, we get three Federal dollars for every \nState dollar you put on the table dealing with Medicaid. That sounds \nlike a good deal until Medicaid explodes in costs and becomes the No. 1 \ndriver of the budget in South Carolina, Wyoming, South Dakota, and \nArizona. Under this bill, the problem we have today with Medicaid \nbecomes Medicaid on steroids.\n  I am confident that there are plenty of Democrats who have Governors \nwho are Democrats who will say: Wait a minute, before you expand \nMedicaid and put additional burden on my State's budget, see if we can \nfind more creative ways of dealing with it and give people the ability \nto opt out of that. That would be good policy.\n  I want to comment about this. One rule of thumb is that any bill \npassed on Christmas Eve on a party-line vote is probably no good to the \ncountry. And that is what happened.\n  As Senator McCain would say, this was a party-line vote, 60 to 40, on \nsomething dealing with one-sixth of the economy.\n  This was supposed to happen on C SPAN. President Obama said: I am \ncoming and we are going to change the way Washington works.\n  If I had to offer exhibit A of what is wrong with Washington, it \nwould be the ObamaCare process. Everything that people hate about \nWashington resulted in this bill being passed. There was absolutely no \nbipartisanship; there were behind-closed-door negotiations, beating \npeople over the head to get their support; there was buying votes based \non special interest deals for their States. That is not exactly what \nthe American people had in mind. Is it any surprise that something that \ncame out of that process is going over like a lead balloon?\n  One of the problems with health care is getting doctors to take \nMedicare and Medicaid patients. What did we do with Medicare? We took \n$500 billion out of a system that is $33 trillion underfunded to help \nthe uninsured. We have an uninsured problem, but we have a Medicare \nproblem that will be an absolute nightmare.\n  What I wanted to do on malpractice is to tell a doctor: If you will \ntake a Medicare or Medicaid patient, doing the country a service, and \nyou get sued, we will go to arbitration--require arbitration--and let \nthe panel render their judgment. And if you want to go to court, you \ncan.\n  That is fair. I want people to have their chance to litigate \ndifferences on alleged malpractice. I also want doctors to feel there \nis an incentive to serve Medicare and Medicaid patients.\n  What was promised in this bill--the remedies to our health care \nsystem--none of them have come true. What you see 2 years later are our \nworst fears being realized at a faster pace.\n  The President promised: If you like your health care, you will be \nable to keep it. What is going on in this country is that employers are \ndropping health care for their employees because it is cheaper to pay \nthe fine. What is happening in this country is that the idea of being \nable to expand Medicaid without bankrupting the budgets of this country \nat the State level, when you look at the consequences, is a nightmare \nin the making.\n\n  We were promised this bill would reduce the deficit. Well, to me, \nhealth care includes doctors, and in the bill itself we never dealt \nwith the problem that doctors face of having their budgets, their \nreimbursements cut. That was not even addressed in ObamaCare. That is a \ncouple hundred billion dollar liability. So the idea this thing has \nbeen paid for, as promised, no longer exists. It is adding to the \ndeficit. It was projected to be $900 billion in cost; now it is about \n$1.7 trillion. So the basic promises around what this bill would do for \nour budget, what it would do for our choices in health care, have not \ncome true.\n  I am here to say to our Democratic friends, fix this before it is too \nlate. You will find people on our side willing to meet you in the \nmiddle when it comes to reforming health care because it needs to be \nreformed. But the model you have created--centralized health care--that \nis going to damage State budgets beyond belief, that will drive private \nsector insurance out of the market, and it is going to have a budget \nconsequence on top of what we already have is not the right model.\n  I say to my colleagues here today, I will work with you to do two \nthings: Educate the public about what awaits us if we don't change this \nbill quickly, and work with our Democratic friends to find a better \nalternative. I think that is what America wants. When 67 percent of the \npeople, 2 years later, feel this is not the way to go, responsible \nleadership would say let's alter course.\n  The Supreme Court may strike down the mandate. They may say Medicaid \nexpansion is a violation of the tenth amendment. I hope they do. But I \ncan say one thing with certainty: Because nine judges, five of whom say \nit is legal to do something, doesn't make it smart to do something. \nWhat is smart is to fix health care in a sustainable way. And what is \nsmart is for Republicans and Democrats to work together in a \ntransparent, open fashion. We haven't done anything smart about health \ncare yet, and I hope that changes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask my colleagues if they remember the Cornhusker \nkickback? Another Democratic holdout took credit for $10 billion in new \nfunding for community health centers, an exemption for nonprofit \ninsurance in their States; and Vermont and Massachusetts were given \nadditional Medicaid funding; a $300 million increase for Medicaid in \nLouisiana, and the list goes on and on. This was the process they went \nthrough, culminating, as the Senator from South Carolina mentioned, on \nChristmas Eve--a process that, obviously, most Americans find unsavory.\n\n[[Page S2119]]\n\n  It is interesting, and I would ask my two colleagues to comment on \nthe fact that the same people, the same organizations--the AMA, the \nhospitals, the pharmaceuticals, and others, that all signed up and were \nbludgeoned into supporting ObamaCare--and by the way, that negotiating \nthat took place, since the President promised there would not be \nlobbyists in the White House, that they would not play a major role, it \nwas done in Blair House--these same people, these same organizations, \nhave come to our offices asking for relief from ObamaCare. Isn't that \nfascinating. I mean, time after time, the same members of the same \norganizations that supported ObamaCare come and say, look, we can't \nlive with this provision, we can't do this, it is impossible for us to \ncomply with that provision. It is a fascinating commentary on trying to \ndo the Lord's work in the city of Satan, is it not, I ask my \ncolleagues?\n  Mr. THUNE. Well, I would say to my colleague from Arizona, he always \nhas a way with words when it comes to describing the strange \nmeanderings of the process here in Washington, but it is.\n  Unfortunately, all those groups that had access to the process in the \nend all got sort of kowtowed into going along with it and now they are \nall being hit with this huge tax bill, because everybody is getting \ntaxed to pay for this. All of it is being passed on, I might add, to \nbusinesses in this country, driving up their costs.\n  But the one thing everyone here this morning has mentioned is who \ndidn't have a seat at the table, and that is the States. Think about \nthe States and what this means for them. Of course, in the first 3 \nyears, the Federal Government said it was going to pay 100 percent of \nthe new population to be covered under Medicaid. But if you look at \nwhat happens after that, the States then are starting to have to share \nor bear more of the burden and be forced to pay at least another $118 \nbillion, according to one congressional report, through the year 2023, \nwhich crowds out priorities such as education, law enforcement, and all \nthe things we expect our States to do.\n  So the States get all these mandates shoved down their throats, \nmaking it more difficult for them to bear the responsibilities they \nhave to the people in their individual States because the Federal \nGovernment has not only said they are going to have to pay for this, \nbut they have also become very prescriptive about what they can and \ncannot do. So States are no longer going to have--and frankly, even in \nthe past, haven't had--a lot of flexibility when it comes to setting \neligibility standards and determining who can and cannot be covered by \nMedicaid in their individual States. They just get the costs shoved \ndown their throats, with very little input into how to implement this \nprogram, so much so that Governors all over the country are reacting to \nthis, and that is why we have 26 Governors who are part of the \nlitigation that is going on right now at the Supreme Court to challenge \nthe mandate on Medicaid, which will be heard today by the Court.\n  But listen to what some of the Governors around the country have \nsaid--and these are Democratic Governors. This is the Democratic \nGovernor of Kentucky:\n\n       I have no idea how we're going to pay for it.\n\n  And, of course, he is referring to these new mandates, regulations.\n  The former Governor of Tennessee said:\n\n       I can't think of a worse time for this bill to be coming. \n     Nobody is going to put their State in bankruptcy or their \n     education system in the tank for it.\n\n  The Governor of Montana said:\n\n       I'm going to have to double my patient load and run the \n     risk of bankrupting Montana.\n\n  Those are Democratic Governors reacting to this new mandate that is \nbeing shoved down their throat because of the changes that were made to \nMedicaid in the health care bill. So I think the States, unfortunately, \ndid not have a seat at the table. If they did, they certainly didn't \nget their voices heard because they are going to be forced now, and \npeople, individuals in these States, to come up with the billions and \nbillions of additional dollars to pay to finance the new mandates in \nthe legislation.\n\n  I want to make one other point, because there has been a lot said \nhere on the floor of the Senate, and by people in general in Congress, \nabout the importance of focusing like a laser on jobs and the economy. \nFrankly, I think there are some things that actually have been done \naround here. Last week, we finally passed a jobs bill, a private sector \njobs bill, that would create jobs, and hopefully make it easier for our \nsmall businesses to access capital to grow their businesses and create \njobs. But the health care bill, clearly, is going to have the opposite \neffect.\n  Interestingly enough, when it passed, there were lots of statements \nmade at the time about how many jobs it was going to create. In fact, \nif you go back, the former Speaker of the House said it would create 4 \nmillion jobs--400,000 jobs almost immediately. That was former Speaker \nNancy Pelosi. Interestingly enough, that contradicts what the \nCongressional Budget Office Director said. He testified the new law \nwould actually reduce employment over the next decade by 800,000 jobs. \nAnd analysts at UBS stated the law is ``arguably the biggest impediment \nto hiring, particularly hiring of less skilled workers.''\n  So what we are seeing again is a promise made about creating jobs and \nthe very opposite is what we are going to see.\n  There was a Gallup poll recently that found 48 percent of small \nbusinesses in this country are not hiring because of the potential cost \nof health insurance under the health care law; 46 percent are not \nhiring because of concerns over other government regulations. But if \nyou look at the impact this legislation is having on hiring in America \ntoday, what we are hearing from the people who hire--the job creators \nout there and the small businesses--this is a huge impediment to \nhiring.\n  The device manufacturer Stryker announced they are shedding 5 percent \nof their workforce over concerns about the impending 2.3 percent \nmedical device tax which was included in the health care law. There is \nanother employer here, somebody who owns a restaurant chain, who stated \nbluntly, ``This law will cost my company more than we make.''\n  Another employer in this country said this: ``The new health care law \nhas wrecked our plans to grow our business and create jobs.''\n  That is exactly the thing many of us predicted would happen, \nnotwithstanding the assertions made by the proponents of this \nlegislation--that it was going to create jobs. We see the very opposite \nhappening. We see our small businesses pulling back, not hiring, not \ngrowing their businesses because of the concerns about the costs and \nthe penalties that would be imposed and the taxes that are included in \nthe health care law.\n  I know my colleague from Wyoming represents a lot of small \nbusinesses, as I do. South Dakota and Wyoming are similar in terms of \nthe size of the States and the way people make their living. We have a \nlot of small businesses and entrepreneurs, and we look to them to grow \nthe economy in our States. Obviously, it becomes much more difficult \nwhen you continue to drive and shove these mandates, these \nrequirements, down the throats of our small businesses, these new taxes \nthey are going to have to bear. And the list of new taxes that are \ngoing to imposed under this is pretty amazing. It adds up to--and this \nis just over the cost of the first decade--$552 billion; when it is \nfully implemented, $1 trillion of tax increases, all of which get \npassed on in the form of higher costs of health insurance and other \ncosts around the economy.\n  My point is simply that if we are sincere in being focused on \ncreating jobs in this country, perhaps the biggest impediment, the \nbiggest barrier to that now is the ObamaCare law that is currently \nbeing heard by the Supreme Court.\n  I guess I would ask my colleague from Wyoming to comment on his view \nwith regard to some of these promises that were made regarding this \nlegislation and how actually the bill is now playing out, as we get to \nknow more about it. That is what the former Speaker of the House also \nsaid: We have to get this bill passed to find out what is in it. The \nAmerican people are finding out what is in it and are becoming \nincreasingly convinced this was the\n\n[[Page S2120]]\n\nwrong direction to go. I assume that is a view shared by the majority \nof people in Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, it is. And as neighboring States, South Dakota \nand Wyoming work closely together and are very similar. The experiences \nwe are having in Wyoming--we now have a Republican Governor but \npreviously had a Democratic Governor--as my colleague talked about, \nwith the Medicaid mandates, which were called by one Governor the \n``mother of all unfunded mandates,'' is that the money that has to be \nused for that is crowding out other things, so that is money that can't \nbe used specifically for education. One of the worst things that is \nhappening for education across our country is the health care law, \nbecause for every penny the State now has to add to pay for this \nMedicaid expansion--this unfunded mandate--and I heard the numbers from \nmy colleague from South Dakota, and these are astronomically large \nnumbers--those are dollars that are not going to go to the universities \nand the institutions of higher education, as well as our additional \nschools throughout the State. So all of a sudden, if you have a student \nin college and you see the tuition has gone up much more than you \nthought it should have--when you likely think it shouldn't go up at \nall--and you say, why is that, well, it is President Obama's health \ncare law. That is what is happening by mandating money be spent for \nMedicaid. That unfunded mandate is taking dollars away from education.\n  This month, in March 2012, a report came out entitled ``The 2011 \nActuarial Report on the Financial Outlook for Medicaid.'' The figures \nare astonishing on this health spending law called ``ObamaCare'' or the \nso-called ``Affordable Care Act.'' And by the way, just because you \ncall it that doesn't mean it is affordable, as we see from this report. \nIt drives up Federal Medicaid costs by hundreds and hundreds of \nbillions of dollars through 2020. It forces many more people onto the \nMedicaid rolls.\n  The President has talked so much and used interchangeably the words \n``coverage and care.'' What we know is that across the country, if \nsomebody has a Medicaid card, that does not equate necessarily to \nreceiving care. My colleague from South Dakota talked about \nreimbursement rates for physicians. Medicaid, in many ways, underpays \nsometimes even the cost of seeing a patient, so it is harder for those \npatients to get seen. So I think the President has used two words \ninterchangeably which are in no way interchangeable. Someone can have a \nMedicaid card but not be able to get care.\n  The concern is now, as my colleague from South Dakota said, $500 \nbillion of Medicare taken out of Medicare, not to strengthen Medicare, \nnot to increase the security for people on Medicare, not to help \nimprove Medicare but to start a whole new government program for other \npeople. The Medicare patients are having a harder and harder time \nfinding a physician to care for them.\n  I would say the President of the United States, by using those two \nwords interchangeably--coverage and care--has, unfortunately, misled \npeople to think coverage equals care, and we know it does not. That is \none of the concerns with the health care law, as we talked about the \nbroken promises and the unfunded mandates sent to the States.\n  As I stand with my colleague from South Dakota, I assume when he goes \nhome on weekends--and he does almost every weekend--he hears the same \nthings I hear. When I have a townhall meeting and I ask the question: \nHow many of you believe that under the health care law--remember, the \none the President promised your insurance rates would go down $2,500 a \nyear--how many believe that actually, because of the law, your rates \nare going up faster than if there hadn't been a law at all, all the \nhands go up. I ask: How many of you believe the quality and \navailability of your care is going to get worse because of this law? \nAgain, the hands go up.\n  For a second, I thought maybe that was just something we saw in \nWyoming and in South Dakota. But in a national poll yesterday--in the \nNew York Times, of all places--on page A15 of yesterday's New York \nTimes, in terms of the health care law: How will this health law affect \nyou personally? Will this help you? Less than one in five Americans \nsaid this will help them. Twice as many said it will actually hurt \nthem. When they asked: Will this decrease your costs, one in six said \nit would decrease their costs. More than half said it would increase \ntheir costs. When it asked, How about the quality of your care, only \none in six said they actually expected better quality of care. Many \nmore expected worse quality of care. So it is not just Wyoming, it is \nnot just South Dakota. It is the entire country which is seeing this \nsame impact.\n  I would ask my colleague from South Dakota, as he travels around, is \nthis what he is seeing everywhere as well?\n  Mr. THUNE. It certainly is. As the Senator from Wyoming mentioned, \nthe huge majority of businesses around this country--and especially \nsmall businesses such as those he and I represent in Wyoming and South \nDakota--are enormously concerned about what this is going to do to \ntheir ability to create jobs, to maintain coverage for their employees. \nThere are so many huge impacts from this, much of which, frankly, we \npredicted. But again, the idea or the notion that somehow imposing over \n$\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes on businesses in this country, on health \ninsurance plans, was somehow going to lead to lower costs for people to \nget coverage in this country is beyond me.\n  I am at a loss to explain how anybody could make the argument this \nwas going to create jobs. Former Speaker Pelosi predicted 4 million new \njobs. The Congressional Budget Office had said it would cost us 800,000 \njobs. I suspect that is a conservative estimate, based on what I hear \nfrom employers in my State and elsewhere around the country.\n  But I do wish to point out too that in so many ways, because of the \nnew mandates, because of the new taxes, because of the new costs, this \nis just going to make everybody's lives more complicated and more \ndifficult, including our States. We represent States where our \nGovernors, our legislators work hard to balance our budgets and to live \nwithin their means, not to spend money they don't have. Yet here they \nare being forced by the Federal Government to swallow these additional \ncosts that are coming because of this new health care plan.\n  Basically, what the Obama administration has done is put shackles on \nthe States when it comes to making decisions about the eligibility \nneeds in their States. They are going to have lower spending on \nMedicaid providers. In some cases, our States are trying innovative \napproaches to care and delivery. They are trying to come up with new \nways of doing this and to do it more effectively. Yet the Federal \nGovernment is going to make that much more difficult.\n  The bottom line is the combined effect of the ObamaCare's policies \nhas taken power from the States, given more of it to Washington. It has \nforced unrealistic new spending mandates on the States that are going \nto crowd out those local priorities the Senator from Wyoming mentioned, \nsuch as education, such as law enforcement, the things I think \nconstituents in our individual States expect their Governors and their \nState legislators to deal with.\n  Again, I would come back to what these Governors have said, and I am \nnot talking about the conservative Republican Governors in this \ncountry. Look at what the Democratic Governors have said. The Governor \nof Kentucky: ``I have no idea how to pay for this.'' The Governor of \nMontana basically saying that increasing the patient load under this \nbill will cause bankruptcy or force him to bankrupt his State.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THUNE. Then, of course, there is even the Governor of a State \nsuch as California, which I will submit for the Record.\n  But the point is, there are lots of promises made that haven't been \nkept with this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Big Oil Subsidies\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about what \nis the pending business before the floor, which is my legislation to \nend Big Oil subsidies in this country.\n\n[[Page S2121]]\n\n  Middle-class families are hurting, struggling to make ends meet. Yet \ntoday we are on the floor of the Senate fighting an uphill battle \nagainst those on the other side of the aisle who, with one hand, would \ncontinue handing out $24 billion in wasteful subsidies to five of the \nbiggest, most profitable oil companies in the country and, with the \nother hand, take away vital programs from our Nation's veterans, its \nseniors, disabled children, just to name a few.\n  We hear our Republican friends talk about balanced budgets and we \nhear them talk about austerity. We hear them saying we all have to \ntighten our belts, we all have to make hard choices on Medicare and \nveterans and veterans' benefits and student loans, just to name a few. \nYet they will not, in that austerity or shared sacrifice, say we will \nend unnecessary tax breaks to Big Oil. They will continue to ask the \nsame things they have asked a thousand times before, which is that the \nAmerican taxpayers subsidize the richest five companies in the world, \nwhile we cut programs for our wounded soldiers, for our seniors, and \nfor our students.\n\n  Some people think of budgets just as boring documents with lots of \nbewildering numbers. In reality, they are statements about our \npriorities. This debate draws the brightest lines between our \npriorities and theirs. The Romney-Ryan budget, for example, cuts $2.2 \nbillion in education for children with disabilities. What do they say \nto these parents? I guess they justify it by saying we can't afford it.\n  Why is it we cannot afford it when five companies that collectively \nmade $137 billion in profits last year alone are getting $24 billion in \nsubsidies over the next 10 years? So we tell these children on the \nRomney-Ryan budget they cannot be helped to fulfill their God-given \npotential because we can't afford it, but we can afford to give these \nfive companies that made $137 billion in profits--not proceeds, \nprofits--that we should give them an additional $24 billion of our \ntaxpayers money? I don't think so.\n  Here is another example. Republicans are proposing cutting $13 \nbillion per year from the SNAP program--that was formerly called the \nfood stamp program--for families who do not know where their next meal \nwill come from. So laid-off workers may not be able to feed their \nfamilies, but our Republican colleagues will ensure that big oil \ncompanies continue to stuff their face at the taxpayer trough and they \nmake sure no subsidies are cut that will hurt the bonuses of the big \nfive oil companies' CEOs.\n  Here is one of them, Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil. He made \nnearly $29 million in 2010. How is it we can afford to protect Mr. \nTillerson's pay but not a program designed to help hungry children? Why \nis it we need to protect those who need it the least but take it from \nthose who need it the most?\n  Another issue we keep hearing from the other side is that cutting \nthese subsidies will somehow raise gas prices. The notion that gas \nprices will go up is only in Washington. Anyplace else in this country, \nthey get it. But only in Washington are we hearing from the other side \nthat cutting subsidies will somehow raise gas prices. The notion that \ngas prices will go up if we end subsidies to Big Oil is nothing more \nthan Republican snake oil, and the American people aren't buying it.\n  Let me put it plainly. We are subsidizing these companies to the tune \nof over $2 billion per year. Collectively, just these five companies--\nnot talking about other sized producers. Just these five companies made \n$137 billion last year. Can anybody, with a straight face, tell the \nAmerican people that they could not live with $135 billion in profits, \nthat they could not give up their $2 billion; and, therefore, if they \ncould only live with $135 billion, they wouldn't need to raise gas \nprices a dime--unless they are so greedy that $135 billion is not \nenough in profits that they need, out of each and every taxpayer's \npocket in this country, another $2 billion to add to their profits.\n  Yesterday morning I heard one of my colleagues on the floor ask why \nare we picking on the poor oil companies when everyone gets the same \ntax deductions. So I took out my 1040 tax form to look for myself, and \nI was looking, let's see, for intangible drilling costs. No, I don't \nsee it in my 1040 form. Tertiary injectants, I don't see it in my 1040 \nform. So I guess not everyone gets the special tax deductions for \ndrilling.\n  There is a tax deduction Big Oil gets called domestic manufacturing \ndeduction. When Congress was contemplating that provision, Big Oil, \nthrough their legion of lobbyists, managed to convince many on the \nother side of the aisle that drilling for oil was somehow \nmanufacturing. When we think of manufacturing, we think about creating \na product. I don't know about you, but being able to call drilling for \noil manufacturing seems like a real special tax break to me.\n  As I said yesterday in this Chamber, it is time to get back to \nreality, the type of reality middle-class families face in this \ncountry, the type of reality middle-class families face as they go to \nthe pump, as they have to get to work, take their children to school, \nto doctor appointments, the type of reality small businesses face when \nthey are trying to send their sales force across a State and have them \ntraveling in a car to do so. It is time to tell middle-class families \nstruggling to make ends meet that fairness means everyone pays their \nfair share when it comes to reducing the deficit and that it also means \nit is time to stop wasting taxpayer moneys on oil subsidies and use \nthis money to invest in clean energy, in jobs, in lowering the deficit. \nIt is time for us to repeal the Big Oil tax breaks. It is time for our \ncolleagues on the other side to join us to end this corporate welfare \nfor big oil companies, to create competition to help lower gas prices \nand to reduce the deficit rather than continue to sell snake oil to the \nAmerican people to protect Big Oil profits.\n  I have listened to some of the debate. I don't get it. I have seen \naverage Americans who are struggling, and they say: Wait a minute, $24 \nbillion of our money is going to the big five oil companies and they \nare making $137 billion? As a matter of fact, that is just 1 year. The \n$24 billion we want to eliminate and put into renewable energy fuels \nwould create competition, will ultimately help drive down gas prices, \nto reduce the deficit significantly, instead of calling upon cuts to \nchildren, whether in their nutrition or cuts to children who are \ndisabled. I only talked about $137 billion in 1 year. We want to cut \n$24 billion over the course of 10 years. Guess what they will make in \n10 years--over $1 trillion in profits. I find it hard to fall for the \ncrocodile tears that taking $24 billion over 10 years, a little over $2 \nbillion a year, when they are going to make $1 trillion over a decade \nis somehow not enough, that leaves them with not enough profits--$24 \nbillion from $1 trillion--and that because we take that $24 billion, \ngas prices are going to go up.\n\n  All these subsidies have not made gas prices go down. As a matter of \nfact, as I pointed out yesterday, at a time when they were making $137 \nbillion in profits, they were producing 4 percent less oil. Come on. It \nis time to give working families in this country a break. We can do \nthat as we vote to end Big Oil subsidies.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, we continue the discussion about the \nimpact of high energy prices, high gasoline prices at the pump, what \nthey mean to families from Alaska to New York--the very reality we face \nas a nation that is struggling still, coming out of a recession. We are \nworried about jobs. We are clearly worried about the high price of \nenergy and what can be done. I think it is important to note this is \nsomething to which there are no clear and easy answers. There are no \nshort-term, quick, flip-the-switch fixes we can do. But there are a lot \nof things we can help to make happen by either affirmative action or, \nin many cases, getting the government out of the way.\n  In doing so, I think it is important we speak honestly about the \nsituation before us, about what the potential solutions are and how \nthey translate. In the past day or so, I have heard some comments from \nsome of my colleagues that I think deserve a fair and honest\n\n[[Page S2122]]\n\nrebuttal so this conversation, the dialog, can continue and be better \nunderstood in terms of what we are talking about with these oil and gas \ntax increases--because that is exactly what the Menendez proposal would \ndo. It would increase the taxes on an industry that is providing not \nonly much needed resources for this country but much needed jobs.\n  The first point I have heard is that American taxpayers are, somehow \nor other, subsidizing the oil companies. Again, it is important to put \nthis in context. This argument I think rather bizarrely labels basic \ntax deductions, somehow or other, as a subsidy, as though the Federal \nGovernment allowing businesses to retain more of their earned dollars--\nbecause that is what is happening with the situation of the oil \ncompanies; they have earned the dollars and they are basically keeping \nmore of the dollars they have earned--that, somehow or other, that \naction is the equivalent to handing them a check from the government; \nwhether it is what we see, for instance, with the situation at \nSolyndra, where they got a check from the government. It is important \nto put in context that when some say we need to end subsidies for oil \ncompanies, I think what that translates into is raising taxes on oil \nproduction.\n  I think it important to note and understand this is an industry that \ndoes pay substantial taxes to the Treasury. Their taxes are already \nhigher than we see in most other industries. The four largest companies \nhave an effective tax rate that is over 40 percent. In 2010, they paid \n$55 billion in income taxes to Federal, State, local, and foreign \ngovernments. That is a huge sum. It probably increased, along with the \noil prices, back in 2011. These numbers are from 2010. But when people \nsay we all need to pay our fair share, I think it is important to ask \nthe question: How much does the industry have to pay before it is \nsufficiently considered to be doing its part?\n\n  One of the other points of contention that has been raised by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle is that raising taxes on oil \ncompanies will not increase gas prices. Well, it is certainly not going \nto lower them. I think we can probably agree on that.\n  If we raise taxes on oil production, we are going to get less oil \nproduction, and it is a question that I think we need to ask. Think of \nany situation where if we tax it more, we will have more of it, and it \nwill be more affordable. It just doesn't make sense here.\n  Both the President and the sponsor of the legislation before us have \npublicly stated that more production can help lower prices. Loss of oil \nproduction due to punitive taxes--I think we have seen this play out \ntime and time again. Back in the Carter administration they advanced a \nfailed windfall profits tax.\n  I mentioned yesterday on the Senate floor the example that we are \nseeing play out in Great Britain right now. One year ago the United \nKingdom decided to do essentially what is being proposed here. They \nreacted to high oil prices by raising taxes on the industry, and the \nnet result was companies produced less, and they diverted their \ninvestment elsewhere.\n  In the year since the UK imposed its tax hikes, the production \ndecline has tripled from 6 percent to 18 percent. They are now looking \nat reversing that decision and have announced new oil tax breaks to try \nto bring back that production.\n  Another point that has been raised is that somehow or other oil \ncompanies are getting special treatment, and I just mentioned this a \nlittle bit. Again, the four largest oil companies have an effective tax \nrate that is over 40 percent. What that means in terms of where they \nstack up with other industries--this is a higher effective rate than in \nmost other industries that we would see there.\n  Another point that has been raised is that oil companies are not \ninvesting their profits in more oil production. The President seems to \ndisagree with this statement, arguing that the United States is \nproducing the most oil it has seen in years. But the reality is, \nefforts to produce oil here in this country have been blocked or slowed \nby the Federal Government seemingly at every turn. Again, I think it is \nimportant to put this in context in terms of where we are seeing \nincreased production because that part of the discussion is true. We \nare seeing increased production but not necessarily on our Federal \nlands.\n  On this map of the lower 48, the Federal lands are all these areas in \nyellow. The red dots are Federal shale well operations on Federal land. \nThe blue is the shale well private land operations. So we have a \nsituation where 96 percent of all production increases have occurred on \nour States and on our private lands. This comes from the \nadministration's own EIA that we have seen production on the Federal \nside drop under this administration. The fact that exists is that \nAmerica's largest untapped oilfields--whether they are in the offshore \nareas, the mountain west, Alaska, which is not even on this map--are \nstill off-limits under Federal law. None of these resources are counted \nwhen people say the United States only has 2 percent of the world's \nreserves.\n  I showed a chart yesterday that indicated we are not even allowed to \ncount these areas that have not been truly proven. It is because of the \nlands being off-limits or the permitting delays that we see that the \nUnited States is not a larger producer of oil. If the Federal \nGovernment wanted to, it could allow us to become the world's top oil \nproducer and be virtually independent of OPEC sources.\n  A fifth point that deserves some comment: Yesterday, the majority \nleader said for every 1 cent increase per gallon of gas, Big Oil \nprofits rise by $200 million. Presuming this figure is true in the \ngeneral sense that it has been alleged, I think my Democratic colleague \nappears to prefer that perhaps those profits should go to OPEC rather \nthan to U.S. companies or to the pension holders. At least in the \nUnited States those dollars are taxable. They support jobs--including \n9.2 million jobs within the oil and gas industry--and help us with the \nbalance of trade issues. So, again, that is a contention that needs to \nbe directed, some commentary.\n  Another point is that America is now a major or net exporter of oil. \nThis was raised yesterday by the Senator from California when I was on \nthe Senate floor. She said: We are now a major or net exporter of oil. \nThat statement is absolutely false and needs to be corrected. Under 15 \nCFR 754.2, it is illegal to export crude oil from the United States \nwithout a rare and very special waiver. Therefore, 99 percent of the \noil that is produced here stays here. Ninety-nine percent of the oil \nproduced in this country stays in this country. Only 1 percent of U.S. \noil is exported.\n  The very small, very insignificant exports of crude that do occur \nrequire a very extensive review process. It is typically sent to Canada \nor Mexico for refining purposes. Ultimately, that fuel is returned for \nuse in the United States.\n  In terms of exporting refined products, if that is the concern, \nSecretary Chu came before the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations \nSubcommittee and stated that the only refined product exports from the \nUnited States consist of certain types of diesel fuel and products we \ndon't use in the United States. So that is a big difference between \nrefined product and crude.\n  But it is important to correct the record and demonstrate that we are \nnot in a situation where, as a country, we are exporting our crude oil. \nIt is totally inaccurate to say the United States is running a surplus \nor acting as some major exporter of any of the fuels which Americans \nneed and use to fill up their vehicles or heat their homes. As a \nresult, almost 90 percent of refined products stay in this country. \nPretty much the only products that are exported are those products we \ndon't use.\n  The last and final point I would like to make is about a statement \nthat was, again, made yesterday that somehow or other Republicans only \nwant to drill, and they are not interested in renewable energy. Again, \nI think that statement is a false one and needs to be corrected.\n  I come from an oil-producing State and certainly believe very \nstrongly that we need to also focus our efforts on renewable energy. \nRepublicans are simply proposing that we pay for renewable energy \nresearch and development without raising taxes on employers and \nconsumers.\n\n[[Page S2123]]\n\n  I have been pushing for years to allow for revenues from the \ndevelopment of ANWR to help us build out that next generation of energy \nsource for our country. ANWR revenues alone could provide as much as \n$300 billion in Federal revenues for renewables--depending on what the \nprice of oil is--if Democrats would simply allow access to it. Instead, \nthey propose to raise taxes on whatever production is taking place and \nhand out loan guarantees, unfortunately, to many unstable companies.\n  I would also point out that allowing the Keystone Pipeline has \nnothing to do with drilling. Neither does pressing the EPA to settle \ndown with its regulations that are making refineries so expensive to \noperate and in some cases actually shutting them down. I think most \nRepublicans also support the new CAFE standards and many of the other \nrenewable provisions that were in the energy law passed in 2007. This \nCongress has passed multiple efficiency and renewable bills out of the \nEnergy Committee. Unfortunately, none of them have been allowed a vote \non the floor of the Senate.\n  So I think it is wrong to suggest that Republicans are not willing to \ntalk about anything but drilling. We just want it included in part of \nthat discussion when we are talking about ``all of the above.'' I think \nwe absolutely need to mean all of the above, and that includes \nincreased domestic production and it includes a strong future for \nrenewables. It must focus on conservation and efficiency. This is how \nwe will get to a true level of energy independence and reduce our \nenergy vulnerability on our insecurity.\n  With that, I know my time has expired. I would ask unanimous consent \nthat the time during all quorum calls be divided equally.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I would ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, a week or so ago I came to the floor \nto talk about the general issues of gasoline prices and domestic energy \nproduction. I believe it is important for us to use accurate facts as \nwe are talking about our energy challenges and we work on energy policy \nissues. Only by using actual facts can we identify policies that will \nhopefully bring down the price of gasoline at the pump.\n  So I would like to focus on a particular aspect of our domestic \nproduction; that is, production on federally owned land. This is \nsomething which has been the subject of a lot of political discussion, \nboth out on the Presidential campaign trail and to some extent in the \nSenate.\n  Let me first comment with respect to the price of gasoline and the \nimpact of domestic production on the price of gasoline. This chart, \nwhich I put up before, ``U.S. oil production and gasoline prices during \nthe period 1990 through 2011,'' I think, makes the point very \nwell. That point is that the price of oil is set on the world market. \nWhat we produce domestically does not have a significant effect on that \nmarket. So the red line on the chart represents increases and decreases \nin domestic production of oil and the blue line represents the price of \ngasoline. Clearly, there is not a lot of correlation between those two. \nIt is worth looking again at this chart because I think it makes the \npoint that as U.S. production has increased from 2009 to the present, \noil prices have also increased. So increased production has not \nresulted in lower prices, and it cannot, because the price of oil is \nset on the world market and the price of gas is, in effect, pegged to \nthe price of oil.\n\n  Increased domestic production, while important for our country--and \nit is important for many reasons--does not bring us lower gas prices. \nOur policy approach must be to find ways to use less oil and be less \ndependent on the volatility we see in the world oil markets. We know \nhow to do that. We know how to decrease our vulnerability to those \nworld oil markets and we have made some, in my view, enlightened policy \nsteps to accomplish that. We got a good start in the 2007 Energy bill. \nIt was a bipartisan bill, and that bill requires the use of more \nbiofuels; that is, homegrown energy which is not traded on a world \nmarket. We require the use of those biofuels in transportation. We \nrequire that vehicles of all sizes be more fuel efficient. We have seen \ndramatic results from that, and we have hopes for even greater results \nin the future.\n  This next chart shows the real progress we have made in reducing our \nreliance on imported oil. It was about 60 percent in 2005; it is now \ndown closer to 45 percent in 2011. The Energy Information \nAdministration projects that this progress will continue and their \nprojection is that under current law, if we do nothing else, imports \nshould drop to around 38 percent of our oil consumption by 2020. I, for \none, hope we are able to do some other things and bring that dependency \non foreign oil down even more.\n  One way to continue that improvement is to support the expansion of \nour renewable fuels industry and support efficient vehicle production. \nIn the context of our debate about energy tax policy, we must use some \nof our limited taxpayer resources to encourage a diverse supply of both \nenergy and fuel. Promoting homegrown advanced biofuels and highly \nefficient alternative vehicles needs to remain a priority for our \ncountry.\n  Yesterday we had a hearing in the Finance Committee's Subcommittee on \nEnergy, Natural Resources, and Infrastructure, the purpose of which was \nto explore how the exploration of a number of tax incentives directed \nat advanced biofuels and at energy efficiency and at renewable energy \nhas affected those industries. I hope very much that we can find a way \nto work together to keep those incentives in place and continue to make \nprogress in developing these alternative ways to meet our energy needs.\n  Unfortunately, there are those involved in these discussions who \npersist in focusing almost entirely on how to increase domestic \nproduction instead of on any other policy that could help us to use \nless oil. While we know domestic production will not significantly \nimpact gasoline prices, at the very least when we discuss domestic \nproduction, I think it is important to get the facts right.\n  There is an ongoing misunderstanding or misstatement of the facts \nabout the production of oil on federally owned land. Let me address \nthat for a bit. One of the Republican candidates stated last week in \nthe context of gasoline prices that ``[p] roduction on government lands \nhas gone down under Obama.'' Indeed, he went on to suggest--without any \nbasis I could determine--that increasing domestic production of oil \nwould reduce the price of oil by $1.13 a gallon. How he came up with \nthat number I have no idea, but it is important that we all work from \nthe same facts.\n  Here are the facts: It is undisputed that overall domestic production \nof oil has increased, not decreased, over the last 3 years. We are \nshowing a chart that makes that point. This chart shows that during the \n3 years of 2006, 2007, and 2008--the last 3 years of the Bush \nadministration--we produced 1.78 billion barrels of oil. During the \nfirst 3 years of the Obama administration--2009, 2010, and 2011--we \nproduced 2 billion barrels of oil. One of the witnesses we had in a \nrecent hearing in the Energy Committee was James Burkhard, a managing \ndirector of IHS/Cambridge Energy Research Associates, and he described \nour situation in this country as the ``great revival'' of U.S. oil \nproduction.\n  Over the last 3 years, the U.S. increase in oil production was far \ngreater than that in any other country in the world. The United States \nis now the third largest oil producer in the world after Russia and \nSaudi Arabia. This trend is also true for the subset of domestic oil \nproduction which we would define as federally owned resources; that is, \noil production on Federal land. This chart I think illustrates that \nvery well. Production on federally owned land is higher in every year \nof the Obama administration than it was in the previous administration.\n\n[[Page S2124]]\n\n  Between 2006 and 2008, as I said before, we had a total of 1.78 \nbillion barrels of oil produced on Federal land. Between 2009 and 2011, \nthe total is over 2 billion barrels being produced on Federal land.\n  Secretary Salazar testified to the Energy Committee recently that oil \nproduction from the Federal Outer Continental Shelf increased by 30 \npercent between 2008 and 2010. Offshore production decreased somewhat \nbetween 2010 and 2011 because of the BP disaster in the gulf, but it \nstill remained higher than it was in 2008, and that production, of \ncourse, is increasing substantially again in 2012.\n  The Energy Information Administration suggests that clearly the \ndecrease experienced in 2011 in offshore production was due to the \nDeepwater Horizon disaster. It projects that domestic oil production \nwill increase over the next 10 years, in part due to ongoing \ndevelopment in the Gulf of Mexico. The projection is that it will \nincrease by over 1 million barrels per day as compared to 2010. Annual \noil production onshore on Federal lands has increased by over 8 million \nbarrels between 2008 and 2011 and is now over 111 million barrels.\n  Oil production has always fluctuated a bit from year to year on \nFederal lands and on private lands. There is no doubt that will \ncontinue to be the case. The important point here is that we need to \nput to rest once and for all the claim that the Obama administration is \ncausing a reduction in production of federally owned resources. That \nsimply is not the fact.\n  We should also be aware that the industry has access to a great deal \nof productive Federal acreage that it has not yet developed. This chart \nis instructive. This shows total federally owned acres leased for oil \nand gas development as of 2011. We can see there are 74 million acres \nthat are currently under lease. This is Federal land currently under \nlease, both onshore and offshore. The striking thing about this chart \nis that roughly 25 percent of this is actually being produced--\nproducing oil and gas at this time. There are many reasons for that. I \nam not accusing anyone of not diligently pursuing this; I am just \nsaying there is a lot of land under lease, a lot of area under lease \nthat is available for production, and I assume the companies that have \nleased it are aggressively pursuing that production.\n\n  This final chart I wish to share with my colleagues covers the number \nof acres offered to industry for lease on the Outer Continental Shelf, \nall of which were in the resource-rich central and western Gulf of \nMexico and the number of those acres actually leased. As we can see \nfrom this chart, the blue area is the area that was offered for lease \nbut not purchased and the red is the area that was actually leased. The \nadministration, of course, has announced they will have another lease \nsale in the Gulf of Mexico--in the central and western gulf--and this \nwill cover 38 million initial acres. So there is a very substantial \namount of land being offered for release.\n  It is useful to keep in mind that federally owned oil production \ntoday is about 37 percent of our total domestic production. Many of our \noil resources are located on private lands or State lands and resources \nfrom all of these areas are important in meeting our energy needs.\n  We need to produce domestic oil and produce it responsibly. There are \na lot of good national security and economic reasons for that. I have \nalways supported doing that. But to suggest that some change in policy \nregarding domestic production is going to change the price of gasoline \nat the pump is disingenuous. In order to move toward policies that will \nwork to moderate the impact of gasoline prices in the future, I think \nit is important we be honest with our constituents and ourselves about \nwhat the factors are that influence that price.\n  We enacted some policies in 2007 that have been helpful. I hope we \ncan build on that work at a time and on an issue of such great \nimportance to the future of our country. I hope we can work together \nand stick to the same facts. If we do that, I believe we can develop \nand enact policies that can provide real help in the long run to our \nconstituents who are suffering from high gas prices.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor up to 25 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I voted against the motion to proceed to the \nMenendez bill on Monday because, quite frankly, it is just a bill to \ncontinue raising gas prices. I talked for quite some time yesterday on \nthe Senate floor about this; that by raising taxes on the oil and gas \nindustry it sounds good to a lot of people because people do not like \nthe oil and gas industry. They have been vilified, so everybody thinks \nwe ought to get the oil and gas industry.\n  What they do not understand is--I think they understand it, but they \nwill not admit it--that is the way to increase prices at the pump. \nSomebody has to pay for all that stuff. So even Senator Menendez and \nseveral Democrats have said this bill is not going to lower gas prices. \nIt would raise gas prices. I do not think anyone who looks at it \nlogically could come to any other conclusion.\n  As I discussed Monday on the Senate floor, the Democrats' plan goes \nagainst everything we know about basic economics--higher taxes limits \nsupply. Whenever we limit supply, the price goes up. I do not think \nthere is a person out there right now who does not remember, back in \ntheir elementary school days, the basic concept of supply and demand. \nWe have this huge supply out there. But if we cut the supply, then the \ndemand is going to be greater, and the prices are going to go up.\n  The bottom line is, President Obama and his allies do not have an \nanswer to high gas prices. That is because high gas prices--higher \nprices for all the energy we use--are exactly what they want. This \nadministration remains committed to a cap-and-trade, green agenda. It \nis a plan that severely restricts domestic development and drives up \nthe price of gas and electricity.\n  Let me put it another way. Their policies are designed to make \nrecoverable traditional energy more expensive so their desired green \nenergy can compete. There is no question that is what the Obama \nadministration has wanted.\n  You all remember--and we have quoted so many times on this Senate \nfloor--that Steven Chu, the Secretary of Energy, told the Wall Street \nJournal: ``Somehow we have to figure out''--speaking on behalf of \nPresident Obama and the Obama administration; not so much the Democrats \nin the House and the Senate, but this is the Obama administration--he \nsaid: ``Somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of \ngasoline to the levels in Europe.'' Well, the levels in Europe were \nranging, at that time, when he made the statement, around $8. Well, we \nare getting up there. He is getting his way. This is something that is \nhappening now.\n  We all know the infamous quote from President Obama in 2008 when he \nsaid under his cap-and-trade plan--this is a quote now--``electricity \nprices would necessarily skyrocket.'' Notice the word ``necessarily.'' \nIt is going to happen. The President had it right. The point of the \ncap-and-trade regulations is to make us pay more on our utility bills.\n  A lot of times people do not draw the connection. Energy is energy. \nIf we raise the price of energy on utilities, on utility bills, or gas \nprices at the pump, it all relates to the rest. If we somehow put coal \nout of business so we have to use more natural gas and more gas, then \nthat raises the price because that makes more demand for that \nparticular product. I think most people understand that. That is very \nbasic.\n  If we are serious about lowering prices at the pump, then we need to \nopen the vast oil and gas reserves we have at home to develop. After \nall, CRS recently reported--this is kind of interesting because it was \na CRS report; so far, I have not heard anyone counter this report--we \nhave more recoverable\n\n[[Page S2125]]\n\nreserves of oil, gas, and coal than any country in the world--more than \nSaudi Arabia, more than China, more than Canada, all of them combined.\n  In fact, with more than 160 billion barrels of recoverable oil, we \nhave enough to maintain America's current rate of production and \nreplace all of our imports from the Persian Gulf for 50 years. That is \njust domestically what we could do. It is out there.\n  A lot of them try to say: Oh, no, we only have 2 percent of the \nreserves. I have said this so many times, and yet the other side just \nkeeps repeating it over and over: We only have 2 percent of the \nreserves, and we are using some 25 percent when, in fact, they are \ntalking about proven reserves. Proven reserves are reserves where we \nhave drilled and proved there is oil there. Recoverable are the areas \nwhere we have not drilled yet because we have not had an opportunity.\n  So if we have a policy, as this administration has, not to allow us \nto drill for oil, then we cannot prove anything. So the 2 percent means \nabsolutely nothing. It is totally false. The thing is they know it. The \nkey is ``recoverable.'' We have more recoverable reserves in fossil \nfuels; that is, oil, gas, and coal, than any other country in the \nworld.\n  But today we have awful government regulations that prevent us from \naccessing it, and we are the only Nation that does this. I defy anyone \nto tell me the name of another country that does not develop its own \nresources. They all do it, and we have this President saying, well, we \nencourage them down in Brazil and Venezuela to drill but not here.\n  Well, anyway, we have these reserves that we need to start doing \nsomething with. That is why I have submitted three amendments that will \naddress President Obama's war on affordable energy. I am going to talk \nabout them.\n  First of all, amendment No. 1974 is the American Jobs and Domestic \nEnergy Production Act. In order to increase the development of our \nwealth of resources, I have submitted a substitute amendment to this \nbill that will open literally billions of barrels of oil and gas for \ncommercial development. It is something that will actually bring down \nthe prices, directly bring down the price of oil, of gasoline at the \npump.\n  First, the bill opens significant portions of the Outer Continental \nShelf for development. Right now, the entire east coast and west coast \nand much of the Gulf of Mexico are completely off-limits. For the most \npart, the only offshore development allowed is in the western portion \nof the gulf and in certain areas offshore of Alaska. But we have to \nkeep in mind, to do this, we have to get the permits, and that is where \nthey have dragged their feet.\n  My amendment would require the rest of the OCS to be leased over \ntime. According to a recent study, these areas have at least 63 billion \nbarrels of recoverable oil and up to 186 trillion cubic feet of natural \ngas. Once brought fully online, this will create tens of thousands of \nnew jobs and ultimately may bring in an additional $1.4 trillion in \nadditional tax revenue for the government.\n  My amendment would also require the administration to move forward \nwith three lease sales that were conducted by the Bush administration \nbut were subsequently pulled by the Obama administration after taking \noffice.\n  Additionally, my amendment allows ANWR on the Northern Slope of \nAlaska to be developed. Experts believe this area contains 16.4 billion \nbarrels of oil and 18.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n  I have been up there. People talk about ANWR and all this, and it is \na beautiful area. They have systems now where we cannot even tell where \nthey are developing it. I have seen polls ranging from 70 to 85 \npercent--and I can actually identify these polls--of the people in \nAlaska, they want to do it. Why are we, in our infinite wisdom in \nWashington, DC, telling them in Alaska they cannot go after their own \noil and gas?\n  I think it is ludicrous. Anyway, this amendment will correct that \nsituation.\n  My amendment removes also the statutory moratorium on the development \nof this resource, and it requires the Secretary of the Interior to \nbegin an oil and gas leasing program in that area.\n  Today, oil shale--particularly that in Western States--represents \nsome of our greatest energy potential. Just a few years ago we didn't \nknow this. We didn't have any idea of the size of this.\n  Some experts believe the Western States hold as much as 1.8 trillion \nbarrels of oil shale, of which 800 billion barrels is presently \nrecoverable. This is simply an astonishing amount of oil, and it would \ndo a lot to help lower the price at the pump. That is what we are \ntalking about. Everything we have talked about on the floor in \nopposition to the Menendez bill is something that will lower prices of \ngasoline at the pump.\n  My bill forces the administration to release 10 research and \ndevelopment leases that were approved by the Bush administration but \nthen canceled by the Obama administration.\n  Thereafter, the Obama administration would be forced to conduct \nadditional oil shale leases on Federal lands. We have 93 percent of the \nFederal lands that are off-limits. That needs to be corrected.\n  Lastly, my bill reserves the right of regulating hydraulic fracturing \nto the States. I know a little bit about this because the first \nhydraulic fracturing that took place in this country was in my State of \nOklahoma in 1949. Since 1949, there has not been one documented case of \ngroundwater contamination. It has worked beautifully, I think most \npeople agree, now that it is better regulated by the States. The States \ndiffer in the depth of their resources, what they have to do to achieve \nit. It has worked. The old saying is ``if it ain't broke, don't fix \nit.'' We have to look behind the motive of the Federal Government. This \nadministration, if they can stop hydraulic fracturing, can stop the \nproduction of oil and gas. I believe that is their motivation. It is a \nState process that is successfully regulated by the States, and in 60 \nyears there has not been one documented case of groundwater \ncontamination.\n  Because States have done such a good job regulating fracking, I think \nthey ought to continue having that exclusive right. My bill does this. \nIt takes away the temptation of the power grab by the Federal \nGovernment to regulate this thing that doesn't need to be regulated at \nthe Federal level, particularly when their motivation is to do away \nwith hydraulic fracturing. If we do that and we talk about when they \nare trying to go after these types of formations, they cannot extract 1 \nfoot of natural gas without using hydraulic fracturing.\n  That is what the bill does. It would be a big win for energy \nproduction because we all know the administration's regulations would \nlikely prevent anybody from ever using hydraulic fracturing again. I \ncan remember when the President was giving his speech to the Nation at \nthe joint session. All of a sudden, people caught on that he has had \nthis war on fossil fuels. He started saying complimentary things about \ngood, clean natural gas. I agree. But what we didn't hear him say--\nbecause he said it so fast toward the end of his remarks--is we have to \ndo something about hydraulic fracturing. If we kill hydraulic \nfracturing, we cannot get the natural gas we are talking about.\n  All told, by tapping into our domestic supply of oil and gas, we \ncould increase our economic output by trillions of dollars over the \nnext several decades. It could increase government tax revenues by $2 \ntrillion, and it would create hundreds and thousands of new well-paying \njobs.\n  We have the energy resources we need, and if we develop them, it will \nsignificantly improve our economy and, there again, lower the price at \nthe pump.\n  By raising taxes, as the Menendez bill would, it would only make the \nproblem worse. I urge adoption of that amendment.\n  The next amendment I introduced is the Gas Regulations Act of 2012. \nTo hold the Obama administration accountable for their role in gas \nprices, I am also introducing the Gas Regulations Act of 2012 as an \namendment. We actually have this, and we are going to try to introduce \nit as a bill. This amendment would require an interagency committee to \nconduct a cumulative analysis on certain EPA rules and actions that \nimpact the price of gasoline and diesel fuels.\n  My amendment is the companion amendment to a bill introduced last\n\n[[Page S2126]]\n\nweek by House Energy and Power Subcommittee Chairman Ed Whitfield. This \namendment will help us to obtain a better understanding of the costs of \nall these levels of regulation. I have often talked about the \nregulation and what the cost is. It is kind of masquerading. I will \nread the cost of these regulations that this administration is \naccountable for and that directly relate to the increased price of gas \nat the pump. Tier 3 motor vehicle emissions and fuel standards--that \nwould levy a $12 billion gas tax on refiners. Who will pay for it? You \nwill and my wife will at the pump. New source performance standards for \npetroleum refiners could result in billions of additional environmental \nand compliance costs. Again, that will be passed on to the consumer. \nThe RFS2 standards too would force Americans to consume 21 billion \ngallons of expensive biofuels, such as the one the Navy procured for \n$26 a gallon last year, instead of paying $3.50 a gallon.\n  Ozone standards would result in a $676.8 billion loss in GDP. Again, \nthese standards increase directly the price of gas at the pump. There \nis greenhouse gas PSD and title V permitting actions--again, another \nregulation. This regulation slows down the permitting process and would \nprevent upgrading refining capacity from coming online quickly. Again, \nthis causes an increase in the gas price. People know pretty much the \nsupply-and-demand argument, but they don't know what the regulations \ndo. Anyway, this amendment No. 1963 is designed to do that.\n  The next one I introduced is amendment No. 1967. This is kind of \ncalled the Inhofe-Upton Energy Tax Prevention Act. Fred Upton, a \nCongressman, actually passed this. I have introduced this now for 3 \nyears. We have been trying to do this.\n  Just yesterday, we found out President Obama fully intends to make \ngood on his campaign promise that under his plan of a cap-and-trade \nsystem, electricity prices would ``necessarily skyrocket.'' That is \nwhat we are talking about with this amendment, cap and trade. People \nremember that. A lot of Republicans were concerned about this issue \nafter Kyoto, and they said let's do something about this; this idea \nthat somehow we are going to have to reduce and regulate greenhouse \ngases in order to do this. They are introducing cap-and-trade bills. It \ngoes back to the Kyoto convention in 1993, when the famous meeting was \nheld, and Al Gore went down to try to put it together in Rio de Janeiro \n20 years ago. He was going to put this together to come up with an \ninternational convention called Kyoto, and they tried to, of course, \nget us to pass it. We saw it would cost the American people between \n$300 billion and $400 billion a year, and it would treat developing \ncountries differently, so we didn't do it.\n\n  The interesting thing about the Kyoto treaty is that the President--\nthen President Clinton--never submitted it for ratification in this \nbody. After that didn't work out, they went ahead and did a second \neffort to do it through cap-and-trade legislation. We beat all the cap-\nand-trade regulations. The main reason is because it became evident the \nscience was cooked--all put together by the United Nations. It started \nback in 1992. They developed something called the IPCC, which is the \nIntergovernment Panel on Climate Change, which was designed in order \nto, I believe, cook the science and make people believe we are going to \nhave to do something and that CO2 and anthropogenic gases \nwere causing global warming.\n  We know what happened since that time, and with climategate, which \nshowed they cooked the science. Consequently, we introduced this \nlegislation. This legislation merely does one thing. It will take away \nthe jurisdiction of the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases. My concern is \nthis: We were able to stop all these bills from passing that would have \nimposed a tax increase on the American people.\n  To give an idea how much that $300 billion or $400 billion would \nmean, in Oklahoma, I keep track of the number of families who file tax \nreturns, and I do the math. If we do the math with what it would cost \nfor cap and trade and do the legislation they were talking about \npassing, which we defeated on the Senate floor, it would cost each \ntaxpayer in Oklahoma over $3,000 a year. What would they get for that? \nThis is interesting. Even those people out there who think I am way off \nbase and wrong, in terms of CO2 and anthropogenic gases--\nkeep in mind we asked the question to President Obama's Administrator \nof the EPA: ``If we were to pass cap and trade, would this reduce \nCO2 emissions worldwide?'' She said: ``No, logically, it \nwould not.''\n  This isn't where the problem is. The problem is in China and in \nIndia. Those are the places where they would have to be regulated. But \nthey don't regulate it to the degree we would here. We can carry that \none step further. If we pass cap and trade, it would have the effect of \nincreasing anthropogenic gases worldwide, because as our manufacturing \nbase leaves the United States and seeks energy in those areas where \nthere are less controls, that would have the effect of not reducing but \nincreasing emissions.\n  What we would attempt to do is to take away that jurisdiction. Here \nis the reason we want to do that. It is bad enough--when I talked about \n$300 billion to $400 billion it would cost to do cap and trade through \nlegislation, if we do it through regulation, it will be a lot more for \nthis reason: Most of the bills that were introduced, starting back in \n2003, ending up with the Waxman-Markey bill, which was a couple years \nago, these were bills that would regulate emitters that emitted over \n100,000 tons a year. However, if we do it through regulation, it has to \nbe under the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Air Act specifically says not \nthose that emit 100,000 tons a year but those who emit 250 tons or \nmore. That would be every church, every school, and every hospital in \nAmerica. We cannot even approximate that cost. That is what doing cap \nand trade by regulation would do.\n  Simply put, my third and last amendment would be to do here what they \nhave already done in the House of Representatives, which is to take \naway the jurisdiction from the EPA. It directly relates to the price of \ngas at the pump. Take these three amendments, and if the Menendez bill \nshould get through, with these amendments we can totally stop the \nincrease of gas at the pump because that is what we will be faced with \nif we adopt the Obama-Menendez amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n               Tribute to Former Senate Majority Leaders\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, last Wednesday, I had the privilege, as \ndid many in this body, of attending a tribute to two former majority \nleaders of the Senate, Howard Baker and Bob Dole. It was a great \nevening. President Clinton sent a video and the Vice President \nattended, as did the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, and all former majority leaders of the Senate, except \none. It was a long evening but a good one. Along with Senator Baker was \nhis wife former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, and along with Senator \nDole was his wife former Senator Elizabeth Dole. It was sponsored by \nthe Bipartisan Policy Center. It was a reminder that while in this body \nwe have differences, in fact, this body was created to resolve \ndifferences. People sometimes say to me: You Senators argue. That is \nwhat we are supposed to do. When they kick over to us issues that \ncannot be resolved other places, with respect for each other's points \nof view, we try to resolve them, and we often do. Well, Bob Dole and \nHoward Baker were among the best at working across party lines and \ngetting results, and it was for that skill as much as for any other \nskill that they were honored.\n\n  I was asked to introduce a short film about Senator Baker, and I did. \nSenator Roberts of Kansas was asked to introduce a short film about \nSenator Dole, and he did. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record my remarks about Howard Baker as I introduced the film.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Good evening. My job tonight is to introduce a short film \n     about Howard Baker, but I want to do that the way he would do \n     it with a story. I was thinking that--I believe the very last \n     time I appeared anywhere with both Senator Baker and Senator \n     Dole was almost exactly 16 years ago. It was just before the \n     Tennessee Republican primary. Bob had run me clean out of the \n     presidential race. I\n\n[[Page S2127]]\n\n     was trying to do the only graceful thing, which was to \n     support him.\n       And so Howard held a press conference at the Knoxville \n     Airport, and I did what I thought was a good thing to do. I \n     presented Bob Dole with one of my red and black plaid shirts \n     and my endorsement, whereupon Howard Baker said loud enough \n     for everybody in the news media to hear him: I hope that's \n     Lamar's last red and black plaid shirt.\n       Howard Baker loves a good story. He especially loves a \n     story about his maiden address. He spoke a little too long. \n     His father-in-law, the late Senator Dirksen, walked over to \n     congratulate him. And Howard said, well, Senator Dirksen, how \n     did I do? And Senator Dirksen looked down and said, Howard, \n     perhaps you should learn to occasionally be guilty of an \n     unexpressed thought.\n       From that he learned eloquent listening.\n       My favorite story of his was when he suddenly found himself \n     the majority leader after the Reagan sweep in 1980, and no \n     one was more surprised than him except Bob Byrd, who suddenly \n     found himself the minority leader.\n       So Howard went to see Bob Byrd, and he said, Senator Byrd, \n     I'll never learn the rules of the Senate as well as you know \n     them. So I'll make a deal with you. I won't surprise you if \n     you won't surprise me.\n       Senator Byrd said, let me think about it. But he called him \n     the next morning and said yes, and they worked beautifully \n     together for four years, effectively, with the Senate.\n       Senator Baker, when he was the chief of staff to President \n     Reagan, every single morning--so he tells me--would begin his \n     day with the president sitting down, just the two of them, \n     each of them telling the other one a little story. That got \n     to be a lot of stories. But it always made me feel a lot \n     better about our country to know we had a president and his \n     chief of staff who were so secure in their own skin that they \n     could sit down at the beginning of each day and tell each \n     other a little story. That was one of Howard Baker's secret \n     weapons.\n       His other secret weapon is that he remembers Roy Blunt's \n     advice: People start getting into trouble when they stop \n     sounding like where they grew up.\n       Howard Baker has never stopped sounding like where he grew \n     up, because he never stopped living where he grew up, the \n     little town of Huntsville, Tennessee.\n       Earlier this week a student asked me, what's the best way \n     for me to get into politics?\n       And I said, I can tell you exactly how to do it. Pick out \n     the person you admire the most, volunteer to go to work for \n     them without any pay, carry their bag, drive them wherever \n     they want to go, baby-sit their children, write their \n     speeches for them, even if they don't give your speeches. I \n     know that works, because that's what I did. I did it for the \n     very best. And 45 years ago, I went to work in the United \n     States Senate for Howard Baker, in the very same office that \n     I occupy today.\n       So I agree with Senator Dan Quayle, who once said, there's \n     Howard Baker, and then there are the rest of us senators.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senator Baker, recalling the story of \nhis maiden speech, asked that his remarks be put into the Congressional \nRecord. The story was this, which I told that night:\n  Senator Baker was here in 1967 and made his maiden speech at a time \nwhen his father-in-law, Everett Dirksen, was the Republican leader. I \nwas here then, as Senator Baker's young legislative assistant, right \nout of law school. Senator Dirksen walked over to Senator Baker and sat \ndown next to him after what had been a fairly long speech--maybe 45 \nminutes. Senator Baker looked at his father-in-law and said: Senator \nDirksen, how did I do? And Senator Dirksen said to his son-in-law \nHoward: Maybe occasionally you should enjoy the luxury of an \nunexpressed thought.\n  So Senator Baker, recalling that advice, I assume, asked that his \nremarks to be delivered that night at the end of a long ceremony be \nplaced in the Congressional Record, and so I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record Senator Baker's remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        BIPARTISAN POLICY CENTER\n\n        A CENTURY OF SERVICE HONORING HOWARD BAKER AND BOB DOLE\n\n                         THE MELLON AUDITORIUM\n\n                            WASHINGTON, D.C.\n\n                       WEDNESDAY, MARCH 21, 2012\n\n                    Remarks by Howard H. Baker, Jr.\n\n       When I first arrived in Washington as a newly-elected \n     Senator in 1967, the Vietnam War was at its height, with no \n     end in sight and with anti-war protests growing increasingly \n     violent.\n       Race riots were burning down American cities.\n       A president of the United States had been assassinated just \n     over three years earlier, and there were more assassinations \n     to come.\n       It was a dangerous time in America, and many of us feared \n     the center would not hold.\n       We came to Washington as the last of the World War II \n     generation to seek public office. We had been, in President \n     Kennedy's words, ``tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and \n     bitter peace,'' and we sought positions of leadership to help \n     heal the Nation we had sworn to defend as very young men and \n     women.\n       Bob Dole, a genuine hero of the Second World War, had \n     already come to Washington six years earlier as a Congressman \n     from Kansas, and he would join me in the Senate two years \n     later.\n       George Bush the elder, another young hero of the war, was \n     elected to the House the same day I was elected to the \n     Senate.\n       The overwhelming majority of members of the House and \n     Senate in those days had served their country in uniform, \n     most of us in war.\n       We had a perspective on political conflict that today's \n     leaders cannot have.\n       We knew what it was like to be a nation totally at war.\n       Most of us were old enough to have suffered through the \n     gloom of the Great Depression that had gripped our economy \n     for more than a decade.\n       And now our country was being torn apart by an unpopular \n     war, by racism, by extremism, by violence.\n       We were no less committed to the success of our political \n     parties and the supremacy of our policy objectives than the \n     leaders of today.\n       Indeed, we understood profoundly that the vigorous contest \n     of political ideologies and policy ideas lay at the very \n     heart of a successful democracy.\n       We knew that it was through those contending interests, \n     passionately but peacefully pursued, that the full range of \n     the American people's demands and dissents could be properly \n     addressed, and sound public policy could emerge from this \n     constitutional crucible.\n       But we also knew that none of us had a monopoly on truth, \n     or wisdom, or the best interests of our countrymen.\n       We had--and we kept throughout our Washington careers--a \n     decent respect for differing points of view.\n       Without this respect, democracy cannot work. With such \n     respect, with good will toward our adversaries even when \n     political passion is most intense, democracy cannot fail.\n       The abundant harvest of this philosophy is plain to see.\n       In our time of testing, we replaced race riots with racial \n     justice.\n       We won the Cold War.\n       We saved Social Security from bankruptcy and created a \n     social safety net that rescued millions from poverty and \n     desperation.\n       We created economic policies that led to the most sustained \n     and widely shared prosperity in the history of the world.\n       In much worse times than these, President Lincoln told his \n     deeply divided countrymen, ``We are not enemies but friends. \n     We must not be enemies.''\n       This is the credo of the Bipartisan Policy Center, which \n     does great honor to Bob Dole and me tonight.\n       This is the secret of America's success.\n       This is the foundation of America's democracy.\n       And this is my fondest wish for the country I love.\n       Thank you, and God bless us all.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks on \nthe subject we are debating here, which is energy.\n  Last week the majority leader said he was disappointed that we were \nnot moving to the Ex-Im Bank and to postal reform and to cybersecurity, \nall of which he said are urgent national issues the citizens of the \nUnited States expect our Senate to deal with. The Republican leader \nsaid that, on our side, we are ready to deal with all three, and the \nRepublican leader offered to join the majority leader in dealing with \nthe Ex-Im Bank, with a few relevant amendments. That might be a pretty \ngood way to begin our process of getting the Senate back to doing what \nthe Senate is supposed to do, which is to bring up important pieces of \nlegislation, allow Senators on both sides to offer their amendments, \nspeak on them, and then vote on them. It is easier to do if the \namendments are relevant to the legislation that is being offered.\n  So we were looking forward this week to dealing with a postal reform \nbill, which needs to be dealt with. We have a several-billion-dollar \ndebt for the post office, which has been a part of our lives ever since \nour country was founded, and we have competing pieces of legislation on \nthe issue, with very good Senators on both sides of the aisle ready to \ndiscuss it. Yet, suddenly the majority leader changed his mind, which \nhe has a right to do, and instead, he brought up legislation repealing \nsix tax provisions for five oil companies--provisions that, for the \nmost part, are tax provisions that are similar to those available to \nmost other companies in America.\n\n[[Page S2128]]\n\n  Why would the majority leader do that? Well, in the Senate it is not \nconsidered to be good form to inquire into the motivation of other \nSenators, and I won't do that, but I will read a paragraph or two from \nThe National Journal this week that speculated on what might have \nhappened this past Monday evening. I quote:\n\n       The Senate holds a procedural vote this evening on \n     legislation sponsored by Senator Menendez of New Jersey that \n     would repeal tax incentives for the country's biggest oil \n     companies. It won't pass, but it will create a platform for \n     Democrats to try to reclaim the debate on gas prices. Indeed, \n     a memo circulated over the weekend by John Podesta, president \n     of the liberal Center for American Progress, and Democratic \n     pollster Geoff Garin, notes that the vote ``offers a huge \n     opportunity for progressives to frame energy policy through \n     the gas price debate.'' Democrats will use familiar tactics \n     of linking high gas prices to Big Oil, and Big Oil to \n     Republicans, with the aim of attacking GOP presidential \n     candidates and of putting three vulnerable Republican \n     Senators up for reelection--Scott Brown of Massachusetts, \n     Richard Lugar of Indiana and Dean Heller of Nevada--in tough \n     spots.\n\n  That is the end of the speculation from the National Journal.\n  Now, maybe that was the reason the majority leader decided to bring \nthis up, but clearly we are spending a whole week on a political \nexercise. If this is true--that it is being brought up to frame an \nissue to put Republican Senators who may be running for reelection in a \ndifficult spot--well, then the Republicans must not think so because we \nall voted to bring it up. So instead of doing cybersecurity or postal \nreform, we are spending a whole week on something we all know is not \ngoing to pass and is a misuse of the time of the Senate. It would be \nmuch better if we were using the time on those other issues.\n  But as long as we are discussing lowering gasoline and fuel prices, I \nhave a suggestion to make. Here is a plan to lower fuel prices: Double \nenergy research. And here is a way to pay for it without adding to the \nFederal debt: Stop wasteful, long-term subsidies that are exclusively \nor mostly for both Big Oil and Big Wind.\n  Look at shale gas. The Senator from Oklahoma was talking about shale \ngas, which is being produced thanks to new technology found through \nenergy research. This is a remarkable development in our country. But, \nas Daniel Yergin, the leading expert on energy, reports in his new book \n``The Quest,'' the innovation on this began over 20 years ago, some of \nit from the private sector, some from government funding. Basically we \nfound a way to find natural gas and oil through a process called \nhydraulic fracking. It is possible all around the world. I was in \nAustralia in January, and they are doing it and selling it to China. \nThe remarkable difference for the United States is not just that we \nsuddenly have a lot more natural gas but that it is cheap gasoline. \nInstead of being $15 a unit, which it was when we passed the last \nEnergy bill in 2005, it is $2 a unit or $3 a unit.\n  More than that, while Australians are selling their gas to China and \npaying the world price at home for their own natural gas, in the United \nStates it appears likely we will be able to buy our gas at a U.S. price \nrather than a world price. What does that mean? That means that natural \ngas in Europe and in Asia is going to be worth four to five times what \nnatural gas is here. So chemical companies that were thinking about \nmoving overseas 5 years ago in order to be able to buy cheap natural \ngas for their feedstock, their raw materials, are staying here, \nexpanding here, thinking about moving back. Older people who need to \nheat and cool their homes can use natural gas at a cheaper price. \nManufacturing companies that are adding up the costs to make a decision \non whether to put a plant in Mexico or some other place in the United \nStates can put cheap energy in there with the natural gas. For the \nforeseeable future, it appears that natural gas in Europe and Asia is \ngoing to be four or five times what it is in the United States, giving \nus a tremendous advantage.\n  So energy research, both in the government and in the private sector, \nhas given the United States the advantage that, if truth be told, has \nbeen our advantage ever since World War II. The principal reason we \nhave produced 25 percent of all the money in the world is because of \nthe innovation, technology, and research that have come since World War \nII, and it is hard to think of an important advance in biological or \nphysical sciences without support from government research. So shale \ngas is one example of that.\n  So shale gas is one example of that. Here is another example: I drive \nan all-electric Nissan LEAF and pay about $3 for the electricity to \ntravel 100 miles--better than spending an equivalent $20 on gasoline. \nResearchers at battery maker Envia have invented a way to double the \ndensity of lithium ion batteries, hastening the arrival of the $20,000 \nelectric cars that travel 300 miles per charge. That research is \npermitting us, in the case of shale gas, to find more American energy \nand in the case of electric batteries, to use less of it.\n  That is why I argue that the United States should launch a series of \nmini Manhattan Projects with the same focus and determination of the \noriginal World War II Manhattan Project, this time with the goal of \nfinding more energy and finding ways to use less of it.\n  The United States has a resource no other country has--dozens of \nmajor research universities and 17 national laboratories that can \nadvance research on cheaper solar, better batteries, recapturing carbon \nfrom coal plants, biofuels from crops we don't eat, better ways to \ndispose of nuclear fuel, offshore winds, green buildings, and even \nfusion. To pay for doubling the $5 billion the United States now spends \non energy research, Congress should end current tax breaks that are \nexclusively or mostly for both Big Oil and Big Wind and of every $3 \nsaved, use $1 for more research and $2 to reduce the Federal debt.\n\n  For all we hear about Big Oil--and we hear a lot about it--you may be \nsurprised to learn that special tax breaks for Big Wind are even \ngreater. During the 5 years between 2009 and 2013, Federal taxpayer \nsubsidies for wind power developers equaled $14 billion, according to \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation and the U.S. Department of Treasury.\n  Here, I am only counting the production tax credit and the cash \ngrants that the 2009 stimulus law offered to wind developers in lieu of \nthe tax credit. An analysis of that stimulus cash grant program, which \nthis legislation offered here would extend, found that 64 percent of \nthe 50 highest dollar grants awarded--or about $2.7 billion in \nsubsidies--went to projects that had begun construction before the \nstimulus measures started. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for \nCommon Sense, told Greenwire:\n\n       It's essentially funding economic activity that would have \n     occurred. So it's just a pure subsidy.\n\n  It sounds like, in the President's budget, Big Oil receives multiple \ntax subsidies that are exclusively for Big Oil. Doing away with them, \nthey say, would save about $4.7 billion next year or about $22 billion \nto $24 billion over 5 years. So far, it sounds as though Big Oil with \n$22 billion is bigger with its subsidies than Big Wind with only $14 \nbillion. But here is the catch: Many of these subsidies the President \nis attacking oil companies for receiving are regular tax provisions \nthat are the same or similar to tax provisions that are available to \nhundreds, even thousands of companies in America. For example, Xerox, \nMicrosoft, and Caterpillar all benefit from tax provisions such as the \nmanufacturing tax credit, amortization or depreciation of used \nequipment that the President is counting as Big Oil subsidies. And of \ncourse wind energy companies also benefit from many of these same \nprovisions, but the production tax credit that benefits mostly wind is \nin addition to the regular Tax Code provisions that benefit many \ncompanies. So the only way to make a fair comparison is to look at \nsubsidies that mostly benefit only oil or mostly benefit only wind, and \nby that measure, Big Wind gets more tax breaks than Big Oil.\n  So the bill proposed by the Senator from New Jersey that is limited \nto just five big oil companies is limited to them even though many of \nthe tax breaks they receive are the same or similar to tax breaks many \nother companies receive. This bill also extends many tax breaks, \nincluding the wind production tax credit and the 1603 grant program for \nrenewable energy, which mostly benefits wind.\n  Two weeks ago, during the debate on the Transportation bill, the \nSenate wisely refused to extend the 20-year-old\n\n[[Page S2129]]\n\ntemporary production tax credit which mostly benefits wind. That was \nthe correct decision. We should allow this tax provision to expire. \nCongress made a much more difficult decision last year to allow the \nethanol tax credit to expire, and we should hold our ground and do the \nsame thing for the wind production tax credit.\n  There are three reasons Big Wind subsidies should go the way of the \n$5 billion annual ethanol subsidy. First, we can't afford it. The \nFederal Government borrows 40 cents of every dollar we spend.\n  It can't justify such a subsidy, especially for what the U.S. Energy \nSecretary calls a mature technology. According to a 2008 Energy \nInformation Agency report, Big Wind received in subsidies 25 times as \nmuch per megawatt hour as all other forms of electricity production \ncombined.\n  Second, wind turbines produce a relatively puny amount of unreliable, \nexpensive energy. Wind produces about 2.3 percent of all of our \nelectricity. A better alternative is clean natural gas. An even better \nalternative is cleaner nuclear power. Nuclear power reactors power our \nNavy and produce 70 percent of our pollution-free electricity. Using \nwindmills to power a country that uses one-fourth of the world's \nelectricity would be the energy equivalent of going to war in \nsailboats.\n  The Tennessee Valley Authority has erected 18 massive wind turbines \non 3,300-foot Buffalo Mountain outside Knoxville. Other than deface the \nlandscape and waste ratepayer dollars, the turbines have done little. \nThe wind there blows 19 percent of the time, usually at night when we \ndon't need it, and its unused electricity production cannot be stored.\n  Finally, there is the question of whether, in the name of saving the \nenvironment, wind turbines are destroying the environment. These are \nnot your grandma's windmills. They are taller than the Statue of \nLiberty. Their blades are as long as a football field, and their \nblinking lights can be seen for 20 miles. In Nashville, Vanderbilt and \nthe Metro water system is about to erect a small wind turbine as tall \nas the Parthenon replica we have in Nashville. It would take 1.1 \nmillion of these eyesores to equal the production of TVA's new Watts \nBar 2 nuclear reactor. Building that many turbines would cost 15 times \nthe cost of the nuclear reactor, and you would still need the nuclear \nplant for when the wind doesn't blow.\n  When wind advocate T. Boone Pickens was asked whether he would put \nturbines on his Texas ranch, he answered, ``No. They're ugly.''\n  Birds must think of turbines as Cuisinarts in the sky. Eagle killing \nhas become so commonplace that the U.S. Department of the Interior has \nset up a process to grant licenses for eagle takings, sort of a hunting \nlicense. A new documentary, ``Windfall,'' chronicles the despair of \nupstate New York residents debating whether to build giant turbines in \ntheir town.\n  So I ask the question: If wind has all these drawbacks, is a mature \ntechnology, and receives subsidies greater than any other form of \nenergy per unit of actual energy produced, why are we subsidizing it \nwith billions of dollars and why are we not including it in this \ndebate? Why are we talking about Big Oil subsidies and not Big Wind \nsubsidies?\n  Our energy policies should be, first, to double the $5 billion \nFederal energy research budget we now have and focus it on new forms of \ncheap, clean, reliable energy. I am talking about the 500-mile battery \nfor electric cars; commercial uses of carbon captured from coal plants; \nsolar power installed at less than $1 per watt; or offshore wind \nturbines. That would be research.\n  Second, we should strictly limit a handful of jumpstart research and \ndevelopment projects to take new technologies from the R phase to the \ncommercial phase. I am thinking here of projects such as ARPA E, \nmodeled after the defense department's DARPA agency that led to the \nInternet, to the stealth, and to other remarkable technologies; or the \n5-year program for small modular nuclear reactors; or incentives for \nthe first 200,000 electric vehicles purchased in America. These are a \nstrictly limited number of jumpstart R projects.\n  Third, we should end wasteful, long-term, special tax breaks, such as \nthose for Big Oil and those for Big Wind. I am talking about the tax \nbreaks that are exclusively mostly for Big Oil and Big Wind and not \nsimilar to what other industries receive. These savings from those \nsubsidies should be used to double clean energy research and to reduce \nour Federal debt.\n  But that is not what this bill does. This bill ends subsidies for \nfive companies that many other companies receive, and it extends \nsubsidies for a few companies that other industries don't get.\n  This debate isn't even about an energy plan, which is what we should \nbe debating when gas is around $4 a gallon right now.\n  Here is a very specific plan: Increase energy research--double it--to \nfind more American oil and more American natural gas and more American \nalternative forms of energy, and increase energy research to find ways \nto use less of that energy. I have highlighted the best ways to use \nless, and I have highlighted a way to pay for it.\n  I thank the President and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a couple weeks ago, and just now my \ncolleague, the Senator from Tennessee, has been speaking on the Senate \nfloor in opposition to the wind energy production tax credit.\n  Obviously, I have great respect for Senator Alexander. A person who \nhas been in the Cabinet, a person who has been Governor of their State, \na person who has been president of a university, and probably a lot of \nother important positions, can't help but be respected as a very \nimportant Senator and a very knowledgeable Senator. While I differ with \nhim greatly on this issue, I will continue to respect him.\n  The greatness of this body allows for debate and disagreeing points \nof view to be heard. I disagree strongly with my colleague. It might be \nnatural for me to do that because I have championed the wind energy tax \ncredit as a way to provide a level playing field for a very clean \nrenewable resource.\n  As a result, wind energy has become more efficient and cost \neffective. The cost of wind energy has declined by 90 percent since the \n1980s. Wind has accounted for 35 percent of all new American electric \ngeneration in the last 5 years. Wind already provides 20 percent of the \nelectric generation in my State of Iowa. It supports as many as 5,000 \ngood-paying jobs in our State.\n  As a result of the tax incentive, the wind energy has actually \ncreated new manufacturing jobs in the United States. Today, 60 percent \nof the wind turbines' value is now produced in the United States, \ncompared with 25 percent 6 years ago. There are now 400 facilities \nbuilding wind components in 43 States. That is why a bill in the House \nof Representatives to extend the wind energy production tax credit has \n80 cosponsors, including 18 Republicans.\n\n  If we fail to extend the incentive, thousands of jobs will be lost in \nthe wind manufacturing industry. Unemployment remains high at 8.3 \npercent. Why would Congress exacerbate the unemployment in our country \nby failing to extend this successful incentive?\n  The Senator from Tennessee has criticized wind turbines because he \nbelieves they are ugly and they kill birds. Well, I happen to find them \nmajestic and awe-inspiring on the landscape.\n  With regard to bill-kill accusations, the Senator's claims were \nevaluated by Politifact, a fact-checking organization. They concluded \nthat the estimates of birds killed by wind turbines vary widely and \nthat there is no consensus. They do point out that the 400,000-bird \nestimate used by Senator Alexander is the conclusion of just one \nperson. It is not an official U.S. Fish and Wildlife estimate. In fact, \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife cites figures that are, at most, half that, \nif not less by much.\n  By comparison, 976 million birds die annually from collisions with \nbuildings. Collisions with high-tension lines kill between 130 million \nand 1 billion birds. Cars kill 80 million birds each year.\n  The Senator from Tennessee referred many times to the wind project \nbuilt in his State by the Tennessee Valley Authority. They constructed \na 29-megawatt wind farm at Buffalo Mountain at a cost of $60 million. \nBut it only generates 6 megawatts, because it generates electricity \nonly 19 percent of the\n\n[[Page S2130]]\n\ntime. The Senator criticized it as being inefficient, wasteful, and \nill-advised. The TVA apparently characterizes it as a failed \nexperiment. He blames the Federal incentive for this failed wind \nproject. The blame is totally misplaced. I think the blame should go to \nthe taxpayer-subsidized TVA which put windmills where there was very \nlittle wind.\n  We do agree that the modification made to the renewable energy \nincentives in the stimulus bill of 2009, specifically the creation of \nthe 1603 cash grant program, is in fact bad policy and should not be \nextended. However, the production tax credit, which I first authored in \n1992, provides the incentive only for electricity that is actually \nproduced. Under the production tax credit, there is no tax benefit \nsimply for placing the turbine in the ground. Electricity must be \nproduced in order to get the credit.\n  The Senator from Tennessee went on to say that the tax incentive has \nencouraged developers to build wind projects in places with \ninsufficient wind resources. The TVA project is the only one I am aware \nof that was built with no prospects of generating electricity. For-\nprofit utilities have to look out for the bottom line. They are not \ngoing to make an investment if it doesn't make economic sense. A \nnonprofit such as TVA can fritter away money, which is what they \napparently did in this wind energy project.\n  The Senator from Tennessee might spend a bit of time criticizing the \nleaders of the TVA over their poor decision to build this wind project \nin the first place. I am not aware of a policy forcing them to develop \nwind. There is no mandate that they build a wind farm there in the \nState of Tennessee.\n  Most intelligent businesses determine whether an investment makes \ncommon sense. The Tennessee Valley Authority obviously failed in that \nregard in relationship to this wind project. The Senator from Tennessee \nmight use his time getting to the bottom of this leadership failure and \nsquandered resources by the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n  I am also glad that he raised the issue of the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority. Much of the criticism aimed at the wind production tax \ncredit is that it is costly, was meant to be temporary, and that it \nprovides a small benefit at great cost. Those same accusations could \nclearly be aimed at the Tennessee Valley Authority. Regardless of one's \nopinion of the TVA, there is no doubt--it is a big government program \nsubsidized by all Americans that benefits just a few.\n  The TVA was created in 1933 to provide flood control, navigation \nservices, and electrical power in the Tennessee Valley region. For more \nthan 60 years, Congress appropriated funds to cover losses by the \nTennessee Valley Authority.\n  A 2009 article published by Jim Powell of the Cato Institute noted \nthat a study estimated the annual cost of capital subsidies exceeded \n$1.2 billion, including taxes that the Tennessee Valley Authority was \nable to avoid.\n  In 1997, the Heritage Foundation issued a report entitled ``Five Good \nReasons to Force the TVA into Mandatory Retirement.'' This report \nstated:\n\n       Throughout its history, the TVA has benefited from generous \n     subsidies, tax breaks, and regulatory exemptions that allow \n     it to keep its power rates lower than the national averages. \n     Yet, despite its protected geographic monopoly, substantial \n     indirect subsidies totalling roughly $1.2 billion each year, \n     sweeping, across-the-board regulatory exemptions, the TVA has \n     managed to amass a debt of well over $27 billion and a \n     disturbing record of waste, mismanagement, and chronic cost \n     overruns.\n\n  The private nonprofit group Citizens Against Government Waste has \nsuggested selling the TVA's electric power assets and privatizing its \nnonpower functions. In their 2011 list of ``Prime Cuts,'' they argued \nthis move would save taxpayers $16.2 billion over 5 years.\n  Even the Congressional Budget Office listed the TVA in its March 2011 \nreport on spending and revenue options to reduce the national debt and \nthe annual deficit. When the Federal Government is borrowing 40 cents \nof every dollar we spend, perhaps the time has come to review an entity \nthat benefits 3 percent of the population at a cost of over $1.2 \nbillion annually. And I use that 40 cents the Federal Government is \nborrowing of every dollar we spend just as the Senator from Tennessee a \nfew minutes ago used that very same figure as a rationale for \neliminating certain expenditures. In this particular case, I apply it \nto the Congressional Budget Office recommendation of selling TVA.\n  Rather than blaming the tax incentives for an ill-conceived wind \nproject, I think a review of the management and taxpayer subsidy of TVA \nwould be more appropriate. On many occasions, the Senator from \nTennessee has argued that the incentives should be repealed and the \nsavings used to double the Federal energy research budget and to \nsupport development of new nuclear.\n\n  First, I support research efforts to develop clean energy, but I do \nnot support imposing a tax hike on one energy industry so we can spend \nbillions through our Federal bureaucracy. This idea is nothing more \nthan a tax increase to pay for further Washington spending. It is this \nkind of activity that helped create the fiscal mess our country is in \nright now.\n  Second, I strongly support nuclear energy. In fact, I believe there \nare four critical elements to a comprehensive energy policy. They are \ndrilling for domestic oil and gas, promoting renewable and alternative \nenergy, supporting conservation and, of course, fourth, nuclear energy.\n  Nuclear is an emission-free resource. It certainly should play a key \nrole in providing our Nation and economy with renewable emission-free \nenergy. However, this discussion of wind energy versus nuclear energy \nshould be an intellectually honest debate. The fact is, nuclear energy \nin the United States would not exist today--would not even be here \ntoday--without significant government support over 60 years, and \ndevelopment of new nuclear in the United States is unlikely to happen \nwithout even greater government intervention and subsidies.\n  An analysis done by the Christian Science Monitor concluded that the \nnuclear power industry in the United States receives about $9 billion \nannually in subsidies. They state that the subsidies stem from things \nsuch as Federal decommissioning, waste management policy, and research \nand development in the Nation's National Laboratories.\n  The Union of Concerned Scientists published a document in February of \nlast year entitled ``Nuclear Power: Still Not Viable without \nSubsidies.'' They contend that the 50-year-old nuclear industry has \nbenefited from 30 subsidies. The Price-Anderson insurance liability \npolicy was enacted in 1957 as a temporary measure for an infant \nindustry. It was recently extended until the year 2025.\n  The Cato Institute published an article, June 2003, entitled ``No \nCorporate Welfare for Nuclear Power.''\n  That report states:\n\n       Despite extensive and continued government assistance--\n     including more than $66 billion in research and development \n     alone--no nuclear powerplant has been ordered and built in \n     the United States since 1973.\n\n  But it goes further.\n\n       The decline of nuclear power is the result of several \n     factors: the Three Mile Island disaster heightened public \n     safety fears and citizen opposition to the siting of grants \n     in their neighborhood grew. But nuclear power was ultimately \n     rejected by investors because it simply does not make \n     economic sense. In truth, nuclear power has never made \n     economic sense and exists purely as a creature of government.\n\n  A more recent piece by the Cato Institute cites an economist who \nbelieves existing nuclear power subsidies are equal to one-third or \nmore of the value of the power produced, and that they face a negative \n49-percent tax rate.\n  There are only two new nuclear plants on the drawing board in the \nUnited States today. Both are recipients of loan guaranties provided by \nthe Department of Energy. One is an $8.3 billion loan guaranty, and the \nother is $2 billion. When the Loan Guaranty Program was first created \nby Congress, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that ``the risk \nof default on such loan guaranties to be very high--well above 50 \npercent.'' This is the same program that backed Solyndra.\n  Congress originally set aside $18.5 billion for loan guaranties for \nnuclear. President Obama has requested tripling that amount to $54.5 \nbillion. It is estimated that this $54 billion would help construct 12 \nnew nuclear plants. That is about $4.5 billion each.\n  Congress created a production tax credit for new nuclear in the year \n2005.\n\n[[Page S2131]]\n\nNow the nuclear industry is advocating a 30-percent investment tax \ncredit for these new nuclear constructions.\n  They are also advocating that the production tax credit be extended \nto the year 2025--that is right; they are seeking to extend for another \n13 years a temporary tax incentive.\n  Taxpayers for Common Sense, in an article published just last week, \nconcluded:\n\n       The U.S. cannot afford to shoulder the high price tag and \n     long term fiscal risk. If the industry cannot figure out a \n     way to manage its long term risks, the taxpayer should not \n     step in. This is especially true when the nation is staring \n     into a $15 trillion chasm of debt. After more than 50 years \n     of subsidies and support, it's well past time for the nuclear \n     industry to stand on its own two feet.\n\n  I do not raise these points to undermine our nuclear industry. I am \nnot urging my colleagues to end the entire big nuclear gravy train at \nthis time. I support that form of energy as one component of a \ncomprehensive energy program. I support a real, ``all-of-the-above'' \napproach to energy security. But a fair comparison of Federal support \nfor wind and nuclear needs to be made. That is the point of my remarks \nat this time.\n  I say to the Senator from Tennessee, as he just spoke and as he spoke \na couple of weeks ago, it is intellectually dishonest to criticize wind \nincentives while at the same time ignoring those subsidies for nuclear \nenergy. The Senator from Tennessee referred to a Wall Street Journal \neditorial that criticized the wind energy incentive. It called into \nquestion whether wind energy could survive a market-based system.\n  I will eagerly await an editorial in the Wall Street Journal--which, \nby the way, will never appear--calling for the gravy train for big \nnuclear to end after nearly 60 years of Federal subsidies with no \nmarket-based timetable on the horizon.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto executive session at 4:30 p.m. today and that all other provisions \nof the previous consent remain in effect, and that the previous order \nregarding the division of time on the motion to proceed to S. 2230 be \nmodified to reflect this consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. For the information of Senators, the two votes originally \nscheduled to begin at 6 p.m. will now begin at 5:30 p.m.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, right outside this Chamber, across the \nstreet, is a huge gathering. It is the third day in succession that \npeople from all across America have gathered before the Supreme Court. \nThey have different points of view. They express those points of view \nin various ways--with signs, chants, music, a variety of others--\ncostumes that are worn to express their points of view.\n  Let me first salute the fact that it is part of America. It is \nprotected, and no one is going to be arrested for expressing \nthemselves, whether they are for or against health care reform. We take \nit for granted, and we should not because in some countries around the \nworld it is an exception rather than a rule. In America, it is who we \nare. We should celebrate even when we disagree.\n  But let me say a word about what is going on inside the building \nacross the street. They are considering the health care reform bill \nthat was passed by the Congress and signed by President Obama. Some \nhave tried to characterize it as ObamaCare. For the longest time that \nwas the biggest applause line at Republican Presidential rallies, after \ncandidate after candidate stood up and said: I will repeal ObamaCare.\n  Let me speak to the issue which I think is guiding the discussion \nacross the street and give perhaps a perspective on it that is not \noften stated on this floor. Earlier this morning several of my \ncolleagues on the Republican side who voted against health care reform \ncame to the Senate floor to express their opposition to the notion of a \nmandate. Here is what the mandate is about.\n  Currently, in America, there are millions of people who have no \nhealth insurance. Some of them by choice--young people think they are \ninvincible; they will not buy it. Some people cannot afford it. But the \nfact is, even these uninsured people get sick.\n  When they get sick or are the victims of trauma--automobile \naccidents, diagnosed with a disease--they don't stay at home and wait \nfor death, they go to a hospital. When they arrive at that hospital \nthey are treated--emergency rooms, regular treatment--and then the \nbills are sent their way. Without health insurance many of them cannot \npay the bills.\n  A little over a year and a half ago I went in for one night, \novernight surgery in Chicago--the first time I was ever in a hospital \nsince I was born. Everything worked perfectly. The ending was great. I \ncouldn't ask for a better result. The total bill, start to finish, was \n$100,000.\n  Lucky for me, I am a Senator. I have the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program. It paid for almost everything. What if I had no \ninsurance? They would have sent me the bill. Perhaps I could have come \nup with the money to pay for it, but some people cannot. What happens \nthen?\n  The hospitals and doctors then take these bills and say: Well, so-\nand-so didn't pay their bill. We are going to charge someone else who \nis paying more. Mr. President, 63 percent of the medical care given to \nuninsured people in America is not paid for, 63 percent. It is shifted, \nthat financial responsibility is shifted to those who do pay, those who \nare under government insurance programs and private insurance programs. \nWhat it means is for those of us in private insurance programs, we pay \n$1,000 more a year--$80-plus a month--to pay off the bills of those who \nare uninsured. That is the subsidy which insured people pay to cover \nthe unpaid medical expenses of the uninsured. That is the starting \npoint.\n  Until we reach the point where everyone is under the tent of \ninsurance, this will continue. Uninsured people will get sick, and \nthose who buy insurance will pay for them. That is cost shifting. It \nhappens every single day in America.\n  The health care reform bill said we have to have health insurance. It \nis a mandate. But we know some people cannot afford it. If someone is \npoor, in the lower income category, we will enroll them in Medicaid so \nthey will have at least Medicaid insurance to pay their medical bills.\n  At Memorial Medical Center in my hometown of Springfield, IL, Ed \nCurtis, who runs that hospital, said to me: Senator, if you just did \nthat alone, if we could just get Medicaid payment for everyone who \nwalked through the door, we would be fine. What hurts us are those who \npay nothing because they can't. That is a problem. The bill we passed \nwent on to say that if you are working, you will never have to pay more \nthan 8 percent of your income for health insurance premiums. People \nwould rather pay nothing, but 8 percent is a lot more manageable than \npeople who are facing 10, 20, 30 percent of their pay going to health \ninsurance premiums. So we basically have created a requirement to have \nhealth insurance but with a helping hand to reach that goal.\n\n  So what about the people who already have health insurance? They are \nuntouched by this mandate. They just continue on and let life continue. \nYou have made your choice; you have health insurance; it doesn't affect \nyou.\n  What I find interesting are so many Senators--primarily from the \nother side of the aisle--who come to this floor condemning government-\nadministered health insurance. ``Get the government out of health \ninsurance.'' You hear that speech over and over. What they don't tell \nyou is their own health insurance policies are administered by the \nFederal Government.\n  Mr. President, as Members of the Senate, you and I are eligible--so \ntoo are Members of the House--to be part of the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program. This was created decades\n\n[[Page S2132]]\n\nago to provide health insurance for people working for the Federal \nGovernment. Eight million people--employees and their families--are \ncovered by this plan. What you have learned as a new Senator is that \nthey come to us once a year and say: Durbin, you and your wife are \neligible for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, and here \nare the private insurance plans you can choose from that are enrolled \nin our program.\n  We have nine choices in Illinois, so Loretta and I looked through and \npicked the plan we liked. We pay part of my income as premium, and the \ngovernment pays the remainder. It is a government-administered plan, \nand each year we have an open enrollment to change if we wish. This has \nbeen wildly successful and popular. Private insurance companies fight \nto enroll in it so they can cover Federal employees, and we have good, \nreliable, affordable insurance, insurance that we can change if we \ndon't like it.\n  A few years back, one of my employees needed a specific foot surgery. \nIt turned out her health insurance didn't cover it, but she knew the \nopen enrollment period was coming. She waited and enrolled in a plan \nthat covered it. What a luxury. People across America would applaud if \nthey thought they could get that treatment, government-administered \nhealth care for Members of Congress.\n  I have waited patiently now throughout this entire debate for the \nfirst Republican Senator who condemns government-administered health \ncare to come to the well of the Senate and announce they are dropping \ntheir own health insurance as a matter of principle. No way.\n  I think people across America are entitled to health insurance that \nis at least as good as the health insurance Members of Congress have \ntoday. I don't think that is a radical idea, and, in fact, the health \ncare reform bill we passed said that Members of Congress will be part \nof the same insurance exchanges we are creating all across America. \nThat is only fair. I am hoping it offers the same plans as the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program, but I am sure it will offer me a \nchoice, and with that choice I am sure my family will get good \ncoverage.\n  When I hear the debates across the street suggesting that the notion \nof requiring people to buy health insurance is somehow un-American or \nunconstitutional, I struggle with that concept. We know what we are \ntrying to do--reduce the overall cost of health care for America. We \nalso know that the requirement of having health insurance is not that \nmuch different from the requirement of paying into Social Security if \nyou go to work in America. If you want another parallel, in my State \nyou have to have insurance to drive an automobile. They don't want you \ngetting involved in an accident without insurance. For one thing, it is \nnot fair to the other driver, let alone the person who might be injured \nin the car. These are mandates under the law relative to insurance--one \nfor retirement, the other for liability--that are built into the law, \nand we don't have people marching in the streets over them.\n  We have to come to a point in this country where we reach a balance, \nand the balance suggests personal responsibility. It means that the \nmillions of Americans who should have and could have health insurance \nwith the help of a tax break, perhaps with the help of Medicaid, should \nhave that insurance so that the burden of their medical bills does not \nfall on every other family and every other insured person. Those who \nare screaming for freedom ought to stop and think a second. Those who \nare accepting the personal responsibility of having health insurance \nare exercising their right to protect their family, and they should \nhave the peace of mind of knowing that their neighbor who didn't accept \nhis personal responsibility will not pass his medical bills on to them. \nI think that is the basis of what we are debating across the street.\n  I would like to raise a point, if I can, about a bill that was \npending this week. It was offered by Senator Menendez of New Jersey to \nend Federal subsidies to oil companies.\n  Last Sunday in Chicago, I went by a BP gas station on the Congress \nExpressway, and I saw it for the first time--more than $5 a gallon for \ngas, $5.03 a gallon for ultimate gasoline at the BP station. For \nreasons I cannot explain, Illinois has the highest gasoline prices in \nAmerica. We have refineries all over our State. I don't get it. But I \nknow it is a recurring problem and a recurring theme. Every spring we \ngo through it. The runup to Easter is the time for every politician in \nAmerica to dust off the press release expressing outrage at our oil \ncompanies.\n  They do it to us every year. They come up with convenient excuses: \nYou know, it is all about uncertainty in the Middle East. How long have \nthey been playing that card. No, it is about the change of seasons. You \nsee, when we go from winter to spring, we just are not ready for it. \nReally? You weren't ready for the change of seasons? There was a \nrefinery accident in some town in the Midwest 400 miles away, and it \nhas really disrupted everything. Well, I don't buy it, and I haven't \nover the years.\n  What they are doing is what they can do: they run up the price of \nthis commodity because we have no choice. Until we have a choice in the \nvehicles we drive or in the sources of energy we use, we are kind of \nstuck with oil companies. But we are not stuck with paying a $4 billion \nannual subsidy to these oil companies. That is what the tax break we \ngive to oil companies comes to. Senator Menendez of New Jersey has \nsaid: Stop it. Take the $4 billion and invest it in renewable, \nsustainable energy research, and take the rest and reduce the deficit. \nThe five biggest oil companies had profits of over $137 billion last \nyear. They won't miss $4 billion. And we should be ashamed that we \ncontinue to shove subsidies at them when they are so profitable.\n  What is happening when it comes to oil exploration? It is a \nlegitimate question. We are now at an 8-year high in terms of the oil \nproduction in America. Starting under President Bush and continuing \nunder President Obama, we have more oil and gas rigs in place working \ntoday in the United States than in the rest of the world combined. So \nthose who say that if we just drilled a little more, gasoline prices \nwould come down, you have to look at that. We are increasing the \nsupply, and yet the prices go up.\n  Secondly, we also understand that when it comes to these gasoline \nprices, even when the supply goes up, the prices are going up. It \ndefies the law of physics. Demand is down because of the recession, \nsupply is up, and prices are going up. That violates principles of \neconomics 101 that I studied in college.\n\n  What Senator Menendez is suggesting is a move in the right direction, \nnot just because we cannot justify the subsidies to oil companies \nanymore but because we should be investing in new ideas that will move \nus forward in the right direction.\n  This morning we had a meeting that I think the Presiding Officer \nattended, and the CEO of Chrysler Corporation was there. He is an \ninteresting and curious man, Sergio Marchionne. I don't think he owns a \nsuit and tie. He never wears one. He is the CEO of a major corporation, \nand he wears kind of a black-knit sweater. I see him all the time. But \nyou have to give him credit; he took Chrysler Corporation when it was \non the ropes struggling and near extinction and turned it around \ncompletely. They are looking forward to more than doubling the \nautomobiles they are going to sell. Those who thought that the \nautomobile bailout, as they called it, was a bad idea should listen to \nthis man.\n  I can tell him the story of Belvidere, IL, northern Illinois, Boone \ncounty. We have a Chrysler production facility that Marchionne said to \nme is one of our best. They have gone on to a second shift, and he said \nthat by the end of the year, they will go to a third shift in producing \ncars for America. He gets it. And when you talk to him about fuel \nefficiency and fuel economy in cars, they are moving in that direction. \nThey are committed to it.\n  The President brokered an agreement with the major auto companies \nthat they would make more fuel-efficient vehicles. That is good news \nfor consumers. We need to be subsidizing research into better, more \nefficient forms of energy instead of subsidizing oil companies with \nrecordbreaking profits.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Would the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I thank the assistant majority leader. I heard his \ncomments about Chrysler and what\n\n[[Page S2133]]\n\nhappened with the CEO when he was in town today talking to some of our \ncolleagues. And one of the untold stories of the auto rescue is not \njust that in my State 800,000 people work directly or indirectly for \nthe auto industry. Most of those are part of the supply chain that \nmakes products and sells those products--a large number of them--that \nare assembled in Lordstown or Toledo or different places around Ohio. \nBut one of the untold stories is that not only were these jobs and \nthese companies saved from going bankrupt--and who knows what would \nhave happened to a State such as mine where much of the State is pretty \ndependent on the auto industry--but in the case of the Toledo Jeep \nplant, prior to the auto rescue only 50 percent of the components that \nwent into the Jeep Wrangler were made in the United States. After the \nPresident and Vice President negotiated with the auto industry and the \nauto task force and the House and Senate weighed in, now 75 percent of \nthe components that go into the Jeep Wrangler are made in the United \nStates. So we are not just seeing the 5,000 jobs in Lordstown making \nthe Chevy Cruze or the jobs at the Honda assembly plants in Marysville, \nOH, or Toledo, or Ford, we are also seeing that a lot more of the \ncomponents are made in the United States. And these are often union \njobs, often not union jobs, but they are almost all good-paying jobs \nthat give people a ticket to the middle-class. It helps them to buy a \nhouse, send their son or daughter to school, or buy a car. Without it, \nmy State would probably be in a depression.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Ohio, that is a good point and \none we ought to make over and over because there is no question that \nthe downturn in the recession forced the management of these auto \ncompanies and the workers to step back and take a look at the \nchallenges they faced.\n  Mr. Marchionne, the CEO of Chrysler, said this morning: We are where \nwe are today because our UAW workers--union workers--sat down at the \ntable and said, we have to agree on a future together or we are sunk. \nThey agreed on that future, and he said: Now my workforce is excited \nand productive.\n  The Senator just made the point--more businesses are coming back from \noverseas. It is a great success story.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I have been to the plant where they make the \nengine for the Chevy Cruze, I have been to the plant where they make \nthe bumper for some of these cars, and I have been to the assembly \nplants, and the workers are excited. And the workers sacrificed a lot, \nas the auto industry--all kinds of people took a hit with the managed \nbankruptcy of those two companies. But we have seen not just the auto \nindustry, but for 12 years, from 1997 to 2009, in my State and I assume \nin Illinois too and all over the country we lost manufacturing jobs. \nAlmost every month for the last 2 years we have gained manufacturing \njobs.\n  The auto rescue is not the only reason we have seen things turn \naround. We also have a productive workforce and we are training workers \nbetter. I have 55 college presidents I just met with whom I bring to \nWashington for a conference--it is the fifth year in a row. Senator \nPortman, Congresswoman Sutton, and others have met with them. They are \nmore focused than ever on manufacturing, working to train those people \nso they can go into manufacturing. The students they are educating are \nin a whole lot of fields, but one of them is focusing on how to train \npeople to do this high-end, much more technical, complicated \nmanufacturing than a generation ago, and it is starting to work.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is not lost on the American people. There was a \ndifferent point of view when President Obama said: I never wanted to \nown an automobile company; that is not why I ran for President. But he \nrealized we faced an economic crisis. If he had not stepped in for \nChrysler and General Motors at the moment he did, they might not exist \ntoday.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, if my colleague would yield one \nmore time, it wouldn't have just been Chrysler and General Motors that \nwould have faltered. Honda--a foreign-owned company that has made a \nhuge and positive presence in the Columbus area, in northwest Columbus \nand in Marysville--and Ford, obviously one of the Big Three but one \nthat didn't ask for the rescue--both those companies wanted us to do \nthe rescue because they knew if we didn't, their whole supply chain \nwould begin to fall apart too. So this mattered not just for Chrysler \nand GM, saving them, and now that they are putting tens of thousands of \npeople all over the country back to work, it mattered for the entire \nindustry, including the foreign companies that have invested and hired \na lot of American workers.\n  I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would just add--and this is not lost on \nmost Americans--there are some political figures who said publicly they \nshould have just gone bankrupt and gone out of business. I think the \nPresident made the right decision. Today, Mr. Marchionne made it clear \nChrysler has paid back everything. They have paid it all back. So now, \nhe said, if we need to borrow money, we are not going to come knock on \nthe door of Secretary Geithner of the Treasury Department; we can go to \nbanks. We are a thriving corporation. We are doing well. He said: I \nhave nothing but good news for you, which is great to hear in a \nrecovering economy.\n  It was a bet made by the President on behalf of hundreds of thousands \nof workers and companies and it paid off. What it says is that if we \nstand behind the basic pillars of the American economy--and \nmanufacturing is one of those; maybe the largest pillar that holds up \nthis great economy--we can prosper and succeed. Jobs being brought back \nfrom Mexico and overseas into the United States, I am glad I have lived \nto see it because I can remember when they were headed in the other \ndirection.\n  Companies that were almost given up on by some politicians turned \nout, such as GM and Chrysler, to be prosperous today, building new cars \nand thinking about the new demands of our economy and our future, tells \nme we can put this together.\n  So when we hear those who say what we need to continue to do is to \nshovel subsidies at oil companies that earn $137 billion a year in \nprofits, let's take that money--we do have a deficit--take that money, \ninvest it in something that will create jobs and take the balance and \nreduce the deficit. I don't think that is a bad outcome. There are lots \nof good things we can invest in. The Department of Energy is talking \nabout battery technology. That is still going to be our challenge for \nthe future--finding ways to create power and save power for when it is \nneeded. I think we need to incentivize that kind of research in the \nfuture as well.\n  At this point, I will yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, right now there is an issue on the mind of \nevery Hoosier and most Americans, if not every American, and that issue \nis the high price of gas. Over the past few months, gas prices have \nrisen higher and higher each week. Currently, across the Nation, the \naverage price is $3.90. In Indiana, it is even higher. It is close to \n$4, and in many parts of our State it is well over $4 per gallon.\n  These prices obviously have a significant economic impact on our \ncountry. It causes budgets to get tighter, planned vacations to either \nbe canceled or shortened; families, farmers, and businesses across the \nState of Indiana are having to rethink their budgets for the year and \nmake tough financial decisions. This is all at a time when unemployment \ncontinues to remain high. Americans are struggling to make ends meet. \nRising gas and energy costs only further weaken an already struggling \neconomy.\n  It is true supply and demand of gasoline and oil prices are subject \nto global considerations. There are concerns that the supply is not \nmeeting the demand. That triggers some clear increase in prices of \ncrude oil. There is also the concern that conflict in the Middle East \ncould potentially shut down lanes of commerce that bring oil out of the \nMiddle East to the rest of\n\n[[Page S2134]]\n\nthe world. So we need to acknowledge there are these spikes.\n  However, this is a trend that has been going up and up and up. We \nhave seen gas prices more than double in the last 3 years and, clearly, \nnow $3.50, $3.75 is not something that looks like a spike; it is \nstarting to look like the normal average and that certainly has real \nserious economic implications for this country.\n  There is some good news. The good news is, Americans are increasingly \nunderstanding and learning we can be a major player in producing \nenergy. We are discovering abundant amounts of energy in this country \nwe didn't think we had. A lot of that is right in our backyard. That is \nthe good news. The bad news is, we have had an administration that for \n3 years has been promoting policies that work against the goal of \nachieving more energy independence. That is the problem with the bill \nwe are currently discussing because that bill raises gasoline prices by \nraising taxes on oil production. Why in the world would we want to \nraise prices on gasoline at a time when America's economy is struggling \nto come out of recession? At a time when gasoline prices are rising \nthrough the supply-and-demand issues we have had, why in the world \nwould we want to do anything that would further increase the cost of \ngas at the pump?\n  The current Tax Code provides a number of targeted tax incentives for \nthe energy sector. It is important to note the vast majority of those \nsubsidies go to the so-called new wave of energy production, the \nrenewables, and only a small minority of those subsidies and credits go \nto producing the oil and gas that drives this economy. So eliminating \nonly those benefits that go to the production of needed oil and gas \nthat benefits our economy while at the same time extending the \nsubsidies and credits and support for renewables is not the direction \nwe need to go. This is not about producing more energy; it is about \ntargeting just one sector of our energy industry, which is oil--a \nfossil fuel energy source that is absolutely essential to our economy. \nIf we want to eliminate oil and gas subsidies, we ought to put all \nsubsidies for energy on the table.\n  Senator Wyden and I have coauthored a comprehensive tax reform bill, \nand in that bill we look at the idea proposed and suggested not only by \nthe Bowles-Simpson Commission but by others who have looked at this and \nwho have said we need to get on a level playing field. We are willing \nto make adjustments even in our own bill, if it is necessary, so we can \nlower tax rates on American companies and on the American people by \ngetting to a more level playing field.\n  We have all heard the President say we are doing all of the above or \nwe need to do all of the above in terms of an energy approach, and \nunblock American resources and put us back in the driver's seat of \nenergy production. The reality is, the administration's policies over \nthe last 3 years have been directed at only subsidizing a certain \nportion of the ``all of the above.''\n  Let me give a couple examples. President Obama has reduced the number \nof new offshore leases in half over the next 5 years. In terms of \ncurrent exploration and production, 97 percent of offshore areas are \nout of bounds, cannot drill, cannot explore.\n\n  Most recently, the President rejected the Keystone XL Pipeline, a \nprivately--privately, not publicly--funded project that would create \n20,000 jobs and deliver more than 800,000 barrels of oil per day from \nCanada.\n  Then, just last week, the President says we are going to improve the \npipeline from Cushing, Oklahoma down to Port Arthur, Texas but rejected \ndoing anything to bring the pipeline from the source of the oil down to \nthe point in Oklahoma where it would continue on. That is essentially \nakin to saying: We have goods we need to move. They are essential. They \nare essential to the running of this country and the economy and we \nneed to ship those from Chicago to New Orleans, but we are only going \nto build the road from Little Rock to New Orleans, and we will not have \nany other way of transporting it to get it to that particular point. So \nit makes no sense whatsoever.\n  We cannot have it both ways. We cannot tell the American people we \nsupport an ``all of the above'' energy plan and then undercut attempts \nto produce domestic energy sources. We cannot say we want to reduce \nAmerica's dependence on foreign oil and then block major parts of the \nKeystone Pipeline or tell political leaders in Brazil we want the \nUnited States to be one of their best customers. We cannot tell \nAmericans we are focused on job creation and then impose one \nunrealistic regulation after another that increase energy costs, \njeopardize jobs, and shut down plants across the country. But that is \nexactly what this administration is doing.\n  The Obama energy plan is to pay lip service to American energy \nproduction at the same time while enacting policies that limit our \nability to tap into domestic resources.\n  Our country faces an energy crisis. We have high unemployment. We \nhave troops putting themselves on the frontline to protect oil in the \nMiddle East. But we can change that. We can unlock American energy \nresources. We can put Americans back to work in doing so. We can \nprotect our troops and reduce our dependence on Middle East oil. We \nhave the ability, we have the innovation, and we have now, we know, the \nresources to lead the world in energy production. It is time for the \nPresident to support American energy production. That is the real ``all \nof the above'' energy plan.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I wish to discuss what everybody else is \ndiscussing these days--I say discussing or maybe even cussing--and that \nis gas prices and, more to the point, some unfortunate finger-pointing \nthat I think is going on in regards to our energy policies and why we \nsee the increase we are seeing at the gas pump and the role of \nspeculation in regards to the futures market and the energy environment \nwe are now living in that is so challenging.\n  I have the privilege of being the ranking member of the Agriculture \nCommittee, which has jurisdiction over the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, and I feel it is very important to address some of the \nclaims being made by a number of my friends--some across the aisle--\nthis week with regard to speculation in the commodities market.\n  From the rural farmer to the urban commuter, Americans everywhere \nare, obviously, deeply impacted by high gas prices. That is the biggest \nand most often negative sign we see when we drive anywhere: Whoops, we \nsee all of a sudden that the gas price has shot up 10 cents. \nUnfortunately, I do not think posturing or finger-pointing does \nanything to minimize the pain felt at the pumps.\n  Similar to the annual planting and harvesting seasons in Kansas, a \nyearly occurrence happens in Washington, DC, for certain Members of \nCongress to blame the commodity markets every time a particular \ncommodity reaches an uncomfortable price level. If we see a big price \njump, we, obviously, want to blame the commodity markets. It is easy to \ndo. We saw it in the 1970s when we had gas lines during the Carter \nadministration, the 1980s, the 1990s. It is the same old talking \npoints. We could have the speech in the file. Just pull out the file, \ncross out the date, and start making these points.\n  But let me talk about some economic facts, if I might. The populist \nrhetoric fails to acknowledge that everyone's money is the same color \nin the futures market. For every buyer, there is a seller and for every \nseller there is a buyer.\n  The historical problem for futures markets and the hedgers who use \nthem is, oftentimes, particularly in the deferred month contracts, \nthere is not the liquidity or an adequate number of market participants \nto take the other side of a trade to allow the hedgers to manage their \ndeferred price risk.\n  Market participants who actually provide this liquidity provide a \nvaluable tool that allows producers and\n\n[[Page S2135]]\n\nconsumers of products to lock in their inventories well in advance, \nwhich can lead to lower costs to producers and certainly better prices \nfor consumers.\n  If long speculation and the liquidity it provides is artificially \ndriven from the market, the potential short-term advantage of lower \nprices could lead to shortages in production, higher demand, and even \nhigher prices for both energy and agricultural commodities.\n  My point in this dissertation on futures markets 101 is to emphasize \nthat speculation is not manipulation. Speculation is trading to make a \nprofit from anticipated price changes--either higher or lower. \nManipulation, on the other hand, is intentionally acting to cause \nartificial price changes.\n  As explained by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the \nindependent regulatory arbiter of excessive speculation, speculation is \nexcessive when it causes any sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or \nunwarranted changes in the price of a commodity.\n  In fact, the CFTC currently has the authority to regulate against \nprice manipulation. So if we want to go to the people who are in charge \nto make sure there is not any manipulation, we already have the \nregulatory body and they are doing exactly that and it has had this \nauthority since its creation by Congress in 1974.\n\n  Furthermore, we have experts at the clearinghouses, at the National \nFutures Association, and at the CFTC whose job it is to watch these \nmarkets minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day, to assure everybody \nthat the discovery of prices between buyers and sellers is occurring \nopenly and transparently.\n  Yet when prices just so happen to move above what somebody in this \nbody might think is reasonable or an uncomfortable level, we have a \ntendency to blame the participants in the market rather than the \nmultitude of factors and economic variables these market participants \nreact to each minute the market is trading.\n  Let's examine some of these real factors that are affecting our \nenergy prices.\n  First off, there is tremendous increased demand outside the United \nStates; particularly, in Asia, China. It has caused the price of oil to \nrise rather dramatically. Even with the increased production in Canada, \nthe United States, and Brazil, declines in the North Sea, Mexico, \nSudan, and Libya have impacted the global supply.\n  Second, our U.S. refining capacity has decreased as a result of \nstricter environmental regulations, where they get their crude from. \nBoth have lowered the supply of gasoline enough to prop up prices. We \nsee reports in the press every day about one refinery making it big and \nother refineries are having a lot of difficulty.\n  Third, restricted domestic energy development on Federal lands has \ndisrupted our futures projections.\n  Fourth, fear over Iran's nuclear weapons ambitions is leading to \nincreased demand for gasoline, as people try to stock up in \nanticipation of any supply disruption that would be based on the \npossibility of a conflict in the Middle East.\n  Lastly, I would simply point out that blaming speculators ignores the \ninflationary aspects of the monetary policies of several central banks \naround the globe. It does not take a speculator to know that when the \nU.S. Treasury prints more money, it drives down the value of the dollar \nand drives up the price of raw materials and commodities, such as oil, \npriced in dollars. Yet despite these facts, we have too many who keep \nseeking a solution for a problem that simply isn't there.\n  What have the regulatory bodies found in their investigations as we \nlook for somebody to blame? There have already been studies and \ninvestigations into whether excessive speculation is manipulation and \nthey are manipulating prices. Let's take a look at what they found.\n  Last year, a Federal Trade Commission report on manipulation of gas \nprices determined that none of the complaints investigated violated any \nFTC rules.\n  A similar study by the CFTC stated that its preliminary analysis \n``does not support the proposition that speculative activity has \nsystematically driven changes in oil prices.''\n  Last but not least, the administration's own Financial Fraud \nEnforcement Task Force set out to investigate illegal speculation in \nthe energy markets. To date, it has found none.\n  The effects of high gas prices on our economic growth and on each \nindividual business and family are certainly well understood. We should \nbe finding effective solutions to fix a failed Federal energy policy \nrather than trying to place the blame where it does not exist.\n  These solutions do not stop at increased domestic oil and gas \nproduction. They include implementation of workable environmental \nregulations. Unfortunately, the multitude of regulations under this \nadministration is anything but workable.\n  They are like a Katrina flooding virtually every part of the economic \nsector. That is all I hear about when I go home to Kansas. There are a \nlot of things that are on people's minds, but regulation is No. 1, and \nI don't care what sector of the economy we are talking about. There is \na very real fear in my State that the new clean air regulations we are \nhearing about targeting coal-fired powerplants could disrupt our power \ngrid. In a State that relies on coal for 75 percent of our power, this \nis simply unacceptable.\n  Yes, let's continue moving toward cleaner forms of energy--certainly \nwe want to do that--but in a way that will not compromise the ability \nfor Kansans or any citizen of any State to access affordable energy. \nThis includes impending Federal regulations on hydraulic fracturing, \nwhich will continue to play a huge role in my State's energy economy.\n  In closing, on a larger topic of domestic energy companies, I think \nit is unfortunate for elected officials to come to the floor--or for \nthat matter make a speech anywhere--and single out specific industries \nor private U.S. citizens, for that matter, that employ millions of \nAmericans and blame them for our energy woes. I think we are better \nthan that.\n  Let's remember that attacking their profits is an easy target. It is \nnot going to hurt the few top-level executives at these companies, but \nit will hurt middle-income Americans and retirees who make up over 90 \npercent of the ownership of so-called Big Oil or so-called big \nanything, and rely on their IRAs, pension funds, and mutual funds for \ntheir very livelihood. These are not privately held companies, so let's \nremember who actually owns the companies. It is our constituents, that \nis who it is.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nunder the control of the majority be divided as follows: Mr. Schumer \nfor 10 minutes, Mr. Cardin for 10 minutes, Mr. Sanders for 10 minutes, \nMr. Levin for 10 minutes, Mr. Reed of Rhode Island for 10 minutes, and \nMr. Merkley for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nlegislation authored by my good friend from New Jersey, Senator \nMenendez. But before I do, I want to call attention to the highway bill \nand its holdup by our colleagues in the House.\n  Once again, we are facing the specter of an unnecessary shutdown \ncaused by intransigence in the House Republican caucus, and time is \nticking away. Should we reach the March 31 deadline without passing a \nbill, States' contract authority for construction projects will cease, \nand 2.9 million jobs will be put at grave risk.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. Speaker Boehner has once again been \npainted into a corner by the extreme wing of his caucus, which is \ncommitted to blocking a responsible highway bill at every turn. It has \nbecome clear Speaker Boehner has run out of options. He has tried to \npass a highly partisan House-drafted highway bill, and that failed. He \nhas tried to pass a 90-day extension on Monday, and that failed. He \nthen tried to pass a 60-day extension on Tuesday, and that failed as \nwell. Now we have learned the House will not\n\n[[Page S2136]]\n\nvote on any type of extension today either.\n  Time is running out. Speaker Boehner simply cannot pass a \ntransportation bill of any length without Democratic votes, and it is \ntime he accepts that.\n  Fortunately, Mr. President, there is an easy way out that already has \na stamp of approval from some of the most conservative Republicans in \nCongress. The House could pass the Senate bill. If Speaker Boehner put \nthe Senate bill on the floor, there is virtually no question it would \npass by a large majority.\n  You know, this is beginning to look a bit like a replay of the \npayroll tax cut episode. Just like then, the Senate passed a bipartisan \nbill by an overwhelming majority. Just like then, the Speaker \noriginally said he would act based on the Senate compromise, but then \nwent back on what he said. Just like then, with the deadline looming, \nthe Speaker is unable to pass an alternative measure and is resorting \nto asking the Senate for a conference.\n  We all know how the payroll tax cut saga ended. Republicans started \nturning on the Speaker and asking him to pass the Senate bill. Now that \nis happening here too. Earlier this week, three House Republicans from \nmainstream Republican districts--Congress Members Dold, Biggert, and \nBass--joined the growing calls for Speaker Boehner to put the Senate's \n2-year highway bill on the floor. These are major cracks in the dam, \nand we believe it is the start of a trend.\n  Earlier today my friend from New York, Pete King, also said he would \nsupport the Senate bill if the Speaker put it to a vote. Now, that \ndoesn't come as a surprise, as Congressman King is a strong fighter of \nNew York's transportation needs, including mass transit, which are \nprotected in the Senate bill.\n  The Senate bill is about two dozen publicly declared Republicans away \nfrom having the votes to pass. We believe we have those two dozen \nRepublicans in the House and more. They may not be publicly declared, \nbut they are there. The Senate's 2-year bill can be a lifeboat for \nSpeaker Boehner. He should take it before it is too late.\n  As we speak about the highway bill over in the House, in the Senate \nDemocrats are hard at work taking on Senator Menendez's fine \nlegislation. He was prescient to focus on this idea years ago, and I am \nglad this bill has come to the floor. I look forward to a debate on the \nissue.\n  In the last election, voters gave those of us who have the privilege \nof serving in this Chamber two distinct mandates. They told us to do \ntwo things at once: First, and perhaps foremost, make the economy grow. \nCreate good-paying jobs. Make sure the American dream burns brightly--\nthe dream that says to the average middle-class family: The odds are \npretty good if you work hard you will be doing better 10 years from now \nthan you are doing today, and the odds are very good your kids will do \nbetter than you.\n  For that dream, which has burned so brightly in this country for \nhundreds of years, the candle began to flicker a little in this decade. \nMedian income actually went down even before the recession, which meant \neven if people had a job--and we know there are millions out of work \ndespite the fact they look hard for jobs--their income was declining. \nBuying power was declining for the average person. That is difficult. \nEven people who do have work have a difficult time when they sit down \nat that dinner table Friday night after dinner trying to figure out how \nthey are going to pay the bills. The costs and needs keep going up, and \neven when they have a job the income doesn't seem to keep up.\n  So we first think of the people we have met who are struggling \nbecause they don't have jobs, and then we look at the people lucky \nenough to have jobs who are still having a difficult time making ends \nmeet. We know this Congress must focus like a laser on jobs, the \neconomy, and the middle class. So this is one obligation voters sent to \nus, and it is a justified one. Secondly, they said, in no uncertain \nterms, to rein in that Federal deficit--rein it in. They are right.\n  So that brings us to today, where we are fighting to grow the economy \nthrough projects such as those in the highway bill, which will bring \ngood-paying jobs to communities across the country, and we try to rein \nin this out-of-control deficit by passing the Big Oil Tax Subsidies \nAct. It would be hard enough to accomplish one of these goals, but we \nare trying to do both.\n  We can do it because this choice is simple. It is obvious that at \nthis time, when there are so many needs, that giving oil companies the \nkind of tax breaks we do makes no sense at all. Getting rid of these \ncorporate subsidies to Big Oil is a no-brainer. At the time these \nsubsidies were passed decades ago, oil was $17 a barrel and there was a \nworry there wouldn't be enough production. Maybe it made sense in those \ndays to give oil companies an incentive to explore and produce. But \nwith oil hovering at $100 a barrel, and Big Oil reaping record profits, \nthis outdated subsidy makes no sense. Yet it remains on the books, \namazingly enough.\n  It defies logic for this government to spend billions of dollars in \ntax giveaways to Big Oil; for taxpayers to give dollars out of their \npockets every year when they are struggling and Big Oil is making \nrecord profits. Believe me, the free market gives the oil companies \nenough of an incentive to produce. When oil is $100 a barrel, they do \nnot need an extra subsidy from the government to produce. They are \ngoing to produce every bit of oil they can. They make huge profits, so \nthey do not need a financial nudge from Washington. At the same time, \nmiddle-class Americans get hit with a double whammy. They are paying \n$70 or more to fill up their gas tanks and then some of their hard-\nearned dollars are being used to line Big Oil's pockets.\n\n  Economists estimate the typical family will pay almost $1,000 more on \ngasoline this year than last year. But families in my home State of New \nYork and across the country are still struggling to make ends meet. As \nthe economy slowly recovers, they cannot afford to get gouged at the \npump.\n  With billions of dollars worth of tax subsidies, and gas prices at \nnear record highs, it is no wonder the top five oil companies are on \ntrack for another record-breaking year. These companies are not only \nthe most profitable businesses in the United States, they are among the \nmost profitable in the world. In the past decade, they took home $1 \ntrillion--not $1 billion, $1 trillion--in profits.\n  Now, there is nothing wrong with profits in and of themselves. In \nAmerica, we celebrate success. We want the private sector to survive \nand thrive. But at a time when the government is looking to tighten its \nbelt, and we are grappling with painful cuts because we have the dual \ngoal of growing the middle class and also reducing the deficit, it \nboggles the mind that we would continue to subsidize such a lavish \nindustry.\n  I have watched my colleagues on the other side of the aisle stand \nidly by while the type of funding that helps our middle class is \nthreatened. Now they are going to choose these subsidies to Big Oil \nover money to help kids pay for college, over cancer research, over \nhelping our veterans, over keeping our highways and transit systems \nreliable. Hardly any American would agree with that. Hardly any \nAmerican--Democrat, Republican, Liberal, Moderate, Conservative--from \nthe Northeast, South, or West would agree.\n  Try to wrap your head around that. Big Oil is reporting record \nprofits, gas prices are at an all-time high, and we, the American \ntaxpayers, are still subsidizing the oil industry. We don't need the \nimagination of Lewis Carroll to come up with a more ridiculous \nscenario. That is why I strongly support and am proud to cosponsor \nSenator Menendez's Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act.\n  If our Republican colleagues are serious about deficit reduction, the \nMenendez bill is the chance to show it. There is no good reason not to \nsupport this sensible legislation.\n  In fact, Speaker Boehner himself has said as much. Let's not forget, \nhe was in favor of repealing oil subsidies before he was against it.\n  So the bottom line is this: At a time of sky-high oil prices, it is \nunfathomable to continue to pad the profits of oil companies with \ntaxpayer-funded subsidies. The time to repeal these giveaways is now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2137]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to concur with Senator Schumer \nabout his comments on the passage of Senator Menendez's legislation, S. \n2204. This legislation is very important for America's energy needs, \nand I urge my colleagues to allow us to take up this legislation and \nlet's act on it and let's move it to the other body.\n  There is one commodity just about everyone knows the price of: a \ngallon of gasoline. People will have a rough idea what a gallon of milk \nor a dozens eggs or a loaf of bread costs, but they will know to the \npenny what a gallon of gasoline costs. The price is rising, and people \nare understandably upset. They are upset because it costs more to fill \nup at the pump. But they are also upset because crude oil and gasoline \nprice increases affect the price of every other commodity--including \nmilk, eggs, and bread--that has to be transported from where it is \nproduced to where it is consumed. Petroleum is a feedstock used in the \nproduction, not just transportation, of so many critical products, \nincluding fertilizer.\n  According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, EIA, the \nretail price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline was 27 cents \nhigher for the week ending March 5, 2012 than it was a year ago. EIA \nreports that vehicle fueling costs for the average U.S. household will \nbe about $238 higher in 2012 than 2011.\n  According to EIA, the price of gasoline has increased dramatically \nevery year--in 2011, higher than 2010, and 2012 is projected to be \nhigher than 2011. This price increase is occurring despite the fact \nthat the United States has stepped up its crude oil production \nconsiderably over the past 4 years by 1.3 million barrels per day. \nProduction is at an 8-year high. The United States is the third largest \nproducer of oil, behind the Saudis and Russia, and domestic oil \nconsumption is at a 15-year low. Americans are driving 35 billion fewer \nmiles today than they did in 2010.\n  If we were producing more and consuming less, then why are prices \ngoing up? Supply and demand would tell us that they should be going \ndown. The answer is straightforward: Crude oil and all of the products \nderived from it, including gasoline, are fungible commodities traded on \nworld markets. Increasing global demand for these commodities is \nputting a relentless upward pressure on prices.\n  Growing demand for oil in developing countries has reshaped the \nglobal market. Developing nations now consume 47 percent of the world's \noil. In 1970, it was 25 percent. The number of cars in the world \nexceeded 1 billion for the first time in 2010, with one-half of the \nglobal growth occurring in China. Beijing adds 1,500 new cars every \nday.\n  Another reason for price increases is market uncertainty over crude \noil supplies. Much of the world's crude oil is produced in the Middle \nEast and North Africa, regions plagued with turmoil. Right now, the \nUnited States accounts for about 9 to 11 percent of the world's crude \noil production. This is despite the fact that we have less than 2 \npercent of the world's total proven oil reserves. We have 2 percent of \nthe world's reserves and we are producing 9 to 11 percent. We are, in \nfact, drilling here and drilling now, with more oil rigs in operation \nthan the rest of the world combined, according to the Baker-Hughes rig \ncount.\n  According to economist Steve Baker at the Center for Economic and \nPolicy Research, even if U.S. production could be increased by one-\nthird overnight, that would increase world supply by 3 percent which \nwould lower the price of oil by 7 to 8 percent. As Baker notes:\n\n       This is not trivial, but it is not the difference between \n     $2 a gallon gas and $4 a gallon gas.\n\n  T. Boone Pickens said it best:\n\n       I've been an oil man all my life, but this is one emergency \n     we can't drill our way out of.\n\n  A recent Associated Press fact check analysis found that there is no \ncorrelation between domestic oil production and the price at the pump. \nI am for reasonable oil production. We need as much as we can get in a \nreasonable manner. As reported in the Washington Post of March 28:\n\n       A statistical analysis of 36 years of monthly, inflation-\n     adjusted gasoline prices and U.S. domestic oil production by \n     The Associated Press shows no statistical correlation between \n     how much oil comes out of U.S. wells and the price at the \n     pump . . . More oil production in the United States does not \n     mean consistently lower prices at the pump . . . U.S. oil \n     production is back to the same level it was on March 2003, \n     when gas cost $2.10 a gallon when adjusted for inflation. But \n     that's not what prices are now. That's because oil is a \n     global commodity and U.S. production has only a tiny \n     influence on supply . . . Factors far beyond the control of a \n     nation or a president dictate the price of gasoline.\n\n  The United States is incapable of having a significant impact on \nworld crude oil and gasoline prices from the supply side of the \nequation, but domestic oil production does play an important role in \nbolstering our energy and economic security. We should produce where we \ncan, in a safe and environmentally sensitive manner.\n  While increasing domestic production and decreasing domestic demand \nmay not be lowering world prices, it does have a significant effect on \nimports. Our dependence on foreign oil is at its lowest level in 16 \nyears. As a share of total consumption, oil imports declined from \nnearly 60 percent in 2005 to 45 percent last year, the lowest level \nsince 1995. And nearly one-half of our imports come from the Western \nHemisphere nations such as Canada and Mexico, while the Persian Gulf \ncountries account for only 18 percent of our net imports.\n  The biggest impact the United States could have on oil and gasoline \nprices is not on the supply side, it is on the demand side. We account \nfor close to 25 percent of the world's petroleum consumption, even \nthough we account for less than 5 percent of the world's population. \nThe best way to continue reducing our demand for crude oil and gasoline \nwould be to: Promote fuel efficiency with higher CAFE standards. We \nhave made progress. We are doing better. We know we can do better than \nour current standards; Replace conventional fleet fuels with \nalternative fuels such as propane, natural gas, and biofuels. That will \nhelp us consume less oil; Electrify transportation, focusing on hybrid \nand plug-in electric technologies. Here you get jobs in the United \nStates helping our economy as well as helping our energy security; \nBoosting transit ridership by increasing funding for the Federal \nTransit Administration. People don't like to be stuck in traffic jams. \nLet's have a modern transit system that can help move our people;\n\n  Eliminating the tax expenditures that benefit Big Oil could generate \nover $20 billion over the next 10 years. This is the bill we are \ntalking about, S. 2204, the Menendez bill. It takes the revenues we are \ngiving to the oil industry and uses them to help pay for these green \nenergy measures. This makes a lot of sense. It will hardly be noticed \nby the big five oil companies--BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, \nor Shell. They made record profits in 2011, $137 billion. I talked \nabout $20 billion over 10 years. They made $137 billion in 1 year. That \nwas up 75 percent from 2010. From 2001 through the last year, Big Oil \nhas made more than $1 trillion in profits. Every penny increase in the \npump increases their profit by another $200 million. So as we are \nsuffering with prices going up, the big oil companies are making more \nand we are still giving them the subsidies, where we could be using \nthose subsidies to help America develop alternative energy sources.\n  Big Oil has been getting big subsidies for 100 years. It is time to \nuse that money for developing alternatives to oil. That is the best and \nmost sustainable way to address the high cost of gasoline at the pump. \nS. 2204 will help us bring down the cost at the pump. It is good for \nour economy, good for our environment, and good for our national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the skyrocketing price of gasoline is \nclearly causing tremendous hardship to American families all across \nthis country, to small businesses to truckers to airlines and, in fact, \nto the entire economy. We are trying to claw our way out of this \nhorrendous recession and\n\n[[Page S2138]]\n\nthe high price of oil and gas is not helping us.\n  I come from a rural State, and it is a State where people often drive \n30, 40, 50 miles to work and back home again. Many of these workers \nmake $10, $12, $14 an hour and when the price of gas goes up to $4 a \ngallon, this is money that is coming right out of their paychecks and \nit is money they can ill afford to pay. Many of them have seen \nstagnation in wages, and these high gas prices are doing their families \nsevere harm.\n  Further, I think the American people understand that our good friends \nat the oil companies continue to do phenomenally well in terms of the \nprofits they are making. In the last decade, the major oil companies in \nthis country have earned $1 trillion in profits while gas prices have \nsoared.\n  The Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act we are debating today is a step \nin the right direction. This legislation would repeal more than $20 \nbillion in tax breaks to the big five oil companies, and use roughly \nhalf of this money to extend renewable energy tax credits and use the \nother half for deficit reduction. Over the past decades, our friends at \nExxonMobil, among others, have seen more profits in ExxonMobil in a \ngiven year than any other corporation in the history of the world. \nMeanwhile, many of the largest oil companies over the years have paid \nlittle or no Federal income taxes. Let me give you an example.\n  In 2009, ExxonMobil--again, which has made more profit on a given \nyear than any corporation in history. In 2009, ExxonMobil made $19 \nbillion in profits while receiving a $156 million refund check from the \nIRS. How is that? A pretty good deal? It made $19 billion in profits, \ndid not pay any Federal income taxes, and yet received a $156 million \nrefund check from the IRS. Chevron received a $19 million refund from \nthe IRS after it made $10 billion in profits in 2009. Not a bad deal. \nIn 2009, Valero Energy, the 25th largest company in America, with $68 \nbillion in sales, received a $157 million tax refund from the IRS. \nConocoPhillips, the fifth largest oil company in the United States, \nmade $16 billion in profits from 2007 to 2009 but received $451 million \nin tax breaks through the oil and gas manufacturing deduction.\n  At a time when the American people are getting ripped off at the gas \npump, the last thing we need to be doing is giving big oil companies \nmassive tax breaks which only add to our deficit and national debt \ncrisis.\n  In my view, we have to do more than simply end these outrageous tax \nbreaks that Big Oil has enjoyed. In my view, we must also end excessive \noil speculation on the oil futures market. There has been a major \ndebate over the last several years as to whether spikes in oil prices \nwere caused entirely by the fundamentals of supply and demand or \nwhether excessive speculation in the oil futures market is playing a \nmajor role.\n  That debate is over. That debate should be put to rest. Let's simply \nlook at the facts. When we were in elementary school and in high school \nwe learned what supply and demand is all about. When supply is high and \ndemand is low, prices go down. When demand is high and supply is low, \nprices go up. The reality is, today the supply of oil and gasoline is \nhigher right now than it was 3 years ago when the national average \nprice for a gallon of gas was just $1.96 a gallon--more supply than 3 \nyears ago when gas was $1.96 a gallon.\n  In terms of demand, the demand for oil in the United States today is \nat its lowest level since 1997. Internationally, during the last \nquarter of 2011, world oil supply exceeded demand by nearly 2 to 1, \nwhile at the same time crude oil prices increased by over 12 percent.\n  Let me recapitulate: Supply is high, demand is low. Yet oil prices \nare going through the roof. What is happening? There is a growing \nconsensus within the business community, among economists, among people \nwho study this issue, that the reason oil prices are soaring is \nexcessive speculation on the oil futures market. That is the cause.\n  ExxonMobil, Goldman Sachs, the IMF, the St. Louis Federal Reserve, \nthe Saudi Arabian Government, the American Trucking Association, Delta \nAirlines, the Petroleum Marketers Association of America, the Consumer \nFederation of America--all of these groups are involved in one way or \nanother in studying oil prices. That is what they do because many of \nthem are affected by high oil prices. Others of them are consumer \ngroups studying the impact of high oil prices. All of them have agreed \nthat excessive oil speculation significantly increases oil and gas \nprices. That is the conclusion more and more observers are making.\n  Interestingly enough, Goldman Sachs, perhaps the largest Wall Street \nspeculator on the oil futures market, recently came out with a report \nindicating that excessive oil speculation is costing Americans 56 cents \na gallon at the pump. This is the conclusion of Goldman Sachs, perhaps \nthe largest speculator on the oil futures market.\n  I personally believe and many others believe that number is low, but \nit is important to understand we now have a major speculator telling us \nwhat excessive speculation is doing, in terms of gas prices.\n  Last year the CEO of ExxonMobil--not one of my best friends, not a \ncompany I particularly trust--ExxonMobil's President last year \ntestified at a Senate hearing that excessive speculation on the oil \nfutures market contributed as much as 40 percent to the cost of a \nbarrel of oil. In fact, Bloomberg News reported on March 26, 2012, \nthat:\n\n       According to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data, \n     bets on rising gasoline prices advanced for 11 weeks through \n     March 6 to the highest level in records dating back to 2006.\n\n  Gary Gensler, the chairman of the CFTC, has stated publicly that oil \nspeculators now control over 80 percent of the energy futures market, a \nfigure that has more than doubled over the last decade. In other words, \nthe vast majority of oil on the oil futures market is not controlled by \npeople who actually use the product. It is not controlled by airlines \nor trucking companies or fuel dealers--people who actually use the \nproduct. But over 80 percent of the oil futures market is controlled by \nspeculators whose only function in life is to make as much profit as \nthey can by buying and selling oil futures.\n  Let me list a few of the oil speculators and how much oil they were \ntrading on June 30, 2008, when the price of oil was over $140 a barrel \nand gas prices were over $4 a gallon. On that day, Goldman Sachs bought \nand sold over 863 million barrels of oil. Morgan Stanley bought and \nsold over 632 million barrels of oil. Bank of America bought and sold \nover 100 million barrels of oil. The only reason these companies were \non the oil futures market was to make as much profit as possible. They \ndo not use the end product.\n  We have to make sure the price of oil and gas is based on the \nfundamentals of supply and demand and not Wall Street greed. To correct \nthis problem I have introduced S. 2222 with Senators Blumenthal, \nFeinstein, Tester, McCaskill, Klobuchar, Levin, Franken, Sherrod Brown, \nCardin, Mikulski, Casey, Bill Nelson, Begich, and Pryor.\n  This legislation--which I have also filed as an amendment to this \nbill--requires the CFTC to use all of its authority, including its \nemergency powers, to eliminate excessive oil speculation.\n  I should point out this emergency directive in our bill is \nidentical--I want my Republican colleagues to hear this--is identical \nto bipartisan legislation that overwhelmingly passed the House of \nRepresentatives in 2008 by a vote of 402 to 19, with significant large-\nscale Republican support.\n  The Dodd-Frank financial reform bill stipulated very clearly that the \nCFTC needed to eliminate, prevent, or diminish excessive oil \nspeculation by January 17, 2011, 14 months ago. They have not done it. \nThe CFTC has not obeyed the law, and it is time for Congress to tell \nthem their breaking the law is not acceptable and what they have to do \nis, in fact, to defend the consumers of this country.\n  In my view, what this legislation would accomplish is immediately \ncurbing the role of excessive speculation in any contract market within \nthe jurisdiction and control of the Commodities Future Trading \nCommission on or through which energy futures are trading--that is what \nthis amendment does. It also eliminates excessive speculation, price \ndistortion, sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes \nin prices or other unlawful activity that is causing major market \ndisturbances that prevent the market\n\n[[Page S2139]]\n\nfrom accurately reflecting the forces of supply and demand for energy \ncommodities.\n  The bottom line is Congress has to tell the CFTC to obey the law. \nThey have to use their emergency powers to end excessive oil \nspeculation. When we do that, I believe we will see oil prices go down.\n  I ask for bipartisan support of my legislation and thank all the \ncosponsors who are already on the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me thank Senator Sanders for his \nleadership in this area of excessive speculation. I am going to have a \nword to say about that in a few minutes. Before he leaves the floor, \nlet me say he has taken a major role in trying to get the CFTC to carry \nout what the law requires that they do, which is to consider excessive \nspeculation and to put a lid on it. They are authorized to do it \nwithout any doubt. That was our intention, and they should get about \nit.\n  The bill we are considering would end an egregious example of \ncorporate welfare. Hopefully, we are going to be allowed to be on this \nbill and be able to defeat a filibuster and vote for cloture sometime, \nI understand, tomorrow.\n  At a time when some argue the Federal debt is so out of whack that we \nneed to cut funding for programs to provide food to hungry children or \nhealth care to our seniors, surely we ought to be able to agree the \nmost profitable corporations in the country no longer need these \nenormous subsidies, but here we are. Those oil and gas subsidies have \nnot reduced the price of oil or gas; that is obvious.\n  The price of gas is complex. I have said many times before, and I \nwill say it again now, the huge increase in speculation plays an \nimportant role in the price, the high price of gas. The Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, has spent years \nexamining these issues, and the evidence is compelling and overwhelming \nthat financial speculators have played a huge role in driving up gas \nprices at the same time supply and demand has not significantly \nchanged.\n  To the extent supply and demand has changed, supply is up and demand \nis down. So if market forces were really in control, the price of gas \nwould be going down, not up. Some estimate that as much as 50 cents on \nthe price of every gallon of gas is the result of excessive \nspeculation, and another huge portion of the price is simply the wide \nprofit margin for the oil and gas companies.\n  I agree with my colleagues that we must do what we can to ensure that \ngas prices do not swing wildly and that they do not pull precious \nresources out of the all-too-tight budgets of American families. But I \nthink we have to focus on some of the true causes for the rapid rise \nand the swings in gas prices and not hide behind unfounded assertions \nthat taking away corporate welfare from an already incredibly \nprofitable handful of companies will somehow or other drive up gas \nprices.\n  Study after study and expert after expert have told us that removing \nthese subsidies will have no impact on those prices. For instance, \nSeverin Borenstein, codirector of the University of California \nBerkeley's Center for the Study of Energy Markets, has said ``the \nincremental change in production that might result from changing oil \nsubsidies will have no impact on . . . gasoline prices.''\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has concluded that \nremoving these subsidies would not impact gas prices because ``prices \nare well in excess of costs and a small increase in taxes would be \nunlikely to reduce oil output.''\n  No, ending these subsidies is not going to impact the price of gas, \nbut maintaining these subsidies does impact taxpayers. These subsidies \ntake money from the vast majority of taxpayers to simply add to the \nalready astronomical corporate profits of oil and gas companies. Just \nfive companies last year reported a profit of $137 billion. Over the \npast 10 years, the profits of just these five companies have totaled \nnearly $1 trillion. That is trillion with a ``t.'' These astronomical \nnumbers can only be thought of in connection with the only other number \nof that size, which is similar, and that is the Federal \nbudget. Congress will soon enact deficit reduction of at least $1.2 \ntrillion or our Nation and our economy will be facing sequestration, \nfacing the slashing of programs that impact nearly every American. That \n$1.2 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade is about the \nsame amount as the expected profits for just five oil and gas \ncompanies. These companies, which are reporting record profits while \npaying record-low rates of taxes, should be paying their fair share to \nhelp get and keep our economy strong.\n\n  While some complain that the United States has such an egregiously \nhigh corporate tax rate that companies fail to invest here, the facts \nshow just the opposite. Just a short time ago, the Congressional Budget \nOffice released a report that corporations paid an effective tax rate \nof just 12.1 percent last year, which was the lowest percentage in \ndecades. Corporations pay extremely low taxes in the United States, and \nthose rates have been steadily declining. Corporate taxes now make up a \nrecord-low percentage of all Federal revenues.\n  The oil and gas subsidies should be cut, and the savings should be \nused to pay for our Nation's other priorities. That is why I introduced \nan amendment last year that would have cut just one of these oil and \ngas subsidies. By eliminating these unnecessary oil and gas incentives \nand adopting the bill before us, we would be able to preserve or \nreauthorize a series of other energy tax incentives and grant programs, \nsome of which have expired and others are in danger of expiring, all of \nwhich would help promote American energy efficiency and self-\nsufficiency. Extending these provisions will help lower energy costs \nfor businesses and families, would help diversify our energy strategy \nbeyond oil, and would reduce the dependence on imported oil that \nundermines our economy and threatens our national security.\n  Among these important tax provisions is section 45, the production \ntax credit for electricity produced by wind and other renewable \nsources; the section 1603 program to encourage the installation of \nenergy equipment; the section 48C advanced energy manufacturing credit \nthat promotes American production of the items used in renewable energy \nproduction, such as wind turbines and advanced batteries; the \ncellulosic ethanol credit to encourage production of fuel through \nrenewable feedstocks; and the tax credit for refueling infrastructure \nthat helps to encourage installation of alternative-fuel infrastructure \nand electric charging stations in homes and in businesses.\n  These and other energy provisions, which are in our bill, are vital \ntools in our battle to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, to \nsubstitute alternatives for fossil fuel, and to promote and sustain \ndomestic manufacturing. Energy is a huge cost for businesses in nearly \nevery field. If we can improve energy efficiency, we can lower costs \nand increase competitiveness. Rest assured that our competitors around \nthe globe are doing that, and we need to do the same or risk falling \nbehind.\n  Energy efficiency is also vital to national security since our \ndependence on foreign oil from volatile regions of the globe is an \nenormous complication to our foreign policy. It leaves our economy \nvulnerable to actions by unfriendly nations such as Iran. The more we \ncan loosen the grip imported fossil fuels have on our economy, the more \nprosperous and secure we will be.\n  Rarely is the choice as stark as it is before us. We can continue \ncorporate welfare for the oil and gas industry, which does nothing but \nadd to those companies' corporate profits and the Nation's deficit, or \nwe can end these subsidies and push for the priorities that will help \nensure our energy future and reduce our deficits.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to join many of my colleagues in \nsupport of the efforts to stop wasting taxpayer money subsidizing oil \nexecutives' huge profits. We need to end these wasteful handouts, \nreduce the deficit, and develop clean energy solutions.\n  While the oil industry is thriving, making $137 billion--that is \nbillion with a ``b''--in profits last year, Rhode Islanders are paying \nnearly $3.90 per gallon at the pump. Working families are being are \nforced to cut back because of high gas prices. In turn, big oil \ncompanies should have their wasteful\n\n[[Page S2140]]\n\ntax subsidies eliminated. We should be working to fuel the U.S. \neconomy, not the oil cartels and big oil companies. That is why I am a \nproud cosponsor of the Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act, which would \nput a stop to these wasteful tax breaks and use the savings to invest \nin clean energy technologies that will create jobs, save money for \nmiddle-class families, and increase America's competitiveness in the \nglobal clean energy economy.\n  Addressing gas prices and reducing our dependence on oil requires a \nsmart, balanced, and responsible national energy policy. There are no \nsilver bullets, but there are both short-term and long-term steps we \nshould take.\n  In the near term, we have to be ready to respond to geopolitical \nevents by making it clear that we are prepared to release oil from the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve if such a measure is necessary because of \ngeopolitical developments.\n  We need to continue efforts to prevent excessive speculation and \nspeculators from manipulating the market and needlessly inflating \nenergy prices. And I have asked the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission--effectively our cop on the beat--to do that and have sought \nto provide them with the tools and funding to achieve this objective.\n  We also need to continue investments in smart growth policies to \npromote mass transit in next-generation vehicles and alternative \nenergy. That is why I have fought for things such as better fuel \nmileage for cars and smart investments in mass transit. Improved energy \nefficiency and developing clean energy technologies will help cut our \noil addiction.\n  Working with President Obama, we successfully persuaded automakers to \ndouble the fuel efficiency of cars and light trucks. After staying the \nsame for over 20 years, under the Obama administration the average fuel \neconomy of vehicles will be 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016. And the \nadministration has proposed to further increase the standards to 54.5 \nmiles per gallon by 2025. Combined, by the year 2025, these standards \nwould save 2.2 million barrels of oil a day and save consumers at the \npump an estimated $8,000 over the lifetime of a vehicle. These new \nstandards will reduce the impact of future price hikes by weaning us \noff oil.\n  In addition to protecting their unnecessary subsidies, the oil \nindustry continues to push increased drilling as a solution to reducing \ngas prices. I support safe and responsible oil production, and the \nadministration's efforts to decrease our reliance on foreign oil. U.S. \ndomestic oil production has reached its highest level since 2003. The \nnumber of oil rigs in the United States has more than quadrupled in the \nlast 3 years, and U.S. dependence on foreign oil is at its lowest level \nin 16 years. Indeed, net imports as a share of total consumption \ndeclined from nearly 60 percent in 2005 to 45 percent in 2011.\n  When oil companies tap into resources on Federal property, the \ntaxpayers must be fairly compensated and assured it is done safely and \nresponsibly. Therefore, the oil companies should pay their fair share \nof drilling royalties and inspection fees to make sure what they do is \ndone right. As chairman of the Interior and Environment Subcommittee of \nthe Appropriations Committee, I worked to secure an increase in the \ninspection fees for offshore drilling last year, and will push for the \nsame for onshore drilling this year.\n  For all the sloganeering about domestic drilling, we know we can't \ndrill our way out of this problem. Even the oil companies admit that \nthe biggest factor in the price of gasoline is the cost of crude oil, \nwhich is set in the world market. It is not pegged to U.S. production. \nIn fact, an Associated Press analysis of 36 years of Energy Information \nAdministration data shows ``no statistical correlation''--their words--\nbetween domestic oil production and gas prices.\n  Again, we need a balanced, well-thought-out national energy policy, \none that will help reduce our dependence on oil and the amount paid at \nthe pump. What we should not be doing is continuing to give away \nbillions in corporate welfare to Big Oil while middle-class families \nsee their gas prices rise. It simply is not fair. The oil companies \nthat soak up these subsidies are effectively charging taxpayers twice \nfor the same gallon of gasoline.\n  Mr. President, middle-class families are struggling. Oil companies \nare not.\n  I urge my colleagues to repeal these oil subsidies, make clean energy \ninvestments in America, and take commonsense steps to get our fiscal \nhouse in order. I urge passage of this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nabout 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this is a tough time for Americans. We \nall know families are sitting around at their kitchen tables struggling \nto figure out how to make ends meet, but those tough times have not \nextended to the boardrooms of the five big oil companies.\n  In 2011 alone, those companies saw more than $100 billion in \nprofits--a sum that is difficult to get your hands around. It is \ndifficult to understand what $1 billion is, let alone $100 billion, not \nin revenue but in profits. Exxon is sitting on $8 billion that it has \nnot reinvested. Shell is sitting on $13 billion cash in hand. The five \nlargest companies together--BP, Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and \nShell--have cash resources of $59 billion and have made nearly $1 \ntrillion in profits over the last decade.\n  Meanwhile, the American taxpayers are not only being forced to hand \nover larger and larger portions of their paychecks at the pump, they \nare also being asked to have a share of their taxes go to additional \nsubsidies to these large companies. Let me restate that. When you go to \nthe pump and pay $4 or more, the oil companies make a tremendous \nprofit. There is nothing wrong with making a profit in America, but \nwhat seems wrong is that these same companies are then coming to these \nhallowed Halls and saying: We want a handout from the general fund.\n  Those companies know there are many other pressing needs in America. \nIndeed, there are many folks who are hungry across our Nation. There \nare many families who are hoping but cannot save enough money to send \ntheir kids to college. Many families who are pressed by the loss of our \nmanufacturing jobs, our middle-class, living-wage jobs, who are \nproviding for their families on service jobs are having a tough time \nmeeting the mortgage.\n  Families are struggling, and certainly they would like to see this \nbody say that we understand the challenges so many face. We understand \nthat the cost of tuition for their children is way outpacing inflation, \nand they are worried about the possibility of their children not having \nthe full opportunities that should be available within our society. \nThey are worried about keeping their homes. They are worried about \nfinding that next job if their current job goes away. But they are \nwondering why we aren't helping with those problems with these funds \ninstead of giving these funds away to the oil companies. The only \nexplanation they can come up with is that the oil companies are very \npowerful; they can come here and talk to this Chamber and say: You \nknow, we just want more. It is more important for us to add to the \nbillions we have in the bank than it is to have basic nutrition \nprograms expanded in this country. It is more important for taxpayers \nto give us money to add to the money we have in the bank than to \naddress the desperate infrastructure funds that are needed around our \nNation. It is more important that they give us a handout rather than \ngive a hand up to struggling families in this Nation.\n  Well, I disagree. I think it is more important to help our families. \nI think it is more important to help our children. I think it is more \nimportant to build our fiscal infrastructure for the economy and for \nthe future. I think it is more important to build the infrastructure \nthrough education, the intellectual infrastructure of our Nation that \nprovides both opportunities to individuals and opportunities and \nstrength to our economy as a whole.\n  There are some who say these giveaways reduce the price of oil at the \npump and reduce the price of gasoline. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. We all know what is driving the price of gasoline. Demand is \ndown because people don't have enough to\n\n[[Page S2141]]\n\nspend, supply is up, so it is certainly not supply and demand. But what \nwe do have is a big increase in speculators. Speculators are going to \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and they are making bets that \nbecause of the crisis in the Middle East, because of the issues with \nIran, because of the concern about oil flowing out through the Strait \nof Hormuz, that others will also buy oil futures, so they will buy \nthem, too, and they will make money on the way up, and the result is, \nfor all of us, a higher price at the pump. So if we want to do \nsomething about oil prices, we take on the speculators. That is why in \nDodd-Frank we gave the CFTC the ability to exclude speculators from \nthat marketplace, to say they have to have positions, they have to have \nan end use for oil. But they haven't used that power. Maybe we need to \npass a stronger bill to suppress the speculation, since the CFTC is not \ndoing its job.\n\n  What we know for certain is that giving powerful oil companies the \npeople's money to add to the money they are keeping in the bank, the \nbillions they are sitting on, will not do one thing to drop the price \nof oil. Let's help American families and not the most powerful who have \nno need for these funds.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, we continue to watch fuel costs \nskyrocket--shockingly so in the last 3 months--as the average price of \na gallon of gasoline breaks records again and again for this time of \nyear. Today, the national average, when I last checked, was $3.91 per \ngallon.\n  When President Obama took office, Americans paid $1.85 for a gallon \nof regular gasoline. Now they are paying more than twice that price, \nwith analysts projecting even higher spikes on the horizon. Some are \nspeculating gasoline prices could top $5 per gallon by summer. Now \nSenate Democrats propose raising taxes on gasoline production.\n  We hear a lot about an all-of-the-above energy approach, and that \nneeds to be put into practice. This should include expanding access to \nAmerica's critical resources. Instead, the President insists on flawed \nenergy strategies such as using taxpayer money for high-risk projects \nsuch as Solyndra, while delaying drilling in the gulf.\n  The President has slowed the permitting process, he has blocked \nleases, and he has supported higher energy taxes and more regulations. \nHis actions have come at the expense of valuable opportunities for \ngreater domestic energy. The gains our energy producers have made are \nin spite of the President's policies, not because of them.\n  The de facto moratorium on drilling in the Gulf of Mexico made it \nclear that strengthening the country's energy security was not a White \nHouse priority. The plan the President proposed for offshore oil and \ngas leasing for the next 5 years would open less than 3 percent of \noffshore areas for production.\n  Then there was the rejection by the President of the Keystone XL \nPipeline--the subject of an extensive environmental vetting process and \na project which would guarantee nearby available oil from our largest \ntrading partner. The President may talk about the need for oil and gas \npipelines and even try to take credit for the lower part of the \npipeline that did not need his approval, but there is no denying his \nadministration is responsible for roadblocks standing in the way of a \nbetter national energy policy.\n  The 830,000 barrels per day the Keystone Pipeline would transport \noffers a 7-percent increase to current imports. Vetoing it keeps \nAmericans vulnerable to spiking gas prices and the dangerous whims of \nenergy providers from volatile regions of the world.\n  High fuel prices can have far-reaching economic effects. According to \nthe Oil Price Information Service, Americans spent more on gasoline in \n2011 than in any other year in the past three decades--some $481 \nbillion. For the average household, about 8.4 percent of the family \nbudget or $4,155 went toward filling up at the pump last year. Of \ncourse, it is more this year. This means consumers have less money to \nspend and invest in their local communities, ultimately hurting the \neconomic growth we desperately need.\n  In 2008, then-Senator Obama said he would have preferred a gradual \nadjustment of gas prices. That same year, Energy Secretary-to-be Steven \nChu told the Wall Street Journal: ``Somehow we have to figure out how \nto boost the price of gasoline to the levels of Europe.'' This is the \nPresident's choice for Energy Secretary, someone who wants our gasoline \nprices to be at the $8-per-gallon level they are experiencing in \nEurope. This mentality has not changed since 2008. Earlier this month, \nPresident Obama said the only solution was to start using less. That \nlowers the demand and prices come down, according to the President. He \nlater asserted that ``how much oil we produce at home'' is ``not going \nto set the price of gas worldwide.'' Somehow, using less will lower the \nprices, according to the President, but producing more will not lower \nthe prices. In other words, the President believes in only half the \nprinciple of supply and demand.\n  Indeed, basic economics tells us otherwise. It tells us that \nalleviating demand can lower prices but having a greater supply does \nthat too. The argument the President is trying to make that domestic \nproduction is inconsequential does not add up. Not expanding production \nforces American wealth to go overseas because we have to buy our oil \nfrom overseas. As Charles Krauthammer recently wrote in the Washington \nPost:\n\n       Drill here and you stanch the hemorrhage. You keep those \n     dollars within the United States economy.\n\n  That is exactly what we need to do in these troubling times.\n  According to the Institute for Energy Research, we have enough oil \nwithin our borders to supply our own fuel needs for 250 years. That is \nnot Senator Wicker talking; that is not a Presidential candidate \ntalking; that is the Institute for Energy Research--250 years we have \nin the United States. Yet they are being kept off-limits by the \nadministration.\n  Now the administration wants an $85 billion energy tax hike. This new \ntax will not translate into cheaper gasoline, a fact my Democratic \ncolleagues have, in fact, acknowledged. It will make it more expensive \nto produce, drive up imports, and hamper economic investment.\n  According to a study by the Congressional Research Service, higher \nenergy taxes will increase gas prices and likely increase foreign \ndependence--exactly what we don't want to do. This would ultimately \nhurt average Americans who depend on affordable gas prices to get to \nwork every day and businesses--small businesses--that need fuel to \ntransport their goods and services. We have seen how the administration \nlikes to use taxpayer money on high-risk bets such as Solyndra and \nalgae. Instead of gambling on unproven ideas, we should be ensuring \neconomic growth with policies that strengthen our energy capacity. We \nare blessed to live in a country with plentiful resources and we are \nfar from maximizing America's energy potential.\n  I have filed amendment No. 1966 to this bill. The amendment would \nestablish a production goal for the Obama administration's 5-year \noffshore oil and gas leasing plan. It calls for 3 million barrels of \noil per day and 10 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day by the \nyear 2027. Compared to today's levels, this increase in production \nwould triple America's current offshore production and reduce foreign \nimports by nearly one-third. By setting these benchmarks for the output \nof oil and natural gas, we can make measurable progress toward energy \nindependence.\n  So I would propound this parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: If we \nwere on the bill at this point, would it be in order for me to offer \nsuch an amendment, No. 1966, at this time?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the pending question was S. 2204, it would \ntake unanimous consent to offer an amendment to that measure because \nthere is not an available amendment slot at this time.\n  Mr. WICKER. I regret that. I hope we can negotiate on both sides of \nthe aisle\n\n[[Page S2142]]\n\nso amendments such as this can be offered.\n  To set benchmarks, we could use an additional 3 million barrels of \noil per day and 10 billion additional cubic feet of natural gas per day \nto help us attack this very serious energy problem.\n  I would simply conclude by saying today's high gasoline prices \nconfirm the urgency of pursuing better energy strategies as demand for \noil continues to increase across the globe. Taking steps now is \nessential to meeting future needs and bringing relief at the pump.\n  Seeing no one who is seeking to speak--does the Senator seek to \nspeak? If so, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I request an opportunity to speak for up \nto 10 minutes on the pending energy legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Keystone XL Pipeline\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I am here to offer a substitute amendment \nto the Menendez act, which is currently under consideration on the \nSenate floor. That is S. 2204. The substitute amendment I would like to \noffer is legislation I have authored along with Senator Lugar and also \nSenator Vitter. It is legislation that would approve construction of \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline and authorize that that construction proceed. \nThat authority is provided to Congress under the commerce clause of the \nConstitution. With gas prices now close to $4--and going higher--\nCongress needs to act.\n  President Obama has turned down the pipeline. He continues to block \nthe Keystone XL Pipeline, and it is time for Congress to act on behalf \nof the American consumer. Every single American, every hard-working \nAmerican, is feeling this pain at the pump.\n  The Keystone XL Pipeline would help us produce more energy supply for \nour country to help reduce the price of gasoline at the pump. It will \nhelp us create more jobs in this country. Close to 13 million Americans \nare now unemployed. It would help put more of those Americans back to \nwork. Of course, it would help reduce our reliance on oil from the \nMiddle East.\n  The first chart I have in the Chamber shows what is happening with \ngasoline prices in the United States. This is over the last 3-year \nperiod. This shows the price of gasoline was about $1.87 a gallon when \nPresident Obama took office 3 years ago. Today, the national average, I \nbelieve stated by AAA, is on the order of $3.91. So the price of \ngasoline during the Obama administration's tenure has more than \ndoubled. It has more than doubled.\n  I think there is something like 8 or 9 States now where the average \nprice of a gallon of gasoline is over $4. In places such as Chicago--\nthe President's hometown--I believe the average price is on the order \nof $4.68. If we go right down to the corner here, right near the \nCapitol, I filled my car the other day. It cost me more than $100 to \nfill the tank, and I think the price was $4.39 a gallon.\n  So what is the solution offered in the Menendez legislation? What is \nthe solution proposed by the Obama administration? What is the solution \nproposed in this bill we are considering right now on the Senate floor?\n  What that bill would do is raise taxes on energy companies. It would \nraise taxes on energy companies. Let's think about this. We are going \nto raise taxes on these energy companies, so we are going to increase \ntheir costs. When we add taxes, that means it not only raises their \ncosts, which will create even higher costs at the pump for American \nconsumers, but it also tends to restrict supply. If we want less of \nsomething, and if we want it to cost more, what do we do? We tax it. So \nthis legislation does exactly the opposite of what will help the \nAmerican consumers with the price of gasoline at the pump.\n  Instead, we need to increase supply. By providing more supply, we \nhelp create downward pressure on gasoline prices. That helps our hard-\nworking Americans not only today but tomorrow as well. Let's talk about \nthat.\n  Why are gas prices high? It is supply and demand. This is economics. \nThis is about supply and demand. If we increase supply, we put downward \npressure on prices. If we increase demand, we put upward pressure on \nprices. Global demand for oil is growing. We know that. Global demand \nis growing. So we need to increase the supply; otherwise, that growing \ndemand continues to push gasoline prices higher.\n  As shown on this chart, here is the amount of crude oil we produce in \nthe United States, along with our good friends in Canada today. That is \nshown in the first bar on this chart. We can see, it is just below 10 \nmillion barrels a day. That is where we are now. With the current \npolicies the administration has in place, we will actually produce less \nsupply in the future--less supply in the future.\n  Think about that. If gasoline prices are a function of supply and \ndemand, it is not only the supply and demand of today, it is what \npeople anticipate the supply and demand will be in the future. If we \nhave growing global demand--which we know we have--and we have an \nadministration that is constricting supply, then not only do we have an \nissue in terms of present supply and demand, but we have people going: \nLook, there is going to be less supply. We know there is going to be \ngrowing demand. That puts upward pressure on prices.\n  So the actions of the administration have a direct impact, a direct \ncorrelation with the price of gasoline at the pump. As I showed on the \nprevious chart, under this administration, gas prices have more than \ndoubled. So what we need to do is, we need to produce ``all of the \nabove.'' We need to produce ``all of the above.''\n  Note that I said ``produce'' it. I do not mean talk about it. I do \nnot mean block it when it comes to building needed infrastructure such \nas the Keystone XL Pipeline or preventing us from drilling offshore or \npreventing us from drilling onshore or having the redtape that prevents \nus from getting permits and the regulatory burden that prevents us from \nproducing more energy. I mean actually doing it--not blocking it, doing \nit.\n\n  This third bar on the chart shows that if we just worked to produce \nmore oil and gas in the United States and Canada, we can produce more \nthan we consume within 15 years. That is just oil and gas. That is not \neven ``all of the above.'' That does not count producing all the \nnatural gas we have in this country and in Canada or biofuels or other \nsources. That is just oil and gas if we start working to produce it \nrather than have the administration continue to block it.\n  Of course, that is what I am talking about with the Keystone XL \nPipeline. The President has studied the Keystone Pipeline, the \nadministration has studied it, the State Department has studied it, the \nEPA has studied it for 3\\1/2\\ years. Now the Department of Energy has \ncome out and said--they did a study in June of last year--in their \nstudy, they said: We need the crude in the United States. We will use \nthe crude in the United States, and it will lower gas prices on the \neast coast, on the gulf coast, and in the Midwest. That is Secretary \nChu, the Secretary of Energy--his Department of Energy produced the \nreport, and that is what it said.\n  After 3\\1/2\\ years, the President says: That is not long enough. We \nneed more time. The administration needs more time to make a decision. \nAfter his own State Department said they would have a decision done \nbefore the end of the year--before the end of the year--the President \nsays: No, we need more time, maybe sometime after the election--maybe. \nWe need more time to make the decision.\n  So Congress said: OK. We will help out. You have expressed concern \nabout the routing of the pipeline through Nebraska. We will pass \nlegislation to kind of give you support and encouragement that says \nthey can go ahead and build the pipeline, and we will give them \nwhatever time they need to reroute Nebraska so there is no issue \nbecause that is what you have identified as the problem.\n  We passed that legislation as part of the payroll tax cut extension. \nThe President denied it, turned it down, blocked it, and he continues \nto block the Keystone XL Pipeline today.\n  A couple weeks ago, bipartisan legislation--the very same legislation \nI am offering in this substitute amendment--was brought to the Senate \nfloor. Bipartisan legislation. We had 11 Democrats who voted with us. \nFifty-six\n\n[[Page S2143]]\n\nvotes, well over a majority--56 votes. The reason we did not get 60 \nvotes on the legislation is because that day the President was calling \nMembers of this body, this Senate body, to get them to vote no. So we \ngot 56 votes instead of the 60 we needed.\n  The very next week--after calling Members of the Senate to get them \nto vote down this legislation that would authorize moving forward so we \ncould actually bring oil in from Canada, bring more oil from my home \nState of North Dakota to refineries to help out Americans at the pump--\nthe very next week, after blocking the pipeline, after calling Members \nof the Senate to get them to vote against it, the President goes to \nCushing, OK, and takes credit for this small portion, the southern leg \nof the pipeline project, saying that somehow he is expediting it.\n  Interestingly enough, that is the only portion of the pipeline that \ndoes not require his approval. But after blocking it, he goes down and \ntakes credit for somehow expediting the portion that was going to be \nbuilt anyway, while he continues to block the two-thirds that actually \nbrings us more oil.\n  So go back to what I said just a minute ago. We need more supply. If \nthe policy of this country is to say all of the above, but then go \nabout blocking our ability to produce more supply, guess what happens. \nPrices go up. Because what counts are the actions.\n  So the market takes that into account and says: Look, if supply is \ngoing to be constrained, then we anticipate higher prices in the future \nwith growing global demand. That is what we see: prices rising at the \npump.\n  Look, we can have energy security in this country. We need to \nincrease our oil production in this country and work with our neighbor \nto the north, Canada, rather than have them send their oil to China, \nwhich is what will happen if we cannot build these pipelines. We need \nto increase our use of natural gas. We need to do ``all of the above,'' \nincrease renewable fuels, with a market-based approach--a market-based \napproach--and we need to use technology to drive energy production in \nthis country, and working with Canada, with better environmental \nstewardship.\n  What I mean by that, in Canada, oil is produced in the oil sands with \nin situ, which is the new technique. It is similar to drilling, rather \nthan the old methods--more energy, better environmental stewardship.\n  Look, we can create a more secure energy future for our country, we \ncan create jobs in America, and we can reduce the price of gasoline at \nthe pump for hard-working Americans. But we need to take commonsense \nsteps, and we need to take them now to produce more oil and gas, to \nproduce more energy of all kinds in this country. We are asking for the \nPresident to work with us to do just that.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I have a parliamentary inquiry: When \nthe Senate resumes consideration of the pending energy tax bill, would \nit be in order for me to offer my amendment, a substitute amendment, \nwhich would approve the Keystone XL Pipeline to help Americans at the \npump with the price of gasoline?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the pending question was S. 2204, it would \ntake unanimous consent to offer an amendment to that measure because \nthere is not an available amendment slot at this time.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. So no amendments will be allowed?\n  Mr. President, I think that is unfortunate. It is time, it is well \npast time, to take action on behalf of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I follow my friend and colleague from \nNorth Dakota who has been a real leader in these Chambers trying to \neducate not only those in these Chambers but people across the country \nas to the value and importance of the Keystone XL Pipeline and what it \nmeans to this country, not only in terms of a resource we need but also \nin terms of jobs and not only construction jobs but what it means to \nfill a pipeline and provide for a product that goes down to our \nrefineries.\n  Again, when we are talking about an economic boom, where better to \nlook than to our neighbors to the north, and I thank Senator Hoeven for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  I too wish to talk about our opportunity as a nation to do more when \nit comes to increasing supply within our own country. As has been \nmentioned on this floor numerous times today, numerous times yesterday, \nwe are in a position as a nation to be doing more to access our own \nresources, to make us less dependent on countries that do not like us, \nto make us more energy secure, less energy vulnerable. At a time when \nthe geopolitical scene is so shaky, every step we can take to make us \nmore secure from a national security perspective and an energy security \nperspective is clearly important.\n  I have a substitute amendment that I have filed, which I think is \nimportant to this debate. I think it is important when we are talking \nabout our access to supply.\n  What I will discuss in my 10 minutes is not new. Members have heard \nme talk over and over about the prolific oil resources that reside in \nAlaska. According to the Energy Department, we have over 40 billion \nbarrels of oil that could be produced up North, providing not only the \nenergy but the energy security, the jobs, and new revenues. We have a \npipeline that is built already. We don't need to deal with the \npermitting issues there. It is there waiting to carry oil. We have \noverwhelming support from Alaskans.\n  What we don't have is what is perhaps most important, which is \npermission from the Federal Government to actually develop our huge \noilfields. The biggest on the continent is in the northwest corner of \nANWR. For years, we have sought to develop a total of 2,000 acres in \nwhat is known as the 1002 area, which Congress set aside back in 1980 \nto access for energy exploration. They knew then that this area had \ngreat potential. The 1002 area is projected to contain more than 10 \nbillion barrels of oil. If you were to put it into context this way, it \nwould be 1 billion barrels a day coming down that pipeline to us from \nANWR. That is enough to replace Venezuela or Saudi imports for about 30 \nyears. To think that we could get off of Venezuela and we would not \nneed to go to Saudi Arabia with tin cup in hand because we are \nproducing ourselves here--think about what that means to us. For those \nwho bring about the speculation and argument of what that does to \nprices, think how this would mess up speculators if you add a million \nbarrels a day online. Instead of embracing this as an opportunity, \nevery excuse in the book has been thrown at us against development. You \nhear that the environment will be degraded, wildlife will be disturbed, \nand that despite a better environmental record than just about anywhere \nelse in the world at Prudhoe Bay, we cannot do it. They don't trust us \nto do it. But for 20 years we have been hearing: Don't go toward ANWR; \ndon't develop ANWR because it will take you 10 years to get that \nonline; therefore, it is not even worth considering.\n  Even the late-night TV shows talk about it. Jay Leno joked about that \nand said, ``Democrats said it would take 10 years 10 years ago.'' If \nyou don't get started, it is never going to happen. We are going to \nkeep that money in the ground indefinitely if we don't get moving on \nit. I don't accept the arguments that have been tossed out, but they \nhave not accepted the facts that we have presented.\n  I have an amendment that has changed a little bit. It is designed to \naddress this debate. It would prohibit surface development entirely. \nYet, it still allows for a very substantial portion of the oil to be \naccessed from our State lands, with drills reaching beneath the Coastal \nPlain. We do this by allowing only subsurface occupancy. We use \nextended horizontal drilling production. Right now, it can reach about \n8 miles underground in all directions. As the technology advances, more \nand more of that refuge's oil could be tapped. Again, we are not going \nto be occupying the surface. There is no surface occupancy in this \nlegislation. All land-based structures would be located on adjacent \nState lands. You would not see permanent roads, wells, buildings, and \npipelines constructed on the surface of the refuge.\n  If you were to put together a slide show of development, the surface \nwould be unchanged before, during, and after\n\n[[Page S2144]]\n\nproduction. This is a photo of ANWR, and this is probably in the spring \nbecause you have tufts of grass coming up through the melting snow. \nThis is what it would look like before, during, and after because we \nare underneath through the technology.\n  The amendment I am offering gives the Senate a chance to put reason \nahead of rhetoric, policy above politics, when it comes to oil \nproduction in this State. It is a chance to end this decades-old \ndispute about whether development can proceed safely.\n  We have not just met the opposition halfway here on ANWR; we have met \nthem 90 percent of the way. We have written into the amendment more \nstringent environmental safeguards than on any other Federal lands. We \nsacrifice 90 percent of the revenues, which Alaska is entitled to under \nour statehood agreement. We proposed a 50 50 Federal split. It seems \nthat we are now begging to access a small fraction of the reserves from \nmiles away.\n  It defies logic to think that, again, an idea, a concept like this \nwould be kept off the table. I realize many are dug in on this issue. I \nhave attempted to change the debate, change the conversation. I would \nask the Senate to take a moment to consider how far we have compromised \non this amendment and understand why it is different. I hope we can get \na vote on it.\n  I ask, as a point of parliamentary inquiry, when the Senate resumes \nconsideration of the pending energy tax bill, would it be in order for \nme to offer my amendment No. 1976 at that time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the pending question were asked regarding \nS. 2204, it would take unanimous consent to offer an amendment to that \nmeasure because there is no available amendment slot at this time.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. The Chair is saying that the amendment slots have been \nfilled by the majority leader, is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have another issue I wish to bring up \ntoday in the remainder of my time. I have two other amendments I would \nlike the body to consider. I understand what the Chair has just said.\n  One of the things that I think we recognize is much of our country's \nproduction can lag due to an accumulation of redtape due to permitting \nissues. We know the Federal Government cannot necessarily set global \ncommodity prices, but it can create a situation where capital that \nmight be invested in American mineral production is stranded for long \nperiods of time. That is what we see happening, and it is unacceptable.\n  What we should not do, particularly in the case of energy and \nminerals development, is subject a project to an unnecessarily long \npermitting process. I have an amendment that would begin to remedy this \nsituation, and it would do so by using the very language the President \nused last week with his executive order, which he signed March 22. My \namendment incorporates provisions that had pretty broad bipartisan \nsupport on the highway bill considered by this body. These provisions \nwill work. According to the September 2010 report by the Federal \nHighway Administration, these reforms have cut the time required to \ncomplete environmental reviews and have mitigated the delays caused by \nlast-minute legal challenges. What they do, more specifically, is take \nthe President's executive order and put some teeth to it, if you will.\n\n  The President simply asked the agencies to consider making certain \nimprovements. What I have done through my legislation is ask for a \nprocess for States to nominate items that might be subject to NEPA, \nallow for a shortening of review periods, and the designation of a \nsingle lead Federal agency. It is a situation that I do think rests on \na good premise. The President has suggested that this is an approach \nthat needs to be considered when, again, making such improvements.\n  I suggest that if it is good enough for the President and for our \ntransportation needs, as we have seen demonstrated in the highway bill, \nthen it is good enough for energy, mineral, and infrastructure needs as \nwell.\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 1985, which includes \nall of the provisions I have described.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have the \nbill before us relative to the tax subsidies given to major oil \ncompanies--it gives $4 billion a year to companies that registered $137 \nbillion in profit last year. It is such a popular measure that moving \nto it attracted a 92-to-4 vote in the Senate. We are trying to bring \nthat to closure and get a vote on it. I know the Senator has an \namendment she feels is valuable. I don't know the merits of it. I \nwasn't on the floor to hear the entire explanation. We have just gone \nthrough a transportation bill on which for more than a week we \nentertained an amendment on contraception on that side of the aisle.\n  We wish to, if we can, limit amendments to relevant issues, and limit \nthem in number and try to actually pass a bill in the Senate, which \nwould be almost historic. I hope we can do it in a bipartisan way. I \ninvite the Senator from Alaska to join us in a conversation about that. \nUntil we can reach agreement on that, I am afraid I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am disappointed we won't have an \nopportunity to offer the amendments. Several of my colleagues will be \ncoming down to offer their amendments. We have been told that the tree \nhas been filled. The amendment I am proposing--I actually have two. \nOne, as I have described, is probably broader in scope, but I have a \nsecond amendment that literally takes the President's executive order \nand provides instructions to the agencies to do a rulemaking to \nimplement them within 1 year. This is not something that the Senator \nfrom Alaska has designed; this is the President's executive order. I \nthink it is designed to get us to an expedited permitting process so we \ndon't have the lag times, whether it is on transportation \ninfrastructure or energy issues.\n  I think it is a good measure, and I ask my colleague from Illinois, \nin the effort to work together, which I appreciate, to take a look at \nthis amendment. I apparently will not be able to introduce or call up \namendment No. 1986. But again, what that bill would do is pretty \nsimple. It is to codify portions of the President's executive order. \nThe title is ``Improving Performance of Federal Permitting.'' He \nsuggested it, and I thought it made sense. Now we are urging the \nagencies to provide for an implementation.\n  Again, I think this debate we are having on the floor this week is an \nimportant one. We are focused on the issues that people in this country \nare talking about. Folks back home are very concerned. I just met with \na group of students. One young man is a high schooler from Yakutat, \nprobably driving his first car, and they are paying in excess of $5.50 \na gallon at the pump. When you are a 16- or 17-year-old boy, that is \npretty high. Even when you are a person our age, that is high. He \nwanted to know what we are doing as a Congress to help address these \nissues.\n  I cannot overstate my disappointment, as we are dealing with these \ndifficult issues in what we all know to be a great deliberative body, \nthat we cannot move to a process where we can allow for fair and \ngermane amendments that I think would help address some of the energy \nchallenges we face, recognizing where we are today.\n  I see my colleague from Louisiana has joined us on the floor. My time \nhas expired.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to offer amendments to \nthis bill. Let me assure our colleague from Illinois that they are not \namendments about contraception or any other unrelated issue. They are \nenergy amendments, which go directly to one of the greatest challenges \nall of our constituents, fellow citizens, face, which is the ever-\nrising price at the pump.\n  I am glad we are on this Menendez bill, because at least it puts us \non that major challenge that faces Louisiana's lower to middle-class \nfamilies, and those families in Illinois, and all around the country. I \nbring amendments that are directly relevant to that.\n  The first amendment has to do with supply. First of all, let me say \nwhy I oppose the Menendez bill. It is because\n\n[[Page S2145]]\n\nwhen we tax something at a higher level, when we increase the tax on \nit, we get less of it. So it will produce less energy, in particular \nless U.S. domestic energy. When we lower supply, we increase the price. \nIt is not only not going to have a positive impact on the price at the \npump, it will increase the price and have a negative impact.\n\n  I take the opposite approach. We need to increase supply, starting \nwith activity and supply right here at home in the United States. So my \namendment, offered along with Senator Murkowski of Alaska, No. 1965, \nwould do that. It would replace President Obama's current 5-year plan \nfor Outer Continental Shelf leasing with basically the plan that \nexisted previously, which is double President Obama's plan.\n  So President Obama's plan, which he put in place after coming into \noffice, is about half of the previous plan. It backs us up and turns us \naround, moving us in the wrong direction. Amendment No. 1965 would turn \nus back, move us in the right direction, and adopt pretty much that \nprevious plan--to expand our access to our own U.S. energy resources \noffshore.\n\n\n                      Unanimous requests--S. 2204\n\n  So, Mr. President, with that said, I ask unanimous consent that when \nthe Senate returns to consideration of S. 2204, the pending energy tax \nbill, it be in order for me to offer amendment No. 1965, which I have \nauthored along with Senator Murkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Louisiana and I can get into a debate \nabout whether taking $4 billion in subsidies away from five oil \ncompanies that reported $137 billion in profit last year is going to \nchange the production of oil, but we will save that for another day.\n  This amendment, like others, needs to go through the Senator's \nleader, and with some understanding as to whether we are going to stay \nin the energy field or go far afield, as we have in previous bills. I \nam afraid I am constrained, until that conversation takes place between \nthe leaders, to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, that is unfortunate. It is particularly \nunfortunate because everyone knows our leader and everyone on our side \nhas absolutely agreed to offer energy amendments and give the other \nside an equal number of energy amendments. We are perfectly agreeable \nto that, and everybody knows that.\n  It is in that context that I bring up another energy amendment, our \namendment No. 1997. This has to do with another huge opportunity we \nhave in the United States right here at home; that is, enormous oil \nresources we can get from western shale. Quoting the Institute for \nEnergy Research:\n\n       USGS estimates that unconventional U.S. oil shale resources \n     hold 2.6 trillion barrels of oil, with about 1 trillion \n     barrels that are considered recoverable under current \n     economic and technological conditions. These 1 trillion \n     barrels are nearly four times the amount of oil reserves as \n     Saudi Arabia's proven oil reserves.\n\n  That is the potential we have right here in this country--enormous \nreserves, available now, recoverable now. So what is the problem? Well, \none big problem is the Obama administration has canceled all leases to \naccess this oil shale. There was movement to properly, responsibly \naccess that 1 trillion barrels, but that has been canceled under the \nObama administration.\n  My amendment, No. 1997--again, obviously, an energy amendment that \ncan affect prices at the pump--would expedite movement toward that \nimportant resource and would get us moving again in the right \ndirection, accessing that U.S. energy resource.\n  With that said, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate returns to consideration of S. 2204, the pending energy tax \nbill, it be in order for me to offer that amendment No. 1997.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. For the reasons stated earlier, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, if I can wrap up, again, I think this is \nunfortunate. Everybody knows Republicans are perfectly willing to limit \nourselves to relevant energy amendments. That is what we are doing. \nThat is what we are bringing to the floor. Leader McConnell has offered \nthat. He has offered to have a like number of energy amendments from \nthe Democratic side. What is happening is we are being completely shut \ndown and shut out.\n  The main issue is not that I am aggrieved, the main issue is the \nAmerican people are being shut out. The folks I represent--the folks \nall of us represent--are being shut out from offering good, sensible \nideas to at least debate and vote on which would access more American \nenergy, more U.S. energy, to help solve the pressing problem of the \nprice at the pump in that way. Let's control our own destiny in that \nway.\n  This is a sensible solution. It is a major solution. It will move us \nin the right direction.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am glad to see the Senator from Illinois \non the Senator floor to object to my next proposal.\n  Mr. President, throughout our history, from time to time we have \npassed legislation that long after it has served its purpose, if it \never did, still remains on the books. I think one of the great and \noutstanding examples of that is a law called the Jones Act.\n  The Jones Act, I am sure, may have had some rationale behind it back \nin 1920 when it was enacted. I am also sure there is perhaps only 1 \nAmerican in 1,000 who has ever heard of the Jones Act. But the Jones \nAct has a direct impact on oil supplies, on the cost of oil, and the \ncost of other products.\n  The Jones Act says, incredibly, any product shipped between two U.S. \nports--whether it is Honolulu, HI, and San Francisco or one of the gulf \ncoast ports to the northeast or anyplace between two U.S. ports--can \nonly be transported by U.S.-owned, U.S.-built, and U.S.-crewed vessels. \nTalk about protectionism. There is probably no greater example than \nthis.\n  The Jones Act, enacted in 1920, has cost consumers--especially in \nplaces such as Hawaii where the transportation of goods is long \ndistance--enormous amounts of money. In other words, citing the \nFebruary 2012 Energy Information Administration Report, there are only \n56 tankers that meet the Jones Act requirements, which accounts for \nless than 1 percent of both the total number and the total deadweight \ntonnages of tankers in the world. So less than 1 percent of the tankers \nin the world are able, by law, to operate between two U.S. ports.\n\n  So what does this do? Obviously, when we are talking about supply and \ncapacity, it drives up the cost of petroleum. In fact, sometimes it is \ntwo or three times the rate of a foreign flagship--again, according to \nthe Energy Information Administration. Not only that, the Jones Act \ntankers--those 56--aren't always readily available, so the costs can be \neven higher than we are talking about.\n  Let me give another example of the harm the Jones Act does to \nAmerican consumers. In 1999, the U.S. International Trade Commission--\nnot a Republican or Democrat or Liberal or Conservative organization--\nsaid a repeal of the Jones Act would lower shipping costs by \napproximately 22 percent. A 2002 economic study from that same \ncommission found repealing the Jones Act would have an annual positive \nwelfare effect of $665 million on the overall U.S. economy. Given the \nprice of oil, that is probably now close to $1 billion.\n  The Jones Act adds real direct costs to consumers, as I mentioned, \nparticularly to Hawaii and Alaska. I notice the Senator from Alaska is \non the Senate floor. A 1988 GAO report found the Jones Act was costing \nAlaskan families between $1,921 and $4,820 annually for increased \nprices paid on goods that were shipped from the mainland. In 1997, a \nHawaii Government official asserted that ``Hawaii residents pay an \nadditional $1 billion per year in higher prices because of the Jones \nAct. This amounts to approximately $3,000 for every household in \nHawaii.'' Again, those figures are from 1988 to 1997. Obviously, they \nare higher today.\n\n[[Page S2146]]\n\n  Everybody says there is nothing that can be done immediately about \nthe price of oil. My friends, if we repeal the Jones Act, we would have \nan immediate effect on the price of oil because when we are \ntransporting oil from the gulf coast to the Northeast, and it costs two \nor three times more if that supply is restricted to being transported \nonly by these 56 tankers, then, obviously--according to figures that \nare accurate that it costs two to three times more than if we allowed \nother foreign-flagged ships to move these goods and services, but \nparticularly oil tankers--we could cut the cost of oil, of gasoline, \nimmediately.\n  So the next time you hear the President of the United States or my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle say there is nothing that can be \ndone now about reducing the price of a gallon of gasoline, understand \nthat we can do so by repealing the Jones Act immediately.\n  If there was ever a law that has long ago outlived its utility or \nusefulness, if it ever had any, it is this law passed in 1920. Only \nAmerican built? We can't even buy another one--a tanker or a ship--that \nis built in another country and not have it fall under the Jones Act, \neven if it is American owned and with an American crew. Amazing.\n  What I am leading to, obviously, is that we should repeal the Jones \nAct. If not repeal it, then waive the Jones Act. If not fully waive it, \nthen waive it just for the transport of oil, for oil and gas tankers. \nIf that is not enough, let's just waive it for 6 months. Couldn't we \njust do that for 6 months?\n  I know what the response of the Senator from Illinois is going to be. \nThat is his duty on the Senate floor, and I respect that. But, my \nfriends, the price of a gallon of gasoline is now, this March, \naccording to media reports, the highest it has been in history. \nDepending on what happens in a lot of different areas of the world--\nparticularly the Middle East and what happens in Iran and other things \nthat are going on in this very dangerous world we are living in today--\nit could go considerably higher.\n  So why don't we take a commonsense approach and at least for 6 months \nwaive the requirements of the Jones Act for only oil and gasoline \ntankers--for just 6 months. It seems to me that would make a great deal \nof sense.\n  I know all four of my unanimous consent requests on these amendments \nare going to be denied. But, first of all, I think the Jones Act should \nbe repealed completely. If it isn't to be repealed, couldn't we at \nleast waive the Jones Act restrictions on coastwise trade for oil and \ngas tankers? If we can't waive it permanently for that, can't we waive \nthose restrictions for 6 months? We are discussing energy and the price \nof oil. Can't we waive the Jones Act restrictions on coastwise trade \nfor oil and gasoline for 6 months.\n  So with the indulgence of my friend from Illinois, I ask unanimous \nconsent that when the Senate returns to consideration of S. 2204, the \npending energy tax bill, it be in order for me to offer--I want to \noffer them all--my amendment No. 1948, which is, as I described, an \namendment that would waive the Jones Act restrictions. In other words, \nit would allow a foreign-flagged tanker to move oil and gas--a waiver \nfor 6 months to move just oil and gas--so that we can immediately \nreduce the cost of transportation, which would then translate itself at \nthe pump at every gas station in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? The Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I believe \nthe shipbuilding industry in Arizona is about the same size as it is in \nIllinois, so I don't come to this issue with any particular hometown or \nhome State view, and I am open to the Senator's suggestion. But I would \nsay at this moment we are clearly focused on doing one thing; that is, \neliminating the $4 billion annual subsidy to the five big oil companies \nthat registered $137 billion in profits last year. Moving to this \nmeasure was voted favorably by 92 Senators, and we are trying to move \nthis to a vote. Perhaps we can move to another issue--the ones the \nSenator is proposing--at another time, but at this point, I have no \nother alternative but to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I always enjoy a little dialog between \nmyself and the Senator from Illinois. I hope he would have the same \npassion concerning all subsidies, including the outrageous and \ndisgraceful subsidies that--and there is a lot of solar in the State of \nArizona--a lot of solar. I will stop here, but if we are going to \nrepeal the gas and oil subsidies, let's repeal them all. Let's repeal \nthem all.\n  I am not sure--again, the logic that says that if we are able to \nimmediately reduce the cost of oil by repealing the Jones Act, which \nthen would reduce the cost of transportation, would then reduce the \ncost of gasoline--why should we out of hand reject such a motion or an \neffort to do so?\n  But I understand what the position of the majority and the \ndistinguished Democratic leader is, and I know others are waiting, so I \nthank the Senator and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time remains.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, President Obama often boasts about oil \nproduction he really had nothing to do with. My amendments I am \nbringing forth today would allow him to be proud of his own record \ninstead of his predecessors, and that is why I ask unanimous consent \nthat when the Senate returns to consideration of S. 2204, the pending \nenergy tax bill, that it be in order for me to offer amendments Nos. \n1956 and 1957. Amendment No. 1956 would accelerate permitting of oil \nand gas exploration on our Federal public lands, and amendment No. 1957 \nwould require Federal agencies to use existing environmental review \ndocuments for oil and gas permitting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, the reason I come to the floor today is \nto speak on behalf of these two amendments I have filed to S. 2204.\n  A few weeks ago, we learned that oil and gas production on Federal \npublic lands and waters is down. Specifically, we learned there was a \n14-percent decrease in oil production on Federal public lands and \nwaters from 2010 to 2011 and an 11-percent decrease in gas production \nfrom 2010 to 2011.\n  On March 14, Bob Abbey, the Director of the Bureau of Land \nManagement, testified about this before the Appropriations Committee. \nHe explained that there had been ``a shift [in the oil and gas \nproduction] to private lands to the east and to the south where there \nis a lesser amount of Federal mineral estate.''\n  That is why amendment No. 1956 would accelerate permitting for oil \nand gas exploration on our Federal public lands, and that is why I just \noffered that. I took a look at the amendments and the discussion on the \nbill on the floor, and that is why specifically I offered an amendment \nthat would rescind the administration's rules requiring what are called \nmaster leasing and development plans. These regulations were put into \nplace over 2 years ago by the Secretary of the Interior. It is unclear \nwhy the Secretary issued these regulations. They add more redtape, they \ncause more bureaucratic delay, and they slow down American energy \nproduction. This amendment would also require the administration to set \ngoals for oil and gas production on Federal public lands. It would \nensure that the United States maintains or increases onshore oil and \ngas production.\n  I have also filed a second amendment, No. 1957, which would require \nFederal agencies to use existing environmental review documents for oil \nand gas permitting. When we take a look at this amendment, this would \nexpedite the time it takes to prepare environmental analyses under the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, often known as NEPA. Too often, NEPA \ndelays onshore and offshore exploration. My amendment provides a \ncommonsense solution. It requires agencies to use, in whole or in part, \nan existing environmental review document if the existing document was \ncompleted for a\n\n[[Page S2147]]\n\npermit that is substantially the same as the permit under \nconsideration. This amendment doesn't exempt agencies from complying \nwith NEPA, and it does not provide for categorical exclusions. It \nsimply requires agencies to use their previous work so they don't have \nto reinvent the wheel.\n  I am disappointed that the majority continues to prevent the Senate \nfrom doing its job and that we heard an objection to these amendments. \nHigh gasoline prices are causing hardships for American families and \nAmerican businesses.\n  My Republican colleagues and I filed a number of amendments to S. \n2204. We would like to have votes on these amendments. We would like to \ntake steps to increase American oil production. Instead, as we just \nsaw, the majority says no. ``No'' to more American energy, they say; \n``no,'' they say to jobs; and ``no,'' they say to strengthening our \nenergy security. We can do better, and it is my hope that we will.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar). The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nno more than 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleagues who \nhave come down to the floor this afternoon for their efforts to offer \nwhat I believe are very substantive, very meaningful amendments to the \nlegislation that is before us. I think we can condense the message you \nhave heard here this afternoon pretty easily.\n  The fact is that the bill before us is highly misleading, and I don't \nbelieve it will work. The legislation that has been introduced, S. \n2204, is not going to put an end to Federal subsidies for oil and gas \nproducers because there are none. There are no subsidies here. The oil \nand gas industry actually sends money to the Federal Government to the \ntune of tens of billions of dollars each year, and it is not the other \nway around. Basic tax deductions that allow businesses to retain more \nof their earned dollars is not the equivalent of handing them a check. \nSo I think that is the first thing we need to get out on the table and \nmake very clear.\n  The second point I want to reinforce is that S. 2204 is simply not \ngoing to work. By definition, increasing costs will not lower prices. \nThere is nothing I can think of that, if we tax it more, it will make \nit more affordable and more abundant. It just doesn't work that way. \nAnd judging from both history and some recent international examples, \nit is virtually certain that S. 2204 would have damaging effects on \nthis country.\n  Back in 1980 the Carter administration imposed a windfall profits \ntax. We remember that. This was a tax that was imposed on domestic \ncrude oil. According to the Congressional Research Service, that tax \nreduced domestic oil production, it increased our dependence on foreign \nnations, and it collected far less in revenue than was expected.\n  The example that is more current on the international scene is one I \nspoke to yesterday, and that is the example in Great Britain. A year \nafter raising its oil tax rates, production declines in Great Britain \nhave increased from 6 percent per year to 18 percent per year. As a \nresult, Great Britain is reversing that course. They are now planning \nto offer new incentives to encourage producers to return to the North \nSea.\n  So all we need to do is look at a real-time example of what one \ncountry did in an effort to deal with high gas prices. They increase \nthe taxes, and investment and production goes overseas. Now they are \nturning the corner on this, and they are working to reduce their taxes.\n  I think there is clearly a better way. The other side of the aisle \nhas refused to even consider amendments that will increase Federal oil \nand gas production, create good jobs in this country, generate billions \nof dollars of Federal revenues at a time that we desperately need them, \nrestrain if not reduce gasoline prices, and increase our domestic \nenergy security.\n  We believe very strongly that the solution to these many problems \nshould be a reasonable combination of increased domestic production, \nfor which we have huge world-class untapped resources that are still \nlocked up by our Federal Government--America could be the world's \nlargest oil producer, and we could be independent of OPEC. That is \nreal. That is achievable. But we have to set our mind to it, we have to \nmake that happen, and we have to have the Federal Government get out of \nthe way or help us with the right incentives to do so.\n  The hundreds of billions of dollars in Federal revenues from \nincreased production could, and should, help support the research and \nthe development of our renewable resources, our alternative energy, as \nwell as efficiency and conservation. We know that building out the \nenergy of the future--renewables, alternatives--is expensive. How are \nwe going to fund it? Well, many of us believe that resources that come \nfrom expanded production could help us with that. Yet what we are \npresented with today is a bill that does nothing more than raise \ntaxes--raise taxes on an industry that has created good jobs, is \nproviding us with the resource that we need, and we are not even \nallowed to offer a single amendment to produce one additional drop of \nAmerican oil. I think that is unfortunate. I wish it were otherwise.\n  But I do think the debate, the discussion we have had on this floor \nin the past couple of days has been good and helpful in helping to \neducate the American public in terms of what we truly have as a nation \nin terms of our capacity and our capability to produce if given the \nopportunity.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What is the parliamentary situation at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority retains 16 minutes in time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am confused a little bit because didn't the minority \nget extra time? Did they not get extra time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator asked consent and no one objected.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, I would ask consent that I have an additional 5 \nminutes on the 16.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So, Madam President, I think it is very important that we \nunderstand what we are trying to do here.\n  The Senator from Alaska said it has been a good debate. Yes, it has \nbeen a good debate, but let me tell you what is not good. What is not \ngood is that Big Oil is getting corporate welfare. Big Oil is ripping \nus off at the pump. They never had greater profits. We are being asked \nto sacrifice and pay more at the pump because of instability in the \nworld, because of problems with the refineries, even though we have \nnever drilled as much as we are drilling now. Big Oil exports our oil \nnow. We have never had as many exports as we have now.\n  Big Oil gets billions of dollars of subsidies, so big that I would \ntell you, $2 billion a year in U.S. tax breaks. Let me tell you, to \nexplain how that compares to something we do that is very near and dear \nto my heart and to every mother and father, grandma, grandpa, or aunt \nand uncle, we put about $1 billion a year into afterschool programs, \nand we have millions of children waiting--$1 billion a year on \nafterschool programs while we give away $2 billion a year to the most, \nshall we say, successful companies in America.\n  I want to show you what I am talking about because I don't want \npeople to think this is rhetoric. These are the facts. When my \nRepublican colleagues come on the floor and defend these profits, let's \ntalk about what they are.\n  Now, remember, we have been in a deep recession for several years \nnow. Remember that President Obama and we had to confront the loss of \n800,000 jobs a month. Now, thank goodness, he has turned it around--we \nhave turned it around. It is still not good enough but we were in the \nworst situation. During that time, small businesses went out of \nbusiness. People lost their homes. If it were not for the leadership of \nthe President, we would have lost the auto industry in America. Thank \nyou, Mr. President, for saving the auto industry in America. Thank you \nfor that. I was proud to vote for that even though I had a lot of \nproblems with the auto industry not moving quickly enough to fuel \nefficient cars. Now they are doing a great job with it.\n\n[[Page S2148]]\n\n  During that time when Americans were suffering, we were bleeding all \nthese jobs and even now, just getting back on our feet, what has \nhappened to Big Oil while they have raised our prices at the pump? In \n2009, all the five oil companies made $64 billion. In 2010, Big Oil \nmade $76 billion, and in 2011 they made a whopping $137 billion. So \nthey went from $64 billion in 2009 to $137 billion in 2011, and my \nRepublican colleagues are crying bitter tears for them. Oh, let's keep \ngiving them that $2 billion a year.\n  Why would we do that when we are sacrificing and our constituents are \npaying more at the pump and Big Oil is profiting from it? There is no \nreason for this kind of increase at the pump. There is no reason for \nit. Look at what is going on here. If they made the normal profits, we \ncould have some relief at the pump. But, oh, no. So now the Republicans \nare going to reward them by allowing them to keep these subsidies.\n  That started a long time ago. That started in the 1980s, most of it, \nbecause we wanted to help them get moving. How much more do they have \nto earn before we say they can get off corporate welfare? You talk \nabout welfare queens, here it is. And my Republican friends defend \ngiving these people, who have ripped us off at the pump, billions of \ndollars of subsidies.\n  They are exporting the oil they recover here. They will not keep it \nin the country. We had a proposal for the XL Pipeline to keep the oil \nin the country. My friends on the other side of the aisle voted against \nit. They don't care, they just want these companies to have their way, \nto do with it what they want.\n  If they want to send our oil to China, fine, that is what they want. \nBut they also want to keep their subsidies. It is not right. I want to \nsee these subsidies done with and I want to see us invest in \nalternatives to these big oil companies that hold us by the throat. I \nwant to have alternatives.\n  I have been all over this country looking at the alternatives we are \ndeveloping now. We know, for example, in Brazil they use sugar cane to \ncreate their gasoline and they are completely free from imported oil. \nThat is the kind of thing we need to do. I am fortunate that I drive a \nhybrid vehicle and I get 50 miles to the gallon, so I don't go in for \ngas that often. But when you go in there, it is a shock. We want to \nhave cars--let them be big cars. If people need that for their \nfamilies, I understand it. I have grandkids. I know what it is to put \nyour grandkids in a small car. It is hard. We need to have larger cars. \nThey need to be fuel efficient. We are going to get there. We are \ngetting there already.\n  Isn't it better to take that money away from people who are ripping \nus off at the pump, away from the corporate welfare queens here, and \nput it into alternatives so our people are no longer victims to their \nprices? That is the fight we are having. That is the debate we are \nhaving.\n  On the other side they say drill, baby, drill. You know what, I am \nfor drilling where it makes sense. Do you know how many acres the oil \ncompanies are holding now that they have not drilled upon? It is pretty \namazing. My friends say open the Arctic to drilling--a precious \nenvironment, God-given, placed in a refuge by I believe it was Dwight \nEisenhower. They want to go in there and ravage it. Why don't they \ndrill on their nonproducing acres? It looks like 75 million \nnonproducing acres, onshore and offshore, on which they hold leases.\n  Oh, no, that is not good enough for them. They are only drilling on \n25 percent of the leases they hold, of the acreage they hold in those \nleases. How about ``use it or lose it,'' instead of ``drill, baby, \ndrill''? Drill, baby, drill in here. Don't go into the coast of \nCalifornia where they want to go, or Washington, or Oregon, where we \nhave fishing, tourism, recreation.\n  There are so many people here to whom I listen who make the arguments \nfor the oil companies. I am so tired of it. How about speaking up for \nthe American people who are getting brutalized at the pump? How about \nspeaking up for the people who make their living off of a beautiful, \npristine environment?\n  Oh, by the way, many jobs in my State, over 400,000 jobs, are related \nto a pristine coastline, and they don't care about that on the other \nside. They want to open it, push these people out of the way and create \na few jobs--because there are far fewer jobs created from drilling. As \nPresident Obama has said many times, and the other side gets rankled: \nWe only have 2 percent of the world's proven oil reserves and we use \nabout 20 percent of the energy. You do the math, as the President said. \nYou could drill in your grandmother's bathtub, you could drill in the \nGreat Lakes, you could drill anywhere you want--you are not going to \nfind enough oil.\n  So let's get off foreign oil, let's tell the oil companies to drill, \nbaby, drill where they have the acres and let's look at these prices \nand let's understand--we will look at it again--the profits of Big Oil. \nThey are crying all the way to the bank, as my dad used to say.\n  Look at this. In the height of the recession they are making record \nprofits and crying to keep their subsidies and my Republican friends \nare crying right along: Oh, here, have a tissue. We are so sorry for \nyou, even though we have to turn away millions of children from \nafterschool programs because we do not have more than $1 billion to \nspend on it. They are giving away $2 billion a year. That is just one \nexample.\n  I hope we vote for the Menendez bill. I hope we vote tomorrow on \nthat, to stop the filibuster, to vote it up or down. What a message of \nhope it will send to the American people, that we are willing to stand \nup to the biggest powers that be, that we are willing to fight for the \naverage American, that we are not in the pockets of Big Oil. You don't \nneed to give American taxpayer dollars to Big Oil. It is absolutely \nridiculous. We don't have to allow them to drill in pristine areas when \nthey will not even drill in areas that they have had under lease for \nyears. And let's stop them from exporting the oil. We need it. Let's \nkeep it here.\n\n  By the way, if they keep on ripping us off like this and getting \nrewarded for it from my Republican friends, let's release oil from the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve, and let's increase the supply and let's \nsee prices go down.\n  Let's look at the CEOs of Big Oil for a minute, these poor guys who \nare fighting for the subsidies. Let's look at them. CEOs for the big \nfive made more than $14.5 million in total compensation in 2010. This \nis it, average compensation. That is 307 times the average salary of a \nfirefighter; that is 273 times the average salary of a teacher; that is \n263 times the average salary of a policeman; that is 218 times the \naverage salary of a nurse. But they need subsidies for their companies \nand they need to rip us off at the pump so they can make a little more \nmoney--$14.5 million isn't enough for a poor oil company executive. \nGive me a break. And stop giving them a break because they don't need \nthis break.\n  We have an opportunity to stand for what is right and I hope we take \nit. Right now we want alternatives to Big Oil. We want competition for \nBig Oil. We want to be able to become energy independent. So let's stop \nthese taxpayer handouts. The oil companies do not need them. Let's \nstart investing in America's energy future which, by the way, that kind \nof investment creates many jobs at a time that we need to do that.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  I want to switch topics here for the remainder of my time and talk a \nminute about health care and then close with a little bit about the \nhighway bill over in the House and the struggle over there to get their \nwork done.\n  I ask how many minutes I have left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Chair advise me when I have 2 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, we all are watching what the Supreme \nCourt is going to do in terms of the health care bill they have before \nthem. What I want to do today is completely stay away from that \nargument and talk about what the health care bill is doing now, right \nnow as we speak, because people tend to get involved in mandates, and \nif it is constitutional, and how does it work and so on. I want to talk \nabout what the Obama health care plan is doing for my people at home, \nyour people back home, and the people of this country right now.\n\n[[Page S2149]]\n\n  As we stand here today, over 5 million seniors have saved more than \n$3 billion on their prescription drugs. The way it worked before this \nbill was passed, you would use up a certain amount of money and then \nyou would fall into this coverage gap that they call a doughnut hole, \nand just when you are at your sickest point, you get no help. A lot of \nour seniors were not taking their medicines at that critical point \nbecause they could not afford the full cost; they were cutting the \npills in half and praying. It was a sad situation. Because of health \ncare reform, we have these seniors being able to keep their medications \nflowing. Last year in my State, 300,000 seniors were able to save $171 \nmillion in their costs.\n  Let's look at that again. As a result of Obama health care, which I \nproudly supported, already 5 million senior citizens are able to afford \ntheir prescription drugs--your mother, your father, your grandma, your \ngrandpa. That is important. What is going to happen to these people if \nthis whole thing gets overturned? They will get sick and they will not \nhave those medications.\n  In addition, what else is happening--2.5 million young Americans are \nnow covered because they can stay on their parents' health plan until \nthey turn 26. Without this law, when you graduated from college you \nwere out of luck, and you had to find your own health care. The Obama \nplan said you should be able to stay on your parents' health plan until \nyou turn 26. I cannot tell you how many people have written to me to \nthank me for that.\n\n  So over there in the Supreme Court they are talking about legalese, \nand I appreciate that. They are talking about severability, and they \nare talking about a lot of interesting things. One thing I want to talk \nabout is what is going to happen to 5 million senior citizens who are \nable to stay on their medication as a result of the Obama health plan.\n  What is going to happen to the 2.5 million Americans who are young \nwho can stay on their parents' plan until they are 26 if something \nhappens over there across the street in terms of this legal case? In \nCalifornia 335,000 Californians have benefited from that young person \nbeing able to stay on their parents' insurance provision.\n  What is going to happen to 54 million Americans who now have access \nto free preventive care, such as screenings for colon cancer, \nmammograms, and flu shots? This is new, folks. Before we didn't get \nfree prevention. We had to pay a copayment. I have to tell you, as I \nlived my life and I have seen the tragedy of cancer, I have learned \nvery clearly that if you take care of yourself and have mammograms and \ncolon cancer screenings, your life can be saved.\n  What is going to happen to 54 million Americans who have that \npreventive care now if the Supreme Court strikes it down? Out of that \n54 million, 6 million Californians have gotten these screenings and \nvaccinations. I will close with health care on this story.\n  I don't know how many people realize this, but before the Obama \nhealth care plan there were caps on insurance policies. Maybe they were \na million-dollar cap or a half-million-dollar cap. Before I had \ndifferent insurance, I had a cap on my husband's policy. What happened \nat that time is, if you used up enough health care, you were finished \nat a certain point.\n  I want to tell you the story of Julie Walters of Nevato, CA. She \nwrote to me last year about her 3-year-old daughter Violet who suffers \nfrom a severe form of epilepsy. She wrote that Violet could hit her \nlifetime limit in 5 years. So here is a little baby who is reaching her \nlifetime limit, and her mom wrote:\n\n       A lifetime limit on insurance is a limit on Violet's \n     lifetime, and that is immoral.\n\n  Because of health care reform, there is no longer a lifetime limit. \nSo I wanted to point this out and so many other things that are totally \nessential to our people that are at stake across the street.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  In closing, before we reach our full time, I want to call on the \nHouse to take up and pass the Senate Transportation bill. There are 3 \nmillion jobs at risk. They cannot get their act together. Allow a vote \non the bipartisan Transportation bill and then leave for your vacation. \nBut don't just give us these extensions which are, frankly, death by \n1,000 cuts. We already know of six or seven States--including those in \nthe Northeast--that are laying people off because they don't have \ncertainty with the Transportation bill.\n  So I thank you very much. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for allowing me to finish.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/28/senate-section/article/S2149-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2149-S2154]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF MIRANDA DU TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                           DISTRICT OF NEVADA\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SUSIE MORGAN TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN \n                         DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Miranda Du, of Nevada, \nto be United States District Judge for the District of Nevada, and \nSusie Morgan, of Louisiana, to be United States District Judge for the \nEastern District of Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I would ask unanimous consent that the \ntime be divided equally but am I correct if we did the full 60 minutes, \nwe would start the first vote at 5:35 p.m.?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we divide \nthe time equally between now and 5:30 and the vote be at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today the Senate will finally vote on the \nnominations of Miranda Du to fill a judicial emergency vacancy in the \nU.S. District Court for the District of Nevada and Susie Morgan to fill \na judicial vacancy in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Louisiana. Both nominations have the bipartisan support of their \nhome state Senators, and were reported by the Judiciary Committee over \n4 months ago. The Senate is still only considering judicial nominations \nthat could and should have been confirmed last year. The judicial \nvacancy rate remains nearly twice what it was at this point in the \nfirst term of President George W. Bush.\n\n  Last week, I noted an article about the ``crushing caseload'' that \nthe Federal courts in Arizona currently face. In that article, the \nChief Judge of Arizona's Federal trial court noted that they are in \n``dire circumstances'' and that they are ``under water'' from all the \ncases on their docket. Like the district court in Arizona, the one in \nNevada is also in desperate need of judges, as evidenced by its \ndesignation as a judicial emergency. As that same article noted, an \ninsufficiency of judges ``lessens the quality of justice for all \nparties involved.'' This is why it is so crucial that we confirm these \nnominees as soon as possible.\n  Delay is harmful for everyone. An editorial from the Tuscaloosa News \nlast week stated that ``[D]elays are objectionable in themselves: They \ndeprive the courts of needed personnel, slow the administration of \njustice and deter well-qualified candidates from agreeing to be \nconsidered for the bench.'' I ask unanimous consent to include a copy \nof the article, entitled ``Congress needs to stop judicial partisan \ngames,'' in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. The needless 4-month delay in the consideration of these \nnominations is another example of the delays that have been caused by \nSenate Republicans' unwillingness to agree to schedule these \nnominations for votes last year. As the editorial from the Tuscaloosa \nNews noted: ``[T]he determination of Senate Republicans to delay \nPresident Barack Obama's judicial nominees--even those who have won \nbipartisan support from the Judiciary Committee--is emblematic of the\n\n[[Page S2150]]\n\npolarization that also has sabotaged efforts of the two parties to work \ntogether on numerous other fronts.'' The editorial concludes by urging \nthat there be ``no more partisan games.''\n  A recent memorandum from the Congressional Research Service confirms \nwhat we have long known: The delay and obstruction from Senate \nRepublicans have resulted in President Obama's judicial nominees \nwaiting much longer for a floor vote than judicial nominees under the \npast four Presidents. These tactics, of course, have resulted in a much \nlower number and percentage of confirmed judicial nominees under \nPresident Obama--despite the fact that President Obama's judicial \nnominees have by and large been consensus nominees.\n  The consequences of these months of delays are borne by the more than \n150 million Americans who live in districts and circuits with vacancies \nthat could be filled as soon as Senate Republicans agree to up or down \nvotes on the 17 judicial nominations currently before the Senate. Our \ncourts need qualified Federal judges, not vacancies, if they are to \nreduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their day \nin court. It is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who turn to \ntheir courts for justice to suffer unnecessary delays. When an injured \nplaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her medical expenses, \nthat plaintiff should not have to wait 3 years before a judge hears the \ncase. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they \nshould not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute.\n  Today, we can finally end the needless delays on these two qualified \nnominees. Miranda Du was born in Vietnam. She left the country with her \nfamily by boat in 1978 and immigrated to the United States after \nspending a year in refugee camps in Malaysia. If confirmed, she will \nbecome the first Asian Pacific American appointed to the Federal bench \nin Nevada. Both of Nevada's Senators, the Majority Leader and \nRepublican Senator Dean Heller, support Ms. Du's nomination. Senator \nHeller has said that Ms. Du will ``make an outstanding district court \njudge.'' She also has the support of the Republican Governor of Nevada, \nBrian Sandoval; the Republican Lieutenant Governor of Nevada, Brian \nKrolicki; and the Republican Mayor of Reno, Robert Cashell; each of \nwhom has personally worked with Ms. Du. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a copy of the letters of support from these \nindividuals at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Governor Sandoval fully supports Ms. Du's nomination. In \nhis recommendation letter, he wrote that when Ms. Du appeared before \nhim when he was a judge, she ``was always well prepared and represented \nher clients with integrity and distinction.'' He further stated that \nshe had his ``full support'' for confirmation as a Federal district \njudge. Ironically, he was the judge in the one case on which \nRepublicans rely to criticize the nominee. As the judge, he had \noverlooked the jurisdictional argument when initially deciding against \ndismissing the case. The Magistrate Judge on the case issued sanctions, \nbut Governor Sandoval ultimately struck the motion for sanctions as \nmoot when Ms. Du and her legal team resolved the dispute with the \nthird-party. In addition, Ms. Du testified candidly about the incident \nduring her Committee hearing and in her response to the Questions for \nthe Record, acknowledged that she had ``learned a great deal from this \nexperience.'' Incidents like this have never held up a nomination \nbefore in the past, and it should certainly not hold up Ms. Du's \nnomination. President Obama's nominees should not be held to a \ndifferent or new standard.\n  She has spent her 17-year legal career in private practice as a \npartner at a law firm in Reno, Nevada. She currently serves as chair of \nthe firm's Employment & Labor Law Group. Ms. Du's story is compelling. \nShe was selected by Super Lawyers as a 2009 ``Mountain States Rising \nStar'' and was named as one of the ``Top 20 Under 40'' Young \nProfessionals in the Reno-Tahoe Area in 2008. That she is being opposed \nbecause she and her legal team filed a third-party complaint on behalf \nof a client in one case is to hold her to a new standard than Senate \nRepublicans have utilized with other nominees and other Presidents in \nthe past.\n  The other nominee we consider today is Susie Morgan. She has worked \nin private practice for 30 years. Her nomination has the bipartisan \nsupport of Louisiana's Senators, Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu and \nRepublican Senator David Vitter. Following her law school graduation, \nMs. Morgan clerked for Chief Judge Henry A. Politz of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit. She was unanimously rated as qualified \nby the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary to serve as a Federal judge in the Eastern District of \nLouisiana. Her nomination was approved unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee last November.\n  The Senate needs to make real progress, which means going beyond the \nnominations included in the agreement between Senate leaders to include \nthe 17 judicial nominations currently before the Senate for a final \nvote and the eight judicial nominees who have had hearings and are \nworking their way through the Committee process. There are another 11 \nnominations on which the Committee should be holding additional \nhearings during the next several weeks.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From Tuscaloosanews.com, Mar. 22, 2012]\n\n       Editorial: Congress Needs To Stop Judicial Partisan Games\n\n       Delays in the confirmation of federal judges aren't \n     uppermost in Americans' minds when they complain about \n     partisan dysfunction in Congress. But the determination of \n     Senate Republicans to delay President Barack Obama's judicial \n     nominees--even those who have won bipartisan support from the \n     Judiciary Committee--is emblematic of the polarization that \n     also has sabotaged efforts of the two parties to work \n     together on numerous other fronts. And the delays are \n     objectionable in themselves: They deprive the courts of \n     needed personnel, slow the administration of justice and \n     deter well-qualified candidates from agreeing to be \n     considered for the bench.\n       So it's a hopeful sign that Republicans have agreed to vote \n     on 14 judicial nominations by May 7. It would be heartening \n     to report that the Republicans agreed to the votes because \n     they repented of the obstructionism of some of their members, \n     but in fact their agreement followed a power play by Senate \n     Majority Leader Harry Reid, D Nev., who filed cloture motions \n     to try to force votes on 17 nominations.\n       Rather irrelevantly, Republicans had complained that Reid \n     hadn't made judicial confirmations a priority. Now he has. \n     Republicans also have faulted the Obama administration for \n     being slow to fill vacancies on district and appeals courts. \n     That is a fair criticism. There are 81 vacancies but only 39 \n     pending nominees (including two for future vacancies). But it \n     is Republicans who have withheld the unanimous consent \n     necessary for nominations already approved by the Judiciary \n     Committee to move forward expeditiously and without prolonged \n     debate. The latest pretext for delay was the desire to \n     protest Obama's recess appointments to federal agencies, but \n     Republicans have been reluctant to allow Democrats to score a \n     political point by promptly confirming Obama's judicial \n     nominees.\n       When Reid first proposed swift action on the nominations, \n     Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R Ky., complained: \n     ``This is just a very transparent attempt to try to slam dunk \n     the minority and make them look like they are obstructing \n     things they aren't obstructing.'' But then McConnell added \n     that ``this is going to, of course, be greeted with \n     resistance.'' In other words, if you accuse us of being \n     obstructionist, we'll make you pay by being obstructionist. \n     This is partisanship at its pettiest.\n       The White House complains that the Senate has taken four to \n     five times as long to confirm Obama's nominees as it did to \n     approve George W. Bush's. Nevertheless, several of Bush's \n     nominations were delayed or derailed by Senate Democrats, \n     including eminently qualified appeals court nominees whom \n     they feared might be potential Republican appointees to the \n     Supreme Court.\n       Controversial or not, every judicial nominee deserves \n     serious consideration by the Senate and an expeditious up-or-\n     down vote--and no more partisan games.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                   Las Vegas, NV, August 22, 2011.\n     Re Recommendation of Miranda Du\n\n     Hon.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing in enthusiastic support of \n     Miranda Du's nomination to the United States District Court \n     for the District of Nevada.\n       As Nevada's Lieutenant Governor, I have the privilege of \n     serving as Chairman of the Nevada Commission on Economic \n     Development (NCED), whose mission is to promote a robust \n     diversified and prosperous economy for Nevada. In this \n     capacity, I have served with Ms. Du since she was appointed \n     to the Commission in July 2008.\n       As a NCED commissioner, Ms. Du has demonstrated many \n     qualities that will make her an ideal Federal District Court \n     Judge. She is intelligent, inquisitive, reliable and \n     dedicated. She is an active and involved commission, always \n     prepared and informed, and she is not afraid to ask tough \n     questions. She conducts herself in a professional and \n     dignified manner. I think that both Nevada and the United \n     States will benefit from Ms. Du's appointment to the Federal \n     Bench and I strongly encourage the Senate to confirm Ms. Du.\n           Best regards,\n                                                Brian K.

Chuck Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Grassley: I am writing in support \n     of the nomination of Nevada Attorney Miranda Du to the United \n     States District Court for the District of Nevada.\n       I have known Ms. Du for quite some time. For the last eight \n     years, I have had the opportunity to observe her legal skills \n     and temperament primarily in my role as a member of the Board \n     of Directors of the Truckee Meadows Water Authority \n     (``TMWA''), which is partly owned by the City of Reno. Ms. Du \n     has represented TMWA on several matters, and she has been \n     both effective and professional in that representation. Ms. \n     Du is intelligent, articulate and even-tempered. She is \n     direct and always seems prepared in responding to questions \n     from the TMWA Board. I believe she will be a great addition \n     to our federal bench. I strongly recommend her for \n     confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Robert A. Cashell, Sr.,\n                                                            Mayor.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, continuing the time that has been \nallotted to me, I ask unanimous consent that the following statement \nappear as though in morning business, but I will utilize the time now \nallotted to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, with \nthe time to be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I want to ask, Mr. President, if it is appropriate for \nme to speak on the judges who will be up for a vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, again, we are moving forward under the \nregular order and procedures of the Senate. This year, we have been in \nsession for about 35 days, including today. During that time we will \nhave confirmed 14 judges. That is an average of better than one \nconfirmation for every 3 days. With the confirmations today, the Senate \nwill have confirmed nearly 75 percent of President Obama's article III \njudicial nominations.\n  Despite the progress we are making, we still hear complaints about \nthe judicial vacancy rate. We are filling those vacancies. But again, I \nwould remind my colleagues that of the 81 current vacancies, 47 have no \nnominee. That is 58 percent of vacancies with no nominee.\n  So I am growing a bit weary of the vacancy rate being blamed on \nSenate Republicans.\n  I have spoken on numerous occasions about the seriousness with which \nI undertake the advice and consent function of the Senate, as I know we \nall do. Our inquiry of the qualifications of nominees must be more than \nintelligence, a pleasant personality, an inspirational life story, or a \nprestigious clerkship.\n  When I became ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \narticulated my standards for judicial nominees. I want to ensure that \nthe men and women who are appointed to a lifetime position in the \nFederal judiciary are qualified to serve. Factors I consider important \ninclude intellectual ability, respect for the Constitution, fidelity to \nthe law, personal integrity, appropriate judicial temperament, and \nprofessional competence.\n  In applying these standards, I have demonstrated good faith in \nensuring fair consideration of judicial nominees. I have worked with \nthe majority to confirm consensus nominees.\n  In fact, of the 138 judges confirmed so far, I have voted in favor of \nover 90 percent of President Obama's judicial nominees. This includes \nsupporting 100 of the 108 district judges we have confirmed during \nPresident Obama's term of office.\n  However, today on the agenda is a nominee that in my judgment does \nnot measure up to the criteria I have outlined. Ms. Miranda Du was \nnominated to be a U.S. district judge for the District of Nevada on \nAugust 2, 2011.\n  We have heard Ms. Du's life story--leaving Vietnam following the war; \nliving in refugee camps with her family; coming to America at a young \nage; obtaining an education and establishing herself in a respectable \ncareer. She has risen above disadvantages that most of us can't \nimagine. This is a great success story, and we congratulate her for \nthese notable accomplishments.\n  However, this is not sufficient for confirmation to a lifetime \nappointment as a Federal judge. We all can think of similar success \nstories. Miguel Estrada immigrated to America at a young age, graduated \nfrom Harvard, clerked at the Supreme Court, and had a prestigious legal \ncareer. His confirmation to the Federal court was defeated by a \nDemocratic filibuster.\n  Justice Thomas grew up in humble circumstances, rose above his \ndisadvantaged background to graduate from Yale Law School, faced \ndiscrimination in legal hiring, but went on to an illustrious public \nservice career. He was barely confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n  Janice Rogers Brown, an African-American female, was the daughter of \nsharecroppers. Overcoming these circumstances, she graduated from UCLA \nSchool of Law working her own way through while being a single mother. \nShe served in California State government and on the California Supreme \nCourt. Her Federal judicial nomination faced a Democratic filibuster \nbefore she was finally confirmed by a vote of 56 to 43.\n  I bring up these examples to point out that many individuals we \nconsider for judicial positions have overcome difficult circumstances \nin life. Most are examples of the American dream. Some are confirmed, \nothers are not. But in each case, the gender or race of the individual, \nor the particular life story was not part of the consideration of \nwhether or not to confirm to a lifetime appointment. So while I think \nMs. Du's accomplishments are admirable, they are not the basis for \nevaluating her qualifications to serve as a Federal district judge.\n  The relevant factors for me are her ability and professional \ncompetence. In those areas, she does not meet the standards I would \nconsider necessary for a Federal judge.\n  I would note that the ABA has rated Ms. Du with a partial ``not \nqualified'' rating. She states she was ``involved in'' four jury trials \nand has limited criminal law experience. As I have stated before, this \nis no place for on-the-job training.\n  A mere 16 legislative days after her nomination, Ms. Du appeared at \nher nominations hearing. At that hearing, she was asked about a case in \nwhich she was lead counsel. Ms. Du was the\n\n[[Page S2152]]\n\npartner in charge of handling the case of Woods v. Truckee Meadows \nWater Authority.\n  In that case, she filed a motion to dismiss the original complaint. \nBut she failed to raise the lack of subject matter jurisdiction as a \nreason to dismiss the case. The court, therefore, denied her motion. \nMs. Du then filed a third-party complaint against the local union. But \nthe union's counsel recognized that there was no subject matter \njurisdiction. Therefore, they advised Ms. Du, in a six-page letter, \nthat the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The union, \ntherefore, warned Ms. Du that they would seek sanctions if Ms. Du did \nnot withdraw her complaint. Rather than recognizing her mistake and \nfiling a second motion to dismiss, Ms. Du went forward with the third-\nparty complaint. In response, the union proceeded exactly as they said \nthey would: They filed a motion to dismiss and filed for sanctions.\n  The district court agreed there was no subject matter jurisdiction \nand dismissed the action. In addressing the sanctions issue, the court \nstated:\n\n       Having reviewed the record and considered arguments of \n     counsel at the hearing on this motion, the court finds that . \n     . . TMWA's counsel acted recklessly. . . .\n\n  Let me remind you, TMWA's counsel was the nominee, Ms. Du. The court \nsaid she acted recklessly. The court went on to state that TMWA--\nreferring to Ms. Du's client--``has not advanced a legitimate, good \nfaith reason for bringing the Union into this litigation.'' \nAccordingly, the court concluded sanctions were warranted.\n  At her hearing, Senator Lee asked her if she agreed with the court's \nassessment that her conduct was reckless. She stated that she did not \nbelieve that she was reckless.\n  In written follow-up questions, I asked her again about the court \nfinding her reckless, and she responded that she disagreed with the \nmagistrate judge's finding. Let me be clear: The finding of reckless \naction on her part was not a mere observation of the court, but a legal \nfinding. That finding allowed the court to award sanctions pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. 1927.\n  I was troubled that she would fail to acknowledge the finding of the \ncourt that she was reckless. I think this demonstrates a lack of \nhumility, which is an essential element of being a Federal judge. I \nunderstand attorneys may make mistakes or have differing views on \nlitigation strategy. However, this is not the case in this situation. \nMs. Du was put on notice of her flawed motion, was warned of the \nconsequences of proceeding, but went forward anyway. That is why the \ncourt found her to be ``reckless.'' Her subsequent attempt to downplay \nthis serious matter goes against the standards for judicial nominees \nwhich I previously discussed.\n  There is another substantive legal element that concerns me as well. \nThat is her apparent lack of knowledge or disregard for the law \nregarding subject matter jurisdiction. Senator Lee's questions at the \nhearing on this issue I think demonstrate a lack of ability or \nprofessional competence.\n  Her written responses to questions for the record failed to \nadequately explain her legal reasoning or to clarify the issues raised \nat her hearing.\n  Accordingly, Senate Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee \nunanimously opposed reporting her nomination to the Senate.\n  I would note that more than 2 months after her hearing, and more than \none month after she was listed on the Executive Calendar, Ms. Du sent a \nletter addressed to me and Senator Lee. In that letter, she apologized \nfor her earlier unclear explanations and for her misstatements. While I \nappreciated her response to me, the doubts I have about her ability and \ncompetence remain. Therefore, I cannot support this nomination and urge \na ``no'' vote on this nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know Senator Inhofe was on the floor, \nand if I could ask unanimous consent that after I speak, he would be \nnext to speak, and then the good Senator, Mr. Lee, from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  It is my distinct privilege to come to the floor this afternoon to \nvoice my full support for Susie Morgan's confirmation as an article III \njudge on the U.S. Eastern District Court of Louisiana.\n  I have known Susie for many years. She is a good friend and, more \nimportantly, she is an excellent and outstanding attorney.\n  Ms. Morgan comes to this position equipped with decades of litigation \nexperience in Federal court as an advocate for both plaintiffs and \ndefendants. She brings a thorough understanding of Federal law and an \nunquestionably fair and evenhanded temperament.\n  It is unfortunate that such a talented individual such as Susie \nMorgan has been waiting nearly a year since President Obama nominated \nher in July of 2011, and almost 5 months since she was voted out of \ncommittee unanimously.\n  Despite what the good Senator from Iowa--my good friend and wonderful \npartner in so many important issues here--has said, the fact is there \nare 17 judicial nominees on this calendar. There are 19 judicial \nnominees in committee. The facts are that the nominees for President \nObama have taken nearly five times longer to receive a vote on this \nfloor.\n  We know there are some vacancies that have not yet received \nnominations. But there is no reason to deny these 17 who are still on \nthe calendar their day on this floor. Ms. Morgan has waited more than \nher turn, and I apologize for that. She understands this has been \ncaught up in bigger politics. It has nothing to do with her nomination \nspecifically or her outstanding qualifications. But I do think we have \nto be honest about these delays and see what we can do to move people \nwho are qualified, such as this nominee, so much more quickly because \nthe courts need their help.\n  Ms. Morgan earned an advanced degree from the University of Louisiana \nat Monroe. She graduated from there, earning both her undergraduate and \nmaster's degrees. Then she earned a law degree on top of that, \ngraduating in the top 5 percent of her class at Louisiana State \nUniversity's Paul Hebert Law Center.\n  Immediately after earning her JD, Susie served as a law clerk for one \nof Louisiana's most respected legal minds, Judge Henry Politz of the \nU.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  At the conclusion of that Federal clerkship, she began practicing in \nShreveport, LA, for one of our most respected firms, Wiener, Weiss & \nMadison.\n  For the next 25 years, she honed her skills. She was one of the most \ncapable civil defense attorneys in both Federal and State court.\n  After years of successful practice in Shreveport, Susie was recruited \nby one of the most prestigious law firms in Louisiana, Phelps Dunbar, \nand has since served as a partner for the firm where she specializes in \ncommercial litigation.\n  She served in a variety of posts, as many of our wonderful nominees \nhave--serving without much fanfare but with great impact on many \ncommittees of the Louisiana bar, the Federal bar, et cetera. One of the \nmost important that I want to mention here is that for 14 years she \nchaired a rules committee. It is not the sexiest kind of committee, not \nsomething known to the public, but it is so important to the practice \nof law for the thousands of attorneys who practice in Louisiana. She \nspent years behind the scenes improving Louisiana's State court \nproceedings. For almost 14 years, as I said, she chaired the rules \ncommittee and Louisiana Bar Association. Thanks to her leadership, the \nLouisiana Supreme Court agreed to replace an old and antiquated system \nwhere each judicial district in Louisiana adhered to its own set of \nidiosyncratic set rules, and now we have a uniform set of rules for the \nentire State. I think that is a special tribute to her tenacity, to her \nwillingness to serve and do the hard work behind the scenes without a \nlot of public credit.\n  I am also impressed with the legal protection services she has \noffered to the homeless at St. Joseph's, the Harry Thompson Center in \nNew Orleans, and the multiple community works she has done pre- and \npost-Katrina in our community. She has had a career that has \ndemonstrated her willingness to work hard and to stay at the job, get \nthe job\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\ndone, to be fair, curious, and respectful and, of course, she is most \nknowledgeable of the law, which she has so well served. I am so proud \nto support her nomination. I am proud that President Obama accepted my \nsuggestion and nominated her. I am very pleased. She should receive a \nfull and strong vote in the Senate. She has the support of myself and \nthe other Senator, my partner from Louisiana, Senator Vitter. I am very \npleased to speak on her behalf today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I rise to express serious concerns that I \nhave with the nomination of Miranda Du to serve as a judge on the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Nevada.\n  In 2007, the very same court to which Ms. Du has been nominated \nimposed sanctions on Ms. Du for ``multiplying the proceedings . . . \nunreasonably and vexatiously.'' (28 U.S.C. section 1927.) The basis of \nthis sanctions order was Ms. Du's prior refusal to dismiss a complaint \nshe had filed on behalf of her client, even after the party her client \nwas suing informed her--and she did not dispute--that the Federal \nDistrict Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. In imposing these \nsanctions on Ms. Du, the district court stated that she ``acted \nrecklessly in failing to consider seriously the basic issue of lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction when the [opposing party] brought it to \n[her] attention.''\n  Ms. Du's errors were egregious, particularly because they involved \nFederal subject matter jurisdiction--the very basis of the limited \njurisdictional reach of the Federal court system for which she has been \nnominated to be a judge. Ms. Du has not provided a satisfactory \nexplanation for her conduct, but instead has repeatedly attempted to \nminimize the significance of her errors.\n  When asked at her Judiciary Committee hearing why, in addition to \ndismissing her complaint against the third-party defendant, she did not \nhave the case against her client dismissed for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction, Ms. Du responded that she did ``not realize this was a \nmatter [she] could raise,'' and that she in fact did raise subject \nmatter jurisdiction but on other grounds ``that the district court \ndisagreed with.'' However, as pointed out in a letter members of the \nJudiciary Committee sent to Ms. Du following her hearing, court filings \nshow that she did not raise the issue of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  In response to that letter, Ms. Du stated that she ``misspoke'' at \nher Judiciary Committee hearing and that she in fact had not raised the \nbasic issue of subject matter jurisdiction. Troublingly, Ms. Du's \nbelated candor was marred by an additional misleading attempt to \nminimize these same errors.\n  In her letter, Ms. Du stated that the ``motion for sanctions was \nlater dismissed as moot and no sanctions were ultimately imposed.'' By \ngoing out of her way to make this misrepresentation, Ms. Du attempted \nto suggest that her sanctions were somehow not upheld or not imposed. \nTo the contrary, after the court was burdened with a number of \nadditional filings and motions regarding how much Ms. Du should pay in \nsanctions for her reckless conduct, the parties settled the issue out \nof court. The only matter that was mooted was the dispute over how much \nMs. Du should pay, not whether she should pay. It is misleading for Ms. \nDu to affirmatively assert to members of the Judiciary Committee that \n``no sanctions were imposed'' when the district court found that her \nbehavior was reckless and plainly required and imposed such sanctions.\n  In light of the gravity of Ms. Du's errors and the importance to our \nFederal judiciary of the issue of subject matter jurisdiction, as well \nas Ms. Du's repeated attempts to minimize her errors, I must express \nserious concerns with her nomination and encourage my colleagues to \nvote against her nomination.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, there have been a lot of comments made \nabout energy, and I have to admit I come from an energy State. One-\nthird of our economy is connected to energy in one way or another. I \nthink the political games we are playing are just that.\n  I have a vision that I can see 50 years of prosperity for America on \nthe basis of one thing; that is, actually using the wonderful resources \nthat are in our country for our citizens and extend an opportunity for \nour kids, in spite of our budget deficits, in spite of our debt, that \nwould enable them to have the same kind of opportunities we have had. \nThe way we do that is to utilize the resources.\n  If we look around the world and we look at the most stable countries, \nwe look at Canada, what is happening? Canada is living within their \nmeans. They have fairly low tax rates. They are utilizing their \nresources. They have trade surpluses.\n  If we look at Australia, they have a stable currency. Their currency \nhas markedly appreciated compared to the dollar. The Canadian currency \nhas markedly appreciated compared to the dollar. They are utilizing \ntheir resources to advance their country and their wealth and their \nopportunity. We hear all of these statements made by lots of people, \nbut most of them are half truths. Let me explain what I mean.\n\n  There is nobody who disagrees that it is going to take us at least 25 \nto 30 years to wean ourselves from carbon fuels, if in fact we should \ndo that. But let's say we should. What is the difference between \nburning a carbon atom that is coming from the Middle East or Venezuela \nversus a carbon atom that we produce here? We are going to do that. \nRight now 30 percent of our oil comes from either the Middle East or \nVenezuela, not necessarily areas of the world that are akin to being \nkind to us as a nation.\n  Here is the difference: If we burn our carbon atoms, we add between 2 \nmillion and 4 million jobs over the next 10 years. Maybe even more than \nthat. If we burn our carbon atoms--which we are going to burn carbon \nfor at least 25 years--we decrease our trade deficit by at least $200 \nbillion a year. That is $200 billion of wealth that does not leave our \nNation, and actually it is more than that because if we get $200 \nbillion worth of American oil and American energy, that creates another \n$50 billion to $60 billion worth of economic multipliers.\n  We are the only Nation in the world where we have the natural \nresources to make ourselves energy independent, and yet our government \nwill not allow us to have access to that energy. So my challenge to my \ncolleagues, given the fact that we will burn carbon--we don't even have \nto have a discussion about global warming or climate change because \neven the best estimate is it is going to take us 25 years to 30 years \nto get off carbon. So during that 25 to 30 years, should we not utilize \nand should we not create a way in which we actually consume our own \nresources rather than send money and wealth out of this country to be \nable to utilize the resources of someone else?\n  I am for conservation. I am for increased mileage. I am for doing \neverything we can to wean ourselves from a dependency on a foreign \nsource for our energy.\n  Other than our debt, the greatest risk this country faces is our \ndependency and reliance on somebody else for our energy needs. If we \ntake our friends in Mexico and Canada and we take what we are \nproducing, we are able to attain 70 percent. That is a tremendous \nchange over the last few years, and that doesn't have anything to do \nwith the present administration.\n  As a matter of fact, oil production, natural gas production, both \nonshore and offshore, is down in double digits under this \nadministration. Permitting--not new lands that have been opened--\nexisting lands that are open has dropped to 40 percent in terms of the \npermitting process. In our Nation we have over 1.2 trillion barrels of \noil equivalent that we can access if, in fact, we would. That is more \nthan any other nation in the world.\n  So what is it that the big political fight is about? Do we want to \nsend wealth out of this country? Do we not want to take advantage of \nwhat is available to us simply because of our location as a nation that \nwill actually create tremendous opportunities for our children, that \nwill create a new vision of America that is energy independent as we \ntransition off of carbon-based fuel?\n  Why would we not want to do that when there is no difference in \nburning an imported carbon atom versus burning a carbon atom produced \nhere? The benefits are obvious.\n  We have a bill we are considering that, to me, is mindless. It is \nabout the politics of division, and it is not about any truth. The fact \nis the major oil companies that reside in our country pay the highest \ntax rate of anybody in the world. They pay over 41.5 percent of every \ndollar of revenue they make straight to the Federal Government. There \nare not any other businesses that compare to that. Google doesn't \ncompare to that; Facebook doesn't compare to that; Apple doesn't \ncompare to it. They are all half that rate.\n  So we are already taxing the oil companies to the tune of almost $36 \nbillion, which went to the Treasury from the major oil companies in \nthis country. The bill we have on the floor will not improve the \nrevenue $1, and that is a fact. There will not be an increase of $1 \nover a 10-year period that will come to the Federal Government if we \npass this bill.\n  Why is that? Most people don't know but my background is as an \naccountant. That was my first training, my first field. Accelerated \ndepreciation just delays the time at which the Federal Government gets \nthe tax dollars it is going to collect. It doesn't change the total \namount of tax dollars, it just delays it so we match revenues with \nexpenses, which is one of the things you are trained to do in \naccounting and in business.\n  By the way, oil depletion allowance is not allowed for the large oil \ncompanies. It is not allowed for them. It has been gone for over 20 \nyears. So we set up accelerated depreciation on what is called \nintangible drilling costs. It would not have any major effect on the \nbig companies, but it will literally kill the smaller capitalized \ncompanies because their capital needs are recaptured over a long period \nof time if we eliminate intangible drilling costs. So what does that \nmean? That means we will have less exploration in our country. We will \nactually harm the exploration for the middle and small oil companies.\n  Some will say: Well, we don't want to do that for them. We don't want \nto affect the small oil companies. We just want to affect the big oil \ncompanies.\n  The big oil companies will pay no increase change in their net taxes \nover a period of 10 years. So the only thing we can actually claim with \nthis bill is the time value of money over that period of time, and the \ntime value of money right now is less than 2 percent a year.\n  So what are we talking about? We are talking about a political game, \nand we are not talking about energy security. We are not talking about \ncreating 2 million to 4 million jobs. We are not talking about \nsubstance. We are talking about politics, and the shame is that nobody \nout there is talking about a vision where America doesn't send $200 \nbillion of its wealth out of the country. There is no reason for us to \ndo that, and we have had every excuse except a legitimate one for why \nwe should not burn our own oil and our own natural gas liquids.\n\n[[Page S2155]]\n\n  What we have seen in this country in the last 5 to 7 years on private \nlands--that doesn't have anything to do with the Federal Government--is \na renaissance in energy independence, moving us from importing over 55 \npercent to 60 percent of our oil from both the Middle East and \nVenezuela to 30 percent. That is a big change. Why is it that North \nDakota, Montana, Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Louisiana, areas of \nPennsylvania, and now West Virginia, are seeing declines in their \nunemployment rate? It is all because they are producing energy that we \nare going to burn no matter where it comes from, and we should be \nburning our own assets.\n\n  The other thing that we don't think about is the fact that these \nenergy companies have made a marked difference in the cost of everyday \ngoods for every American in this country. Go into the kitchen and look \nat all the products in the kitchen. Go into the bathroom and look at \nall the products in the bathroom. The fact is, natural gas at $2.13--1 \nmillion Btus today--has enabled us to now become competitive worldwide \nin fertilizer, polyethylene, all of the raw materials for packaging for \nsynthetic goods from clothing to vinyls to housing materials.\n  What has happened is a renewal in manufacturing in this country on \nthe basis of this large expansion of available natural gas. If we do \nthat with oil as well, what we are going to do is set up our country to \nbeat everybody in the world in terms of petrochemical byproducts. Why \nwould we not want to do that? Why would we put anything as a roadblock \nto that?\n  We have heard all the debate. The best part I know that seems the \noddest to me is to think that doing this is not going to have an impact \non prices. We all talk about the fact that oil is a global commodity, \nand at the same time we are saying American speculation on oil is why \nthe price is higher.\n  Well, there is not just American speculation on oil, we can trade all \nover the world today in the commodities. Why is there a $15 to $20 \npremium right now? Because of the situation in the Middle East with \nIran. Would the prices come down if that political situation were gone? \nYes. Would the prices come down if we eliminated every American's \nability to speculate or hedge a bet against the price of oil? \nAbsolutely not. Because the price of oil is set on the world market, \nnot on the American market, and it is traded by everybody around the \nworld.\n  So the best way to lower the price of oil is to solve the problems in \nthe Middle East but produce more. Prices go down when production goes \nup.\n  So the fact is, we have an administration that has taken credit for \nsomething they obviously are not responsible for, which is exploration \non private lands, and has denied the fact that they have limited the \nability of those people who actually have leases but no permits on \npublic lands to explore for oil.\n  One of the answers we hear from the Secretary of the Interior is, \nnobody wants to permit new natural gas. No, they don't, not at $2.13. \nBut they all want to permit in the areas where there is oil or natural \ngas liquids except the permitting has been slowed down. The new plan is \nto cut the permits in half on lands that have already been opened for \nexploration.\n  I would invite all of the critics to come to Oklahoma to see where we \ndrilled for oil. More oil rigs are run in this country by Oklahoma \ncompanies than anybody else in the country combined. They do it well. \nThey do it in an environmentally sound way. They do it with the \nsmallest footprint we can imagine, and they are held to accountability \nby every corporation commission throughout the country.\n  I know in the Presiding Officer's State their corporation commission \nis right on top of it. We have 60 years of experience in Oklahoma with \nfracking. We have never had one contamination of any water zone in 60 \nyears in the State--second to Texas and Louisiana--that has drilled \nmore holes in the ground than any other State in the country. So what \nwe hear is all the reasons why we shouldn't create an opportunity \nthrough our natural resources for our kids rather than why we should, \nand it is time we should.\n\n  There is one other thing affecting the price of oil that people don't \ntalk about very often, and that happens to be the value of the dollar. \nWhen the dollar declines in value, when we have deficit spending and \nbig debt, the price of oil goes up. Why is that? Because the price of \noil is traded in dollars. So when the world sees us not addressing our \ndeficit issue, our debt issue, the value of the dollar declines. Ten \nyears ago the value of the euro versus the dollar was 96 cents. It is \n$1.32 today. So we can buy only two-thirds as much as we could 10 years \nago in terms of products from Europe. That has an impact on the price \nof oil. If the dollar were strong, if we managed our budget well, if we \ndidn't have deficits, oil would go down.\n  So the next time we are angry about paying $4-plus for a gallon of \ngas, the only place we have to look is the U.S. Congress because if we \nweren't running deficits, if we were making the tough decisions, the \nvalue of the dollar would be much stronger, the purchasing power of \nthat dollar would be stronger, and the value of oil would be less. \nPeople don't talk about that. They just assume it is just the world \nmarket. It is not. It is that what we do here matters. The fact is, we \ndon't address in any significant way the problems in front of us from a \nfiscal standpoint, which has created a lack of confidence in the value \nof the dollar. It has declined; therefore, the price of oil has gone \nup.\n  So we have a way. This is one of the easy problems for America to \nsolve. It is one of the ways to create a great opportunity for our kids \nand our grandkids; that is, utilizing the resources we have. We can do \nthat in an environmentally clean way that will not change our goal to \nbecome clean in terms of our energy utilization.\n  As we look at it, we subsidize solar to the tune of $692 a megawatt \nhour. We subsidize--if we call it subsidization--natural gas at 64 \ncents per megawatt hour. Oil is at 69 cents, and coal is somewhere \nslightly above that. For wind, it is over $100 per megawatt hour. So \nthe money we are paying in taxes we are sending out to inefficiently \ncompete with what is known to be there because the technology isn't \nthere yet. That is why it is going to take us 25 to 30 years to ever \ndevelop the technology to wean ourselves from carbon-based fuels.\n  One more thought. There is new technology in terms of thorium nuclear \nreactors. A lot of people are worried about nuclear reactors, and they \nare concerned. We are very safe in this country in terms of how we have \noperated them, and we have a very good Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nthat oversees that. The new technology eliminates nuclear waste and \neliminates any threat of a meltdown. So think about it. Here we have a \nnew technology in nuclear that significantly eliminates 99 percent of \nthe waste. There is absolutely no threat of a nuclear explosion or \nnuclear meltdown. How many dollars did the Department of Energy put \ninto that research last year? Zero dollars.\n  We have the President talking about algae. ExxonMobil has already \nspent almost $1 billion on algae. Why should we take your taxpayer \ndollars to invest in something in which the biggest oil company in the \nworld is already investing? Can we do it better? Probably not. Is more \nmoney the answer? No. Technology and scientific breakthrough is the \nanswer, and that takes time.\n  As we hear the debate on raising the taxes on oil companies, just \nremember that we are not really going to raise any taxes because the \namount of revenue that actually comes to the Federal Government isn't \ngoing to change. It sounds good. It is good for politics. It is good \nfor the election cycle. It is good to make somebody angry about the \nprice of oil. But the problem with the price of oil has nothing to do \nwith that. It has to do with supply, it has to do with the decreased \nvalue of the dollar, and it has to do with factors that are outside the \ncontrol of this country in terms of market price for oil based on \nsignificant geopolitical considerations. So I hope my colleagues will \nthink a little bit longer term rather than the next election about our \nenergy needs.\n  The one thing we have never done and the one thing I have already \nheard on the floor this week is that it will take us 10 years to become \nenergy independent. I was in this body 7\\1/2\\ years ago. I heard the \nsame thing: Had we started 7\\1/2\\ years ago, we wouldn't be importing \none drop of oil from the Middle East today--not one--and the price of \nour gasoline wouldn't be above $4. So\n\n[[Page S2156]]\n\nwe can't use that as a reason not to do it. The fact is, we can do it \nbetter, we can do it smarter, we can markedly increase the revenues of \nthe Federal Government by increased resource utilization, and we are \ngoing to be burning carbon for at least 25 more years. I want us to \nburn our carbon, not somebody else's carbon. With that comes the future \nfor our children.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/28/senate-section/article/S2156-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2156-S2158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, high energy prices are hurting \nindividuals and families and businesses, particularly during these \ndifficult economic times. While I support the measure before the Senate \nthis week that would eliminate certain subsidies for the largest \nintegrated oil companies and extend several clean energy tax \nincentives, the fact that we are not debating a bill to establish a \nlong overdue national energy policy is a missed opportunity.\n  To better protect American consumers against fluctuating and \nescalating prices, we need a thoughtful and comprehensive energy policy \nfor the 21st century that promotes greater efficiency, the development \nof viable alternative fuels, and the production of domestic energy \nsources, including oil and natural gas, wind, solar, biomass and \nothers.\n  The rising costs of energy are burdensome to Maine families, truck \ndrivers, farmers, fishermen, schools, small businesses, mills, and \nfactories. Nearly 80 percent of the homes in our State rely on heating \noil, leaving Maine families extremely vulnerable to rising crude oil \nprices. It is clear that we need a dramatic change in our energy policy \nto protect ourselves from rapid increases in oil prices without \nsacrificing our environment. We must rally around a national effort to \nachieve energy independence for our economic, environmental, and \nnational security.\n  In the nearly 40 years since the 1973 oil embargo, numerous \napproaches aimed at lowering energy prices have been discussed, such as \nexpediting the review of offshore drilling permits, opening new areas \nto oil and gas leasing, releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve, and promoting the development of domestic energy alternatives. \nThe serious will to tackle a comprehensive policy, however, has been \nlacking.\n  If the United States is to become less susceptible to volatile global \nmarket situations that drive up the cost of heating and transportation \nfuel, we must decrease our dependence on foreign oil. To accomplish \nthis goal, we must promote energy efficiency and develop viable and \naffordable domestic energy sources. I have worked to advance these \ngoals by supporting legislation that would promote clean energy \ninitiatives, such as accelerating research of plug-in hybrid \ntechnologies for heavy duty trucks, providing incentives for producing \nalternative fuels from biomass, improving the energy efficiency of cars \nand appliances, the deployment of deepwater offshore wind power, and \nexpanding domestic production of oil and natural gas in areas approved \nfor exploration.\n  We must seize every opportunity to use oil more efficiently. For \nexample, the provisions I was able to include in the last \nTransportation Funding Bill to allow heavy trucks to use Maine's \ninterstate highways instead of being forced on secondary roads and \ndowntown streets will shorten travel distances significantly. The \nowner-operator of a logging business in Penobscot County told me this \nchange will save him at least 118 gallons of fuel each week. At today's \ndiesel prices, that's more than $500.\n  The current political turmoil in the Middle East and our reliance on \noil from countries with which we have strained relations, such as \nVenezuela, remind us that decreasing our dependence on foreign oil and \nrelying on domestic energy sources must be the cornerstone of our \nNation's energy policy. For this reason, I have supported efforts to \nincrease the responsible domestic production of oil and gas.\n  Our efforts to increase American production should first be focused \non regions that are already open to gas and oil production. The many \nlessons learned from last year's oil spill disaster in the Gulf will \nhelp to ensure stricter safety regulations. I continue to believe, \nhowever, that we must also continue to avoid our most sensitive coastal \nareas and areas that are essential to our fishing industry, such as \nGeorges Bank. Pursuing domestic oil and gas leasing and transport is an \nimportant component in reaching this goal, and I remain disappointed in \nthe President's decision to deny the permit for the proposed Keystone \nXL pipeline. Canada is our Nation's largest trading partner, and \nconstruction of the pipeline would create thousands of jobs in our two \nnations and reduce our reliance on oil from overseas.\n  Finally, we must also continue to support important safety net \nprograms, including providing adequate resources for the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program to help low-income Mainers and senior \ncitizens afford to heat their home. The Weatherization Assistance \nProgram, which helps Mainers improve the efficiency of their homes and \nsubstantially reduce heating bills for the long-term, is another very \nimportant program.\n  I remain committed to working with my Senate colleagues to advance \neffective and commonsense energy legislation that increases America's \nsupply of energy and decreases our demand for foreign oil. This will \nhelp us to achieve energy independence and stabilize gas and oil \nprices.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is long past time to close the wasteful \ntax loopholes for Big Oil. Over the past 10 years, the five biggest \nprivate sector oil companies--BP, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, and \nConocoPhillips--have amassed combined profits of almost $1 trillion. \nLast year was no different. Due to skyrocketing prices for oil, these \nsame five corporations raked in a record-breaking $137 billion in \nprofits. Despite this massive windfall, Big Oil continued to receive \nbillions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies subsidies that are \nunnecessary and, in my opinion, unconscionable. The Repeal Big Oil Tax \nSubsidies Act will eliminate these harmful subsidies and level the \nplaying field for all Americans.\n  Big Oil does not need these big tax breaks, and the prices they set \nfor consumers at the pump suggest that they don't appreciate them. As \nof March 22, the national average price of regular gasoline is over \n$3.88 per gallon--up almost $0.34 from a year ago. I need look no \nfurther than the prices at the pump in Vermont, where the average price \nfor a gallon of gasoline is $3.85--up approximately $0.30 from the \naverage price in March 2011. This price increase is especially \nburdensome in rural states such as Vermont, where people must often \nrely on cars to get around, and heating fuel is a life-or-death \nnecessity in the winter. For every penny the price of gasoline \nincreases, big oil companies make an additional $200 million per \nquarter.\n  In spite of their ever-increasing profits and unneeded subsidies, the \nfive major oil companies have done absolutely nothing to bring down \nprices for average consumers. Instead, they have padded their own \npockets, using the vast majority of their net profits to pay exorbitant \ndividends, repurchase stock, lobby government officials, and buy radio \nand newspaper advertising to fight this bill. These actions benefit \nelite oil company executives and the companies' largest stockholders \nbut do nothing whatsoever to ease the pain of hardworking Americans who \ntrying to commute to their jobs every day or heat their homes during \nthe long winter months.\n  This bill will halt the transfer of money from hard-working middle \nclass families to oil company fat cats by ending more than $2 billion \nin annual tax breaks. It is a watershed moment for both energy policy \nand deficit reduction, and I support it wholeheartedly. Eliminating \nthese wasteful tax breaks that benefit a few undeserving companies will \nallow us to reinvest in clean energy technologies that will benefit \neveryone. These investments will improve our national security by \nmaking the U.S. less dependent on foreign oil. They will also \nstrengthen our economy and create new green jobs for the large number \nof Americans who are currently out of work and facing hard times.\n  Specifically, the Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act would renew \nincentives for clean energy technologies and put America on the path to \nenergy independence. In order to break free from\n\n[[Page S2157]]\n\nour unhealthy addiction to oil, we must choose the President's all-of-\nthe-above energy strategy which will grow clean energy industries, \nincluding alternative fuel vehicles, advanced manufacturing, biofuels, \nand solar, to name just a few. Savings from repealing these tax \nsubsidies for Big Oil will help continue important incentives for \nalternatives to oil and usher in a bright new future of energy \nindependence.\n  In addition to the benefits we will receive from investing in clean \nenergy technology, the remaining savings from this bill will be \ndedicated to reducing the national deficit, a goal shared by both \nDemocrats and, supposedly, Republicans. Time and again we have heard \nseemingly impassioned rhetoric from Republicans about the need to \nbalance the budget and rein in spending. And yet, when given the chance \nto end more than $2 billion per year in unnecessary tax breaks, \nRepublicans have stood with Big Oil. Instead of standing with Big Oil, \nwe need to stand up to Big Oil.\n  For years, Republicans have opposed efforts to end taxpayer subsidies \nto the major oil companies. However, lavishing these giant corporations \nwith incentives they do not need merely deepens our deficit and takes \nmoney out of the pockets of hard-working families, money which could be \nspent growing the economy and hastening our recovery. The Repeal Big \nOil Tax Subsidies Act is precisely the action we should take to ensure \nthat oil companies pay their fair share to help lower the deficit, just \nas working class taxpayers do.\n  It is important to note that cutting these subsidies will not result \nin less oil production or an increase in prices. Expert analysis has \nrevealed that it costs the big five oil companies only about $11.00 to \nproduce a single barrel of oil. This amount is dwarfed by the current \nprice of a barrel of oil, which has consistently hovered around $110 \nper barrel. At today's prices, oil companies regularly earn $100 in \npure profit from each barrel of oil that they sell. In fact, the former \nchief executive officer of Shell Oil Company, John Hofmeister, has \nadmitted that, in his point of view, high oil prices made subsidies \nunnecessary. Therefore, it is highly improbable that a small change in \ntax subsidies would reduce their output. Furthermore, because oil is a \nglobal commodity, any incremental change in production that might \nresult from changing oil subsidies in the United States will likely \nhave no impact on world oil prices and, therefore, no impact on the \nprice of oil.\n  The Senate should also go one step further and once again pass the No \nOil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act (NOPEC), which I have filed as \nan amendment to today's bill, along with Senator Kohl and others. We \nmust do everything we can to ensure that oil prices are not \nartificially inflated, driving up gas prices at the pump. Our NOPEC \namendment will hold accountable those who engage in collusive behavior \nthat artificially reduces supply and increases the price of fuel by \nallowing the Justice Department to crack down on illegal price \nmanipulation by oil cartels. This illegal manipulation affects us all. \nAs long as OPEC's actions remain sheltered from antitrust enforcement, \nOPEC's member-governments will continue to have the ability to wreak \nhavoc on the American economy and their destructive power will remain \nunchecked.\n  The benefits of the Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies Act should be \nobvious to all Senators. An overwhelming majority of the Americans, 66 \npercent, have said that repealing tax subsidies for Big Oil is an \nacceptable way to help reduce the deficit. I would go further. Not only \nis this an acceptable way to reduce the deficit, but in these lean \ntimes when so many are struggling to make ends meet, it is an essential \nway to bring the budget back in line. It is time to end Big Oil's free \nride at the expense of taxpayers.\n  Going forward, our focus should be on 21st Century clean energy that \npowers a jobs boom and fuels our economy. If these tax breaks were ever \njustified, that day has long passed. The Repeal Big Oil Tax Subsidies \nAct will end the unjustified Federal subsidies for the biggest oil \ncompanies that are enjoying record profits at the expense of working \nfamilies. It will propel us into the future by investing the savings in \nclean energy technologies and reducing the Federal deficit.\n  Senators must make a choice: stand with the American people and stand \nup to Big Oil or continue business as usual. I think the choice is \nclear, and strongly support this bill.\n\n\n                       Surface Transportation Act\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate this \nevening to urge Speaker Boehner and the House of Representatives to \npass the bipartisan Senate highway jobs bill now. This is an important \nbill that would save or create nearly 3 million jobs with really a \nstroke of the President's pen.\n  From Washington in the Northwest, 33,700 jobs, to Rhode Island in the \nNortheast, 9,000 jobs in our small State, to Florida in the South, \n81,700 jobs, this is the jobs bill on which we need to act.\n  Rhode Island would receive $227 million a year for highways, roads, \nand bridges from this bill, and that would hold us steady at funding \nthis year's funding levels.\n  Rhode Island would also receive an additional $30.5 million each year \nfor transit projects, which would be a 10-percent increase over this \nyear's Federal aid.\n  Importantly, this bipartisan Senate bill that will be so good for \njobs across this country includes language authorizing the Projects of \nNational and Regional Significance Program. That will help fund \ncritical infrastructure projects such as the Providence Viaduct. Where \nI 95, the main northeast highway corridor, comes through Rhode Island, \nit goes through our capital city, Providence, next to the Providence \nPlace Mall, and it proceeds through Providence as a bridge. It is a \nbig, long land bridge. Its condition is so poor that when you go \nunderneath it, as you do to drive down and enter the back parking \nentrance of the mall, and you look up, you see that between the I-beams \nthat support the highway have been laid planks. The planks are there to \nkeep the highway that is falling in from landing on the cars that pass \nunderneath the highway below.\n  If you look just to the side where Amtrak, the main rail corridor for \nthe Northeast passes under the Viaduct, you see the same thing: Planks \nacross the I-beams so the road that is falling in does not land on the \ntrains as they pass or block the tracks.\n  It takes a program like the Projects of National and Regional \nSignificance Program to address repairs of this magnitude, particularly \nin a small State like mine, which simply does not have the resources to \nrepair a facility like that built in 1964.\n  The Senate bill would send significant funds to States to build badly \nneeded projects like these. All of those projects not only repair \ncrumbling, broken, and deteriorating infrastructure, but they put \nAmericans back to work at a time when we still urgently need these \njobs.\n  So we passed this bill in the Senate. We passed it with 74 votes, and \nanother Senator making it 75, expressing that had he not been required \nto be at a funeral in his home State, he would have voted for it. So we \nhave 75 votes on a bipartisan bill that spent, if I remember correctly, \n5 weeks on the floor of this body getting amendments, bipartisan \namendments, amendments of all kinds being worked on and improved to the \npoint where it could pass out of this body with that kind of a \nmajority--even in the contentious and partisan atmosphere that often \nprevails in Washington.\n  It is a good bill, it is a bipartisan bill, it is a highway bill, it \nis a jobs bill, and the House should move on it.\n  What have they done instead?\n  Well, the House Republicans initially proposed funding transportation \nprograms with a 30-percent cut in existing transportation funding. \nThat, obviously, would have been a disaster. It would have resulted in \nthe loss of an estimated 600,000 jobs across the country. So, of \ncourse, it was overwhelmingly opposed by transportation advocates and \nby business groups.\n  The House Republicans then tried to introduce something called the \nAmerican Energy and Infrastructure Jobs Act back at the end of January. \nThis bill was so extreme and so flawed that it was even opposed by many \nHouse Republicans. It removed dedicated funding for transit programs \nand went after things like offshore drilling.\n  Transportation Secretary LaHood was a Republican Member of the House\n\n[[Page S2158]]\n\nof Representatives himself for many years. He said about that House \nbill that it was ``the worst transportation bill I have ever seen'' and \nthat it would ``take us back to the horse and buggy era.''\n  So with bipartisan opposition to this extreme, the worst bill that \nSecretary LaHood had ever seen, Speaker Boehner was forced to pull it, \nand that was that for that effort.\n  Then they spent months going after budget proposals that would reduce \nspending on our highways and on our bridges. Ultimately, they have \nthrown in the towel. They have no transportation bill in the House. \nThey cannot get one up for a vote. So they have fallen back on trying \nto pass short-term extensions.\n  Well, first of all, that is not a great outcome for jobs and for the \neconomy. According to the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, \nshort-term extensions have had significant detrimental effects. These \ninclude delaying $80 million worth of projects, which equates to the \nloss of 1,000 job-years of work; delaying planning for needed safety \nand structural improvements of a $300 million to $400 million \ninterchange that is in deplorable condition; delaying the advertising \nand awarding of the entire 2012 formula-funded construction program, \nwhich may cause the State to miss an entire construction season, \nputting the entire road construction industry out of work for that \nseason; making long-range planning and the development of a sound State \nTransportation Improvement Program nearly impossible; and, last, \njeopardizing the State's plans to design and construct the replacement \nof the Providence Viaduct I spoke about.\n  So the idea that an extension just carries on the status quo, it is \nmore or less OK, it will not create harm, and it will not cost jobs is \njust plain dead wrong. There is job loss and there is economic loss \nassociated with these extensions.\n  So how have they done on the extensions? Well, they have not even \nmanaged to pull themselves together to deal with the extensions. The \nHouse leadership has proposed 60-day extensions and 90-day extensions \nto the Federal transportation programs. Twice they have placed these \nproposals over on their calendar, but both times they have had to pull \nthe proposals down because they do not have the votes.\n  So what do they have over there? They have no bill they can vote for. \nThe bill they did put up was called one of the worst and most extreme \ntransportation bills in history by a former Republican Congressman. \nThey cannot get their act together to pass an extension. Even assuming \nit is not a bad idea to pass an extension for our economy, they still \ncannot do it, even as bad of an idea as that is. So they have nothing, \nand we are coming up on a deadline. On March 31, the authority to draw \nfunds from the Highway Trust Fund runs out. So we are up against a \npretty serious time constraint. As we whittle away to those last days, \nand as they get ready to leave the House and head home without having \ndone their work on transportation, it is becoming more and more urgent \nthat they take some action. If they cannot do a bill of their own, if \nthey cannot pass a 90-day extension, if they cannot pass a 60-day \nextension, there is one obvious solution that is standing there as big \nas the proverbial rhinoceros in the living room; that is, pass the \nSenate highway transportation bill.\n  It is right there. It is ready to go. It could be on the President's \ndesk in just days. It is bipartisan, with 75 votes in the Senate. It \npreserves these important programs and saves or creates nearly 3 \nmillion jobs in this country. The people of America understand that our \nhighways, our roads, and bridges are important. They want us to go \nforward on this bill. This is not controversial. This should be easy.\n  So the House needs to take a look at where they are and make a hard \ndecision.\n  They should not go home without addressing this problem and let us \nhit the deadline wall--particularly not with a good, solid, bipartisan \nSenate highway bill waiting to be taken up, waiting to be voted on, and \nwaiting to be signed. All of the indications are that if the Senate \nhighway bill were taken up by the House, it would pass overwhelmingly. \nWho would vote against a bill that creates 2.9 million jobs? Who would \nvote against a bill that maintains our highways, our roads, and our \nbridges? Who doesn't get it that in this country, our highway, bridge, \nand road infrastructure is in terrible shape? We understand this. The \nNation's civil engineers have given our infrastructure near-failing \ngrades in these areas. Other countries spend 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 percent of \ntheir gross domestic product on infrastructure, keeping it right, \nknowing it helps grow their economy. We are down below that.\n  It is very unfortunate that the House at this point cannot sort \nitself out to come up with its own transportation bill, cannot sort \nitself out to pass an extension--they cannot even do that. A deadline \nis coming at them that is nonnegotiable. Ideology, partisanship, \nrhetoric--all of those things don't matter against the hard deadline \nthey are driving this country toward. I hope and urge that they take up \nthe Senate Transportation bill, put it to a vote, let's get going, \nlet's put 2.9 million people to work rebuilding our roads and highways, \nand let's get America moving and working again.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

BILL SWOPE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate my very \ndear friend, Mr. Bill Swope of Elizabethtown, KY, for his many \nsuccesses in business and in life. Mr. Swope has made many \ncontributions to philanthropy and his local community, and has affirmed \na commitment to public service on behalf of the Commonwealth while \nsetting an example for his family and others of what it means to be a \ndistinguished citizen.\n  I have been very closely acquainted with Bill Swope, his brother Sam, \nand the rest of their family for quite some time. Bill was born in 1922 \nin Cleveland, Ohio. He graduated from Miami University in Oxford, OH, \nwith a degree in business administration. Bill served in the U.S. Army \nduring World War II as a sergeant specializing in artillery. He \nrecently received the French Legion of Honor in 2009, and is now \nconsidered a knight of the French Republic.\n  His wife Betty was a lieutenant, junior grade, in the Navy WAVES \nbefore she married Bill on July 26, 1945. According to Bill, the \ncouple's long-lasting relationship is because Bill has always \nremembered who holds the higher rank--and it isn't him.\n  The first business venture of Mr. Swope was established in 1952 in \nWinchester, KY; it was called Swope Motor Company Plymouth-Dodge. There \nwere many doubts about the future of the young company in its \nbeginnings, but the Swope family business survived and thrives. This \nyear marks the 60th year of the family business. Bill is now retired \nhas left the running of the business to his three sons Carl, Bob, and \nDick.\n  The first generation of Swopes laid the foundation of the business. \nThe second generation is now in charge and makes sure the business runs \nsmoothly. One thing both generations can agree on is that the company \nneeds to remain a local, family-run enterprise. Bill is excited about \nthe next 60 years in the automotive industry, and he is the first to \ntell you how proud he is of the three generations of Swopes' \nleadership.\n  Mr. Swope has been involved in a tremendous amount of volunteer \nactivities, charities, and leadership roles throughout the years. He \nhas been an active member of the Lion's Club since 1952, a deacon, \nelder and trustee of First Presbyterian Church in Elizabethtown, KY, \nand the past president\n\n[[Page S2159]]\n\nof the Fort Knox Chapter, Association of the United States Army in Fort \nKnox, KY. As a former member of the Elizabethtown City Council, he \nholds his community very dear to his heart. He has made sure to give \nback to the place he calls home in just about every way possible.\n  If you ever have the chance to sit down and talk with Bill Swope, you \nwould quickly learn his passion for cars. Starting a company that has \nsold over 500,000 automobiles is just the beginning of his immersion in \nthe industry. Bill likes to collect and restore antique and classic \ncars. Over the years he has become so good at this that in 1999, he \nopened Swope's Cars of Yesteryear Museum in Elizabethtown, KY. The \nmuseum is open Monday through Saturday, and admission is free. The \nattraction houses every type of classic car you could imagine, and \npeople from around the world have made a trip to the Commonwealth just \nto take a look.\n  Bill is very proud of his accomplishments in the business world, not \nbecause of the success he himself acquired, but for the opportunities \nhe has helped to provide for so many other Kentuckians. Bill is a \nsensitive and thoughtful individual, and a natural-born leader. And he \nis first and foremost a loyal family man, a husband, father, foster-\nfather, grandfather, and great-grandfather.\n  Bill is a joy to be around, he has a great sense of humor, and he \nalways knows how to make you smile. He is an instrumental part of the \neconomy of Hardin County, he is a vital part of the success of the \nState of Kentucky, and I am proud to say he is my good friend. I extend \nto him my heartiest congratulations on his lifetime of accomplishments, \nand I look forward to his future endeavors, wherever they may lie.\n  I would like to ask my U.S. Senate colleagues to join me in paying \ntribute to all Bill Swope has achieved for the Commonwealth of \nKentucky.\n  An article was recently published in Hardin County's local newspaper, \nthe News-Enterprise, which highlights the life of Mr. Bill Swope, and \nalso follows Bill as he looks back on over 60 years of success in the \nprivate sector. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that said \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n               [From the News-Enterprise, Jan. 29, 2012]\n\n                 Swopes Celebrate 60 Years in Business\n\n                           (By Sarah Bennet)\n\n       Nearly 60 years ago in March of 1952, Swope Dodge-Plymouth \n     was celebrating its grand opening at the corner of College \n     and Mulberry streets. The dealership already had been open \n     for a couple months, but people crammed into the one-car \n     showroom for the event.\n       As Bill Swope remembers, two competitors, Buick and Pontiac \n     dealers, were there that day and were overheard to make the \n     following exchange: ``I'll give them six months,'' one dealer \n     said about Bill Swope and his brother Sam.\n       The other replied, ``I think you're being pretty \n     generous.''\n       This year marks 60 years in business for Elizabethtown's \n     Swope Family of Dealerships and Louisville's Sam Swope Auto \n     Group.\n       Combined, the two Swope businesses have sold more than \n     500,000 automobiles, Bill said.\n       ``We're kind of proud of that,'' the 89-year-old said \n     during a phone interview.\n       ``We think the 60 years have given us pretty good practice, \n     and we're pretty well set for the next 60 years,'' he said.\n       Today, Bill is retired and his sons are managing the family \n     business. Bob, 64, is president of Bob Swope Ford, while \n     Carl, 54, is president and CEO of Swope Family of \n     Dealerships. Their brother, Dick, is CEO of Sam Swope Auto \n     Group.\n       As the second generation closes out the family's first 60 \n     years, Carl said the ``dynamic third generation'' is getting \n     involved with the business, which will continue to be a \n     local, family-owned company.\n       ``As the successive generations get involved, there's more \n     of them,'' Carl Swope said. ``There's certainly an increased \n     capacity to do things. We're very excited about the next 60 \n     years and think that the growth of the family business will \n     be even more fantastic than what we've seen.''\n       ``I think that's very important,'' Bill added about keeping \n     the Swope Family of Dealerships both local and family-owned. \n     ``We're very proud of our family. Our family seems to be \n     well-adapted to the automobile industry. We're very proud of \n     the products that we're selling and certainly of the people \n     that we have, our associates, that help make our business \n     successful.''\n       But as the Swope men point out, the 60 years in business \n     hasn't been a cake walk. The automobile industry has had its \n     ups and downs throughout the years, and in January 1966, the \n     Swope's second location at the corner of St. John Road and \n     U.S. 31W burned down.\n       The building was a total loss, and the Elizabethtown Swope \n     dealership was without a home for nearly 12 months.\n       ``We ran an ad in the paper at the time--a picture of the \n     building totally destroyed,'' Bill said. ``Here it is, winter \n     time. I'm standing in the rubble of the building and there's \n     still smoke billowing up from the ashes. We ran a full-page \n     ad and the headline of that ad was, Low overhead? We have no \n     overhead.'''\n       But, somehow, with help from some competitors and their \n     hard-working employees, the Swope family stayed in business, \n     he said, and they began building where the Swope Chrysler-\n     Dodge-Jeep-Ram building is today.\n       ``January to December 1966, we were kind of operating out \n     of the backseat of our cars and out of briefcases and various \n     stalls that were loaned to our technicians,'' Bill said. ``We \n     moved out to what was then out in the country, and we dubbed \n     that part of Dixie `The Miracle Mile.' It wasn't much of a \n     miracle at the time, but we thought it would be. Certainly it \n     has turned out that way.''\n       Asked about the recent downturn in the automobile industry, \n     the Swopes stay optimistic.\n       Americans love their automobiles and will always need a way \n     to travel from Point A to Point B, they say. That fact always \n     will remain true regardless of how cars evolve in the future.\n       ``Over that 60 years, we've seen a number of ups and downs \n     in our industry,'' Bob Swope said, ``and we certainly learned \n     to make adjustments that were necessary for getting through \n     those slow periods. It seems like each time we've experienced \n     slow periods, the industry then comes back very robust.''\n       The recent downturn was difficult for the entire industry, \n     Carl said, but the Swope family made it through without \n     making any layoffs.\n       ``I would give a lot of credit to our associates for how \n     they responded to (the downturn),'' he said. ``Our people \n     rose to the occasion. They became more efficient and \n     effective in what they do.''\n       Bob said over the years the Swope Family of Dealerships has \n     developed a culture in its stores that values its associates \n     and makes them part of the family, a business practice that \n     has contributed to the company's longevity.\n       ``One of the things that we learned very early on was to \n     make sure our associates were also very happy with their \n     working experience,'' he said. ``So we work very hard to try \n     to make sure that they feel like they're just an extended \n     part of the family.''\n       In 2011, the Swopes were up 20 percent compared to the \n     previous year, Carl said, partially because of activity at \n     Fort Knox. The Hardin County locations sold 4,538 retail \n     vehicles, which was ``a pretty steady mix'' of both used and \n     new cars.\n       Combined, the Elizabethtown and Louisville locations sold \n     more than 22,000 vehicles in 2011, he said.\n       As they celebrate 60 years in business, the Swope family is \n     expanding. Later this year, the business will hold grand \n     openings for a new Nissan dealership as well as the expansion \n     of its museum, which is one of Bill's projects.\n       Bill referred to it as a tribute to the Hardin County \n     community and the customers who have supported the Swope \n     family over the years. Open each Monday through Saturday, \n     admission is free.\n       Reminiscing about the early years in the business, Bill \n     recalled one of the first business deals he and Sam made in \n     January 1952, not long after they opened the Swope Dodge-\n     Plymouth doors for the first time. An Elizabethtown cab \n     company, Dixie Cab, wanted to increase its fleet.\n       ``So one of the first orders we got was a big order,'' he \n     said. ``They increased their fleet from two cabs to three, \n     which is 50 percent. That was one of our first sales, and it \n     was a Plymouth Cranbrook for Dixie Cab.''\n       Bill recently located a 1952 Plymouth Cranbrook with some \n     15,000 miles on it which he plans to detail.\n       ``You don't see many of those anymore,'' he said. ``You \n     will see that car parked out in front of the museum when it \n     is completed.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/28/senate-section/article/S2159-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2159-S2160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FRANCE CORDOVA\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, earlier today, the Supreme Court concluded \nthree days of oral arguments about the affordable care act, the law \nCongress passed 2 years ago to provide millions of Americans with \naccess to affordable health care while bringing the spiraling costs in \nthis area under control.\n  I was fortunate to be able to attend yesterday's argument about the \nconstitutionality of the provision requiring individuals to take \npersonal responsibility for paying for their health care, and to watch \nin person and in real time. Hundreds of thousands of Vermonters and \nmillions of Americans across the country who benefit from the \naffordable care act did not have that access. The Supreme Court's \ndecision in this landmark case will affect every American. I think \nevery American should have had a chance to see it and the Supreme Court \nshould open its proceedings to television and radio.\n  Americans are already beginning to see some of the benefits of \ninsurance reform. Seniors on Medicare who have high-cost prescriptions \nare starting to receive help when trapped within a coverage gap known \nas the ``doughnut hole.'' The affordable care act completely closes the \ncoverage gap by 2020, and the new law makes it easier for seniors to \nafford prescription drugs in the meantime. In 2010, more than 7,000 \nVermonters received a $250 rebate to help cover the cost of their \nprescription drugs when they hit the doughnut hole. Last year, nearly \n6,800 Vermonters with Medicare received a 50-percent discount on their \ncovered brandname prescriptions, resulting in an average savings of \n$714 per person. Since the affordable care act was signed into law, \nmore than 4,000 young adults in Vermont have gained health insurance \ncoverage under these reforms, which allow young adults to stay on their \nparents' plans until their 26th birthdays. The improvements we are \nseeing in Vermont go on and on: 81,649 Vermonters on Medicare and more \nthan 100,000 Vermonters with private insurance gained access to and \nreceived preventative screening coverage with no deductible or copay. \nThese are just a few of the dozens of consumer protections included in \nthe law that are benefiting Vermonters and all Americans every day.\n  Now that the law is in effect, many of the essential \nantidiscrimination and consumer protections of the affordable care act \nare being implemented, allowing consumers to take control of their own \nhealth care decisions. Going forward, insurance plans can no longer \ndeny children coverage because of a preexisting health condition; \ninsurance plans are barred from dropping beneficiaries from coverage \nsimply because of an illness; dozens of preventative care services must \nbe covered at no cost and with no copay; and Americans will have access \nto an easier appeals process for private medical claims that are \ndenied.\n  I attended Tuesday's argument with Senator Grassley, the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee. He and I disagreed about the \naffordable care act when we debated it extensively in the Senate and \npassed it 2 years ago. But we both respect the important role the Court \nplays in our constitutional system. I hope that as the Supreme Court \nconsiders its decision in the coming weeks, it respects the important \nrole of Congress, the elected representatives of the American people.\n  For years, we have heard Republican and Democratic Senators \nrightfully say that judges should not make law from the bench. For the \nsake of the health and security of our nation, the Supreme Court should \nnot cast aside this landmark law and Congress' time-honored ability to \nprotect the American people.\n  After watching the arguments and following the debate closely, it is \nas clear to me now as it was when Congress debated and passed the law \nmore than 2 years ago. The Supreme Court should uphold the affordable \ncare act. Looking at Article I of the Constitution and a long line of \nSupreme Court precedents dating back to the Nation's earliest days, \nthere is no question Congress acted well within its time-honored \nability to protect the American people.\n  Every Member of Congress takes an oath of office to ``support and \ndefend the Constitution of the United States.'' We take this oath \nseriously. As Justice Scalia said at a Judiciary Committee hearing last \nyear, we take the same oath that the Justices take.\n  During the course of Congress' extensive consideration of the \naffordable care act, we considered untold numbers of amendments in \ncommittees and before the Senate. That is what Congress is supposed to \ndo. We consider legislation, debate it, vote on it, and act in our best \njudgment to promote the general welfare. Some Senators agreed and some \ndisagreed, but this was a matter decided by the democratically elected \nCongress.\n  Among the arguments expressly considered and rejected by Congress \nbefore passing the affordable care act were arguments that the law was \nnot constitutional. We considered and rejected arguments that the part \nof the law now being challenged in the Court--the individual mandate--\nis not constitutional. In fact, those arguments were considered on the \nSenate floor when Senator Hatch raised and the Senate formally rejected \na constitutional point of order claiming that the individual \nresponsibility requirement was unconstitutional. During the Senate \ndebate on the affordable care act, I responded, publicly and on the \nrecord, to arguments about the constitutionality of this requirement. \nNo Justice could say Congress did not consider the constitutionality of \nthe affordable care act.\n  The individual mandate is about personal responsibility. Throwing out \nthis requirement that Americans be responsible for their necessary \nhealth care costs will result in tossing aside the provision that bans \ninsurance companies from denying Americans coverage based on pre-\nexisting conditions. The personal responsibility requirement is \nnecessary to ensure that Americans who do have health insurance are not \nstuck with paying the $43 billion in health care costs incurred by \nmillions of Americans who do not buy health insurance, instead relying \non expensive emergency health care when inevitably faced with medical \nproblems. Congress concluded this after extensive study and debate.\n  I joined with congressional leaders in filing an amicus brief \ndefending the affordable care act in the case now being considered by \nthe Court because I am convinced that Congress acted well within the \nlimits of the Constitution in acting to secure affordable health care \nfor all Americans. I believe we must defend the enumerated powers given \nto Congress by the Constitution so that our ability to help protect \nhardworking American workers, families and consumers is not wrongly \ncurtailed by the courts.\n  Partisan opponents of the affordable care act want judges to override \nthese legislative decisions properly made by Congress, the elected \nrepresentatives of the American people. They want to challenge the \nwisdom understood by generations of Supreme Court justices from the \ngreat Chief Justice John Marshall in upholding the constitutionality of \nthe national bank nearly 200 years ago to Justice Cardozo in finding \nSocial Security constitutional early in the last century.\n  The difference between the role of Congress and of the courts is not \na partisan one or a controversial one. In his opinion upholding the \naffordable care act, Jeffrey Sutton, a conservative, President George \nW. Bush's appointee to the Sixth Circuit, understood the importance of \ncourts not substituting\n\n[[Page S2161]]\n\ntheir policy preferences for those of Congress. He wrote: ``Time \nassuredly will bring to light the policy strengths and weaknesses of \nusing the individual mandate as part of this national legislation, \nallowing the peoples' political representatives, rather than their \njudges, to have the primary say over its utility.''\n  Professor Charles Fried, who was Solicitor General under President \nReagan, testified at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing a year ago on \nthe constitutionality of the affordable care act. When Senator Grassley \nasked him if there needs to be changes to the part of the law requiring \nthat individuals purchase health insurance to make it constitutional, \nProfessor Fried answered: ``I see no need for it because it seems so \nclearly constitutional.'' I agree with him and I do not think it is a \nclose call.\n  The provisions of the affordable care act are firmly rooted in what \nprevious Congresses enacted over the last century to protect hard-\nworking Americans. Working Americans have long been required to pay for \nSocial Security and Medicare by the deduction of taxes reflected on \ntheir paychecks every month. It is not novel for Congress to pass laws \naffecting a health care market that makes up one-sixth of the U.S. \neconomy, the key to satisfying the test for constitutionality under the \nCommerce Clause.\n  What is telling about the partisan nature of these challenges is that \nmany of those who now claim that the requirement that Americans have \nhealth insurance or face a tax penalty is unconstitutional are the very \nones who proposed it. Republican Senators such as Orrin Hatch, the \nformer chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and John McCain proposed \nand supported a health insurance requirement when President Clinton was \ntrying to increase access to health care. They proposed the individual \nmandate as an alternative when they opposed President Clinton's plan. \nThis requirement was also a part of health care reform in Massachusetts \nsupported by former Governor Mitt Romney and by Scott Brown, now a \nRepublican Senator from Massachusetts.\n  All of these opponents were for ensuring personal responsibility with \nan individual mandate until President Obama was for it, and now they \nare against it. Their views may have changed, but the Constitution has \nnot.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks a March 24 column in The Washington Post by \nEzra Klein, ``Why Ryancare and Obamacare look so similar,'' questioning \nRepublican opposition to the individual mandate they once championed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. When I hear partisan critics attacking the affordable care \nact, I wonder what law they are looking at. The affordable care act \nwill protect some of our most vulnerable citizens. The law eliminates \ndiscriminatory practices by health insurers, ensuring that a patient's \ngender is no longer a pre-existing condition, reduces the cost of \nprescription drugs for our Nation's senior citizens, and helps parents \ncontinue to cover their kids on their health insurance until they are \n26. The law also provides necessary resources to help law enforcement \nrecover millions of taxpayer dollars lost to fraud and abuse in the \nhealth care system.\n  If the Supreme Court overturns the affordable care act now, it will \nbe devastating to kids, families, and senior citizens. I hope the Court \ndoes not undo the progress we have made. Doing so depends on legal \ntheories so extreme they would turn back the clock even farther to the \nhardships of the Great Depression and strike down principles that have \nhelped us build the social safety net over the last century with Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n  The affordable care act builds on some of the cornerstones of \nAmerican economic security built over the last century. I believed when \nit passed, and still believe today, that Congress acted within its \nconstitutional authority to enact laws to help protect all Americans, I \nhope the Court does not overstep the judiciary's role by substituting \nits own policy preferences and denying a century of progress.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 24, 2012]\n\n               Why Ryancare and Obamacare Look so Similar\n\n                            (By Ezra Klein)\n\n       Let's play a game. I'll describe a health-care bill to you. \n     Then you tell me if I'm describing President Obama's \n     Affordable Care Act or the budget released this week by Rep. \n     Paul Ryan (R Wis.).\n       The bill works like this: The federal government subsidizes \n     Americans to participate in health insurance markets known as \n     ``exchanges.'' Inside these exchanges, insurers can't \n     discriminate based on pre-existing conditions. Individuals \n     can choose to go without insurance, but if they do so, they \n     pay a penalty. To keep premium costs down, the government \n     ties the size of the subsidy to the second-least-expensive \n     plan in the market--a process known as ``competitive \n     bidding,'' which encourages consumers to choose cheaper \n     plans.\n       This is, of course, a trick question. That paragraph \n     describes both the Affordable Care Act and Ryan's proposed \n     Medicare reforms. The insurance markets in both plans are \n     essentially identical. And for good reason.\n       The Affordable Care Act was based on two decades of \n     Republican thinking about health care. The basic structure \n     was first proposed by the conservative Heritage Foundation in \n     1989, first written into a bill by Senate Republicans in \n     1993, and first passed into law by a Republican governor by \n     the name of Mitt Romney in 2005.\n       About 2008, Democrats decided they could live with a system \n     based on private health insurers, federal subsidies and an \n     individual mandate as long as it produced universal coverage. \n     A year later, Republicans decided they couldn't live with \n     such a system, at least not if a Democratic president was \n     proposing it.\n       The problem for the Republicans, however, is that they \n     don't have a better--or even alternative--idea. Since the \n     passage of the Affordable Care Act, ``repeal and replace'' \n     has been a reliable applause line at tea party rallies and an \n     oft-uttered incantation on the floor of the House of \n     Representatives. But while Republicans have united around \n     ``repeal'' of health-care reform, they haven't managed to \n     come up with a policy for ``replace.''\n       Instead, they've opted to apply their old policy \n     framework--the one the Democrats stole--to Medicare. That has \n     left the two parties in a somewhat odd position: Democrats \n     support the Republicans' old idea for the under-65 set but \n     oppose it for the over-65 set. Republicans support the \n     Democrats' new idea for the over-65 set but oppose it for the \n     under-65 set.\n       This isn't quite as incoherent as it seems. Democrats say \n     they would prefer Medicare-for-All for the under-65 set, but \n     they'll take whatever steps toward universal health insurance \n     they can get. Republicans say they would prefer a more free-\n     market approach for the over-65 set but that a seniors' \n     version of ``Obamacare'' is nevertheless a step in the right \n     direction. For both parties, it's the direction of the \n     policy, rather than the policy itself, that matters.\n       There's an added complication for Republicans. They have \n     assumed huge savings from applying the exchange-and-subsidies \n     model to Medicare. But they don't assume--in fact they \n     vehemently deny--that those same savings would result from \n     the identical policy mechanism in the Affordable Care Act. \n     The Democrats haven't assumed significant savings from the \n     exchange-and-subsidies model in either case.\n       If the concept works as well as Ryan says it will, then the \n     Affordable Care Act will cost far, far less than is currently \n     projected. There's no compelling reason to believe \n     competitive bidding will cuts costs for seniors but fail \n     among younger, healthier consumers who, if anything, are in a \n     better position to change plans every few years and therefore \n     pressure insurers to cut costs.\n       The discrepancy highlights another difference between \n     Republicans and Democrats right now. Republicans have put all \n     their eggs in the competitive-bidding basket. If that doesn't \n     work to control costs--and versions of it have failed in the \n     past--they're sunk.\n       Democrats, on the other hand, are promoting a slew of \n     delivery-system reforms in the Affordable Care Act. They're \n     hoping competitive bidding works, but they're also trying \n     comparative-effectiveness review, pay-for-quality, \n     accountable-care organizations, electronic health records, \n     penalties for excessive readmissions and medical errors, and \n     a host of other experiments to determine which treatments and \n     processes actually work and how to reward the doctors and \n     hospitals that adopt them.\n       It's unlikely that the model in the Republican budget will \n     prove sustainable. That legislation would repeal the \n     Affordable Care Act, cut Medicaid by a third and adopt \n     competitive bidding for Medicare. The likely result? The \n     nation's uninsured population would soar. In the long run, \n     and quite possibly in the short run, that will increase the \n     pressure for a universal system. Because Republicans don't \n     really have an idea for creating one, Democrats will step \n     into the void.\n       As a result, Republicans' long-term interests are probably \n     best served by Democratic success. If the Affordable Care Act \n     is repealed by the next president or rejected by the Supreme \n     Court, Democrats will probably retrench, pursuing a strategy \n     to expand Medicare and Medicaid on the way toward a single-\n     payer system. That approach has, for\n\n[[Page S2162]]\n\n     them, two advantages that will loom quite large after the \n     experience of the Affordable Care Act: It can be passed with \n     51 votes in the Senate through the budget reconciliation \n     process, and it's indisputably constitutional.\n       Conversely, if the Affordable Care Act not only survives \n     but also succeeds, then Republicans have a good chance of \n     exporting its private-insurers-and-exchanges model to \n     Medicare and Medicaid, which would entrench the private \n     health-insurance system in America.\n       That's not the strategy Republicans are pursuing. Instead, \n     they're stuck fighting a war against a plan that they helped \n     to conceive and, on a philosophical level, still believe in. \n     No one has been more confounded by this turn of events than \n     Alice Rivlin, the former White House budget director who \n     supports the Affordable Care Act and helped Ryan design an \n     early version of his Medicare premium-support proposal.\n       ``I could never understand why Ryan didn't support the \n     exchanges in the Affordable Care Act,'' Rivlin says. ``In \n     fact, I think he does, and he just doesn't want to say so.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/28/senate-section/article/S2162-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2162-S2163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GOVERNMENT INTRUSION\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, last Friday was the second anniversary of \nthe new health care law. This week we have been reminding the American \npublic to take a hard look at what is in it, and, more importantly, why \nI don't want to observe this anniversary again.\n  Examples such as the Medicare reimbursement formula that allows \nMassachusetts to set Statewide hospital reimbursement rates for \nproviders equal to the cushy wages paid to providers at a 15-bed \nhospital on the island of Nantucket that caters to the East coast \nelite.\n  This robs 19 other States of money for their reimbursements because \nit all comes from the same pot. In short, there aren't enough clams at \nthis bake to go around, certainly not to Kansas after Massachusetts is \nfinished.\n  Or the Health and Human Services' rule that required qualified health \nplans to offer contraception benefits. As my colleagues know, religious \ninstitutions that hold moral objections to specific services expressed \nwidespread concern with the rule.\n  In response, Senator Blunt offered, and I cosponsored, S. 1467, the \nRespect for Rights of Conscience Act. This act would allow a health \nplan to decline coverage of specific items and services that are \ncontrary to the religious beliefs of the sponsor, issuer, or other \nentity offering the plan without penalty and remain in compliance with \nthe requirements under the new Health Care Law.\n  And what about the regulations that have caused insurance plans in 39 \nStates to stop offering child-only plans, and parents in at least 17 \nStates that are no longer able to purchase ANY child-only plans? Keep \nin mind, there are no private insurance alternatives for these families \nuntil the new health care law is fully implemented in 2014.\n  There is also the prohibition on what can be reimbursed from a Health \nSavings Account or HSA. I joined Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins  in \nintroducing a bipartisan bill to repeal this provision to restore the \nchoice and flexibility people had in managing their health care \nexpenses by buying over-the-counter medications.\n  Even more alarming is the act of granting waivers to more than 1,700 \nlabor unions and others from participating in the new law. At issue are \nthe mandates involving annual coverage forcing many employers not to \noffer coverage at all. So instead labor unions and others are getting \nwaivers. Where is your waiver? Why can't all Kansans get a waiver??\n  At the time, Speaker Pelosi famously said we had to pass the bill to \nfind out what is in it. Well, we have read it, and my concerns which I \nvoiced throughout the very limited debate remain the same: the health \ncare reform law is bad for Americans.\n  The health care reform law. Regulates every Americans' health \ncoverage, by penalizing anyone without a Government-approved health \nplan.\n  The law penalizes American businesses that do not provide Government-\napproved health plans.\n  It forces more Americans into Medicaid--a broken, bankrupt Government \nentitlement program.\n  It puts the Federal Government in charge of your health insurance.\n  By one count, the law creates over 159 new boards, offices, and \npanels in the Federal Government to make decisions about your health \ncare.\n  The law gives the Obama administration Secretary of Health and Human \nServices more than 1,700 new or expanded powers--to exert control over \nthe lives and personal health care decisions of Americans; creates an \nunworkable new long-term insurance program that will go broke, leading \nto skyrocketing premiums or a taxpayer bailout; levies more than $550 \nbillion dollars of taxes, fees, and penalties related to health care on \nAmerican families and employers; and spends tens of billions of \ntaxpayer dollars just to implement the massive new law.\n  The law micromanages how patients can spend their own tax-free health \ncare dollars.\n  As of March 12, 2012, the total number of pages of regulations the \nadministration has released related to the health spending law is \n12,307, which is an increase of over 4,700 pages in the last year.\n  In addition to the formal regulations, the administration is also \nissuing hundreds of pages of subregulatory guidance in the form of \n``bulletins'' to avoid having to describe how much these regulations \nwill cost.\n  A significant portion of the regulations issued thus far have been \ninterim final rules, which give the regulations the force of law prior \nto any public comment.\n  I have listed a number of these regulations in a letter I sent to \nPresident Obama. I did get a reply from Secretary Sebelius a few months \nlater, but it never did address the concerns I had tried to bring to \ntheir attention. She did, however, note that they listen to all \nstakeholders before implementing new rules. Unfortunately, that isn't \nwhat I've been hearing.\n  While I travel around Kansas I try to talk to as many of our Kansas \npatients, providers and advocates as possible. Without fail, \nregulations and their effect on our health care system, how they affect \nhealth care costs, and the result they have on job loss come up.\n  I held a stakeholder roundtable in Topeka to get feedback from \npatients and providers on their thoughts related to health care reform. \nI was not surprised to hear that every representative at that meeting \nhad a concern with regulations, but the sheer volume was truly \nextraordinary.\n  I was surprised to hear every representative at this stakeholder \nmeeting discuss the impacts of health care reform and, more \nimportantly, their concerns with regulations, some of which are buried \nin the volumes of regulations being put out every day and many that \ndefy comprehension.\n  When discussing the health care reform and regulations with my \nconstituents and those representing the patient and provider community, \nthe No. 1 concern that I heard was a fear of what else is coming down \nthe road? What will the impact of future regulations be?\n  The current burden of regulations pales in comparison to the \nuncertainty of future regulations. Future regulations from implementing \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, PPACA, will have an \neven greater impact on jobs and the economy. This is like the second \nhealth care reform earthquake. If you are a health care provider, hang \non.\n  Additionally, the combination of the regulations being issued to \nimplement the PPACA statute has resulted in an increase in premiums for \nindividuals and businesses, which, as you know, results in increased \ncosts and tough choices.\n  Providers feel that the significant costs associated with \nimplementing the health reform law are either inaccurate or not taken \ninto consideration. In fact, I often hear that patients and providers \nfeel that they do not have a voice in the regulatory process.\n  More specifically, a number of regulations are currently being issued \nthrough a shortened process. This shortened process allows limited or \nno input from those most affected by the regulations, prior to their \nimplementation, and result in an even greater confusion. And from \nconfusion we get higher costs.\n  It is my understanding that 20 of the 51 rules issued to implement \nthe health reform law have been issued as interim final rules and \ntherefore with limited input. While there may have been instances in \nwhich a shortened process was necessary or appropriate, this lengthy \nlist is absurd.\n\n[[Page S2163]]\n\n  In my letter to the President, I listed some 34 regulations that my \nKansas constituents noted had the most significant impact. I encouraged \nthe administration to limit the use of this regulatory process and take \nevery available opportunity to get feedback from those who would be \nmost affected by these regulations and allow for ample time to review \nand consider that feedback prior to implementing future regulatory \npriorities.\n  Time and time again, I have heard no more regulations will be issued \nin the shortened process, and yet the interim rules continued to be \nissued. I have heard that stakeholder comments will be thoroughly \nreviewed and considered, but the actions by the administration don't \nseem to prove this. I have heard that economic impacts will be \ncarefully considered, and yet the studies indicate otherwise.\n  If history truly does repeat itself, I don't have much hope of that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/28/senate-section/article/S2163-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2163-S2164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTES TO SENATOR BARBARA MIKULSKI\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice to those of my \ncolleagues paying tribute to the senior Senator from Maryland, who \nrecently became the longest-serving female Member of Congress in \nAmerican history.\n  Senator Barbara Mikulski and I were first elected to the Senate at \nthe same time. Over the past 26 years she has been a colleague, a \nlegislative partner, and a friend. Courageous, determined, and \nhonorable are only a few of the words I use when describing Senator \nMikulski.\n  Senator Mikulski has devoted her life to public service. She began \nher career as a social worker in Baltimore, where she worked with high-\nrisk children and educated seniors about Medicare. In 1971, she \ntransitioned into politics by attaining a seat on the Baltimore City \nCouncil. As a council member, she continued to advocate for those in \nneed. In 1976, she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, \nwhere she became the first woman ever to sit on the influential Energy \nand Commerce Committee. As a member of the House, she worked on a \nvariety of important legislation, including funding for shelters for \nbattered spouses.\n  Issues concerning women have always been a passion of Senator \nMikulski's. From sponsoring the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to being a \nleader in women's health issues, she has been a champion for women's \nrights.\n  Senator Mikulski was particularly helpful to me during the Grand \nForks flooding in 1997. When our third largest city was devastated by \nflooding and fire, Senator Mikulski stood with Grand Forks residents \nevery step of the way as we fought for Community Development Block \nGrant funding to recover and rebuild. Her support was critical. More \nrecently, Senator Mikulski joined me in pushing for comparative \neffectiveness research as part of health reform, so that patients and \ndoctors can have better information on which treatments and medical \ninterventions are most effective and which amount to wasteful spending.\n  Senator Mikulski is a fierce advocate for her constituents--and for \nworking men and women everywhere. She will never back down from a cause \nshe believes in, and she has compiled an impressive record of results. \nI congratulate her on being the longest-serving female Member of \nCongress.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a \ntrue trailblazer, my colleague Senator Barbara Mikulski. Earlier this \nmonth, she crossed a major milestone by becoming the longest serving \nwoman in Congress.\n  Before she set her sights on Congress, Senator Mikulski worked as a \ncommunity activist, social worker, and a member of the Baltimore City \nCouncil. In 1977, she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives \nfrom Maryland's Third Congressional District. At that time, she was one \nof only 21 women serving in Congress.\n  She never let any misguided stereotypes or long odds slow her down. \nTen years later, she won her first race for the U.S. Senate and in the \nprocess became the first Democratic woman elected to this Chamber from \nthe State of Maryland. She immediately lent her voice to issues like \neducation, health care, and national service.\n  Along the way, she has given a voice not only to families and the \nmiddle class but also sent a powerful message to women all across this \nNation. If there were ever any doubt, they now know for sure that they \ndeserve a seat at the table in Congress. And her message is being \nheard. Since Senator Mikulski first was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives, the number of women serving in Congress today has \nincreased to 92.\n  I have gotten to know Barbara well, especially through our work on \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee. I know she would rather we focus \non her accomplishments regardless of her gender, but Senator Mikulski \nhas blazed an important path. Along the way, she has never forgotten \nthe value of hard work that was instilled in her from an early age. She \nhas also built the kind of working relationships you need to get things \ndone.\n  There is a reason the people of Maryland have sent Barbara Mikulski \nback to the Congress time and again. She is telling their story and \nmaking sure that every voice has a chance to be heard. I want to \ncongratulate her on this milestone. It is an important one for her and \nher family, and I believe it is symbolic of the gains we have seen our \nNation make since she first was elected to Congress more than 35 years \nago.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, in 1977, Jimmy Carter became our Nation's \nPresident, Elvis Presley died, and ``Rocky'' won the Oscar as best \npicture.\n  It was also the year my colleague, Barbara Mikulski, came to \nCongress. She has served since then, for 10 years in the House and \nsince 1987 in the Senate, with exemplary dedication to our Nation and \nits working families. Those of us who have had the pleasure to serve \nwith her in the Senate and all the citizens of Maryland who have \nelected her to represent them celebrate this moment, for Senator \nMikulski has become the longest serving female Member of Congress in \nour Nation's history.\n  Barbara Mikulski is the first female Democrat to have served in both \nthe House and the Senate, as well as being the first Democratic woman \nto be elected to the Senate without succeeding a spouse or father. She \nis, among all of us, truly a path breaker.\n  When she entered the Senate, there was only one other female Member \nof this body. Today, there are 17. Barbara Mikulski has served as an \ninspiration, a leader, and a mentor to generations of women seeking to \nsecure their rightful place as members of our Nation's highest \nlegislative bodies.\n  Throughout her time in both the House and the Senate, she has worked \ntirelessly on behalf of the elderly, veterans, the poor, hard-pressed \nfamilies, and our Nation's children. Daughter of a grocer, her roots \nare in Baltimore. She may have come a long way to play her important \nrole here in Washington, but what makes her such a vital voice in \nCongress is that she has never lost touch with the values and needs of \nthe blue-collar neighborhood of Highlandtown where she grew up.\n  Barbara Mikulski entered politics as an activist and a populist, and \nshe has remained true to that initial motivation. Barbara Mikulski \ngenuinely cares about the people of our Nation about all the people, \nnot just the wealthy or the famous or the influential.\n  She understands the difficulties faced by working families as their \nincomes have been stagnant, as unions have declined, as disparities in \nwealth and income have widened dramatically. She is passionately \ncommitted to the importance of education for our young people, just as \nshe respects and fights for our nation's elderly and their security as \nthey negotiate the later years of life.\n  We serve together on the HELP Committee, on which she has long been a \nleader. No one, no one, better exemplifies the values of caring for \nthose who are all too easy to forget working families, the elderly, the \npoor, the children than Barbara Mikulski. Having worked with them both, \nI know how completely she has taken on the mantle of her friend Ted \nKennedy and kept our committee focused on those whose needs are \ngreatest.\n  As we celebrate the inspiration Barbara Mikulski has been for the \nwomen of the Senate, Maryland, and the country, let's not forget that \nshe has also been an inspiration to all of us. She has shown us how to \nfight for the powerless\n\n[[Page S2164]]\n\nand how to cast votes based on ethical values and a deep commitment to \nour fellow men and women, not based on political expediency.\n  For that leadership, both as a great female legislator and as an \naccomplished legislator with a lifelong commitment to improving the \nlives of all Americans, we honor her.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my esteemed \ncolleague, Senator Barbara Mikulski from the great State of Maryland. I \nam honored to recognize the historic achievements of my fellow Senator. \nOn Saturday she became the longest-serving woman in congressional \nhistory after serving more than 35 years in both the House and Senate. \nOriginally a social worker and community organizer in Baltimore, \nSenator Mikulski's congressional legacy began in 1976 when she was \nelected to the U.S. House of Representatives. Ten years later with her \nelection into the U.S. Senate she became the first female Senator from \nMaryland as well as the first woman to be elected to both the House and \nSenate. Senator Mikulski deserves great honor and reverence for her \ndedication to the people of Maryland, the United States, and to the \ninstitution of the Senate.\n  Three years ago I entered these chambers as a freshman from a faraway \nState. Senator Mikulski was already known as a legend, to me and so \nmany of my constituents. Since then, she has been an inspiration--and, \nto no one's surprise, a straight shooter and passionate advocate of her \nissues. More than once, when I have not yet signed onto one of her \nbills--usually something near and dear to her, like child abuse \nprevention--she has cornered me. And in a tough stance, all 4 feet 5 \ninches of her, she'll tell me why it is my duty to sign the bill. She \nis always right, and I am happy to follow her lead on such issues.\n  Throughout her time in Congress Senator Mikulski has been a champion \nfor civil rights, fighting to end discrimination of all kinds. As the \nchairwoman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nshe has continually fought to end discrimination in the workplace. In \n2011 she was a sponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which ensures \nequal pay, regardless of gender.\n  She has also defended our Nation's teachers and students by fighting \nfor more affordable and accessible education and supporting the needs \nof rural school districts. Just this year she introduced legislation \nthat would ensure veterans who receive educational assistance from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs also receive adequate counseling when \nconsidering their educational options.\n  Senator Mikulski's accomplishments are numerous and diverse, from the \nday-to-day needs of workers, business owners, and students to the \nstrengthening of scientific innovation and research. Senator Mikulski \ndeserves great honor and esteem for her dedication to fighting for the \ngood of the people of Maryland and the Nation.\n  I am honored to serve alongside such a devoted advocate, and I look \nforward to her continued service in the U.S. Senate. She began her \ntenure in 1977 as one of 21 women serving in the House and today is one \nof 17 women in the Senate. She has helped paved the way for future \ngenerations. Yet she likely would not agree that women have come a long \nway over those years; instead she will say there is a long way to go.\n  Today I congratulate and pay homage to Senator Barbara Mikulski. She \nis a friend, a mentor, and--so very often--the good conscience of the \nUnited States Senate.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nspeak in honor of Senator Barbara Mikulski. I join my colleagues in \nrecognizing her for becoming the longest serving female Member of \nCongress in our Nation's history.\n  I know Senator Mikulski is more interested in results than \nmilestones, but this is an appropriate moment to congratulate her for \nall that she has accomplished. She is both a tenacious fighter and \ngracious colleague.\n  The true measure of a society is how we treat people in the dawn and \ntwilight years of their lives. By that standard, Senator Mikulski's \ncareer has been extraordinary.\n  From the start of her career in public service as a Baltimore social \nworker helping at-risk kids and seniors to today, she has been a \nchampion for children and the elderly. She has been a champion for \neducation, research, and veterans, and she has been an unflinching \nchampion for Maryland.\n  Senator Mikulski has also been a friend since my first days in the \nSenate. Early on she reached out to me to explain the appropriations \nprocess in the Senate. My father, who spent his entire career in the \nU.S. House of Representatives, was always suspicious of the Senate. So \nto a freshman Senator making the transition from the House, hers was a \nwelcome and reassuring gesture, kind of like the folksy gesture of \ncalling me ``cowboy,'' which always brings a smile to my face.\n  Senator Mikulski's style is a powerful counter to the old Washington \njoke that there are actually three political parties: Democrats, \nRepublicans, and appropriators. She always values the input of other \nSenators and strives to balance the many competing priorities of all \nthe Members of this body. For example, we have worked together on the \nJoint Polar Satellite System. This program is over budget and behind \nschedule, but it is also indispensible to public safety and our \neconomy. As an appropriator, she has the unenviable challenge of \nstriving to continually put this program on firm financial footing. In \nthe process, she has repeatedly asked for my perspective and welcomed \nme into the process. This is above and beyond the call of duty but is \nso typical of Barbara Mikulski.\n  Many have compared Senator Mikulski's streak to another famous \nMarylander's--Cal Ripken, Jr. I think Cal would agree with Barbara when \nshe said, ``It's not only how long I serve, but how well I serve.''\n  She has undoubtedly served this institution, this country, and \nMaryland very well.\n  I commend Senator Barbara Mikulski for her 35 years of service in \nCongress and look forward to her future successes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/28/senate-section/article/S2164-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    PORTLAND'S FIRST AME ZION CHURCH\n\n Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I \ncongratulate the First African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church in \nPortland, OR, on its 150 years of devotion to God and the Portland \ncommunity.\n  In 1862, the A.M.E. Zion Church convened as the first of its kind in \nPortland, just 3 years after Oregon became a State. First Church's \nhumble beginnings started in the home of Mrs. Mary Carr on A Street, \nnow Ankeny Street, under the leadership of Rev. J.O. Lodge. Since then, \nthe congregation has grown substantially and has weathered four \nrelocations. It now has settled at its current home on North Vancouver \nand North Skidmore Avenue.\n  First Church has impacted countless lives over the course of its 150 \nyears. It has provided shelter and clothing for the homeless, food for \nthe hungry, and scholarships to young students chasing their dreams to \ncollege. Today, they continue their good work keeping youth off the \nstreets and reducing gang violence. The church is a strong, positive \nforce in the Portland community.\n  To Pastor Robert Nelson Probasco, Sr., and the First African \nMethodist Episcopal Zion Church of Portland: Thank you for your \ndedication, conviction, and faithful service to the people of \nPortland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/28/senate-section/article/S2164-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2164-S2165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ARGO MARKETING GROUP\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as the American economy becomes \nincreasingly global, small businesses specializing in \ntelecommunications and direct-response marketing provide essential \nservices to businesses throughout the world. Today, I rise to commend \nand recognize Argo Marketing Group, located in Lewiston, ME, for being \namong the best in this expanding industry.\n  Jason Levesque founded Argo in 2003 to provide consulting and direct-\nresponse marketing services to companies in Maine and throughout the \nworld. Since that time, this small firm has continued to expand despite \nthe turbulent economy, adding numerous jobs throughout the State. In \n2011, Argo Marketing moved from Auburn to Lewiston to allow for a \ncompany expansion, which included the doubling of\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\nemployees from 25 to 51. Moreover, the firm recently added 25 \nadditional employees in January of this year to its new location in \nPittsfield. This remarkable expansion provides high-quality jobs for \nMainers, which is especially vital after the closing of Global Contract \nServices in Pittsfield, leaving 65 employees without jobs.\n  With cutting-edge technology, Argo is a leader in call center service \nand support. The company prides itself on having the best integrated \nsystem in the industry that is customized to handle a vast array of \nclients. Moreover, Argo has always firmly believed that having \ndedicated professionals as part of the Argo family helps direct the \npath of any given project. There is a pervading philosophy in the \ntelecommunications, marketing, and customer service industry that \nretaining a current customer is easier than finding a new one. Indeed, \ncustomer care is a top priority, especially for small businesses \ncompeting with larger companies with more resources and cheaper \nproducts. This quality investment in customer service has been a key \ncomponent in Argo's success.\n  Further, Jason understands the importance of an engaged staff and \ngiving back to the local community. He consistently works to increase \ncompany morale and provide an atmosphere where people enjoy coming into \nwork every day with a positive attitude. As a dedicated part of the \nLewistown-Auburn community, this company also donated to Sand Castle \nPre-School in Lewistown which assists disadvantaged youths.\n  Small businesses drive the American economy by consistently creating \njobs in the private sector while spurring investment in their local \ncommunity. Argo's success and expansion is a glowing example of why \nthese firms are so critical to America's economy. It is innovative \nentrepreneurs like Jason Levesque who are going to lead us out of our \neconomic morass by creating jobs and opportunity all across our Nation. \nDespite these difficult economic times, he has clearly fostered a \nwinning strategy, and I congratulate him and everyone at Argo Marketing \nfor their dedication to excellence and for maintaining an impressive \nrecord of job creation in central Maine. I offer my best wishes for \ntheir future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/28/senate-section/article/S2165-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/28/senate-section/article/S2165-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were placed on the Executive Calendar under \nPrivileged Nominations.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/28/senate-section/article/S2165-3", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:41 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3298.

A bill to clarify that a State has the sole authority to \nregulate hydraulic fracturing on Federal land within the boundaries of \nthe State; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce S. 2248, a bill that \nwould clarify the States' sole authority to regulate the process of \nhydraulic fracturing at the State level as opposed to the Federal \nlevel.\n\n[[Page S2167]]\n\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Murkowski, Vitter, Sessions, \nCornyn, Risch, Hoeven, and Lee as cosponsors.\n  The reason for this bill is the State jurisdiction of a process \ncalled hydraulic fracturing, which has taken place since 1949. In 1949, \nthe first hydraulic fracturing well took place in Duncan, OK. It is \ninteresting that there has not been one documented case, in over a \nmillion wells using this process--in 60 years--of groundwater \ncontamination.\n  As a matter of fact, numerous studies, including reports by the \nGroundwater Protection Council, the EPA, and recently the Energy \nInstitute at the University of Texas at Austin, have found no evidence \nof hydraulic fracturing posing a risk to water wells or groundwater. A \nlot of people believe--and I am among them--that the reason to take it \nover at the Federal level is to do away with hydraulic fracturing. It \nis interesting that, recently, with some of the shale deposits and \ndiscoveries that have been made in the United States, we have been able \nto get in there, using this process, and come up with huge reserves and \nstart producing these reserves.\n  In every case, without exception--in fact, I will go so far as to say \nyou cannot get one cubic foot of natural gas out of a type formation \nwithout using hydraulic fracturing. The process is and will continue to \nbe a safe process. Despite the evidence, in President Obama's recent \ncampaign rhetoric, this administration continues to wage an all-out war \non domestic oil and gas development. During the State of the Union \nMessage--it was interesting because, apparently, now because of the \nhigh price of gas at the pump, the President is feeling political \npressure, so he is coming out and saying: No, I am not against all \nfossil fuels, even though he has been for 4 years. And he started \ntalking about clean, plentiful, cheap natural gas. I agreed with that; \nthat is what it is. However, at the same time, if he could have that \nrhetoric and be able to make the case that the Federal Government needs \nto take over the process of hydraulic fracturing to be under his \ncontrol and he can stop that process, he can cut off almost all \nproduction altogether.\n  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service--and this \nis one that came out this month--since 2007, ``about 96 percent of the \n[oil production] increase took place on nonfederal lands.''\n  A recent study also found that 93 percent of shale oil and gas wells \nare on private and State lands. The Department of Interior is in the \nprocess of issuing rules which will further discourage production on \nFederal lands and federally regulate disclosure of fracking fluids, \nwell integrity, and waste water. According to Secretary of Interior Ken \nSalazar, these are rules which they hope will serve as a model for \nfuture regulation of State lands.\n  The Obama EPA alone is looking to regulate hydraulic fracturing \nthrough its offices of Water, Air, and Toxics.\n  What does this legislation do? It is simple. It makes clear that the \nStates have the sole authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing on any \nland within their borders. This would include Federal lands within the \nborders of a State.\n  It also requires hydraulic fracturing on Federal lands to comply with \nthe State laws of which the Federal lands are located.\n  Activities related to hydraulic fracturing are already regulated at \nthe Federal level under a variety of environmental statutes, including \nportions of the Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Clean \nAir Act.\n  States better understand their unique geologies and interests. I \nhappen to be from Oklahoma, which is an oil State, and it varies from \nState to State. Louisiana deposits are found at a different level than \nours in Oklahoma. Recently, people think of all these deposits being \nlocated in the West. However, the Marcellus discoveries that have been \nmade are actually in New York State and Pennsylvania, so their local \nregulations are much more applicable than it would be if you did it at \nthe Federal level.\n  I invite cosponsors. Here we are in the United States with more \nrecoverable reserves in oil, gas, and coal than any other country in \nthe world. We can be completely self-sufficient from the Mid Eastern \noil if we get politics out of the way and use our own resources. We are \nthe only country in the world that doesn't develop its own resources. \nThis is the answer to the problem--the answer to the price of gas at \nthe pump. It is one more option. We need to get out of the way of this \nprocess called hydraulic fracturing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2248\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fracturing Regulations are \n     Effective in State Hands Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) hydraulic fracturing is a commercially viable practice \n     that has been used in the United States for more than 60 \n     years in more than 1,000,000 wells;\n       (2) the Ground Water Protection Council, a national \n     association of State water regulators that is considered to \n     be a leading groundwater protection organization in the \n     United States, released a report entitled ``State Oil and \n     Natural Gas Regulations Designed to Protect Water Resources'' \n     and dated May 2009 finding that the ``current State \n     regulation of oil and gas activities is environmentally \n     proactive and preventive'';\n       (3) that report also concluded that ``[a]ll oil and gas \n     producing States have regulations which are designed to \n     provide protection for water resources'';\n       (4) a 2004 study by the Environmental Protection Agency, \n     entitled ``Evaluation of Impacts to Underground Sources of \n     Drinking Water by Hydraulic Fracturing of Coalbed Methane \n     Reservoirs'', found no evidence of drinking water wells \n     contaminated by fracture fluid from the fracked formation;\n       (5) a 2009 report by the Ground Water Protection Council, \n     entitled ``State Oil and Natural Gas Regulations Designed to \n     Protect Water Resources'', found a ``lack of evidence'' that \n     hydraulic fracturing conducted in both deep and shallow \n     formations presents a risk of endangerment to ground water;\n       (6) a January 2009 resolution by the Interstate Oil and Gas \n     Compact Commission stated ``The states, who regulate \n     production, have comprehensive laws and regulations to ensure \n     operations are safe and to protect drinking water. States \n     have found no verified cases of groundwater contamination \n     associated with hydraulic fracturing.'';\n       (7) on May 24, 2011, before the Oversight and Government \n     Reform Committee of the House of Representatives, Lisa \n     Jackson, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, testified that she was ``not aware of any proven case \n     where the fracking process itself has affected water'';\n       (8) in 2011, Bureau of Land Management Director Bob Abbey \n     stated, ``We have not seen evidence of any adverse effect as \n     a result of the use of the chemicals that are part of that \n     fracking technology.'';\n       (9)(A) activities relating to hydraulic fracturing (such as \n     surface discharges, wastewater disposal, and air emissions) \n     are already regulated at the Federal level under a variety of \n     environmental statutes, including portions of--\n       (i) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 \n     et seq.);\n       (ii) the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.); \n     and\n       (iii) the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.); but\n       (B) Congress has continually elected not to include the \n     hydraulic fracturing process in the underground injection \n     control program under the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. \n     300f et seq.);\n       (10) in 2011, the Secretary of the Interior announced the \n     intention to promulgate new Federal regulations governing \n     hydraulic fracturing on Federal land; and\n       (11) a February 2012 study by the Energy Institute at the \n     University of Texas at Austin, entitled ``Fact-Based \n     Regulation for Environmental Protection in Shale Gas \n     Development'', found that ``[n]o evidence of chemicals from \n     hydraulic fracturing fluid has been found in aquifers as a \n     result of fracturing operations''.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF FEDERAL LAND.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``Federal land'' means--\n       (1) public lands (as defined in section 103 of the Federal \n     Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702));\n       (2) National Forest System land;\n       (3) land under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of \n     Reclamation; and\n       (4) land under the jurisdiction of the Corps of Engineers.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATE AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State shall have the sole authority to \n     promulgate or enforce any regulation, guidance, or permit \n     requirement regarding the underground injection of fluids or \n     propping agents pursuant to the hydraulic fracturing process, \n     or any component of that process, relating to oil, gas, or \n     geothermal production activities on or under any land within \n     the boundaries of the State.\n       (b) Federal Land.--The underground injection of fluids or \n     propping agents pursuant to the hydraulic fracturing process, \n     or any components of that process, relating to oil, gas, or \n     geothermal production activities on\n\n[[Page S2168]]\n\n     Federal land shall be subject to the law of the State in \n     which the land is located.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 2249. A bill to provide for the reform of the Senior Executive \nService; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Senior Executive \nService Reform Act of 2012, a bill to strengthen the Federal \nGovernment's senior leadership corps.\n  In this time of fiscal constraint, agencies and Federal employees are \nbeing asked to do more with less, and they are rising to meet this \nchallenge. Leading the way in efforts to cut costs without compromising \nagency missions are members of the Senior Executive Service, SES, who \nare responsible for driving management priorities and promoting \nefficiency within agencies and across the Government.\n  Each year, Presidential Rank Awards are given to outstanding Senior \nExecutives in recognition of their innovation and management expertise \nthat save taxpayers billions of dollars. This is no small feat in an \nera of shrinking budgets and limited resources. I am proud that such \ntalented people have chosen to join the Federal Government, and believe \nthat America has benefitted as a result of their commitment to public \nservice.\n  Last year, I chaired a hearing entitled, ``Strengthening the Senior \nExecutive Service: A Review of Challenges Facing the Government's \nLeadership Corps.'' Witnesses testified about shortcomings in Senior \nExecutive Service candidate development, diversity, and training. \nTestimony also focused on disincentives for applying to the SES, \nincluding increased workload and responsibilities compared to General \nSchedule, GS, positions with little additional compensation and fewer \nworkers' rights. This bill addresses many of the challenges my hearing \nbrought to light.\n  A recent report from the Congressional Budget Office concluded that \nFederal employees with professional degrees are paid 23 percent less \nthan their counterparts in the private sector. The Senior Executive \nService is made up of these highly-educated professionals who often \nfind themselves not only making less than those in the private sector, \nbut also other Federal workers. In 2004, Congress enacted reforms \nlinking SES pay to Congressional pay, which has not kept pace with the \nGS. As a result, the GS pay scale overlaps substantially with the lower \nend of the SES. This means that a Senior Executive may be paid less \nthan employees he or she supervises. This bill would mitigate the \noverlap--often referred to as pay compression--by having Senior \nExecutive pay more closely pace the pay of those they supervise.\n  Performance-based pay is an integral part of the Senior Executive \nService. The legislation would strengthen SES performance management \nand further address disincentives for joining the SES by including \nperformance awards as base pay for the purpose of retirement \ncalculations. Additionally, it would increase transparency in SES \nperformance ratings by requiring an explanation for why a rating is \nlowered from an initial recommendation. Quotas in performance pay \nadjustments also would be prohibited.\n  Restoration of career leadership and career development are important \ncomponents of this legislation. A Senior Executive Service Resource \nOffice would be established to collect data on the SES and oversee \ncandidate development, management, and training.\n  Finally, the bill would encourage diversity in the SES by requiring \nagencies to include ethnic minorities, women, and those with \ndisabilities as part of the SES hiring process whenever practicable. \nThis language closely mirrors the Senior Executive Service Diversity \nAssurance Act, which I introduced with Congressman Danny Davis of \nIllinois in the 110 and 111 Congresses.\n  The time has come to reframe the discussion surrounding our Nation's \ncivil servants. We must invest in our Government's senior leaders and \nrecognize the critical role they play in making our agencies and the \nFederal Government more efficient and effective.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2249\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Hoeven) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by her to the bill S. 2204, to \neliminate unnecessary tax subsidies and promote renewable energy and \nenergy conservation; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. EXPEDITED FEDERAL PERMITTING AND REVIEW DECISIONS \n                   FOR ENERGY, NATURAL RESOURCE, AND \n                   INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is imperative to significantly reduce the aggregate \n     time required to make decisions by the Federal Government on \n     the permitting and review of energy, natural resource, and \n     energy infrastructure projects, while improving environmental \n     and community outcomes;\n       (2) investing in the energy infrastructure of the United \n     States provides immediate and long-term economic benefits for \n     local communities and the United States as a whole;\n       (3) Federal permitting and review processes, including \n     planning, approval, and consultation processes, have a \n     substantive impact on the economy of the United States;\n       (4) it is critical that Executive agencies take all steps, \n     within the authority and resources of the Executive agencies, \n     to execute Federal permitting and review processes with \n     maximum efficiency and effectiveness, while ensuring the \n     health, safety, and security of communities, the environment, \n     and vital economic growth;\n       (5) Federal permitting and review processes should--\n       (A) provide a transparent, consistent, and predictable path \n     for project sponsors and affected communities;\n       (B) ensure that Executive agencies--\n       (i) establish and adhere to timelines and schedules for \n     completion of reviews;\n       (ii) establish clear permitting performance goals; and\n       (iii) track progress against those goals;\n       (C) encourage early collaboration among Executive agencies, \n     State, local, and tribal governments, project sponsors, and \n     affected stakeholders to incorporate and address affected \n     interests and minimize delays;\n       (D) provide for transparency and accountability by using \n     cost-effective information technology to collect and \n     disseminate information concerning individual projects and \n     Executive agency performance;\n       (E) rely on early and active consultation with State, \n     local, and tribal governments to avoid conflicts or \n     duplication of effort, resolve concerns, and allow for \n     concurrent rather than sequential reviews;\n       (F) recognize the critical role project sponsors play in \n     ensuring the timely and cost-effective review of projects by \n     providing complete information and analysis and by \n     supporting, as appropriate, the costs associated with review; \n     and\n       (G) enable Executive agencies--\n       (i) to share priorities;\n       (ii) to work collaboratively and concurrently to advance \n     reviews and permitting decisions; and\n       (iii) to facilitate the resolution of disputes at all \n     levels of Executive agency organization;\n       (6) each of the actions described in paragraph (5) should \n     be incorporated into routine Executive agency practice to \n     provide demonstrable improvements in the performance of \n     Federal infrastructure permitting and review processes, \n     including lower costs, more timely decisions, and a healthier \n     and cleaner environment; and\n       (7) it is imperative to institutionalize best practices--\n       (A) to enhance Federal, State, local, and tribal government \n     coordination on permitting and review processes (such as \n     conducting reviews concurrently rather than sequentially to \n     the maximum extent practicable);\n       (B) to avoid duplicative reviews;\n       (C) to engage stakeholders early in the permitting process;

CLEAN VEHICLE CORRIDORS PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Traditional transportation refueling networks are well-\n     established, but market uncertainties continue to hamper the \n     full use of cleaner-burning domestic energy resources.\n       (2) Despite considerable investor interest, higher capital \n     costs and an uncertain consumer base has limited expansion of \n     cleaner-burning alternative refueling options and its \n     customer base.\n       (3) Reduced emissions and energy independence are important \n     factors at a national level, but they are not a sufficient \n     inducement to create large-scale changes.\n       (4) While American-made fuels provide many energy security \n     and environmental benefits, a significant portion of imported \n     oil continues to be consumed as diesel fuel in on-road motor \n     vehicles.\n       (5) Motor vehicles fueled by domestically-generated, \n     cleaner-burning transportation fuels, such as compressed \n     natural gas, liquified natural gas, propane, electricity, and \n     biofuels, can pay for themselves over time, but sales of such \n     vehicles, other than return-to-base vehicles, have been \n     hampered because of insufficient refueling infrastructure.\n       (6) Simultaneous facilitation of infrastructure development \n     and a robust customer base is needed to avoid penalizing \n     current users or early adopters.\n       (7) Facilitating focused infrastructure development along \n     designated routes will foster an expansion of alternative \n     fuel vehicles and increase the likelihood for commercial \n     success.\n       (8) Eliminating the logistical barriers that are delaying \n     infrastructure development along clean vehicle corridors \n     will--\n       (A) provide alternative refueling stations with a larger \n     customer base;\n       (B) attract more buyers to the purchase of clean vehicles; \n     and\n       (C) provide new market outlets for clean fuel providers.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (1) to provide market certainty to drive private and \n     commercial capital investment in clean transportation \n     options;\n       (2) to promote clean transportation technologies that \n     will--\n       (A) lead to increased diversity and dissemination of \n     alternative fuel options; and\n       (B) enable the United States to bridge the gap from foreign \n     energy imports to secure, domestically produced energy; and\n       (3) to facilitate clean transportation incentives that \n     will--\n       (A) attract a critical mass of clean transportation \n     vehicles that will give alternative fueling stations an \n     assured customer base and market certitude;\n       (B) provide for ongoing increases in energy demands;\n       (C) support the growth of jobs and businesses in the United \n     States; and\n       (D) reduce petroleum use and emissions by vehicles.\n       (c) Clean Vehicle Corridors Program.--\n       (1) Corridor designations.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy (referred \n     to in this section as the ``Secretary'') shall designate 10 \n     ``Clean Vehicle Corridors'' along Federal highways or other \n     contiguous highways.\n       (B) Consultation.--In making designations under paragraph \n     (1), the Secretary shall--\n       (i) consult with the Secretary of Transportation; and\n       (ii) gather information from Federal, State, and local \n     governments, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals \n     to help determine which highways should be included in the \n     corridors designated under subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Infrastructure development.--\n       (A) Cleaner-burning fuels.--\n       (i) In general.--The Secretary shall encourage the addition \n     of alternative fueling options and other supporting \n     infrastructure along Clean Vehicle Corridors. These refueling \n     stations should provide 2 or more cleaner-burning fuels and \n     allow any motor vehicle that operates on such fuels to refuel \n     at distances comfortably within 1 tank range without the need \n     for prior arrangement. Existing and private facilities should \n     be encouraged to be included in the Clean Vehicle Corridors \n     network.\n       (B) Definitions.--In this paragraph:\n       (i) Cleaner-burning fuels.--The term ``cleaner-burning \n     fuels'' includes--\n\n       (I) rapid-fueling compressed natural gas;\n       (II) liquefied natural gas;\n       (III) liquefied petroleum gas (also known as propane);\n       (IV) plug-in electric;\n       (V) biofuel;\n       (VI) hydrogen; and\n       (VII) other clean fuels designated by the Secretary.\n\n       (ii) Supporting infrastructure.--The term ``supporting \n     infrastructure'' includes fueling stations, rest stops, \n     travel plazas, and other service areas on Federal or private \n     property that are found to be most practically located along \n     a Clean Vehicle Corridor.\n       (3) Information and resources on clean vehicle corridors.--\n       (A) Website.--The Secretary shall maintain a website \n     containing information and resources for Clean Vehicle \n     Corridors.\n       (B) Interstate compacts.--\n\n[[Page S2181]]\n\n       (i) Establishment.--Two or more contiguous States may enter \n     into an interstate compact to establish clean vehicle \n     corridor partnerships to facilitate planning for and siting \n     of necessary facilities within those States.\n       (ii) Technical assistance.--The Secretary, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of Energy, may provide technical \n     assistance to interstate compact partnerships established \n     pursuant to clause (i).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1990.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Regulatory Relief to Reduce \n     Energy Prices Act of 2012''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Americans are suffering through record levels of job \n     losses, slow economic growth, high gasoline prices, and \n     increasing energy costs, and unemployment in the United \n     States is currently more than 8 percent;\n       (2) the President wrote in an August 2011 letter to the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives that ``it is \n     extremely important to minimize regulatory burdens and to \n     avoid unjustified regulatory costs, particularly in this \n     difficult economic period'' and, in that letter, the \n     President identified at least 7 proposed regulations that \n     would each impose billions of dollars in new costs on the \n     private sector and, with respect to at least 1 of those \n     rules, the President ultimately directed the Federal agency \n     to not proceed with promulgation;\n       (3) the President stated in Executive Order 13563 that our \n     Nation's regulatory system should ``protect public health, \n     welfare, safety, and our environment while promoting economic \n     growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation'';\n       (4) since the issuance of Executive Order 13563, additional \n     significant Federal rules have been issued that increase \n     energy costs and hinder economic growth;\n       (5) many existing Federal laws do not expressly authorize \n     the President or the Federal agencies to delay or terminate \n     the rulemaking process for new regulations based on adverse \n     economic impacts, unemployment, energy prices and electric \n     reliability, and other related considerations; and\n       (6) it is necessary for job creation, until the \n     unemployment rate improves, to authorize the President to \n     delay or disapprove any major rule due to concerns related to \n     significant economic impacts.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act--\n       (1) is to facilitate economic growth, affordable energy, \n     and job creation by providing\n\n[[Page S2182]]\n\n     the President with authority to delay or disapprove the \n     adoption, finalization, promulgation, issuance, or \n     implementation of any major rule due to concerns related to \n     significant economic impacts; and\n       (2) is not to authorize the President to delay or terminate \n     rules that--\n       (A) facilitate economic recovery or job creation; or\n       (B) reduce the overall Federal regulatory burden.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act--\n       (1) the term ``major rule'' has the meaning given that term \n     under section 804(2) of title 5, United States Code; and\n       (2) the term ``significant economic impacts'' includes \n     impacts on energy costs and electric reliability, gasoline \n     prices, employment, gross domestic product, and related \n     considerations.\n\n     SEC. 5. APPROVAL OF MAJOR RULES BY THE PRESIDENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, any major rule (as determined by the Administrator of \n     the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the \n     Office of Management and Budget in accordance with chapter 8 \n     of title 5, United States Code) shall not become final and \n     effective until the President issues an executive order of \n     approval under subsection (b).\n       (b) Executive Orders.--\n       (1) In general.--After review of any major rule and \n     consideration of significant economic impacts, the President \n     may issue an executive order to--\n       (A) approve the major rule to become final and effective \n     notwithstanding significant economic impacts;\n       (B) delay consideration of, or action upon, the major rule \n     due to concerns related to significant economic impacts; or\n       (C) disapprove and terminate the major rule due to concerns \n     related to significant economic impacts.\n       (2) Contents.--Any executive order issued under paragraph \n     (1) shall describe the basis for the finding of significant \n     economic impacts and the rationale for the decision to \n     approve, delay, or disapprove and terminate the major rule.\n       (c) Exemption for National Security or National \n     Emergency.--A major rule is exempt from this Act if the \n     exemption is necessary in the interest of national security \n     or in response to a national emergency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1994.

Res. 409) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 409\n\n       Whereas according to the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation, at least 25.6 percent of households in the \n     United States, or close to 30,000,000 households with \n     approximately 60,000,000 adults, are unbanked or underbanked \n     and, subsequently, have missed opportunities for savings, \n     lending, and basic financial services;\n       Whereas according to the 2011 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling, 41 percent of adults in the United States, or \n     more than 77,000,000 adults living in the United States, gave \n     themselves a grade of C, D, or F on their knowledge of \n     personal finance;\n       Whereas according to the National Bankruptcy Research \n     Center, the number of personal bankruptcy filings reached \n     1,500,000 in 2010, the highest number since 2005, and in \n     2011, the percentage of total consumer filings increased from \n     2010;\n       Whereas the 2011 Retirement Confidence Survey conducted by \n     the Employee Benefit Research Institute found that only 13 \n     percent of workers were ``very confident'' about having \n     enough money for a comfortable retirement, a sharp decline in \n     worker confidence from the 27 percent of workers who were \n     ``very confident'' in 2007;\n       Whereas according to the 2011 Retirement Confidence Survey \n     conducted by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, less \n     than half of workers (42 percent) in the United States have \n     tried to calculate how much they need to save for retirement;\n       Whereas according to a 2011 ``Flow of Funds'' report by the \n     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, household \n     debt stood at $13,200,000,000,000 at the end of the third \n     quarter of 2010;\n       Whereas according to the 2011 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling, 28 percent, or nearly 64,000,000 adults, admit to \n     not paying all of their bills on time;\n       Whereas according to the 2011 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling, only 43 percent of adults keep close track of \n     their spending, and more than 128,400,000 adults do not know \n     how much they spend on food, housing, and entertainment, and \n     do not monitor their overall spending;\n       Whereas according to the 2011 Consumer Financial Literacy \n     Survey Final Report of the National Foundation for Credit \n     Counseling, 1 in 3 adults in the United States, or more than \n     75,600,000 individuals, report that they have no savings, and \n     only 22 percent of adults in the United States are now saving \n     more than they did a year ago because of the current economic \n     climate;\n       Whereas according to the seventh Council for Economic \n     Education biennial Survey of the States 2011: Economic, \n     Personal Finance, and Entrepreneurship Education in Our \n     Nation's Schools, only 22 States require students to take an \n     economics course as a high school graduation requirement, and \n     only 16 States require the testing of student knowledge in \n     economics;\n       Whereas according to the seventh Council for Economic \n     Education biennial Survey of the States 2011: Economic, \n     Personal Finance, and Entrepreneurship Education in Our \n     Nation's Schools, only 12 States require students to take a \n     personal finance course either independently or as part of an \n     economics course as a high school graduation requirement;\n       Whereas according to the Gallup-Operation HOPE Financial \n     Literacy Index, while 69 percent of American students \n     strongly believe that the best time to save money is now, \n     only 57 percent believe that their parents are saving money \n     for the future;\n       Whereas expanding access to the mainstream financial system \n     will provide individuals with less expensive and more secure \n     options for managing finances and building wealth;\n       Whereas quality personal financial education is essential \n     to ensure that individuals are prepared to manage money, \n     credit, and debt, and to become responsible workers, heads of \n     households, investors, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and \n     citizens;\n       Whereas increased financial literacy empowers individuals \n     to make wise financial decisions and reduces the confusion \n     caused by an increasingly complex economy;\n       Whereas a greater understanding of, and familiarity with, \n     financial markets and institutions will lead to increased \n     economic activity and growth;\n       Whereas, in 2003, Congress found it important to coordinate \n     Federal financial literacy efforts and formulate a national \n     strategy; and\n       Whereas, in light of that finding, Congress passed the \n     Financial Literacy and Education Improvement Act (20 U.S.C. \n     9701 et seq.), establishing the Financial Literacy and \n     Education Commission: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 2012 as ``Financial Literacy Month'' \n     to raise public awareness about--\n       (A) the importance of personal financial education in the \n     United States; and\n\n[[Page S2185]]\n\n       (B) the serious consequences that may result from a lack of \n     understanding about personal finances; and\n       (2) calls on the Federal Government, States, localities, \n     schools, nonprofit organizations, businesses, and the people \n     of the United States to observe the month with appropriate \n     programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/28/senate-section/article/S2185-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MARCH 29, 2012\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.
