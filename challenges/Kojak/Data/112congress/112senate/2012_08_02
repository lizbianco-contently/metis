We will vote at 11 o'clock, so those people debating the \ncloture motion may not get the full hour. They should understand that.\n\n\n                  recognition of the republican leader\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                             Cyber security\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to start this morning with \na word about cyber security. No one doubts the need to strengthen our \nNation's cyber security defenses. Open source reporting clearly shows \nthat our defense industrial base, financial sector, and government \nnetworks are all under attack by nation states as well as independent \nhackers. The U.S. Cyber Command, the NSA, and the FBI are working hard \nto counter these threats. So we all recognize the problem. That is \nreally not the issue. The issue is the manner in which the Democratic \nleadership has tried to steamroll a bill that would address it.\n  Members on both sides of the aisle have recommendations for improving \nour cyber defenses, and some of them thought this bill would provide an \nopportunity to propose those ideas through amendments, especially since \nDemocrats did not allow for an opportunity to do so in committee. Yet, \ndespite preventing Members from amending the bill in committee, the \nanticipated open amendment process, once this new bill got to the \nSenate floor, never happened. It just never happened. Despite being on \nthe bill now for the third day, no Senator from either party has been \nallowed to vote on any amendment.\n  Look, this is a big, complicated, far-reaching bill that involves \nseveral committees of jurisdiction. Democratic leaders have not allowed \nany of those committees to improve the bill or even vote on it. \nFrankly, I was a little surprised the majority leader decided to file \ncloture and end debate before it even started. An issue of \nthis importance deserves serious consideration and open debate. \nInstead, the majority\n\n[[Page S5902]]\n\nleader waited until the last week before August to even take it up. \nRather than give this issue the time and attention it deserves, \nDemocratic leaders brought it up with only 3 days left before recess \nand then tried to jam something through without any chance for \namendment.\n\n  The few days the bill was on the floor, the majority limited its \nconsideration to debate only and then filled the tree and filed \ncloture. But, of course, that is kind of par for the course around \nhere. This is the 65th time the majority leader has filled the \namendment tree and filed cloture--the 65th time. Just to give a point \nof comparison, the last 6 party leaders did it 40 times combined. The \nlast 6 party leaders did it 40 times combined. So the majority leader \nhas set a historic pace for blocking amendments. No amendments in \ncommittee, no amendments on the floor--take it or leave it. That is the \nstory of the Senate under the current leadership.\n  The notion that we should just roll over and wave through these bills \nwithout having a chance to improve them and that Democratic Senators \nwould be willing to be rolled in such a way is ridiculous, especially \non a bill of this significance. I remind my Democratic friends, none of \nyou were able to offer or have a vote on your amendments. By filing \ncloture and filling the tree, your amendments were blocked as well. The \nsenior Senator from Missouri authored three amendments and cosponsored \nthree others. None of those will get votes if cloture is invoked. The \nsenior Senator from Arkansas has two amendments and cosponsored \nanother. None of those will get votes if cloture is invoked. The senior \nSenator from Louisiana has authored two amendments and cosponsored one \nmore. None of those will get votes if cloture is invoked. As of this \nmorning, 29 Democratic Senators have filed 74 amendments, not counting \nthe ones used to fill the tree. That is a lot of amendments. They will \nnot get any votes. I may not support all of these amendments. In fact, \nI am sure there are many I will probably oppose. But that doesn't mean \nthe Senators who proposed them should not be entitled to have a chance \nto make their case.\n  Instead of just being rubberstamps for the majority leader, I \nencourage these Senators to stand up for themselves and their \nconstituents and demand to be heard. After all, the majority leader \nhimself said earlier this year that given the complex nature of this \nsubject, it was essential to have a thorough and open amendment process \nand even committed to ensuring it.\n  Let me read what the majority leader committed to on this bill in \nFebruary of this year. The majority leader said:\n\n       Given the complexity and significance of the legislation, \n     it is essential that we have a thorough and open debate on \n     the Senate floor, including consideration of amendments to \n     perfect the legislation, insert additional provisions where \n     the majority of the Senate supports them, and remove \n     provisions if such support does not exist. For that reason, I \n     have committed to my colleagues that we will have an \n     amendment process that will be fair and reasonable . . . this \n     legislation will have been subject to as fair, thorough, and \n     open a process as is conceivable.\n\n  That was the majority leader in February of this year.\n  There is widespread agreement that a cyber security bill should \neventually pass. We need to improve information sharing between the \nprivate and public sectors. And there is a clear indication that we \nwill need to responsibly debate this matter in the very near future. If \ncloture is not invoked today, I suggest we work in a bipartisan fashion \nto complete the bill, and I suggest that the next time we take it up, \nwe allow the Senate to be the Senate. Let Senators have their proposals \nconsidered on the floor, especially if the Democratic leadership is not \ngoing to allow them to be considered in committee.\n  Mr. President, on another matter----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the Senator from Arizona for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I see the majority leader wants to speak, but my question \nis, isn't it true that there has been a series of meetings including \nthe sponsors of the bill, those of us who believed significant \nmodifications needed to be made, and large numbers of Senators have at \nleast tentatively come to some agreement that we think could move this \nlegislation forward in a fashion that recognizes the importance of the \nissue and yet dramatically, in our view, improves the legislation? I \nhope the Republican leader and majority leader would not interpret this \nvote--which clearly cloture will not be invoked--as an impediment to \nthe process that I think was moving on a path where we could have \nreached some agreement and addressed this issue and this legislation \nconclusively.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, I say to my friend from Arizona, he is entirely \ncorrect. A vote not to finish the bill today is a vote to actually have \namendments and an opportunity to modify the bill, as we all know is \nnecessary, including my friend the majority leader, who indicated as \nmuch back in February.\n  I know the majority leader is on his feet and wants to discuss the \nmatter further. I know he may have time commitments, but I do as well. \nI have two other issues I wish to address, and then I will be happy to \nyield the floor.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Two years ago tomorrow, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner declared in a \nnow-infamous New York Times op-ed entitled ``Welcome to the Recovery'' \nthat because of the actions taken by the Obama administration during \nits first 1\\1/2\\ years, the U.S. economy was, as he put it, ``on the \nroad to recovery.'' I think it is pretty obvious that the Treasury \nSecretary jumped the gun on that one. Far from putting us on a path to \nrecovery, it is now obvious that President Obama's policies have made a \nbad situation worse.\n  Secretary Geithner was right to say that the President's policies \nwere having an effect on the economy. He was clearly wrong to conclude \nthat they were anything approaching a lasting, positive effect on the \neconomy. On the contrary, we can see that the policies of the \nPresident's first 2 years in office put us decidedly on the wrong path.\n  Two years after Secretary Geithner's op-ed, 23 million Americans are \neither unemployed, underemployed, or have given up looking for work \naltogether. Half of the college graduates cannot find a decent job, and \nwith little or no income, many have decided to move back home with mom \nand dad. Two years after Secretary Geithner all but declared victory, \nGDP growth is still at an anemic 1.5 percent. Foreclosures are still \nquite common. More Americans than ever are on food stamps. Two years \nafter Secretary Geithner welcomed Americans to the recovery, more \nAmericans are signing up for disability than are finding jobs. More \nAmericans are signing up for disability than are finding jobs. All of \nthis after the President and a Democrat-led Congress passed his major \npolicy initiatives.\n  In the face of all these things, you would think the administration \nwould change course, go in a different direction. After all, if it \nclaimed credit then for what it thought was a recovery, it would have \nto claim credit for what we actually see, now--not exactly apparent.\n  As it turns out, the administration is happy to claim credit when it \nthinks things are going well but even happier to cast blame when it \nthinks things are not going well. So 2 years after touting the impact \nthe President's policies were having on our economy, the administration \nnow acts as though they have been irrelevant. They act as though an \nadditional $5 trillion in debt isn't affecting people's anxiety about \nthe Nation's future. They act as though a $1 trillion health care bill \nthat hammers the private sector isn't affecting business activity.\n  They act as though the President's perpetual threats to raise taxes \naren't impacting investment. They act as though somehow the President's \nattacks on free enterprise aren't putting a chill on risk-taking. They \nact as though a barrage of new regulations isn't keeping businesses \nfrom hiring and expanding. They say it is Bush's fault, it is headwinds \nfrom Europe, it is the Tsunami, and it is the Republicans.\n  The President can't have it both ways. He can't be responsible for \nthe economy when he thinks it is going well and disavow responsibility \nwhen it clearly isn't. He is either responsible for it or he isn't.\n  The Treasury Secretary had it right 2 years ago when he said: The \nPresident's policies have had a big impact on the economy. What he got \nwrong\n\n[[Page S5903]]\n\nwas the fact that the impact was actually negative. If we were to ask \nourselves whether Americans are better off now than they were 2 years \nago, the answer would be obvious. The President's policies have clearly \nmade it harder for Americans to find jobs and to keep those jobs.\n  If the President wants to cast blame for the economic mess we are in, \nhe should look no further than his own policies. If he is more \nconcerned about the future of the country than his own reelection, he \nwould work with us to go in a different direction. For 3\\1/2\\ years, \nRepublicans stood ready to work with him on the kind of policies that \nwould empower the private sector to lift us out of this recovery once \nand for all. Comprehensive tax reform, an all-of-the-above energy \npolicy, eliminating burdensome regulations, these are the kinds of \nthings we can do together. We are ready whenever he is.\n  Finally, on one other subject, and I apologize to my friend the \nmajority leader for delaying him further.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Carl Kaelin\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to congratulate my old friend Carl Kaelin of \nLeitchfield, KY. Carl was recently appointed national inspector general \nof the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States at the national \nconvention in Nevada. Carl is the first Kentuckian to become VFW's \nnational inspector general, one of the highest positions in that \norganization.\n  Carl has a long history of serving his country, the Commonwealth of \nKentucky, his community and veterans across the State and, indeed, the \nNation. He served in the U.S. Army as a crew chief of an OV-1 Mowhawk \naircraft in Vietnam in 1968 and 1969. Upon his return in 1969, he \njoined VFW Post 1170 in Middletown, KY, becoming a VFW life member.\n  Carl has served the VFW in a number of positions over the years, \nincluding as post and district commander and, at the age of 33, as \nKentucky's youngest State commander.\n  In these capacities and on the VFW National Council of \nAdministration, Carl worked tirelessly on behalf of America's heroes, \nour Nation's veterans. In addition to his selfless work with the VFW, \nCarl has also been active with Kentucky's Joint Executive Council of \nVeterans Organizations and served as mayor and city councilman of the \ncity of Lynnview, KY.\n  Over the years, I have had the great fortune of working with Carl on \na number of issues to ensure our Nation's veterans receive the care and \nthe benefits they deserve.\n  I congratulate Carl Kaelin and his wife Linda on his new position and \nthank him for his military service and tireless dedication to our \nNation's veterans. I also thank him for his friendship over the years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n\n                           Order of Business\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wasn't planning on making a statement \ntoday. I felt we should leave the time for the vote we are having at \n11. It is my understanding that under the rule, Senator Coburn and \nothers will have a half hour to debate the Burma sanctions; is that \nright?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The time left over will be whatever time is left over for \nthe debate on the motion to proceed to the cloture vote; is that right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n\n\n                              tax Planning\n\n  Mr. REID. I will talk about cyber security in 1 minute. Let's talk \nabout the minority leader's continual harangue against the President of \nthe United States. Underscore all of this with what my friend the \nRepublican leader said at the beginning of this Congress: The No. 1 \nissue for him in this Congress is defeating President Obama, and that \nis how the Republicans have acted. To talk about a Republican tax plan \nwould have to bring a smile to one's face. Yesterday, an organization \ncalled the Tax Policy Center--now remember last year Mitt Romney called \nthe Tax Policy Center ``an objective third party'' and cited one of \ntheir studies to bash Rick Perry in the Republican primary. So this \nobjective third party said yesterday about Romney's tax plan that my \nfriend the Republican leader wants the American people to grab. The \nonly people to be grabbing that are very rich people.\n  The vast majority of Mitt Romney's tax plan would go to people just \nlike him, people making millions of dollars every year. Under Romney's \nplan, folks making more than $3 million a year would get a tax break of \nalmost $250,000 per year. So how will he pay for this massive handout \nto the top 1 percent? He will hand the bill to 95 percent of the \nAmerican people. Under his plan, my friend the Republican leader \nwants--I hope everyone within the sound of my voice listens to this \nbecause the Republican plan would require the average middle-class \nfamily with children to pay $2,000 more in taxes to take care of the \nmillionaires. Ninety-five percent of families in this country would be \nasked to pay more so people such as Mitt Romney can get a tax break. \nNow, that is a great program, a wonderful program.\n  Last year, I repeat, Mitt Romney called this Tax Policy Center an \nobjective third party when he was once again changing his position \nduring the Republican debates leading up to his nomination. Now that \nthe group has exposed his plan to hike taxes for 95 percent of the \nAmerican families while handing out more giveaways to millionaires, the \nTax Policy Center is suddenly too liberal, his spokespeople say, to be \ntrusted. I would suggest, when we are talking about trust, we need to \nlook no further than the person my friend the Republican leader wants \nto be President of the United States.\n  As we know, he has refused to release his tax returns. If a person \ncoming before this body wanted to be a Cabinet officer, he couldn't be \nif he had the same refusal Mitt Romney does about tax returns. So the \nword is out that he has not paid any taxes for 10 years. Let him prove \nhe has paid taxes because he has not. We already know from one partial \ntax return he gave us he has money hidden in Bermuda, the Cayman \nIslands, and a Swiss bank account. I am not making that up. Mitt Romney \nmakes more money in a single day than an average middle-class family \nmakes in 2 years or more.\n  So let's not talk about this great plan the Republicans have to \ncreate jobs. The No. 1 goal in this body by the Republicans has been to \ndamage the President of the United States. They have refused to work \nwith us in creating jobs.\n\n\n                             Cyber Security\n\n  Let's talk a little bit about cyber security. We have people coming \nover here saying: We almost have a deal. I have been hearing that for 3 \nyears. We have been working on cyber security for 3 years. They are \nover here today asking why we don't have more meetings. This is a bill \nthat has had meeting after meeting. Chairman Lieberman, Chairman \nRockefeller, and Chairman Feinstein have had plenty of meetings. They \nhave had meetings with the Republicans, meetings with Independents, and \nmeetings with business groups. So don't come and lecture us over here \nabout how my Senators should vote. We know how important this \nlegislation is. We believe this legislation is more important than \ngetting a pat on the back from the Chamber of Commerce.\n  The Chamber of Commerce does not support this legislation. That is \nwhy the Republicans are running like scared cats, because the \nRepublicans will not endorse doing something that is good for our \ncountry and that is protecting us against cyber attacks.\n  The statements made by the Republican leader speak volumes. This is \nanother filibuster that could have been prevented by their work to get \na list of relevant amendments to show how serious the Republican leader \nis about cyber security. Let's just take a few days from this week. We \nhave been stalled and stalled in months past trying to get a bill. We \ncould never get the Republican leader to endorse a bill. We worked with \nthe White House, and they came aboard. We begged and pleaded to do a \nbill together. No, no; because the Chamber of Commerce does not want a \nbill.\n  The first thing we hear about cyber security, to show how serious \nthey are, is an amendment where they want to repeal ObamaCare. They did \nthat on the last day of the month of July, when on the first day of \nAugust all these great benefits for women kick in.\n  The Republican leader was standing here and said, I want to vote on\n\n[[Page S5904]]\n\nObamaCare. Then he walks out there a few hours later, standing by the \nfamous Ohio clock, and says, cyber security, we should do it. It will \ntake a lot longer to do than the time we have. If cloture is not \ninvoked today, it is for reasons I have just enumerated but principally \nbecause of the Chamber of Commerce. They are opposed to the initial \nbill because it was mandatory that these companies do something to \nprotect America from these attacks from bad people.\n  So Senators Lieberman and Collins, the two managers of this bill from \nthe Homeland Security Committee, said: OK. We don't think this is the \nright thing to do, but we will not make the provisions mandatory \nanymore. That is still not good enough for the Chamber of Commerce. A \nvoluntary alternative is still something opposed by the Chamber of \nCommerce.\n  I have and numerous other people have come to the floor and talked \nabout how important this bill is. The bill that is before this body now \nthat we are going to vote cloture on would be a wonderful step forward. \nNo, it doesn't do everything everyone wants, but it is a good bill. It \nis to protect our country. The leaders of the security of this Nation, \nincluding General Patraeus, General Dempsey, and the people working in \nNSA say this bill is more important than Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, \nand North Korea. But the Chamber of Commerce has now interjected \nthemselves in the security of this Nation. They think they know more \nthan Patraeus, Dempsey, and all the leaders of this country. They are \ntelling the Republicans to vote against this, believing they will get \nsomething better later on. Maybe they will, but right now here is what \nwe have. I think it sends a very bad message to the country that \nRepublicans are not willing to support this legislation.\n  To show how serious the Republicans are to get this bill done, they \nfiled an amendment on a right-to-work law and they filed an amendment \non repealing Dodd-Frank. That is just some of the beginning volleys \nthey shot over here. My friend, the Senior Senator from Arizona, steps \nin and says: We are working on a list.\n\n  So I am disappointed, perplexed, and somewhat confused about how the \nRepublicans want to proceed. It is obvious--it is obvious--until they \nget a signoff from the chamber of commerce that nothing will happen on \none of the most important security interests this country has faced in \ngenerations.\n  So I would suggest that the Republican leader, rather than trying to \ndenigrate this legislation that has been done with the best interests \nof the country at heart--including one of his most valued Senators, Ms. \nCollins--do a conference call with the chamber of commerce. Have them \ncome down here and tell them what they want, and maybe, with what the \nchamber of commerce wants, we can work something out, because they are \nruling the place now as far as this legislation goes.\n  The chamber of commerce, I will repeat, for the first time that I am \naware of in the history of this country, has now become the protector \nof our Nation's security interests. That says it all, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5904-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of S. 3326, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill, (S. 3326), to amend the African Growth and \n     Opportunity Act to extend the third-country fabric program \n     and to add South Sudan to the list of countries eligible for \n     designation under that Act, to make technical corrections to \n     the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States relating \n     to the textile and apparel rules of origin for the Dominican \n     Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement, \n     to approve the renewal of import restrictions contained in \n     the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to say I appreciate \nthe leadership for working to ensure a vote on this package. This \npackage was slowed down not because anybody is truly opposed to what we \nare trying to do, but the package was slowed down because of the way we \nare paying for it. We are going to see that coming over from the House \nas well. It is not a Republican or a Democratic problem; it is a \nproblem of all of us because there is going to be an emergency farm \nbill, a disaster bill, coming over that is going to spend almost $400 \nmillion, and it is paid for over 5 years. That has to stop. It has to \nstop.\n  Right now, in this country, every man, woman, and child is on the \nhook for $53,000 of debt. So the typical American family is on the hook \nfor 212,000 bucks right now because of what we have done. So my \nobjection was not with the AGOA package, it is not with Myanmar, it is \nnot with any of that. Those are great policy things. My objection is we \nare addicted to not fulfilling our responsibilities and delaying.\n  So this is a very simple, straightforward message and amendment that \ndoes two things: One, it recognizes the recommendation of the Obama \nadministration in terms of duplication and the need for consolidation. \nThat is how we are eventually going to get out of the hole. We have \n$130 trillion in unfunded liabilities, and we have $16 trillion in \ndebt. It was a good recommendation. We totally ignored it. We have \nignored it. Nothing has happened on what they have recommended. There \nhave been no hearings on what the Obama administration recommended in \nterms of combining some of the departments at OMB.\n  So this is just a step toward trying to meet in the middle with what \nthe Obama administration has recommended and us actually paying the \n$200 million in costs over 2 years, with $200 million worth of savings \nin 2 years.\n  The bill, as it presently stands, takes 10 years to pay for $200 \nmillion. We have a $3.7 trillion budget--or CR--and we can't find--it \nis less than one-hundredth of 1 percent, and we can't find it. So what \nthis does is delay the cost--the payment--for this bill over a period \nof years, all the way out to 2023. No family who is broke gets to \noperate that way--and we are. Nobody who has maxed out their credit \ncards gets to do that, and we have maxed them out. So what we are \nsaying is there is a ton of money that is available that we can use.\n  We have had three amendments on this floor that everybody who is \ngoing to be in opposition to this have voted for to eliminate \nduplication. The vast majority of my colleagues on the other side have \nvoted for it, and the vast majority of my colleagues on my side have \nvoted for it. So we are going to use that same skill where we know \nthere is waste and we know there is inefficiency. We have tons of GAO \nreports, tons of IG, and tons of oversight of the Homeland Security \nCommittee in the Senate that shows where the duplication is. All we are \nasking is, let's pay for it. Let's pay for it.\n  This place is so manipulated, I couldn't get a score until yesterday \nbecause somebody was telling them don't give him a score. Then when we \nchanged the amendment, all of a sudden, because we want to know what \nthe amendment says, CBO says: Well, wait a minute. That might not work. \nThe fact is CBO didn't read our amendment right, and they know they \ndidn't. So OMB was consulted. They said this amendment is \nimplementable, and it fits with what the President was recommending in \nterms of consolidation of programs.\n  So what it says is let's make this a start today. Let's actually \nstart paying for things in the years in which we are going to spend the \nmoney, and let's not kick the can down the road. Let's not charge it to \nour kids because the history is we take 10 years to pay for something, \nwe come back next year and we will change it. We will change it. So \nwhat was paid for this year all of a sudden is not paid for anymore, \nand it is smoke and mirrors for the American people.\n  So this is very straightforward. It is a clean pay-for. It uses two \nmechanisms to get there which have been scored that will accomplish it.\n  I fully support the AGOA. I am sorry we got delayed. I am actually \nsorry it took--because there has already been\n\n[[Page S5905]]\n\nsome damage done, than had we passed it when it came here. That was \nnever my intent, but we can right that today. What I agreed to is if I \nlose the amendment, fine. But to not try to pay for things, to not \ncreate a discipline to get back where we should be--we are going to do \nthis. We may not do this today, but I promise my colleagues the \ninternational financial community, in a very short period of time, is \ngoing to make us do this. So let's start doing it on our own under our \nown terms rather than what some foreign bondholder or the Chinese want \nto do.\n  The other objection that might be there is, well, if we do this, it \nwill have to go back to the House. That is right. This passed on \nsuspension. There was very little opposition to it. It will go back \nmodified; they will pass it. I have talked to the Speaker. They haven't \npassed the other one first because they are waiting on us to act. We \nwill hold ours at the desk because it has a revenue problem; they will \nmodify theirs; they will do exactly what we did. I would just \nappreciate us standing up to the real problems in front of us.\n  It is a great goal to want to help these areas. It is a great goal to \nput the sanctions back on Myanmar so that they can be adjusted and used \nto create freedom. Those are great goals. But there is a greater goal \nbecause none of those things are going to matter if our financial \nsystem, our way of life, crashes around us because we are not \nresponsible here.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator wish to call up \nhis amendment?\n  Mr. COBURN. I do. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2771\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2771.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. AMENDMENTS TO AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT.\n\n       (a) Extension of Third-Country Fabric Program.--Section \n     112(c)(1) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (19 \n     U.S.C. 3721(c)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) in the paragraph heading, by striking ``2012'' and \n     inserting ``2015'';\n       (2) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``2012'' and inserting \n     ``2015''; and\n       (3) in subparagraph (B)(ii), by striking ``2012'' and \n     inserting ``2015''.\n       (b) Addition of South Sudan.--Section 107 of that Act (19 \n     U.S.C. 3706) is amended by inserting after ``Republic of \n     South Africa (South Africa).'' the following:\n       ``Republic of South Sudan (South Sudan).''.\n       (c) Conforming Amendment.--Section 102(2) of that Act (19 \n     U.S.C. 3701(2)) is amended by striking ``48''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION, REDUNDANCY, \n                   AND OVERLAP OF FEDERAL TRADE PROGRAMS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Director of \n     the Office of Management and Budget shall coordinate with the \n     heads of the relevant Federal agencies--\n       (1) to, not later than 60 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, eliminate, consolidate, or streamline \n     Federal programs and Federal agencies with duplicative or \n     overlapping missions relating to trade;\n       (2) to, not later than September 30, 2012, rescind the \n     unobligated balances of all amounts made available for fiscal \n     year 2012 for programs relating to trade for the Department \n     of Commerce, the Small Business Administration, the Export-\n     Import Bank of the United States, the Overseas Private \n     Investment Corporation, and the Trade and Development Agency, \n     with the amounts rescinded to be deposited in the general \n     fund of the Treasury for purposes of deficit reduction;\n       (3) to reduce spending on programs described in paragraph \n     (2) by not less than $192,000,000 in fiscal years 2012 and \n     2013 (including the amounts rescinded pursuant to paragraph \n     (2)); and\n       (4) to report to Congress not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act with recommendations for \n     any legislative changes required to further eliminate, \n     consolidate, or streamline Federal programs and Federal \n     agencies with duplicative or overlapping trade missions.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak both in favor of the \npassage of the bill, S. 3326, and to speak against the Coburn \namendment.\n  I, first, wish to thank Leaders Reid and McConnell, as well as \nSenators Baucus and Hatch, for working together diligently to find a \npath forward for passing this bill. I wish to recognize Senator Coburn \nand Senator Menendez for being willing to work with us to get to today.\n  I say with some regret that I stand to speak against the Coburn \namendment because I respect and recognize Senator Coburn's \ndetermination to hold this body accountable and to find pathways \nforward to deal with our record deficit and debt. In that broader \nobjective, I look forward to working with him on finding responsible \npay-fors in future bills and in finding ways that we can steadily \npartner to reduce the deficit and to find and root out waste and abuse \nin Federal spending. But I have to say in this particular case, on this \namendment, on this day, if we change the pay-for, we kill the bill.\n  We have heard clearly from the Republican chairman of the House Ways \nand Means Committee, Mr. Camp, and from his ranking minority member, \nCongressman Levin, that they will not take up this bill if amended in \nthis form, if broken and reassembled, or if sent over in any other way. \nThe pressure of today and the pressure of the value, the importance of \nthis bill is what I choose to speak to. I may at some point reserve \ntime to speak to other issues embedded in the amendment, but I first \nwanted to speak to the underlying bill.\n  I am the chairman of the African Affairs Subcommittee of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, and it is, in some ways, my special honor \nand challenge to help this body grasp why the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act is important for us to reauthorize today. Specifically \nwhat I am speaking to is the third-country fabric provision which \nexpires in September. This Chamber is about to go out of session later \ntoday, and every day we delay in the reauthorization of this critical \nprovision costs jobs, costs opportunity, and costs the future. Let me \nspeak to that for a few minutes, if I might.\n  Creating American jobs and fueling our economic recovery is my top \npriority, and I know it is for many Members of this body. That is why I \nam here to talk about what we can do to strengthen our economic \nsecurity. It may surprise my colleagues, but the truth is one of the \nbest ways to look for that future opportunity is one that was \nconsidered among the least likely just a few years ago in Sub-Saharan \nAfrica.\n  Access to emerging markets is critical to America's health and \ngrowth, and increased political stability and rising wages in an \nemerging middle class across Africa makes it the most promising \ncontinent for countries willing to invest in long-term partnerships \nwith the United States. In AGOA--the African Growth and Opportunity \nAct--and its third-country fabric provision, the United States has \nseized this opportunity to pursue broad and mutually beneficial \neconomic relationships that give American consumers and businesses \neconomic security by allowing eligible countries to export apparel from \nAfrica that is more affordable to the American consumer and, in so \ndoing, create jobs in Africa that otherwise would be elsewhere in the \nworld.\n  This key provision, as I have said, expires in September. Our delay \nin moving forward with reauthorization that has earned strong \nbipartisan support is already disrupting production for American \napparel companies along with the supply chain on which their customers \ndepend. In my view, we cannot wait to take action. America can't afford \nto turn its back on African markets, and Congress can't afford to turn \nits back on extending this provision.\n  Every 3 years since 2000, Congress has unanimously passed the \nreauthorization of this provision without controversy, and it is, in my \nview, time to do so again.\n  I respect Senator Coburn's concern that we must change business as \nusual in this Chamber, but the timing of this amendment and the timing \nof this concern is, to me, not wise.\n  Today Secretary Clinton is in the middle of a continent-wide tour of \nAfrican countries. She is engaging with\n\n[[Page S5906]]\n\ncountries for strong emerging middle classes, and that offers us great \nopportunity: future economic partnership and very real political \npartnerships. From Ghana to Ethiopia to Tanzania to a half dozen other \ncountries, some of the fastest growing economies in the world are in \nSub-Saharan Africa. The seven countries that are the fastest growing \neconomies in Sub-Saharan Africa are home to 350 million potential \nconsumers of our products. In my view, that is why I am urging my \ncolleagues to vote against the Coburn amendment and to allow us to pass \nthis critically important bill today. Failing to do so, in my view, is \nbad for Africa and for America.\n\n  Reauthorizing this provision supports the poorest African workers, \nthe vast majority of them women. Senator Isakson, who is my capable and \ntalented ranking minority member on the African Affairs Subcommittee, \njoined with Congressman Smith and Congresswoman Bass, who are our \ncounterparts in the House, in hosting a meeting 3 months and 6 months \nago with roughly 35 Ambassadors from all over the continent who pleaded \nwith us to reauthorize this critical provision.\n  The economic benefits of a strong middle class in Africa are \nobvious--a pool of new consumers hungry for American products; \npotential partners for us. And countries with flourishing middle \nclasses are more likely to have strong democratic institutions, good \ngovernance, and low corruption. They are more likely to be stable and \nbulwarks against instability in Africa, a region that I think is vital \nto our future.\n  In short, then, reauthorizing this provision and continuing our \nstrong bipartisan support of tradition for AGOA is where the United \nStates can continue to differentiate itself from competitors such as \nChina, which recently surpassed the United States as Africa's No. 1 \ntrading partner. The United States has exports to Sub-Saharan Africa \nthat exceeded $21 billion last year, growing at a pace that exceeds our \nexports to the rest of the world.\n  Africans want to partner with us. They want to work with us, and they \nseek opportunity. This sort of bipartisanship that in the past has \nallowed this AGOA third country fabric provision to be reauthorized \nwithout controversy is one that I think we should embrace again today. \nSo let's end the delays and reauthorize this provision.\n  Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes of my time, if I might, to the \nSenator from Georgia, who would like to speak to the issue of the value \nof the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Chair how much of \nthe proponents' time would that 3 minutes leave?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Five minutes.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise for just a moment to do two \nthings. First of all, I spent 33 years selling houses. I have dealt \nwith honest brokers, and I have dealt with brokers who were hard to \ndeal with and whom I would never categorize as honest. Senator Coburn \nfrom Oklahoma is the most honest broker I have ever dealt with in \npolitics or in selling houses. I wish to acknowledge for just a second \nexactly what he said about the process, his support for the AGOA \nprovisions but his concern about the pay-for, but the fact that he \nnever tried to scuttle this piece of legislation, he only tried to get \nhis day in court. I respect that, and I want him to know that. If we \nall acted a little bit more like that, we would have a lot more debate \non the floor and a lot fewer problems in terms of running our country.\n  As far as AGOA, I want to say this. As the chairman and ranking \nmember, as Senator Coons and I are, of the African Affairs \nSubcommittee, we travel to that continent quite a bit. One of my trips \nwas to the Sudan, to Darfur, and to the South Sudan, when the \ncomprehensive peace agreement was being negotiated. As this body knows, \nthe South Sudan had their revolution peacefully. South Sudan became the \nnewest country on the face of this Earth, and South Sudan will become, \nif AGOA passes today, one of the parties to this agreement, which is \ncritical to the developing economy of the South Sudan as an independent \nnation. Further, the other nations that are included are nations that \ndepend on this legislation to raise a middle class in Africa that will \nbecome the customers of the United States of America and our \nbusinesses.\n  I say often in my speeches about Africa that if it is true that \nEurope was the continent of the 20th century in the first 50 years and \nif it is true that Asia was the most important continent in the last 50 \nyears of the 20th century, Africa is the continent of the 21st century. \nThis is an agreement that is important to our relationship with Africa, \nit is important to our economy, it is important to American textiles, \nand it is important to jobs in Africa.\n  I commend Senator Coons for his hard work, and I intend to support \nthe AGOA bill and ask all of my fellow colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is intriguing to me. We heard the \nSenator from Delaware absolutely assure us that if we defy this, the \nHouse is not going to do the right thing. My conversation with Chairman \nCamp was different from that. I do not know what the timing was between \nour conversations. But it is never the right time in Washington to fix \nour problems.\n  We do a lot of great things. You want to talk about job creation? Job \ncreation has decreased by 1 million jobs a year in this country simply \nbecause we continue to add to our debt. And this bill adds to our debt. \nIt is not paid for. It has another trick in there that actually charges \nmore in corporate taxes just to get around pay-go.\n  So the point is--and I will not have any more to say on this bill so \nwe can go on and get to the other--the point is, if we stood and did \nthe right thing and led this country by actually paying for something \nat the time, the House would change it--just for the very reasons the \nSenator from Delaware said. It is important. If we had a strong vote \nthat said: Yes, it is important, but, by dingy, we are not going to \nkeep doing the same thing that has been bankrupting this country--but \nnow we use an excuse to say: Well, here is our reason why we cannot do \nwhat is right.\n  America should spit us out of their mouth. We never find the right \ntime to actually have the fiscal discipline that will solve our \ncounty's problems and create a viable future for our children, let \nalone African children.\n  So that is a real choice today. I do not expect to win this because \nthis place is not going to change until the people who are here decide \nthat the future of our country is more important than anything else and \nwe start acting like it. And we can do good things internationally, but \nwe can do them the right way that will not put our children at risk. \nOur debt level is such that our GDP is decreased by 1 percent right \nnow--it is proven--just because of the amount of debt we have.\n\n  So we are going to pass a bill with great intentions, with which I \nagree. It will have a great result; I agree with that. We can do both. \nWe can actually do better. But it is because there is not the spine in \nthe Senate to stand up and make the hard choice. This country is full \nof people outside of Washington who are used to making hard choices, \nand they are doing it in this tough economic time all the time. They \nare making hard choices. We lack the intestinal fortitude to do that. \nWe should have them here and us home because they know how to get it \ndone.\n  So what we are going to do is we are going to do the same thing we \nhave always done. We are not going to make the hard choice. We are not \ngoing to do the best we can do. We are going to settle for second best \nbecause we have an excuse not to make the hard choice. The excuse right \nnow is that the House will not move. Well, I will guarantee you, if it \nas important as Senator Coons and Senator Isakson say it is, and \nRepresentative Smith, and we sit here and say our position is that it \nis paid for within 2 years, I will bet you by tomorrow it will be paid \nfor within 2 years. But we will not ever do that because we lack the \ncourage to do the hard thing, the right thing. What has that gotten us? \nIt has gotten us deeper in debt, a depressed economy, an anxious \nAmerican citizenry that has no\n\n[[Page S5907]]\n\nconfidence about the future, which is so self-fulfilling in terms of \ndriving the economy down even further.\n  It is time for us to lead. This is a small issue, but if we cannot \neven pay for $200 million over 2 years, we do not deserve to be here, \nwe do not deserve it, because what we are really doing--we are helping \npeople in Africa, we are helping the freedom in Burma, but what we are \nreally doing is taking just a little bit of freedom away from our kids. \nThat is the real vote here. It is really not about money; it is about \ndestroying the future prospects of this country because we refuse to \nmake a hard choice.\n  There can be a lot of flowery speeches about it. We can say we are \ngoing to do something good. I will tell you that well-intentioned \ndesires by the Members of this body are what has us $16 trillion in \ndebt.\n  I will not spend any more time. I have the greatest respect for the \nSenator from Delaware. I know he believes in this cause. He is bigger \nthan this. He can make this tough vote. He knows how big the problems \nare. If we are not going to do it now, when are we going to do it? If \nwe are not going to do it on something small, when are we going to do \nit?\n  We are not going to do it, and that is what the American people get. \nThat is why there is an uprising in this country to get back to the \nbasics of the Constitution. That is why there are people who are \ninterested--because we have mismanaged it because we will not do the \nhard part.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  I will ask for the yeas and nays at the appropriate time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Oklahoma \nfor his remarks.\n  If I might just conclude my comments on this amendment by speaking in \na little detail on the amendment and its substance.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma essentially directs the administration to \nfind $192 million in reductions in spending in the following agencies: \nthe Department of Commerce, the Small Business Administration, the \nExport-Import Bank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and \nthe Trade and Development Agency.\n  In my role as the chair of the African Affairs Subcommittee, we \nrecently held a hearing on expanding U.S. trade opportunities in Africa \nfor exactly the reasons I elucidated previously: that there is enormous \ngrowth, there are great opportunities across the continent. Our \ncompetitors from all over the world--not just China but Brazil, Russia, \nand other European countries--are expanding their investment and their \nseizure of these opportunities in a way that we are not.\n  The structure of this amendment would simply declare that there is \n$200 million of waste and duplication at several important trade \nagencies and direct the administration to slash their budgets for that \namount and then hope for the best.\n  That is what Senator Coburn's proposed offset would do. These are \nagencies that promote and finance U.S. exports and help small and large \nU.S. businesses export and compete in a global market. In my view, \nexports, particularly to this market, mean jobs. So I am not convinced \nthat now is the time to blindly slash our ability to export. I think we \nshould instead be encouraging exports.\n  In the context of the Federal budget, $192 million is a very, very \nsmall amount of money. I look forward to working with Senator Coburn to \nfind other places where we can find reductions of this size. But this \namendment, at this time, on this day, would kill the broader and more \nimportant objective of reauthorizing the African Growth and Opportunity \nAct third-party fabric provision, of moving forward with relevant Burma \nsanctions, and of moving forward with an important technical fix to \nCAFTA.\n  This is a carefully crafted compromise bill that the House will pass \nonce we pass it. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Coburn \namendment and to move forward with passage of this vital bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n\n\n                       Cybersecurity Act of 2012\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, later this morning we will vote on \nwhether to invoke cloture on a major cyber security bill. In the past 3 \ndays we have received letters from GEN Keith Alexander, who is the head \nof Cyber Command as well as the chief of the National Security Agency, \nfrom the Secretary of Homeland Security, and from the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, urging us to act immediately on this important \nlegislation. Let me read briefly from all three of these letters.\n  General Alexander said the following:\n\n       I am writing to express my strong support for passage of a \n     comprehensive bipartisan cyber security bill by the Senate \n     this week. The cyber threat facing the Nation is real and \n     demands immediate action. The time to act is now; we simply \n     cannot afford further delay.\n\n  That is what General Alexander has told us.\n  Secretary Napolitano wrote to us:\n\n       I am writing to express my strong support for S. 3414, the \n     Cybersecurity Act of 2012. I can think of no more pressing \n     legislative need in our current threat environment.\n\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dempsey, wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       I am writing to add my voice to General Alexander's and \n     urge immediate passage of comprehensive cyber security \n     legislation. We must act now.\n\n  How many more implorings do we need from our Nation's top homeland \nand military officials to act on what many believe to be the greatest \nthreat that is facing our Nation? A cyber attack with catastrophic \nconsequences is a threat to our national security, our economic \nprosperity and, indeed, to our very way of life. Our adversaries have \nthe means to launch a cyber attack that would be devastating to our \ncountry. All the experts tell us, it is not a matter of if a cyber \nattack is going to be launched, it is when it is going to occur.\n  So I find it incredible and indeed irresponsible that this body is \nunable to reach an agreement to allow us to move forward on this \nimportant legislation. It is astonishing to me that irrelevant, \nnongermane amendments have been filed to this important bill on both \nsides of the aisle. It is unacceptable that we have worked hard and \nhave come up with a list of relevant and germane amendments, and yet we \ncannot seem to reach an agreement to proceed.\n  American officials--our government officials--have already documented \nthat our businesses are losing billions of dollars annually and \nmillions of jobs due to cyber attacks, attacks that are happening on \nour government and business computers and individual computers each and \nevery day.\n  Yet our defenses are not there. General Alexander, who knows more \nabout the cyber threat than any individual in this country, was asked \nto rank our preparedness for a large-scale cyber attack on a scale of 1 \nto 10. Do you know what he said? He deemed us to be at a 3. Is a 3 \nadequate to protect this country from what we know is coming, that is \nonly a matter of time?\n  There have been all sorts of suggestions for improving this bill. We \nhave adopted many of those suggestions. Indeed, we have made major \nchanges to make this bill more acceptable to those on my side of the \naisle. And what has been our reward? To be criticized for making \nchanges in the bill, for having Members on our side of the aisle, my \nside of the aisle, say, well, now it is a different bill.\n  Well, it is a different bill because we took their suggestions, and \nwe took the suggestions of a bipartisan group acting in good faith \nheaded by Senator Kyl and Senator Whitehouse. There is much more I want \nto say on this issue. I see the chairman has arrived on the floor. I \nknow opponents to the bill such as Senator Hutchison wish to speak and \nshould certainly be given the right to do so. But let me say that \nrarely have I been so disappointed in the Senate's failure to come to \ngrips with a threat to our country that all of these officials have \nwarned us over and over again is urgent and must be addressed now. Not \nmaybe in September; not probably by the end of the year; not in the \nnext Congress, but now.\n\n[[Page S5908]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wanted to get the time for our side \nand the time for the bill sponsor's side and clarify that the people on \nour side would have 15 minutes. Is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time is divided between the two \nleaders or their designees. The Republican side has approximately 9 \nminutes, and the majority side has 16 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I wanted to clarify that there would be time for the \nopposition side. I did not know if Senator Collins is speaking for the \nmajority side then or the minority side. I am trying to clarify to \nassure that the opposition is getting some equal amount of time or \nclose to equal.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I understand the time is divided \nbetween the two leaders. But I think there is 15 minutes for the \nproponents and for those opposed. I would ask unanimous consent that \nthat be the case.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding \nthat I am managing the time on the Republican side. I, of course, want \nto make sure that the Senator from Texas is treated fairly and is given \nan opportunity to present her views. But it was my understanding that \nthe 15 minutes is allocated to me to dole out or to allocate on our \nside.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Then how much time would the proponents have with \nSenator Collins and Senator Lieberman on the proponents' side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time is divided between the two \nsides, not between the proponents and opponents.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How much, then, would be left on the Republican side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 7 minutes left on the \nRepublican side. The majority side has 15.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that the \nopponents have at least 10 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I have no objection.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Nor do I.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to be notified when I have 5 \nminutes left, because Senator McCain is expected on the floor, and if \nSenator Chambliss or others come, I would like to have the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment \nthat we are taking a vote that is very premature. Not that we have not \nbeen discussing this bill for over a year. I have certainly been one of \nthe first to say that we should vote on a cyber security bill. This is \na complicated bill. It is a bill that did not get marked up in \ncommittee.\n  In our discussions, we are talking about amendments. I want to say \nthat the proponents of the bill before us have certainly been willing \nto talk and adjust and try to make changes in the bill. It is not there \nyet even though we have been meeting pretty much constantly. There are \nthree different groups that have a very strong interest. All of us are \ninterested in getting a cyber security bill, but none of us likes what \nis before us--well, obviously the proponents of the bill like what is \nbefore us.\n  But two other groups are very concerned about further needs in the \nbill. Let me say that we have an alternative called SECURE IT. It is \ncosponsored by eight of the ranking members of committees and \nsubcommittees that have jurisdiction over cyber security. Senators \nMcCain, myself, Chambliss, Grassley, Murkowski, Coats, Burr, and \nJohnson are cosponsoring a bill that could pass the House and go to the \nPresident.\n  My concern with S. 3414, on which we are voting on cloture, is on the \nprocess, because we have not had a chance to amend this bill. The \nmajority leader is attempting to invoke cloture and fill the tree so \nthat we are not able to put any amendments on this bill at all. It is a \nbill that will not get 41 votes for sure. And there are many others who \nare very concerned about the substance of the bill.\n\n  You cannot have a bill with no amendments that is this important and \nthis technical. Let me state some of my concerns on the bill before us. \nFirst, it will actually undermine the current information sharing \nbetween the government and the private sector. The biggest priority we \nhave is to get the private sector to the table and to make sure they \nhave the ability to not only give information to the government but get \ninformation from the government. Furthermore, they must be able to \nshare among the other industries, if they see a cyber threat, on an \nexpedited basis.\n  No. 2, the Department of Homeland Security would be granted authority \nover standard setting for private sector systems. That is unacceptable \nin the private sector and most certainly is not going to produce what \nis a consensus for getting the information we need. It assumes that \ngovernment must take the adversarial role against private network \nowners in order to get cooperation when, in fact, both the government \nand the private sector share the same goals of increased cyber \nsecurity.\n  Let me read from a couple of letters we have received with concerns \nabout this bill. The American Bankers Association, the Financial \nServices Roundtable, the Consumer Bankers Association, and 6 other \norganizations say: This legislation threatens to undermine important \ncyber security protections already in place for our customers and \ninstitutions. It misses an opportunity to substantially improve cyber \nthreat information sharing between the Federal Government and the \nprivate sector.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers says: The creation of a new \ngovernment-administered program in an agency yet to be named forces \nunnecessary regulatory uncertainty on the private sector.\n  The defense industry groups are very concerned about not having \ndirect access to the National Security Agency with whom they deal now, \nand this bill would take that away from their capabilities.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Let me ask my colleagues, I have reserved the 5 \nminutes that I have for opponents. Is that going to change, Senator \nLieberman? If not, I will give 2\\1/2\\ minutes each to Senator McCain \nand Senator Chambliss of my 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I think that is the situation we are \nin, because the vote is set to go off in a little more than 15 minutes. \nI have not spoken yet.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will ask my colleagues, Senator McCain--I can give \nyou 2\\1/2\\ minutes to you and Senator Chambliss. While they are going \nto their microphones, I want to say that they have been instrumental in \ntrying to get a consensus bill. And they, like myself, are very \ndisappointed that we are prematurely voting on a cloture motion when we \nhave had no ability to amend the bill.\n  I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to Senator McCain.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, Mr. President, I want to again thank Senator \nLieberman and Senator Collins for their willingness to negotiate \nseriously. I want to thank also Senator Chambliss as well as Senator \nHutchison and many others, Senator Kyl and others.\n  We have had large meetings, small meetings, medium-sized meetings. We \nhave had discussions among various groups. I believe we sort of had the \noutlines of a framework that we could have had a certain number of \namendments that we all agreed to that would be voted on. At the same \ntime, we could prevail upon some of our colleagues not to have \nnongermane amendments.\n  Unfortunately, the first amendment proposed by the majority leader \nhas to do with tax cuts. Look, I say to my colleagues that I think we \nhave developed a framework where we can move forward with a certain \nnumber of germane amendments. All of us appreciate how important this \nissue is.\n  I don't see the need for this vote. Cloture will not be invoked. All \nit will do is embed people in their previously held positions. What we \nshould be\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\ndoing is continuing productive negotiations and discussions that we had \nall during yesterday, put off this cloture vote, and try to come to \nsome agreement in recognition that cyber security is a vital national \nsecurity issue. We all recognize that. We started out very much poles \napart. I think there have been some agreements made which I view as \nsignificant progress.\n  I regret, I say to Senator Lieberman, Senator Collins, and all my \ncolleagues, that we are taking this vote when we should be spending our \ntime--at least the rest of the day--setting up a framework that we can \naddress cyber security during the first week we are back in September. \nBut it is what it is.\n  I thank Senators Lieberman and Collins for their willingness to sit \ndown and negotiate. We still have significant differences, but I think \nthose could have been resolved. I hope this vote doesn't have a \nchilling effect on what I think was progress that was being made.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. On issues of transparency and information sharing and \nothers, there are still differences, but they have been narrowed. \nAgain, I thank my colleagues for their hard work.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, let me add to what Senator McCain has \nsaid. We have been working very hard with the sponsors of the bill, \nSenators Lieberman and Collins, who have been receptive and open to our \ndialog over the last several days and weeks. It is an indication, No. \n1, that everybody in this body recognizes the seriousness of this \nissue, but it is also a recognition of the complexity of this issue. \nThere are about four or five committees of jurisdiction that have a \npiece of the issue of cyber security and, unfortunately, we didn't go \nthrough the regular order of giving all those committees the \nopportunity to go through the regular markup process. That may or may \nnot have solved some of the issues we are now dealing with. But we are \ndown to the final minutes before a cloture vote.\n  Unfortunately, I will vote against cloture and I recommend that my \ncolleagues do likewise and that we continue over this break to \nnegotiate on the remaining issues we have. They have been narrowed in \nnumber and scope. Both sides are negotiating in good faith because we \nall understand this is an issue of such critical importance.\n  The basic philosophical difference we have is that we all seek to \nprotect the private sector from cyber attacks that may have a huge \nimpact on life or on our economy. The issue is, primarily, does the \ngovernment know better how to do that or does the private sector know \nbetter how to protect itself, as we think it does. While we understand \nthe government has a role to play, we have capabilities and capacities \nwithin the Federal Government that the private sector doesn't have, and \nwe recognize that. That is why we have been negotiating in good faith \nto try to find that common ground between the government and the \nprivate sector to ensure the protection of the basic critical \ninfrastructure in this country.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the two letters from which I read in my statement \nand an article from the Wall Street Journal this morning on this issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   August 1, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Republican Leader McConnell: \n     The financial services industry, represented by the \n     undersigned organizations, opposes the Cybersecurity Act of \n     2012 (S. 3414) in its current form. While we strongly support \n     efforts to protect the nation's critical infrastructure from \n     cyber-attacks, this legislation threatens to undermine \n     important cybersecurity protections already in place for our \n     customers and institutions, and misses an opportunity to \n     substantially improve cyber threat information-sharing \n     between the federal government and the private sector.\n       Our sector recognizes the very real and ongoing threat of \n     cyber-attacks and works very hard to prevent those attacks by \n     constantly updating, and investing heavily in our security \n     systems. We work tirelessly, day and night, to block cyber-\n     attacks, including working with the federal government and \n     other private sectors to share information and design \n     effective ways to mitigate cyber threats. Given this, we \n     believe any legislation passed by the Senate, and eventually \n     enacted into law, must take a balanced approach that builds \n     upon, but does not duplicate or undermine what is already in \n     place and working well in the financial sector. At the same \n     time, it should enhance Cybersecurity protections in areas \n     where they are most needed.\n       There are several issues and questions raised by the \n     technical language included in the revised bill. For \n     instance, while the sponsors of the legislation have \n     attempted to design a voluntary framework for the designation \n     of ``critical infrastructure,'' the text of the bill would \n     likely create a mandatory regulatory regime that could \n     displace robust efforts already being made in the financial \n     sector to combat the risk of cyber-attacks. Additionally, the \n     government agency ``Council'' created in Title I of the bill \n     to conduct risk assessments, and set best practices for \n     protecting critical infrastructure does not provide a \n     meaningful role for sector-specific agencies that oversee \n     financial institutions. The bill does not recognize the \n     existing security standards and regulations to which \n     financial institutions are subject, including the Gramm-\n     Leach-Bliley Act, nor the regular oversight and examinations \n     conducted by financial regulatory agencies. This opens the \n     door for inconsistent and potentially duplicative regulations \n     that are more than likely to become mandatory for our \n     industry.\n       Further, the process for designating financial systems as \n     covered critical infrastructure does not provide for \n     meaningful input of financial agencies or the private sector, \n     and this is crucially important for determining what is, in \n     fact, critical and what is not. Finally, we are concerned \n     that the changes made to the Title VII information sharing \n     provisions could actually restrict some forms of important \n     information sharing between the government and private \n     sectors, as well as decrease the current level of information \n     sharing between private entities.\n       As the Senate considers S. 3414, a legislative proposal we \n     support could be considered as an amendment on the Senate \n     floor; specifically, Amendment #2581 offered by Senators \n     Hutchison and McCain, which encompasses the SECURE IT Act of \n     2012 (S. 3342). This amendment would provide necessary \n     updates and clarifications to current law that will \n     facilitate and increase cyber intelligence information \n     sharing within the private and public sectors, as well as \n     update the federal information security policy, encourage \n     research and development, and increase criminal penalties. We \n     encourage you to support this amendment, which builds upon \n     our existing regulatory structure, better protecting \n     financial institutions and our customers.\n       We recognize that more needs to be done to encourage high \n     levels of cybersecurity protection across all sectors deemed \n     critical infrastructure. We would like to continue to work \n     with you and your colleagues in the Senate to pass \n     legislation that accomplishes this goal, while utilizing \n     existing regulatory requirements and ensuring a central role \n     for sector-specific agencies; this would bolster the ongoing \n     efforts of the financial services industry as we continue to \n     improve the effectiveness of our cybersecurity.\n       We look forward to working with you and your colleagues on \n     this important issue.\n       American Bankers Association, American Council of Life \n     Insurers, The Clearing House Association, Consumer Bankers \n     Association, Electronic Funds Transfer Association.\n       Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center \n     (FS-ISAC), The Financial Services Roundtable, NACHA-The \n     Electronic Payments Association, Securities Industry and \n     Financial Markets Association (SIFMA).\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                             of Manufacturers,\n\n                                                    July 25, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: On \n     behalf of the 12,000 members of the National Association of \n     Manufacturers (NAM), the largest manufacturing association in \n     the United States representing manufacturers in every \n     industrial sector and in all 50 states, I am writing to \n     express the NAM's concern with S. 3414, the Cybersecurity Act \n     of 2012 scheduled to be considered by the Senate this week \n     and reiterate our support for S. 3342, the SECURE IT Act, \n     cybersecurity legislation that includes consensus-based \n     provisions supported by manufacturers.\n       As currently written, S. 3414 raises significant concerns \n     for our members. While we support increasing information \n     sharing and reducing companies' liability, the legislation \n     unfortunately does not allow manufacturers to share \n     information among themselves and also receive liability \n     protection. It requires companies to share that same \n     information jointly with a new government entity created in \n     the legislation to receive the benefit of liability \n     protection. The creation of a new government-administered \n     program in an agency yet-to-be-named forces unnecessary \n     regulatory uncertainty on the private sector, creates a \n     system that allows for new, overly prescriptive regulations, \n     and is a disincentive to share information.\n       NAM members are also concerned that owners and operators of \n     critical infrastructure would be subject to cybersecurity \n     assessments by third-party auditors who are granted \n     unfettered access to company information. This provision \n     creates economic uncertainty as manufacturers are concerned \n     that the release of proprietary information\n\n[[Page S5910]]\n\n     to third parties could actually create new security risks. \n     Manufacturers are already subject to agency and sector-\n     specific regulations and requirements. They have well-\n     developed compliance processes to improve their systems. More \n     government mandates are unnecessary and would quickly become \n     obsolete.\n       Manufacturers through their comprehensive and connected \n     relationships with customers, vendors, suppliers, and \n     governments are entrusted with vast amounts of data. They \n     hold the responsibility of securing this data, the networks \n     on which it runs, and the facilities and machinery they \n     control at the highest priority level. Manufacturers know the \n     economic security of the United States is directly related to \n     our cybersecurity. The NAM and all manufacturers remain \n     intensely committed to securing our nation's \n     cyberinfrastructure and we look forward to working with you \n     toward this goal.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Dorothy Coleman,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Tax and Domestic Economic Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 1, 2012]\n\n                           Cyber Hill Battle\n\n\nSearching for a common sense defense against a ``digital Pearl Harbor''\n\n       Every Washington politician and his favorite lobbyist claim \n     to want to shore up America's cyber-defenses. So naturally \n     Congress is mucking up efforts to protect financial systems \n     and power grids from hackers, terrorists or rogue states.\n       The Senate is due to take up cyber-security legislation \n     this week before its summer recess. The goal ought to be to \n     find common ground with a modest, bipartisan bill passed by \n     the House of Representatives in May. In this instance a delay \n     to work out a compromise in the autumn is preferable to a \n     hasty vote.\n       The Senate debate so far hasn't been encouraging. The White \n     House supports legislation from Joe Lieberman, the \n     Connecticut Independent, and Maine Republican Susan Collins. \n     Their Cybersecurity Act of 2012 expands government oversight \n     of private networks. Without further substantial changes, the \n     bill has little shot of getting through a House-Senate \n     conference.\n       John McCain, the Arizona Republican, has offered better \n     alternatives. He wants to give companies a legal avenue to \n     draw on the government's cyber expertise or share information \n     about cyber threats with the FBI or National Security Agency. \n     As in the House's Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection \n     Act, this cooperation would be voluntary.\n       The Lieberman bill brings government compulsion. The \n     Department of Homeland Security--that nimble bureaucracy--\n     would draw up and enforce new ``minimum'' cyber-security \n     standards for private business. This mandate adds costs for \n     government and the private economy. The same folks who give \n     you invasive airport screening will now poke around IT \n     departments. No wonder the Chamber of Commerce wants Homeland \n     Security to keep its hands off ``our junk,'' so to speak.\n       Mr. Lieberman has softened some provisions. He dropped a \n     mandate for private facilities to upgrade their cyber-\n     security as prescribed by government. He took out a ``kill \n     switch'' that lets the President shut down the Internet in an \n     emergency. Yet he isn't going to win bipartisan support in \n     both houses as long as any new standards for privately owned \n     technology aren't voluntary.\n       Heeding the ACLU, the White House and Mr. Lieberman want \n     strict limits on how government agencies can use intelligence \n     garnered through the information-sharing program. Such \n     artificial walls were in place before 9/11, which was why the \n     CIA couldn't tell the FBI about suspected terrorists enrolled \n     in American flight-training schools. The House and McCain \n     versions allow the feds to act on information about, say, \n     Iran's cyber-terror plans.\n       The White House cited privacy grounds in threatening to \n     veto the House bill. Call us naive, but we don't see how the \n     voluntary sharing of selective data related to legally \n     defined cyber threats constitutes an Orwellian surveillance \n     program.\n       The House and McCain cyber-security proposals offer limited \n     solutions to guard against a ``digital Pearl Harbor.'' In a \n     world of fast-changing technology, less is better policy, and \n     in this case it stands a far better chance of becoming the \n     law of the land.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, all of us recognize the need to strengthen \nour cyber security defense to protect our defense industrial base, \nfinancial sector, and government networks from nation states and \nindependent hackers. GEN Keith Alexander, commander of the U.S. Cyber \nCommand, said that he rates U.S. preparedness at 3 on a scale of 1 to \n10. So it is important that Congress act responsibly to get this right.\n  I voted against invoking cloture on the cyber security bill because I \nbelieve cloture was filed too early. This is vast, far-reaching \nlegislation that requires ample consideration time. Two days isn't \nenough. Moreover, Senators weren't even given a chance to offer \namendments to improve the legislation, and the legislation wasn't \nmarked up by a relevant committee.\n  I believe we can ultimately come together to find enough common \nground so that we can pass a bill that can get through a House-Senate \nconference committee.\n  We have come a long way since talks began, and the negotiators have \nspent an enormous amount of time working on two key issues: critical \ninfrastructure and information sharing between the government and the \nprivate sector. I am confident the good will exists to work out these \ndifferences.\n  To that end, it is my hope that we who are involved in the bipartisan \nnegotiations can use the month of August to continue. Cyber security \nisn't a Republican or a Democratic issue. Let's work together to pass a \nbipartisan bill that the President can sign into law.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor finding a path to legislation that will at long last confront our \nNation's 21st-century vulnerability to cyber crime, global cyber \nespionage, and cyber attacks. This legislation has been a long time in \nthe making, and over the last several years I have been privileged to \nwork with colleagues on the Senate Intelligence and Commerce Committees \nto address some of these consequential matters, including Senator \nRockefeller, whom I collaborated with closely on cyber security \nlegislation that passed the Commerce Committee unanimously in 2010; \nSenator Hutchison, who has worked tirelessly with us on these issues as \nranking member on the Commerce Committee; Senators Mikulski and \nWhitehouse, with whom I served on the Intelligence Committee's Cyber \nSecurity Task Force; Senator Warner, who has joined me in underscoring \nthe urgency of considering cyber security legislation in a transparent \nand nonpartisan manner; and Senators Lieberman and Collins, who have \nled the effort to craft this revised cyber security bill.\n  Nothing less than the very foundation of our national and economic \nsecurity is at risk, and it is essential that we be prepared to defend \nagainst cyber activity that could cause catastrophic damage and loss of \nlife in this country.\n  Still, some of my colleagues will undoubtedly make poignant and \nconvincing arguments for why this Chamber should delay consideration of \na comprehensive cyber security bill--stressing the complexity of the \nquestions involved, the competing jurisdictions, and the many unknowns \nassociated with a medium where innovation in functionality will \ncontinue to outpace innovation in security.\n  However, last fall the National Counterintelligence Executive warned \nthat the rapidly accelerating rate of change in information technology \nand communications is likely to ``disrupt security procedures and \nprovide new openings for collection of sensitive U.S. economic and \ntechnology information.'' In fact, the counterintelligence report cited \nCisco Systems studies predicting that the number of devices such as \nsmartphones and laptops in operation worldwide will increase from about \n12.5 billion in 2010 to 25 billion in 2015.\n  Thus, as a result of this proliferation in the number of operating \nsystems connected to the Internet, the Counterintelligence Executive \nhas assessed that ``the growing complexity and density of cyber space \nwill provide more cover for remote cyber intruders and make it even \nharder than today to establish attribution for these incidents.''\n  So as I said during the Senate Commerce Committee's bipartisan, \nunanimous markup of the Rockefeller-Snowe cyber security legislation \nover 2 years ago in early 2010, when it comes to the threat we face in \ncyber space, time is not on our side, and this is further evidence of \nthat irrefutable fact.\n  This Congress could spend another 2 years debating the merits of \nvarious approaches and continuing to operate based on a reactive \nhodgepodge of government directives and bureaucratic confusion. But at \nthe end of the day, the only way to begin preparing our Nation to \ndefend against this emerging threat is to allow the Senate to work its \nwill in a full and unrestrained debate.\n  In June, Senator Warner and I urged the Senate's leadership to reach \nan agreement ensuring cyber security legislation receives an open \ndebate on the Senate floor during the July work period. In calling for \na fair amendment process, we in fact were simply repeating the cyber \nsecurity debate commitment made by the majority leader at\n\n[[Page S5911]]\n\nthe start of the year when he said that ``it is essential that we have \na thorough and open debate on the Senate floor, including consideration \nof amendments to perfect the legislation, insert additional provisions \nwhere the majority of the Senate supports them, and remove provisions \nif such support does not exist.''\n  So I welcomed the majority leader's commitment to allow an open \namendment process, and I joined my colleagues in voting to invoke \ncloture on the motion to proceed to the bill. As I have said \nrepeatedly, only a bipartisan agreement will achieve our shared goal of \npassing cyber security legislation to prevent a devastating cyber \nattack.\n  That process must begin now, and as one who has served on the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence for the last decade, I believe it is \nessential to begin by elucidating the nature of the indisputable threat \nwe now face.\n  In June 2010, the Intelligence Committee's Cyber Security Task Force, \non which I served along with Senators Whitehouse and Mikulski, \ndelivered its classified final report illustrating the myriad of \nchallenges to the security of our physical, economic, and social \nsystems in cyber space. I urge my colleagues to review this classified \nreport.\n  As for some examples we can discuss in an open forum such as this, I \nencourage my colleagues to read the National Counterintelligence \nExecutive's unclassified report to Congress entitled ``Foreign Spies \nStealing U.S. Economic Secrets in Cyberspace.'' The Counterintelligence \nExecutive's report, which was released last fall, is truly the \nauthoritative document when it comes to portraying in detail the nature \nof the threat and its ramifications on our lives and--increasingly--our \nlivelihoods. s\n  The report is incredibly eye-opening and represents the first time in \nwhich our government has explicitly named China and Russia as the \nprimary points of origin for much of the malicious cyber activity \ntargeting U.S. interests. In fact, the report states that the \nGovernments of China and Russia ``remain aggressive and capable \ncollectors of sensitive U.S. economic information and technologies, \nparticularly in cyberspace'' and it links much of the recent onslaught \nof computer network intrusions as originating from Internet Protocol \naddresses in these two countries.\n  For example, the Counterintelligence Executive's report cites a \nFebruary 2011 study attributing an intrusion set called ``Night \nDragon'' to an IP address located in China. According to the report, \nthese cyber intruders were able to exfiltrate data from computer \nsystems of global oil, energy, and petrochemical companies with the \ngoal of obtaining information on ``sensitive competitive proprietary \noperations and on financing of oil and gas field bids.'' As the report \nnotes, such activity on behalf of our economic rivals undermines the \nU.S. economy's ability to ``create jobs, generate revenues, foster \ninnovation, and lay the economic foundation for prosperity and national \nsecurity.'' And the report estimates that our losses from economic \nespionage range from ``$2 billion to $400 billion or more a year,'' \nreflecting the scarcity of data and underscoring how little we \ncurrently understand about the total effect these malicious cyber \nintrusions have on our economic future.\n  In addition to the threat posed to our Nation's prosperity, the \nCounterintelligence Executive's report noted that foreign collectors \nare stealing information ``on the full array of U.S. military \ntechnologies in use or under development,'' including marine systems, \naerospace and aeronautics technologies used in intelligence gathering \nand kinetic operations, such as UAVs, and dual-use technologies used \nfor generating energy.\n  In April, James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International \nStudies testified in an unclassified Senate hearing that the delays and \ncost overruns in the F-35 program may be the result of cyber espionage, \nwhich in turn could be linked to the rapid development of China's J-20 \nstealth fighter. He went on to note that Iran has also been pursuing \nthe acquisition of cyber attack capabilities, noting that FBI Director \nMueller has testified that Iran appears increasingly willing to carry \nout such attacks against the United States and its allies.\n  As Director of National Intelligence James Clapper remarked during \nhis unclassified testimony to the Select Committee on Intelligence in \nJanuary, we are observing an ``increased breadth and sophistication of \ncomputer network operations by both state and nonstate actors'' and \ndespite our best efforts ``cyber intruders continue to explore new \nmeans to circumvent defensive measures.'' To illustrate this point, \nDirector Clapper cited the well-publicized intrusions into the NASDAQ \nnetworks and the breach of computer security firm RSA in March 2011, \nwhich led to the exfiltration of data on the algorithms used in its \nauthentication system and, subsequently, access to the systems of a \nU.S. defense contractor.\n  Consequently, as Director Clapper put it, one of our greatest \nstrategic challenges in the coming years will be ``providing timely, \nactionable warning of cyber threats and incidents, such as identifying \npast or present security breaches, definitively attributing them, and \naccurately distinguishing between cyber espionage intrusions and \npotentially disruptive cyber attacks.''\n  As I listened to Director Clapper's assessment of the cyber threat at \nthe Intelligence Committee's annual unclassified worldwide threat \nhearing this past January, I was reminded of similar statements by \nseveral of his predecessors. In fact, on February 2, 2010, then DNI \nDennis Blair provided the following cautionary warning:\n\n       This cyber domain is exponentially expanding our ability to \n     create and share knowledge, but it is also enabling those who \n     would steal, corrupt, harm or destroy the public and private \n     assets vital to our national interests. The recent intrusions \n     reported by Google are a stark reminder of the importance of \n     these cyber assets, and a wake-up call to those who have not \n     taken this problem seriously.\n\n  Similarly, the preceding year, on February 12, 2009, Director Blair \nsaid:\n\n       Over the past year, cyber exploitation activity has grown \n     more sophisticated, more targeted, and more serious. The \n     Intelligence Community expects these trends to continue in \n     the coming year.\n\n  As far back as February 5, 2008, then-DNI Michael McConnell warned:\n\n       It is no longer sufficient for the US Government to \n     discover cyber intrusions in its networks, clean up the \n     damage, and take legal or political steps to deter further \n     intrusions. We must take proactive measures to detect and \n     prevent intrusions from whatever source, as they happen, and \n     before they can do significant damage.\n\n  It was in response to this cavalcade of wake-up calls and threat \nbriefings that Senator Rockefeller and I, in our role as crossover \nmembers of both the Intelligence and Commerce committees, initiated a \nseries of hearings before the Commerce Committee to begin considering \nproposals for collaborating with the private sector to prevent and \ndefend against attacks in cyber space.\n  On April 1, 2009, Senator Rockefeller and I introduced one of the \nfirst bills aimed at tackling some of our Nation's most vexing \nchallenges when it comes to this issue. Our legislation, the \nCybersecurity Act of 2010, was meant to focus the Senate's efforts on \nseveral key priorities, including conducting risk assessments to \nidentify and evaluate cyber threats and vulnerabilities, clarifying the \nresponsibilities of government and private sector stakeholders by \ncreating a public-private information sharing clearinghouse, and \ninvesting in cyber research and development to expand activities in \ncritical fields like secure coding, which is indispensable in \nminimizing our vulnerability to cyber intrusions. Our bill also sought \nto expand efforts to recruit the next generation of ``cyber warriors'' \nto implement these defenses through the creation of a cyber \nscholarship-for-service program.\n  Our cyber security bill was one of the first attempts to confront our \nvulnerabilities in cyber space, and with approximately 90 percent of \nthe Nation's digital infrastructure controlled by private industry, we \nmade a concerted effort to collaborate with businesses and ensure our \nbill incorporated input from experts covering the complete spectrum of \nthis issue. Along the way Senator Rockefeller and I have worked \ntogether closely, holding meetings with the White House Cyber Security \nCoordinator, conducting hearings at the Commerce Committee with experts \nlike James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies\n\n[[Page S5912]]\n\nand former Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell, and \ncollaborating on a Wall Street Journal op-ed entitled ``Now Is the Time \nto Prepare for Cyberwar.''\n  As a result, our legislation was marked up in a unanimous, bipartisan \neffort by the Commerce Committee in 2010. Moreover, our proposal \nreceived praise from a major telecommunications industry leader who \nsaid our 2009 bill ``puts the nation on a much stronger footing'' to \nconfront the cyber threat and a leading telecom association, which said \nthat ``passage of the Rockefeller-Snowe Cybersecurity Act is a \nnecessary and important step in protecting our national \ninfrastructure.''\n  Additionally, in February 2011, following the Egyptian Government's \nattempt to quell public protests by denying access to the Internet, I \npledged to oppose so-called ``Internet kill switch'' authority here in \nthe United States. Consequently, I was pleased when earlier this year \nSenators on both sides of the aisle joined me in protecting critical \nfirst amendment rights by agreeing to reject any provisions that could \nbe construed as giving our government new authority to restrict access \nto the Internet.\n  Thus, although I am not a cosponsor of the legislation before the \nSenate, I recognize that this proposal reflects many of the core ideas \nfirst offered by Senator Rockefeller and I in 2009, and I commend my \ncolleagues for working with us over the last few years to ensure that \nthese essential provisions were made part of the revised cyber security \nlegislation.\n  Specifically, I support steps taken in the revised bill that require \ncollaboration between the government and the private sector to share \ninformation about cyber threats and identify vulnerabilities to protect \nnetworks. Such information sharing and sector-by-sector cyber risk \nassessments were a fundamental part of the Rockefeller-Snowe bill in \n2009. Likewise, I support provisions establishing an industry-led--\nrather than government-led--process for identifying best practices, \nstandards, and guidelines to effectively remediate or mitigate cyber \nrisks, with civil liability protection for those owners and operators \nof critical infrastructure who have implemented these standards. And I \nsupport the cyber outreach, awareness, recruitment, and workforce \ndevelopment provisions that were an essential component of our original \nbill.\n  That being said, the private sector is rightly concerned about the \nprospect of over-regulation by the Federal Government. Specifically, \nmany of my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle have \nexpressed concerns that passage of a comprehensive cyber security bill \ncould lead to more government redtape, stifling innovation and impeding \ngrowth.\n  Yet I firmly believe these are not insurmountable challenges, and I \nam optimistic that there is tremendous potential for the Senate to \nforge a viable solution that incentivizes private sector participation \nand collaboration.\n  Although the revised bill takes steps to incentivize the adoption of \nvoluntary cyber security practices, many continue to voice concerns \nwhen it comes to the provisions governing ``covered critical \ninfrastructure,'' or in other words, those information systems for our \ntransportation, first responders, airports, hospitals, electric \nutilities, water systems, and financial networks whose disruption would \ninterrupt life-sustaining services, cause catastrophic economic damage, \nor severely degrade national security.\n  I support an effort to raise the bar when it comes to cyber security \nstandards for our most critical, life-sustaining systems. Yet in order \nto pass a bill that has the momentum to become law, we absolutely must \nfind some middle ground with those who have raised valid concerns about \nthe potential of over-regulation by the Federal Government.\n  For example, I have heard concerns from the private sector that \nsubsection 103(g) of the revised bill may cause confusion and has led \nmany to believe that the voluntary rules will eventually be forced upon \ncompanies who may already have strong security practices in place. \nSpecifically, this subsection mandates that all Federal agencies with \nresponsibilities for regulating critical infrastructure must submit an \nannual report justifying why they have not acted to make the voluntary \nstandards proposed through this legislation mandatory within their \njurisdiction. To remove any confusion about the intent of the bill, I \nam working with Senator Warner and several of my colleagues on \nstraightforward language to clarify that nothing in the bill should be \nconstrued to increase, decrease, or otherwise alter the existing \nauthority of any Federal agency when it comes to the security of \ncritical cyber infrastructure.\n  Likewise, I share some of my colleagues' concerns that provisions \ndesigned to bolster the Department of Homeland Security's role in \nmanaging efforts to secure and protect critical infrastructure networks \ncould lead to an unsustainable DHS bureaucracy. Such provisions were \nnot part of the original Rockefeller-Snowe bill, which took a different \napproach by creating a Senate-confirmed National Cybersecurity Adviser \nwithin the Executive Office of the President.\n  Yet, again, this hurdle is not insurmountable--and I welcome the \nestablishment of the National Cybersecurity Council in the revised bill \nas an interagency body with members from the Departments of Commerce, \nDefense, Justice, the Intelligence Community, and other appropriate \nFederal agencies--in addition to DHS--to assess risks and ensure the \nprimary regulators for each critical system are involved in any final \ndecision.\n  Furthermore, I remain concerned that the bill lacks specific \nprovisions to assist small businesses in complying with any new cyber \nsecurity standards adopted by Federal agencies with responsibilities \nfor regulating the security of critical infrastructure. Small \nbusinesses remain the primary job creators in this country, responsible \nfor more than two-thirds of all new jobs created. As ranking member of \nthe Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I have \nadvocated tirelessly for targeted regulatory reform because there is no \ndoubt that regulations are stifling small business. Small firms with \nfewer than 20 employees bear a disproportionate burden of complying \nwith Federal regulations. These small firms pay an annual regulatory \ncost of $10,585 per employee, which is 36 percent higher than the \nregulatory cost facing larger firms.\n  In response, I have proposed several amendments to ensure the Small \nBusiness Administration and other constructive stakeholders are \ninvolved in analyzing the implications of cyber security performance \nstandards on small businesses and recommending options for mitigating \nany costs or unnecessary burdens. And I have filed an amendment that \nwould identify the challenges that prevent the Federal Government from \nleveraging the capabilities of small businesses to perform classified \ncyber security work and to develop security-cleared cyber workers.\n  I have also filed amendments that ensure sector specific regulators \nhave the technical resources and staffing to adequately address cyber \nthreats facing their industry and that focus research efforts on \npromising technologies that will secure our wireless infrastructure. \nAdditionally, I have joined my colleague, Senator Toomey, in offering \nan amendment that would implement a national data security breach \nstandard to simplify compliance for businesses and notifications to \nconsumers to reduce undue burden and confusion. More than 540 million \nrecords have been reported breached since 2005 according to the Privacy \nRights Clearinghouse, and research from Symantec estimates the average \norganizational cost of a breach is approximately $5.5 million.\n  Finally, I have filed an amendment to prohibit our government from \nsigning new trade agreements with countries that have been identified \nby the National Counterintelligence Executive as using cyber tools to \nsteal our trade secrets and threaten our economic security. It is time \nto send the message that these malicious activities will come with a \nprice, and I view this as a sound and practical means of deterrence.\n  So again let me reiterate the imperative fact that time is not on our \nside. As former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff and \nseveral of his intelligence community and defense colleagues recently \nwrote in a letter to our Senate leadership, the\n\n[[Page S5913]]\n\nrisk of failing to act on comprehensive cyber security legislation is \n``simply too great considering the reality of our interconnected and \ninterdependent world, and the impact that can result from the failure \nof even one part of the network across a wide range of physical, \neconomic and social systems.''\n  Therefore, as I wrote in a letter to the majority and minority \nleaders in June, ``given the nature of the threat we face . . . it is \nessential that we not miss an opportunity to consider cyber security \nlegislation in a non-partisan manner and pass a bill that has the \nmomentum to become law.''\n  Now is the moment to prove that the Senate is capable of forging a \nviable solution to address what Director Clapper called ``a critical \nnational and economic security concern.'' I welcome this debate on what \nI view as one of the defining national security challenges of our \ngeneration, and I urge my colleagues to join me in working for passage \nof comprehensive cyber security legislation.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I wish to urge my colleagues to allow \nan up-or-down vote on the Cybersecurity Act of 2012, S. 3414, and to \nsupport my amendment to further strengthen the privacy safeguards in \nthis important legislation.\n  National security experts from both parties have warned us about the \nvery serious danger of a major cyber attack. It is not a matter of if, \nbut when it will occur. As someone who witnessed the attack on Pearl \nHarbor and was in Washington, DC, on September 11, 2001, it is \nfrightening to know that in our modern world where much of our critical \ninfrastructure and security systems are controlled by computers, a \nsuccessful attack on a critical system could lead to more loss of life, \ninjury, and damage than those terrible events. We have a moral duty to \nact immediately. That is why I urge my colleagues to put partisan \ndifferences aside and pass the Cybersecurity Act of 2012 for the safety \nof our Nation.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee, I know that Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member \nCollins have been working diligently for several years to get this bill \nto the floor for a vote. Commerce Committee Chairman Rockefeller and \nIntelligence Committee Chairman Feinstein have also been working \ntirelessly to advance this legislation. While I continue to support the \neven stronger critical infrastructure protections in the original cyber \nsecurity bill introduced in February, I accept the revisions the bill \nsponsors have made to accommodate concerns raised by several of my \ncolleagues.\n  I want to thank the bill sponsors for working with me during this \nlengthy process to make improvements to the legislation. In order for \nour country to have robust cyber security capabilities, we must have a \ntalented and well-trained cyber workforce. I am pleased that the bill \nincorporates my recommendations to strengthen title IV of the bill, \nwhich provide the necessary tools to build a first-class cyber \nworkforce while maintaining employee and whistleblower protections. \nFurthermore, these workforce provisions establish a supervisory \ntraining program that will help managers properly evaluate their cyber \nemployees.\n  I also want to commend the sponsors for the marked improvement of the \nunderlying privacy and civil liberties protections in the bill. I \ncollaborated with Senators Franken, Durbin, Wyden, Sanders, Coons, and \nBlumenthal to strengthen protections in the information-sharing \nprovisions of the bill, which allow companies to share cyber security \ninformation with each other and the government. We worked with privacy \nand civil liberties groups from across the political spectrum on a \nseries of recommendations, most of which were accepted by the bill's \nsponsors.\n  With these changes, the privacy and civil liberties protections in \nthe Cybersecurity Act are much better than the protections contained in \nthe Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act that recently passed \nthe House, and the SECURE IT Act that has been introduced in the \nSenate. However, I am still pushing for further improvements to enhance \nthe privacy and civil liberties protections in the Cybersecurity Act.\n  I have offered an amendment that seeks to strengthen the underlying \nlegal framework protecting Americans' personal information held in the \ncomputer systems that the Cybersecurity Act seeks to protect. My \namendment will close loopholes in Federal privacy requirements, \ncentralize Federal oversight of existing privacy protections, and \nreinstate basic remedies for privacy violations. My amendment, which \nreflects input from the bill's sponsors, would make four small changes \nthat would have significant benefits to American's privacy and data \nsecurity.\n  First, my amendment would address Federal agencies' uneven \nimplementation of Office of Management Budget, OMB, guidance on \npreventing breaches of private information and notifying affected \nindividuals when they do occur. In testimony this week before the \nOversight of Government Management Subcommittee that I chair, we \nlearned that the agency that oversees the Thrift Savings Plan, TSP, had \nno breach notification plan in place at the time of the recent breach \ninvolving 123,000 participating Federal employees. Specifically, my \namendment would strengthen data breach notification requirements for \nFederal agencies by directing OMB to establish requirements for \nagencies to provide timely notification to individuals whose personal \ninformation was compromised. It would require agency heads to comply \nwith the policies, and mandate that OMB report to Congress annually on \nagencies' compliance.\n  Second, my amendment would provide basic transparency when agencies \nrely on commercial databases. Agencies frequently use private sector \ndatabases for law enforcement and other purposes that affect \nindividuals' rights, but this is not covered by Federal privacy laws. \nMy amendment would require agencies to conduct privacy impact \nassessments on agencies' use of commercial sources of Americans' \nprivate information so that individuals have appropriate protections \nsuch as access, notice, correction, and purpose limitations.\n  Third, my amendment would fill a hole in the government's privacy \nleadership. Despite OMB's mandate to oversee privacy policies \ngovernment-wide, it lacks a chief privacy officer. As a result, \nresponsibility for protecting privacy is fragmented and agencies' \ncompliance with privacy-related statutes and regulations is \ninconsistent. Furthermore, the administration lacks a representative on \ninternational privacy issues. My amendment would direct OMB to \ndesignate a central officer within OMB who would have authority over \nprivacy across the government. This officer would also be responsible \nfor assessing the privacy impact of the new information-sharing \nprovisions in the cyber security bill.\n  Finally, it would address the Supreme Court's ruling restricting \nPrivacy Act remedies earlier this year that has by many experts' \naccounts rendered the Privacy Act toothless. In Federal Aviation \nAdministration v. Cooper, the Social Security Administration violated \nthe Privacy Act by sharing the plaintiff's HIV status with other \nFederal agencies. The Court concluded that the plaintiff could not \nrecover damages for emotional distress because Privacy Act damages are \nlimited to economic harm. My amendment would heed the call of scholars \nacross the political spectrum to amend the Privacy Act and fix this \ndecision. It would also clarify that in the event of a Federal \nviolation in the information-sharing title of the bill, a victim would \nbe entitled to recovery for the same types of noneconomic harms.\n  My amendment will further strengthen the privacy and civil liberties \nprotections in the cyber security bill while enhancing the security of \npersonal information held by the Federal Government. I urge my \ncolleagues to allow an up-or-down vote on the Cybersecurity Act, which \nis so critical to our Nation's safety, and to support my amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will conclude debate on \nthe Cybersecurity Act of 2012, S. 3414. Developing a comprehensive \nstrategy for cybersecurity is one of the most pressing challenges \nfacing our Nation. I commend President Obama for his commitment to \naddressing this national security issue. I also commend the majority \nleader and the bill's sponsors for their work on this pressing matter.\n  I share the President's view that updates to our laws are urgently \nneeded\n\n[[Page S5914]]\n\nto keep pace with the many threats that Americans face in cyberspace. \nFor that reason, I will support the motion for cloture on this bill. \nBut, I do so with major reservations about the bill in its current form \nbecause this legislation does not address many of the key priories that \nmust be a part of our national strategy for cybersecurity.\n  A legislative response to the growing threat of cyber crime must be a \npart of our debate about cyber security. Protecting American consumers \nand businesses from cyber crime and other threats in cyber space is a \ntop priority of the Judiciary Committee. That is why I filed an \namendment to the bill to strengthen our Nation's cyber crime laws, \nwhich takes several important steps to combat cyber crime. The \namendment, among other things, updates the Federal RICO statute to add \nviolations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to the definition of \nracketeering activity; strengthens the legal tools available to law \nenforcement to protect our Nation's critical infrastructure by making \nit a felony to damage a computer that manages or controls national \ndefense or other critical infrastructure information; and streamlines \nand enhances the penalty structure under the Computer Fraud and Abuse \nAct. This cyber crime amendment incorporates many of the proposals that \nwere recommended in the cyber security proposal that President Obama \ndelivered to Congress last May. The Judiciary Committee favorably \nreported these proposals in September as part of my Personal Data \nPrivacy and Security Act. These updates to our criminal laws are \nurgently needed to keep pace with the cunning of cyber thieves and the \nmany emerging threats to American's safety in cyber space. These \nmeasures must be included in any cyber security legislation the Senate \nconsiders.\n  In the digital age, we must also update our digital privacy laws so \nthat Americans will have better safeguards for their electronic \ncommunications. That is why I filed an amendment to the bill that makes \ncommonsense updates to two vital digital privacy laws that I authored \nseveral years ago--the Video Privacy Protection Act, VPPA, and the \nElectronic Communications Privacy Act, ECPA. The amendment would update \nthe Video Privacy Protection Act to permit consumers to provide a one-\ntime consent for video service providers to share their video viewing \ninformation with third parties via the Internet. This update will help \nthe VPPA keep pace with how most Americans view and share videos \ntoday--on the Internet--while also requiring that video service \nproviders provide clear and conspicuous notice that the consent to \nshare video viewing information can be withdrawn at anytime. The \namendment also updates the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to \nprohibit service providers from voluntarily disclosing the contents of \nAmericans' e-mails or other electronic communications to the \nGovernment, unless the Government obtains a search warrant based on \nprobable cause. There are appropriate exceptions to this prohibition \nunder current law, including when a customer provides consent or when \ndisclosure to law enforcement is necessary to address certain criminal \nactivity. I am also mindful of the need to ensure that law enforcement \ncan do their jobs effectively. The safeguards and exceptions in this \nprovision were designed to ensure that appropriate privacy protections \ndo not undermine the ability of law enforcement to keep us safe.\n  I also filed a bipartisan amendment to promote cyber research and \ndevelopment in Vermont and elsewhere across the Nation. This amendment \nimproves section 301 of the bill by clarifying that the White House's \nOffice of Science and Technology Policy's new test bed program should \nbuild upon existing work on cybersecurity test beds by the Department \nof Homeland Security in its Science and Technology Directorate. The \namendment also expands the proposed test beds program to include \nfunding for the military academies and senior military colleges to \nparticipate. Senator Hoeven joined me in proposing this improvement to \nthe bill, and we both believe that it is important for these \ninstitutions, which have such a prominent role in cultivating the next \ngeneration of security leaders, to develop tools to combat the next \ngeneration's security threats.\n  Comprehensive cyber security legislation must also respond to the \nalarming number of data security breaches that threaten the privacy and \nsecurity of American consumers and businesses today. The troubling data \nbreaches at Sony, Epsilon, and Lockheed are recent reminders that new \ntools are needed to protect us from the growing threats of data \nbreaches and identity theft. In May 2011, the Obama administration \nsubmitted a data breach proposal that adopted the carefully balanced \nframework of data privacy and security legislation that I have \nintroduced--and that this Judiciary Committee has favorably reported--\nseveral times. My data breach amendment would establish a single \nnationwide standard for data breach notification. My data security \namendment would require that companies that maintain databases with \nAmericans' sensitive personal information establish and implement data \nprivacy and security programs, so that data breaches do not occur in \nthe first place. I filed these amendments because Congress must address \nthe threat of data security breaches and make these long overdue \nprivacy protections available to American consumers and businesses.\n  The threats to our privacy and security in cyber space are real, and \nthese threats will not go away simply because the Congress fails to \nact. I lament the fact that a long-overdue debate on cybersecurity \nlegislation has become embroiled in a partisan stalemate. While there \nare legitimate differences on how we must confront this threat, \nDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents alike are put at risk if we do \nnot do so. We must find a way to work together to confront this \nnational challenge. I hope we will see more progress on overcoming \ndifferences on this issue in the weeks ahead. I also hope the sponsors \nof this bill will include the priorities I have outlined as part of any \nfuture comprehensive cyber security bill. Again, I commend the \nPresident and all Senators on both sides of the aisle who have worked \nto address this important issue. I also thank the many privacy, civil \nliberties, and technology organizations that have supported my \namendments to this bill.\n  I ask that a copy of three letters I have received in support of \nseveral of my amendments to the bill be printed in the Record following \nmy full remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senate Majority Leader.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader.\n       Dear Leader Reid and Leader McConnell: as the Senate \n     considers cybersecurity legislation, we urge you to make in \n     order and to support an amendment that Chairman Leahy has \n     introduced that would update a key privacy law that is \n     critical to business, government investigators and ordinary \n     citizens.\n       Chairman Leahy's amendment #2580 addresses the Electronic \n     Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), a law that Chairman Leahy \n     himself wrote and guided through the Senate in 1986. ECPA was \n     a forward-looking statute when enacted. However, technology \n     has advanced dramatically since 1986, and ECPA has been \n     outpaced.\n       As a result, ECPA is a patchwork of confusing standards \n     that have been interpreted inconsistently by the courts, \n     creating uncertainty for service providers, for law \n     enforcement agencies, and for the hundreds of millions of \n     Americans who use mobile phones and the Internet. Moreover, \n     the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that a provision \n     of ECPA is unconstitutional because it allows the government \n     to compel a service provider to disclose the content of \n     private communications without a warrant.\n       Chairman Leahy's amendment would make it clear that, except \n     in emergencies, or under other existing exceptions, the \n     government must use a warrant in order to compel a service \n     provider to disclose the content of emails, texts or other \n     private material stored by the service provider on behalf of \n     its users.\n       Chairman Leahy's amendment would create a more level \n     playing field for technology. It would cure the \n     constitutional defect identified by the Sixth Circuit. It \n     would provide clarity and certainty to law enforcement \n     agencies at all levels, to business and entrepreneurs, and to \n     individuals who rely on online services to create, \n     communicate and store personal and proprietary data. These \n     protections for content are consistent with an ECPA reform \n     principle advanced by the Digital Due Process coalition, \n     www.digitaldueprocess.org, a broad-based coalition of \n     companies, privacy groups, think tanks, and academics.\n       For Internet and communications companies competing in a \n     global marketplace, and\n\n[[Page S5915]]\n\n     for citizens who have woven these technologies into their \n     daily lives, as well as for government agencies that rely on \n     electronic evidence, the protections for content in the Leahy \n     amendment would represent an important step forward for \n     privacy protection and legal clarity.\n       While the signatories to this letter have very diverse \n     views on the cybersecurity legislation, and some take no \n     position on the legislation, we urge you to make the Leahy \n     amendment #2580 in order and to support it when offered.\n           Sincerely,\n       Adobe; American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression; \n     Americans for Tax Reform; Association for Competitive \n     Technology; American Library Association; Association of \n     Research Libraries; Bill of Rights Defense Committee; \n     Business Software Alliance; CAUCE North America; Center for \n     Democracy & Technology; Center for Financial Privacy and \n     Human Rights; Center for National Security Studies; Citizens \n     Against Government Waste; Competitive Enterprise Institute; \n     Computer and Communications Industry Association; The \n     Constitution Project; Data Foundry; Distributed Computing \n     Industry Association; eBay; EDUCAUSE; Engine Advocacy; \n     FreedomWorks; Liberty Coalition; Newspaper Association of \n     America; Microsoft; Neustar; Personal; Salesforce; Sonic.net; \n     SpiderOak; Symantec; TechFreedom; TechAmerica; TRUSTe; U.S. \n     Policy Council of the Association for Computing Machinery.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 21, 2011.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Grassley: The undersigned \n     individuals and organizations wrote last month in support of \n     making changes to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to ensure \n     that it is both strong and properly focused. We mentioned \n     that while the CFAA is an important tool in the fight against \n     cybercrime, its current language is both overbroad and vague. \n     It can be read to encompass not only the hackers and identity \n     thieves the law was intended to cover, but also actors who \n     have not engaged in any activity that can or should be \n     considered a ``computer crime.'' We write again today to \n     express our appreciation for recent action taken by the \n     Committee on the Judiciary to address our concerns.\n       Last week, at a markup of Chairman Leahy's Personal Data \n     Privacy and Security Act of 2011 (S. 1151), Senator Grassley, \n     with the co-sponsorship of Senators Franken and Lee, \n     introduced an amendment that would fix a large part of the \n     overbreadth problem in the CFAA. In particular, the amendment \n     would remove the possibility that the statute could be \n     interpreted to allow felony prosecutions of ``access in \n     violation of a contractual obligation or agreement, such as \n     an acceptable use policy or terms of service agreement, with \n     an Internet service provider, Internet website, or non-\n     government employer, if such violation constitutes the sole \n     basis for determining that access to a protected computer is \n     unauthorized.'' The amendment passed with bipartisan support, \n     including that of Chairman Leahy himself.\n       As we noted in our previous letter, our concerns about \n     overbroad interpretations of the existing language are far \n     from hypothetical. Three federal circuit courts have agreed \n     that an employee who exceeds an employer's network acceptable \n     use policies can be prosecuted under the CFAA. At least one \n     federal prosecutor has brought criminal charges against a \n     user of a social network who signed up under a pseudonym in \n     violation of terms of service.\n       These activities should not be ``computer crimes'' any more \n     than they are crimes in the physical world. If, for example, \n     an employee photocopies an employer's document to give to a \n     friend without that employer's permission, there is no \n     federal crime (though there may be, for example, a \n     contractual violation). However, if an employee emails that \n     document, there may be a CFAA violation. If a person assumes \n     a fictitious identity at a party, there is no federal crime. \n     Yet if they assume that imaginary identity on a social \n     network that prohibits pseudonyms, there may again be a CFAA \n     violation. This is a gross misuse of federal criminal law. \n     The CFAA should focus on malicious hacking and identity theft \n     and not on criminalizing any behavior that happens to take \n     place online in violation of terms of service or an \n     acceptable use policy.\n       We believe that the Grassley/Franken/Lee amendment is an \n     important step forward for both security and civil liberties. \n     We commend the Ranking Member for introducing the amendment \n     and the Chairman for supporting it. We would also support \n     further changes to the language in the bill to ensure that \n     government employees are given the same protections from \n     criminal prosecution as their private sector counterparts. \n     Changes such as these will strengthen the law and focus the \n     justice system on the malicious hackers and online criminals \n     who invade others' computers and networks to steal sensitive \n     information and undermine the privacy of those whose \n     information is stolen.\n           Sincerely,\n       Laura W.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch A. McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: On \n     behalf of TechAmerica, thank you for your leadership in \n     making cybersecurity a national priority. We share your goal \n     of enhancing our nation's cybersecurity posture in response \n     to growing cyber threats. TechAmerica believes that any final \n     bi-partisan agreement should both preserve the vitality of \n     innovation and promote the Information & Communication \n     Technology sector's ability to respond to constantly evolving \n     cyber threats. With these goals in mind, we are writing to \n     provide our insights on S. 3414, the Cybersecurity Act of \n     2012, and additional elements for the Senate's consideration \n     as part of a final cybersecurity package designed to help \n     meet our national security challenges.\n       TechAmerica and its members are dedicated to maintaining \n     and expanding the partnership between the private sector and \n     the government to address our nation's cybersecurity \n     preparedness. We have spent much time over the last six years \n     focusing on these critical issues, working closely with \n     Congress and the Administration on addressing threats to our \n     nation's cybersecurity. Any final cybersecurity measure \n     passed by the Senate must be firmly grounded in a strong \n     public private partnership.\n       We believe that legislation, if not done carefully, could \n     do more harm than good. Specific mandates generally do not \n     adapt as quickly as threat and technology landscapes change, \n     so they can actually hinder industry's ability to innovate \n     and effectively mitigate threats. Mandates affect industry's \n     ability to design, develop and deploy technology. S. 3414 \n     represents a clear step forward towards a workable framework \n     that strikes the right balance by prioritizing our nation's \n     cybersecurity with an outcome based approach of voluntary \n     incentives rather than through prescriptive regulatory \n     mandates.\n       As the Senate prepares to consider S. 3414, The \n     Cybersecurity Act of 2012, as the underlying bill to \n     comprehensive cybersecurity legislation, we wish to convey \n     our strong support of several critical components that would \n     immediately enhance our cybersecurity posture. Specifically, \n     TechAmerica endorses the following provisions of S. 3414 to \n     address our country's critical cybesecurity priorities:\n       Title--Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) \n     Reform: The paper-based, compliance regime that exists under \n     the current FISMA framework is time consuming and costly. \n     This outdated system has not demonstrated a requisite \n     increase in security of government systems. In response to a \n     rapidly evolving threat environment, our federal information \n     security practices must be updated to reflect a risk-based \n     and continuous monitoring approach as proposed by Senator \n     Carper in Title II of S. 3414.\n       Title III--Research and Development: Investing in research \n     and development (R) is essential to protecting critical \n     systems and enhancing the cybersecurity for both the \n     government and the private sector. We support Title II, which \n     would create a national cybersecurity R plan to help \n     develop game-changing technologies that will neutralize \n     attacks on the cyber systems of today and lay the foundation \n     to meet the challenges of securing the cyber systems of \n     tomorrow.\n       Title IV--Education, Workforce, and Awareness: Industry and \n     government must work together to plan for the future by \n     investing in cybersecurity education to develop the next \n     generation of cybersecurity workers. We support Title IV, \n     which encourages cybersecurity professional development and \n     improving public awareness of cybersecurity risks from \n     identity theft to cyber predators and fraudsters.\n       Title V--Federal Acquistion Risk Management Strategy: We \n     support Title V, which calls for a comprehensive acquisition \n     risk management strategy to address risks and threats to the \n     information technology products and services in the federal \n     government supply chain. This strategy will allow agencies to \n     make informed decisions when purchasing IT products and \n     services. Importantly, the bill requires specific and much \n     needed training for the federal acquisition workforce to \n     enhance the security of federal networks.\n       Title VI--International Cooperation: Cybercrimes are \n     borderless, and we must work with our international partners \n     to combat this threat. Title VI will help provide for \n     enhanced cyber response capacity in countries currently \n     without adequate resources to combat cybercrime, as well as \n     use\n\n[[Page S5916]]\n\n     of existing legal mechanisms to further international \n     cooperation. We support Title VI, which includes S. 1469, The \n     International Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act, \n     sponsored by Senators Hatch and Gillibrand.\n       TechAmerica is confident that these core components alone \n     would immediately and substantially improve America's \n     cybersecurity posture. Congress cannot afford to delay any \n     longer on the passage of these critical provisions \n     considering the potential risk of falling behind our cyber \n     adversaries.\n       In an effort to provide the Senate with our collective \n     expertise, we are also compelled to outline for you those \n     aspects of the legislation that we believe require further \n     refinement in order for it to receive our overall support as \n     a final cybersecurity proposal. These provisions include:\n       Title I--Public Private Partnership to Protect Critical \n     Infrastructure: Rather than mandating that critical \n     infrastructure organizations comply with a DHS cybersecurity \n     framework, the newly introduced bill offers a vast, important \n     improvement by providing incentives to organizations that \n     voluntarily comply with cybersecurity best practices. While \n     we commend this positive direction, TechAmerica recommends \n     further refining the following provisions of Title I.\n       National Cybersecurity Council--In the spirit of a true \n     public-private partnership, industry should be represented by \n     the Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) in an official \n     capacity on the National Cybersecurity Council. Best \n     practices and voluntary standards should be industry driven \n     and developed in conjunction with NIST. The Council should \n     not have the ability to unilaterally overrule the SCCs \n     proposed best practices. Alternatively, we therefore propose \n     a conciliatory dispute resolution process.\n       Inventory of Critical Infrastructure--We recommend that \n     each sector be differentiated and recognized for current \n     cybersecurity best practices employed in securing critical \n     infrastructure. Information technology is not only a specific \n     sector, but an underlying component of multiple industry \n     sectors. For this reason, we strongly support preserving the \n     current back-end limitation on commercial information \n     technology products.\n       Voluntary Cybersecurity Best Practices--We urge the \n     sponsors to strike any reference to the term ``mandatory'' in \n     the text to ensure this framework is truly voluntary in \n     nature and not a precursor to future regulatory action.\n       Voluntary Cybersecurity Program for Critical \n     Infrastructure--TechAmerica requests inserting liability \n     protection language that will prevent compensatory damages, a \n     cap on damages for vicarious liability, and bar punitive \n     damages.\n       Protection of Information--While we strongly support the \n     protection of information found in Section 106, we are \n     concerned by some of the additional, extraneous mechanisms \n     introduced as part of that protection. Such elements of the \n     proposal act as a clear disincentive to private companies \n     joining a voluntary system in good faith out of concern for \n     future audit and investigation.\n       Title VII--Information Sharing: The inability to share \n     information is one of the greatest challenges to collective \n     efforts toward improving our cybersecurity, and we appreciate \n     the efforts by the sponsors of S. 3414 to remove those \n     barriers in order to foster better information sharing \n     between the government and the private sector. We believe \n     that information sharing is a fundamental component of S. \n     3414, as it will better enable collaboration in defense of \n     cyber-attacks while ensuring strong privacy protections. \n     TechAmerica recommends refining the following provisions of \n     S. 3414 in Title VII.\n       Affirmative Authority to Monitor and Defend Against \n     Cybersecurity Threats--S. 3414 significantly narrows the \n     scope of ``monitoring'' activities permissible under previous \n     bill iterations to the scrutiny of a specific list of ``cyber \n     threat indicators.'' Previously proposed language had allowed \n     companies to monitor for cybersecurity threats, which were \n     defined more generally as unauthorized access or \n     exfiltration, manipulation, or impairment to the network or \n     data. It isn't clear that industry's standard monitoring \n     systems can be tailored enough to fit within the parameters \n     of the more specific list as some threats are not categorized \n     until after they are detected through system alerts. In \n     addition, Title VII in its current form limits how an entity \n     may use cyber threat information that it obtains from its own \n     monitoring. This is a significant limitation to put on \n     entities and does not seem justified. The laundry list \n     approach used to define cyber threat indicators potentially \n     limits the use of some techniques tailored to protect \n     networks. It is problematic that this definition is linked to \n     monitoring authority. Finally, we believe that the definition \n     of countermeasures should be narrowed.\n       Voluntary Disclosure of Cybersecurity Threat Indicators \n     Among Private Entities--Business to business information \n     sharing is an important practice in preventing cyber threats. \n     We recommend striking the reasonably likely standard \n     provision in this Title. It is a difficult test to meet and \n     one that will only discourage private information sharing. \n     Also, we believe that more business to business information \n     sharing would be possible with the inclusion of the same \n     limited liability protection that a private entity would \n     receive when sharing information with the newly created \n     government exchange.\n       In closing, TechAmerica urges the Senate to act on and pass \n     the following legislative measures which may possibly be \n     offered as amendments to S. 3414, The Cybersecurity Act of \n     2012:\n       Cybercrime: TechAmerica urges the Senate to pass S. 2111, \n     The Cyber Crime Protection Security Act, sponsored by Senator \n     Leahy. This measure will provide the government with new \n     tools to prosecute more effectively organized criminal \n     activity involving computer fraud. The legislation will also \n     streamline and enhance the criminal penalties for computer \n     fraud, and address cybercrime involving the trafficking of \n     consumers' online passwords.\n       Electronic Communications Privacy: TechAmerica supports, S. \n     1011, The Electronic Communications Privacy Amendments Act, \n     sponsored by Senator Leahy which would update the 1986 ECPA \n     statute to give information stored in the cloud the same \n     level of protection afforded to information stored locally.\n       Data Breach Notification: TechAmerica has long supported \n     passage of a strong, national data breach notification law \n     and has endorsed S. 1207, the Data Security and Breach \n     Notification Act, sponsored by Senators Rockefeller and Pryor \n     as the approach consistent with our principles on data breach \n     notification. Establishing a national framework to promote \n     on-going data security measures and consistent breach \n     notification standards will provide much needed guidance, \n     predictability, and certainty for consumers, consumer \n     protection authorities, and businesses, and will replace the \n     complex patchwork of state data breach laws with a uniform \n     national standard.\n       As you and your colleagues attempt to find bi-partisan \n     consensus on a final cybersecurity agreement, we urge you to \n     carefully consider sustaining the innovative capacity of our \n     information and communications systems and all the myriad \n     activities that they enable, and to thus observe the \n     important axiom, ``first, do no harm.'' Cybersecurity is a \n     multi-faceted and complex ecosystem with profound \n     interdependencies; thus even well intended legislation in \n     this area often has the potential to produce many unintended \n     consequences. Without such rigorous review and consultation, \n     legislation could possibly potentially violate this cardinal \n     principle and risk setting us back in our collective efforts \n     to bolster our nation's cybersecurity.\n       Thank you again for considering our views and for your \n     continued efforts to enhance our nation's cybersecurity. As \n     representatives of the nation's leading information and \n     communications technology firms, TechAmerica remains strong \n     in our resolve to continue working together with the Senate \n     and the House to improve the security of our shared \n     cyberspace.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Shawn Osbourne,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose cloture on the \nCybersecurity Act of 2012.\n  Are any of us surprised that we find ourselves in this situation--\nagain? Is this the ``open amendment'' process we were all promised? As \nI said earlier this year, a bill as complex as cyber security \nlegislation can only be achieved if it goes through the regular \ncommittee process. Had this bill been subjected to the proper committee \nprocess, instead of relying on Senate rule XIV, I believe we would have \nhad a much stronger legislative product that would have attracted \nbroader support. Instead, the blame game, which is the first sign of a \nstalled legislative process, is in full swing.\n  As of yesterday afternoon it was my understanding that we would \ncontinue to work throughout August to find a compromise on this \nlegislation. As a backstop to prepare for the possibility that an \nagreement would not be reached during that time, we requested a tranche \nof 10 to 15 placeholder amendments be set aside to address a defined \nset of issue areas we had with the current bill. In exchange for these \nprocess concessions, our group was willing to support cloture.\n  The unfortunate reality is that we had time to conduct proper \nlegislative hearings and hold committee markups. But rather than choose \nthe customary process, which forces us to defend our points of view, \nbuild consensus around ideas and, admittedly, requires more planning \nand hard work, a less transparent approach was taken. That approach, \nwhile at the time may have seemed more legislatively convenient, \nresulted in hurried, last-minute negotiations that have been doomed \nfrom the outset. Rarely does anything good get accomplished under these \ncircumstances, which lack transparency and scrutiny. This should serve \nas a warning to both sides of the aisle and future congresses that \nattempts to side-step the legislative process are risky, often \nunproductive, and do not bypass the criticism they seek to avoid.\n  And while all of us recognize the importance of cyber security, we \nshould\n\n[[Page S5917]]\n\nnot confuse opposition to this deeply flawed bill as a sign of somehow \nbeing unwilling to address the issue. It has been my experience that \nwhen dealing with matters of national security and domestic policy, and \nin this bill is at the nexus of both, it is more important to work to \nget something done right than just work to get something done. And \nwhile both efforts may result in enough material to create a headline, \nonly one fulfills our purpose for being here in this body.\n  Time and again, we have heard from experts about the importance of \nmaximizing our Nation's ability to effectively prevent and respond to \ncyber threats. We have all listened to these accounts. This cyber \nthreat and the risk of an attack only increased when the Stuxnet leaks \nbegan recklessly coming out of this administration. And while this \nthreat and others persist, the most important piece of legislation \nwhich the congress can pass when it comes to ensuring our national \nsecurity, the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes cyber \nsecurity elements, remains unfinished. This entire process feels more \nlike a ploy to advance the fiction that we are focused on national \nsecurity, while avoiding the fulfillment of one of the Congress's most \nimportant national security responsibilities--the passage of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act.\n  The point is that debating a controversial and flawed bill--a bill of \nsuch `significance' that it has languished for over 5 months at the \nHomeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, with no committee \nmarkup or normal committee process--should not have taken precedence \nover a bill which was vetted over a period of 4 months by the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and reported to the floor with the unanimous \nsupport of all 26 members. Unfortunately, our current trajectory will \nlikely leave us without a cyber security bill or the National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  As I have said time and time again, the threat we face in the cyber \ndomain is among the most significant and challenging threats of 21st-\ncentury warfare. But this bill unfortunately takes us in the wrong \ndirection and establishes a new national security precedent which fails \nto recognize the gravity of the threats we face in cyber space. I agree \nthat we must take appropriate steps to ensure that civil liberties are \nprotected and believe we could have appropriately done so without \nremoving the only institutions capable of protecting the United States \nfrom a cyber attack from counties like China, Russia, and Iran--from \nthe front lines. Making these entities more reliant on their less \ncapable civilian counterparts is an unacceptable, precedent setting \napproach, which fails to recognize the unique real-time requirements \nfor understanding the threat environment, anticipating attacks, and \nresponding when necessary.\n  Additionally, what is not being discussed enough are the likely \nimplications of the new cyber security stovepipes being proposed in \nthis bill. The recreation of the very walls and information sharing \nbarriers that the 9/11 Commission attributed as being responsible for \none of our greatest intelligence failures is very unwise.\n  In addition to the problems with the information sharing provisions, \nthe critical infrastructure language grants too much authority to the \ngovernment, failing to consider the innovative potential of the private \nsector. I continue to believe that this title would force those who own \nor operate critical assets to place more emphasis on compliance \nattorneys, rather than utilize the world-class engineering capabilities \nemployed by our private sector. This is why the primary objective of \nour bill is to enter into a cooperative information sharing \nrelationship with the private sector, rather than an adversarial \nrelationship rooted in mandates used to dictate technological solutions \nto industry.\n  The SECURE IT Act is a serious response to the growing cyber threat \nfacing our country, and it is an alternative approach to the overly \nbureaucratic and regulatory bill before us. Our amendment seeks to \nutilize the world-class engineers employed by our private sector, not \ncompliance attorneys in law firms. This is why the primary objective of \nour bill is to enter into a cooperative information-sharing \nrelationship with the private sector, rather than an adversarial \nrelationship rooted in mandates used to dictate technological solutions \nto industry.\n  The centerpiece of the SECURE IT Act continues to be a legal \nframework to provide for voluntary information sharing. Our amendment \nprovides specific authorities relating to the voluntary sharing of \ncyber threat information among private entities and the government, and \nin doing so, we do not create any new bureaucracy. This bill at the \nvery least deserved a vote.\n  As I stated earlier, it has been my experience that when dealing with \nmatters of national security and domestic policy, it is more important \nto work to get something done right than just work to get something \ndone. For these reasons, and because of the closed process put forth by \nthe majority, we should all oppose cloture.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, nearly 3 years ago, I called the chairmen of \nthe Senate's national security committees--Senators Lieberman, \nRockefeller, Feinstein, Leahy, and Levin--together to discuss what, \neven then, was one of the most urgent priorities for our national \nsecurity: defending our Nation against cyber attack.\n  I asked them to begin working together, across committee \njurisdictions and across party lines, to develop comprehensive cyber \nsecurity legislation to protect our Nation, our security, and our \neconomy from this growing threat. Many of the Senators present had \nalready begun work on their own legislation, but they committed that \nday to join their efforts in common cause.\n  Since that time, their committees have painstakingly worked to break \ndown artificial jurisdictional boundaries and to resolve differences \nacross party lines. They have also sought to include a remarkably wide \narray of stakeholders--including cybersecurity experts, the private \nsector, academia, the intelligence community, military leaders, law \nenforcement, think tanks, State and local governments, and many more--\nin an open, transparent, and cooperative process.\n  The process has been nearly unprecedented in its scope, its \nthoroughness, and its transparency. Since the Senate began its work on \ncyber security legislation in 2009, committees have held more than 20 \nhearings across at least seven different committees specifically on \ncyber security and related legislation, and addressed critical \nquestions relating to cyber security in dozens of additional hearings. \nThey have held numerous briefings for Senators and staff on cyber \nsecurity, including a simulated cyberattack exercise for all Senators \nconducted by senior administration officials. They have organized \nseveral other forums for Senators to examine cyber security issues, \nincluding cross-committee working groups designed to develop \ncomprehensive legislation, as well as the Intelligence Committee's 2010 \nCyber Security Task Force. They have considered nearly 20 separate \ncyber security bills and numerous cyber security-related amendments. \nAnd they have held markups of cyber security legislation in five \nseparate committees, each of which occurred under each committee's \nrules for regular order.\n  The result has been legislation that addresses the equities of these \ndiverse stakeholders as fairly and thoroughly as one could imagine, \nwhile preserving the authorities necessary to boost our Nation's cyber \ndefenses.\n  As ranking member of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Collins \nhas been heroic in her efforts to ensure the bipartisan nature of this \nprocess. Yet, despite her best efforts, Republicans have made it clear \nthroughout the last 3 years that they were simply unwilling to \nparticipate.\n  They refused to participate in working groups designed to draft the \nlegislation, despite the fact that these groups were established with \nLeader McConnell's full agreement. They refused to propose changes to \ndraft legislation, or to participate in negotiations with bill \nsponsors. When, after 3 years of painstaking work and broad outreach \nthe legislation came to the floor, my Republican colleagues refused to \nallow the Senate to consider a single amendment to improve the bill, \ndespite my continuous pleading for their agreement on a list of \namendments for consideration. And, as today's cloture vote has \ndemonstrated, they have refused to allow us to continue to debate the \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S5918]]\n\n  Why this obstinate refusal to participate? How can these Senators, \nwho have received the same entreaties from our military and \nintelligence leaders about the urgency of this legislation, obstruct \nSenate action to confront one of the leading threats to our Nation? \nThese questions are all the more perplexing when one considers what our \nnational security leaders have said about the seriousness of the threat \nwe face.\n  According to General Keith Alexander, Commander of U.S. Cyber \nCommand, ``The cyber threat facing the Nation is real and demands \nimmediate action. The time to act is now; we simply cannot avoid \nfurther delay.''\n  General Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, noted, \n``The uncomfortable reality of our world today is that bits and bytes \ncan be as threatening as bullets and bombs. Not only will military \nsystems be targeted by tools that can cause physical destruction, but \nadversaries will increasingly attempt to hold our Nation's core \ncritical infrastructure at risk.''\n  Similarly, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated, ``We talk about \nnuclear. We talk about conventional warfare. We don't spend enough time \ntalking about the threat of cyberwar. There's a strong likelihood that \nthe next Pearl Harbor that we confront could very well be a \ncyberattack.''\n  And Director of National Intelligence James Clapper called \ncyberattack ``A profound threat to this country, to its future, its \neconomy and its very being.''\n  Simply put, there is unanimity across the national security community \nthat malicious cyber activity is an urgent, growing, and imminently \ndangerous threat that our Nation must confront immediately. But this \nunanimity is not limited to the current administration. Countless \nnational security officials appointed under Republican \nadministrations--including former Director of National Intelligence \nMike McConnell, former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, \nformer Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz, former Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen, former Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency Michael Hayden, and many others--have echoed the \nurgency of our current administration's call for action, as well as \ntheir support for the legislation we have considered today.\n  Yet, today Republicans were nearly unanimous in their opposition to \nthis legislation. Why?\n  It is no secret that Republicans are taking their marching orders \nfrom the Chamber of Commerce. And the Chamber has made no secret that \nit is opposed to any effort to secure America's cyber networks; in \nfact, it has gone so far as to oppose even voluntary cybersecurity \nstandards. In other words, the position of the Chamber of Commerce is \nthat the owners and operators of the most critical infrastructure of \nour Nation--the electricity grid, telecommunications lines, air traffic \ncontrol systems, and the like--should not even be asked to take steps, \non a strictly voluntary basis, to improve our Nation's security. That \nposition is hard to believe, and it is seriously out of step with the \npatriotism of the owners and employees of the American businesses it \nclaims to represent.\n  As a result, my Republican colleagues have ignored the urgent calls \nof some of America's most respected national security leaders in order \nto pander to the Chamber of Commerce--an organization that appears more \nconcerned with corporate bottom lines than with the American lives this \nlegislation seeks to defend.\n  It seems that the only people who have not yet awakened to the threat \nfacing our Nation are Senate Republicans. What has become clear in this \ndebate is that Republicans are willing to prioritize partisan politics \nand slavish defense of corporate interests over our Nation's security. \nAnd that is simply unacceptable.\n  I hope that my colleagues across the aisle will wake up and recognize \nthe threat facing our country before it is too late--before the ``cyber \n9/11'' of which leaders like Secretary Panetta have warned us arrives. \nI hope that they can join us, as we have asked them to do for the last \n3 years, and work on a bipartisan basis for the good of our country. \nAnd if they choose to do so, we will be ready to work quickly to pass \nthis much-needed legislation.\n  But the more they delay, the more the risk to our Nation's security \nand economy grows. Time is running short.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the vote we will \nhave in about 10 minutes. I am going to be real personal in my \nstatement.\n  This is one of those days when I fear for our country, and I am not \nproud of the Senate. We have a crisis, one we all acknowledge. It is \nnot just that there is a theoretical or speculative threat of cyber \nattack against our country--it is real and happening now. Most people \ndon't know it because a lot of people who are attacked don't want to \nannounce it because they are embarrassed.\n  A lot of companies are attacked that control critical cyber \ninfrastructure and have, in fact, what I called yesterday secret cyber \nattack cells planted in their system to control the kind of systems we \ndepend on for the quality of our life and, in some ways, for our lives.\n  GEN Keith Alexander, Director of Cyber Command at the Pentagon, said \nthe other day that when it comes to cyber war, we are today where we \nwere in 1993 in our war with Islamist terrorism after they blew up the \ntruck bomb in the parking garage at the World Trade Center. We were \nattacked. It shook us up for a while, but then people forgot about it. \nAt least in that case we knew we had been attacked. Now we are attacked \nevery day and most people don't know it. Maybe there is a story in the \npaper one day and they read it and it is on TV and then they forget \nabout it.\n  Are we going to act before we get to the cyber 9/11, as we obviously \ndid in the attacks in a war we were in without acknowledging it with \nIslamist terrorism? We pretty much all agree on that. Yet we have \ndescended once again to gridlock, to partisan attack and counterattack. \nThe end result of that is a lot of sound and fury that will accomplish \nnothing, and we will leave our country vulnerable.\n  The fact is that as the majority leader announced earlier in the \nweek, we have been on this for a long time. Senator Collins and I have \ntried to be flexible. We have been open to compromise, not of principle \nand how much we thought we could get passed through the Senate, but \nbecause the threat is so urgent, we cannot afford to insist on \neverything we thought was in our best interest. We made a mandatory \nsystem voluntary, but that has not been enough. Senator Reid said if \nthere was an agreement on a finite list of amendments, and they are \ngermane and relevant to the bill--not taking your favorite political \nshot through the bill or a political message opportunity--then he would \ntake it up in September. As soon as we come back, we would have limited \ntime on it and go to final passage and the Senate would work its will.\n  Unfortunately, we haven't been able to agree on such a list. There \nare still nongermane, irrelevant amendments on the list. Our friends in \nthe Republican caucus have whittled the list down to 58. Frankly, I \ndon't worry about the number as much as the majority leader was right \nthat this bill and the threat of cyber attack and cyber theft is too \nimportant to use as a vehicle for political shots at one another.\n  We are approaching a cloture vote, and now it looks like it is going \nto lose. I hope not. Hope springs eternal for at least 25 minutes more. \nI say to my friends, if they believe we are in a cyber war and we are \ninadequately defended--particularly the part of our cyber \ninfrastructure controlled by the private sector--then vote for cloture. \nIt is the only way we are going to get to this bill. Vote for cloture.\n  Remember something. We are just one of two Chambers of the Congress \nof the United States. Whatever passes the Senate still has to go to a \nconference with the House. The House's approach on this is very \ndifferent, and we are going to have to do even more negotiating and \ngive-and-take. I appeal to my colleagues, make a principles vote and \nvote in a way that says to the country and to your constituents two \nthings: One, you recognize we are in a cyber war now and we are \ninadequately defended. Second, by voting for cloture,\n\n[[Page S5919]]\n\nwhich means we will take up the bill, you are saying we are willing to \nwork together across party lines to try to get something done.\n  In my opinion, it is the only way we are going to get to this bill. \nIf cloture is not granted, as disappointed and angry as I am going to \nbe, I will not be petulant. I will be open today, tomorrow, and as long \nas we have an opportunity in this session, to work with my colleagues \nto try to reach an agreement that will help us improve our cyber \ndefenses.\n  Sometimes in moments of disappointment, I go back to the great \nWinston Churchill. I will just read a few comments from him. These were \nall in the 1930s when he was in the House of Commons and was concerned \nthat England and the world faced a threat which they were not \nacknowledging, the rise of Nazi Germany. First, he said this--and I \nhate to say it, but it relates to where we are today. He said this \nabout those who refused to act decisively to counter the clear and \ngrowing threat of a resurgent and rearmed Nazi Germany during the \n1930s: ``They go on in strange paradox, decided only to be undecided, \nresolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity.''\n  I am afraid that is the message we are going to send to the country \nand to our enemies if we don't get together and pass a cyber security \nbill in this session. Churchill said he was staggered, after his long \nparliamentary experience with the debates he had gone through on this \nquestion during the 1930s, by two things: ``The first has been the \ndangers that have so swiftly come upon us in a few years, and have been \ntransforming our position and the whole outlook of the world.''\n  That is where we are with regard to cyber war, although most people \ndon't understand that. We do. He said:\n\n       Secondly, I have been staggered by the failure of the House \n     of Commons to react effectively against those dangers. That, \n     I am bound to say, I never expected. I say that unless the \n     House [finds its resolve] we will have committed an act of \n     abdication of duty.\n\n  I end with those words. I think it is that serious. If we don't find \na way either by voting for cloture today to get on the bill so we can \nnegotiate or continuing to negotiate if cloture fails, it will be quite \nsimply a colossal abdication of duty to the people of the United States \nand their security.\n  Mr. COATS. Will my friend yield me some time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes; I yield to my friend from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, first of all, I commend all the Republicans \nand Democrats who have worked so hard together--nearly one-fifth of us \nin this Congress--hour after hour, meeting after meeting, and \nflexibility has been provided to both sides by Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Collins and their bill and Senators Chambliss, McCain, \nHutchison, and others in terms of trying to reach a consensus. Those \nwho listened to the Senator from Maryland yesterday know we are given \nthe unclassified version of the nature of this threat. Add to that the \nclassified version, and it is truly a threat that needs to be \naddressed.\n\n  It is despicable that the majority leader of the Senate, when we were \nso close to putting together something to bring joint support of what \neverybody knows we need to do and want to do--so close with agreements \nfrom Democrats and Republicans, ranking members and chairmen of the \nrelevant committees, and presenting a package which would grant limited \ntime and limited germane amendments--to deny us that opportunity.\n  Yet here we are faced with a dilemma of an imminent threat facing the \npeople of the United States of America and a vote whether to continue \nthe process, continue to work with something that potentially could \nkill this for the rest of the session and maybe even next year or \nsomething that grants to the White House an abuse of executive power to \nmandate things through executive order, which we have seen on a number \nof other occasions. Maybe that is the motive, maybe it is not; I don't \nknow.\n  Nevertheless, we are faced with a critical choice in terms of an \nimminent threat to the security of the United States and the American \npeople. I hope my colleagues will take that into consideration when we \ndecide what to do. I thank people on both sides for their tremendous \nefforts, and we should not point fingers of blame at each other.\n  That is a real effort to join and address this very serious threat to \nthe United States.\n  I thank my friend and yield back to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to discuss the troubling \nstate of our financial system and the unfinished business of Wall \nStreet reform. I am here to talk specifically about too-big-to-fail \nbanks.\n  Decades of deregulation and laissez faire economic policies helped \nthe six largest U.S. banks grow from 18 percent of gross domestic \nproduct only 25 years ago to 68 percent of gross domestic product in \n2009. So it went from 18 percent in the mid-1990s to 68 percent of GDP \nin 2009.\n  We know what happened next. During the financial crisis, these six \nmegabanks collected $1.2 trillion--just to understand that figure, if \nwe can--$1.2 trillion is $1,200 billion and $1 billion is $1,000 \nmillion. The six megabanks collected $1.2 trillion in Federal taxpayer-\nfunded support from the Treasury, from the FDIC, and from the Federal \nReserve.\n  Two years after we passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act--and \nI supported it because it took many important steps--I am concerned we \nare not seeing reform, nearly sufficient enough reform, in the \nfinancial sector. As we uncover more and more risky, fraudulent, and \nillegal activities, it seems far too clear that the American people \nabsolutely see this and believe Wall Street is back to business as \nusual.\n  Since 2010, we have learned about a number of things. I am just going \nto rattle off seven or eight significant, serious problems. Some are \nillegal, some are accusations, some are alleging significant systemic \nproblems--all troubling issues that have happened just in the last \ncouple years: Investor lawsuits and SEC enforcement actions over \nmortgage-backed securities; municipalities being sold overpriced credit \nderivatives, bankrupting some of those municipalities, and think of the \nhardship that causes these communities; the forging of foreclosure \ndocuments and mortgage securities legal documents by five of the \nNation's largest servicers, leading to $25 billion in penalties--$25 \nbillion in penalties--from these servicers forging foreclosure \ndocuments and mortgage security legal documents--$25 billion in \npenalties; the Nation's largest bank halting all consumer debt \ncollection lawsuits due to concerns about poorly maintained and \ninaccurate paperwork; the Nation's largest bank losing $5.8 billion so \nfar--so far--on large, complex derivative trades that regulators either \nmissed or didn't understand or ignored; suspicions that 16 global \nbanks, including the three largest U.S. banks, manipulated LIBOR--the \nLondon Interbank Overnight Rate--that is used as a benchmark for \nmortgages, credit cards, student loans, and even for derivatives--\nfinancial instruments that affect almost everybody in our country.\n  Continuing with the list of problems since 2010: a criminal bid-\nrigging trial exposing illegal practices by many Wall Street banks in \narranging bids so banks could underpay for municipal bonds; former \nemployees of the Nation's largest bank alleging the company urged them \nto steer clients to their own mutual funds because they were more \nprofitable to the bank, even though they paid investors lower returns \nthan other funds, while their clients presumably were trusting them to \nact in their best interests; the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \ninvestigating whether the biggest U.S. bank manipulated prices in the \nenergy markets, forcing consumers to pay more; a $175 million \nsettlement by the Nation's fourth largest bank for discriminatory \nlending practices in housing markets that include Cleveland and many \nother cities. One can walk through these neighborhoods and see what \nforeclosures have done to them, see what rigging, what other \ndysfunctional servicers' behavior or illegal activities have done to \nthese communities and to these families.\n  Putting the numbers aside and the political speech aside, imagine for \na moment that a parent of 12- and 13-year-old daughters has to sit down \nwith them and say: Sorry, but dad lost his job a few months ago and now \nwe are losing our home.\n  Where are we going to move, Mom?\n  I don't know.\n  What school am I going to go to?\n  I don't know yet. We have to figure that out.\n  Imagine the personal hurt and hardship caused by a lot of these \nthings to\n\n[[Page S5922]]\n\na whole lot of families in Cleveland and Mansfield and Cincinnati and \nDayton.\n  More problems since 2010: Regulators are investigating whether the \nrate that establishes municipal bond prices is susceptible to \nmanipulation.\n  These are just 11 examples, all of them huge separately and in the \naggregate devastating, potentially--certainly devastating to many \nindividuals and potentially devastating in a huge way to our economy as \na whole. The list goes on and on and on.\n  Some experts say we can't--when we talk about potentially forcing \nthese banks to divest themselves because of their size, some experts \nsay our banks need to compete. They say: No, our banks need to compete \nwith the banks in other countries. But then does anyone truly believe--\ndo any of these bankers on Wall Street or bankers in my State who have \nacted, frankly, more responsibly--the community banks and the credit \nunions and the regional banks--does anybody truly believe we should \nfollow the European model where never-ending bank bailouts have become \nthe norm?\n  We know the world's largest bank, HSBC, at $2.55 trillion, helped \nlaunder money from Mexican drug traffickers and Middle Eastern \nterrorists. As we know by now--all over the newspapers--the eighth \nlargest bank in the world, the $2.4 trillion Barclays--the city where \nthe Olympics are being held--was the first bank caught manipulating the \nLIBOR rate, not exactly models we should emulate.\n  Financial reform is supposed to reduce industry concentration. It is \nsupposed to end too big to fail. But the financial sector is even more \nconcentrated now than it was before the financial crisis.\n  My colleagues will remember what I said at the outset. In 1995, 18 \npercent of GDP was the assets of these banks. The six largest banks had \n18 percent of GDP in 1995. By 2009, it was 68 percent, and it is even \nworse today--the top 10 banks' assets, 6 percent in 2006, now 77 \npercent at the end of 2010 and growing, presumably, as a result of \nmergers during the financial crisis. Three of the four largest \nmegabanks have grown by an average of more than $500 billion--grown by \nan average of more than $500 billion. They are in the vicinity of $800 \nbillion and $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion in assets.\n  The six biggest U.S. banks have combined assets that are twice as \nlarge as the rest of the top 50 U.S. banks put together. Think about \nthat. The six largest U.S. banks, their assets total this; and the next \nlargest 50 U.S. banks--big banks, to be sure; hundreds of billions in \nassets--total even less than the six largest.\n  According to Robert Wilmers, the CEO of M Bank, the six biggest \nbanks in the United States account for 35 percent of all U.S. deposits, \n53 percent of U.S. banking assets, 56 percent of all mortgages, and 93 \npercent--93 percent--of trading revenues.\n  This is just six banks that wheel such immense power in our economy. \nThe message to the markets is clear: These trillion-dollar megabanks \nare too big to manage, they are too big to regulate, and they continue \nto be too big to fail. We still have work to do.\n  For all of its benefits--including a new consumer protection agency \nand oversight of derivatives--the Dodd-Frank legislation relies upon \nregulators to get it right this time.\n  But given their track record--sometimes being too close to the people \nthey regulate, so-called regulatory capture; sometimes there just are \nnot enough of them; other times they may not have the expertise to be \nable to chase around some of the smartest, best educated, most \nexperienced banking executives who know how to game the system. Also, \nas I said, as to these regulators, we simply do not have enough of \nthem.\n  That is why I am skeptical. That is why we need to go beyond the \ncentral provisions of Dodd-Frank that increase capital, that establish \nliving wills, that establish a process for orderly liquidations. Those \nare all good things. But, clearly--I just mentioned these 10 or 11 or \n12 problems; those are just the biggest ones--clearly, those are not \nenough.\n  Members of Congress in both political parties agree that banks need \nto have much more capital to cover their losses--much more of a \nfinancial capital cushion. We agree institutions should issue more \nstock, should restrict dividends, should retain their earnings to build \nbigger buffers. But while countries such as Switzerland are considering \n19 percent capital requirements--a ratio of about 5 to 1--U.S. \nregulators are staying within the Basel III international capital \nstandards, which FDIC Director Tom Hoenig has said simply will not \nprevent another financial crisis.\n  There is also a living will process that is intended to make it \neasier to resolve large, complex institutions. We talked a lot about \nthat in Dodd-Frank.\n  Institutions are supposed to tell regulators how they can be \ndismantled to protect the financial system as a whole and to protect \nMiddle America when they get into financial trouble. But the proof will \nbe in the results.\n  So far regulators have yet to begin a process of simplifying the six \nlargest banks that have a combined 14,420 subsidiaries. Six banks have \n14,420 subsidiaries.\n  I mention that number because, Madam President, as you think about \nevery look at these six banks, every quantifying number I try to give, \nevery observation of these six banks, every delineation of what these \nsix banks do and what they are, this speaks of these huge, these \nbehemoth banks that are too big to fail--these six banks. They are too \nbig to regulate, and they are too big to manage.\n  There is title II Orderly Liquidation Authority. I have heard my \ncolleagues, including the ranking member on my subcommittee, Senator \nCorker from Tennessee, who coauthored title II, note that the FDIC and \nTreasury could keep failing banks on life support rather than liquidate \nthem. Is that what we want when we think of too big to fail, too big to \nmanage, too big to regulate?\n  I have talked to regulators who have privately told me and told \nGraham Steele of my staff that they believe our banks are still too big \nto be allowed to fail because the collapse of banks that size could \npotentially crush the economy.\n  We remember the fear in the voices of some of the top people in the \nBush administration when they talked to us in the fall of 2008 about \nwhat was happening to our financial system. I do not think we have \nanswered those fears nearly well enough.\n  This is not capitalism the way it should be. It is not right. Some of \nmy colleagues think the answer to too big to fail requires repeal of \nDodd-Frank--this is about as silly as it gets--and a return to the same \nunfettered free market approach that Alan Greenspan championed for \ndecades and that led us into this mess--except Alan Greenspan does not \neven think we should have that again, even though he was the No. 1 \ncheerleader, he and the Wall Street Journal editorial board, for an \nunfettered, unregulated Wall Street. He is, to his credit--and I do not \ngive him credit for much in most of the last 10 years--but, to his \ncredit, he has acknowledged that, yes, indeed, he was wrong; that this \nunfettered, unregulated Wall Street capitalism simply did not work for \nour country. He acknowledges doing that again would be a recipe for \nfinancial crises and bailouts as far as the eye could see.\n  Instead, we must face the reality that too big to fail is simply too \nbig, and we must enact the SAFE Banking Act because too big to fail and \ntoo big to manage and too big to regulate has become the norm, \nespecially among these large six behemoth institutions.\n  The SAFE Banking Act, my legislation, would place reasonable limits \non the share of deposits and the volatile nondeposit liabilities that \nany one institution could take on. It would require the largest \nfinancial companies to fund themselves with more of their own \nshareholders' equity and less leverage. It would put an end to the \ngovernment's implicit and explicit support for megabanks--specifically, \nthe six largest Wall Street institutions that, as I spelled out \nearlier, are in a class by themselves.\n  Remember those numbers. The six largest banks: 35 percent of all \ndeposits, 53 percent of all U.S. banking assets, 56 percent of all \nmortgages, 93 percent of trading revenues. Those six institutions have \nthat kind of power in the economic marketplace in large part because of \nactions here.\n  Regulators and banking leaders are increasingly voicing support for \nthis bill.\n\n[[Page S5923]]\n\n  Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker recently said the \nJ.P.Morgan episode might be an illustration that these banks are too \nbig to manage.\n  Former FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair says shareholders and regulators \ncould force banks to break up, but this legislation would be the most \ndirect way to do it.\n  Richard Fisher, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, \nand James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, \nagree that more needs to be done to address the problem of too-big-to-\nfail banks.\n  Last week, the architect of the too-big-to-fail banking model, former \nCitigroup CEO Sandy Weill, said the biggest banks should be broken up.\n\n  Increasingly, this is not a partisan issue. The ranking member of the \nBanking Committee, Republican Senator Shelby from Alabama, supported \nthe SAFE Banking Act when it was a floor amendment, when it was the \nBrown-Kaufman floor amendment.\n  I have heard from more and more of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle that they might have voted against it a couple years ago as a \nfloor amendment, but things have gotten worse. The idea is sounding \nbetter and better to them.\n  This legislation would protect taxpayers by putting megabank \nshareholders on the hook for losses and ending bailouts for good.\n  At a time of increasing fiscal restraint, our Nation can ill-afford \nto waste precious taxpayer dollars bailing out our largest banks in \ntheir recklessness.\n  My legislation would benefit the community banks that are at an \nunfair competitive disadvantage because megabanks have access to \ncheaper funding based upon the perception that the government stands \nbehind them.\n  Studies estimate this support gives megabanks a 70 to 80 basis point \nfunding advantage. Madam President, 70 to 80 basis points means three-\nfourths, four-fifths of a percent on interest advantage, if you will--a \nsubsidy encouraged, provided, for that matter, by the expectation of \ntaxpayer support of up to $60 billion per year.\n  So if you are one of the six big banks, you can borrow money in \ncapital markets at a lower cost than if you are a community bank in \nCarey, OH, or a community bank in Sandusky or a mid-sized bank in \nColumbus or Akron, OH, because the market knows we will not let those \nsix biggest banks fail. So their lending is a little less expensive \nbecause there is a lot less risk.\n  My legislation will benefit investors, as many experts agree that the \nsum of the parts of the largest megabanks is more valuable than the \nbanks as a whole. So under our legislation, when they begin--these six \nmegabanks, with assets from $800 billion to $2.2 trillion--when they \nbegin to divest themselves, there is a reasonably good chance they will \nbe worth more in the aggregate than they were in the whole.\n  It will benefit Main Street families and businesses because increased \ncompetition will result in better prices, and fraudsters will be \npunished with the full force of the law. Just about the only people who \nwill not benefit from my plan are a few Wall Street executives who, \nfrankly, have done just fine in the last 10 years.\n  We simply cannot wait any longer for regulators to act. Wall Street \nhas been allowed to run wild for years. Their watchdogs are either not \nup to the job or, in some cases, complicit in their activities.\n  How many more scandals will it take before we acknowledge that we \ncannot rely on regulators to prevent subprime lending, dangerous \nderivatives, risky proprietary trading, and even fraud and \nmanipulation?\n  Even if the regulators wanted to do the job--and I think they do--it \nwould require 70,000 examiners to examine a trillion-dollar bank with \nthe same level of scrutiny as a community bank.\n  The regulation of the community banks is plenty, but when its comes \nto the six largest banks, we are not even close. Again, they are too \nbig to fail, they are too big to manage--look at what has happened, \nthose examples I gave--and they are too big to regulate.\n  We cannot rely on the market to fix itself. The six largest Wall \nStreet megabanks are essentially an oligopoly and a cartel, making true \ncompetition impossible.\n  Megabanks' shareholders and creditors have no incentive to end too \nbig to fail because they get paid out when banks are bailed out. They \nget paid out when banks are bailed out. And banking laws prevent \nmeaningful management shakeups because any hostile takeover effort \nwould require Federal Reserve approval.\n  That is why it is time for Congress to act in the interests of the \nAmerican public. It is time to restore the public's confidence in our \nfinancial markets. It is not there now, to be sure. It is time to put \nan end to Wall Street welfare and government subsidies. We have seen \nfar too much of that. It is time to enact the SAFE Banking Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I see the Senator from North Dakota \non the Senate floor, and I wonder if he seeks recognition. He is my \nchairman on the Budget Committee. I am inclined to give him precedence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, through the Chair, I would say to my \ncolleague, I do have a matter that is a parliamentary inquiry that is a \nmatter that is important for us to resolve. I do not want to intrude on \nthe Senator's time.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, may I suggest that the Senator \nproceed, and it would be helpful to me if he could give me an \nindication, first, of how long he might be and, second, that we enter \ninto a unanimous consent agreement that I be recognized following his \nremarks.\n  Mr. CONRAD. No more than 4 minutes.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Perfect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n       Parliamentary Inquiry--Fiscal Year 2013 BCA Sequestration\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I come to the floor today to clear up \nsome confusion with respect to the Budget Control Act of 2011. Some \nhave suggested that the Budget Control Act indirectly authorized the \nSenate to use a fast-track process to modify the across-the-board cuts \nscheduled to go into effect next year due to failure of the Joint \nSelect Committee on Deficit Reduction.\n  Madam President, if that claim were true, it would result in a \nfundamental change in Senate procedures and prerogatives. However, it \nis clear in looking at both the statutory language and Congress's \nintent in passing the Budget Control Act that this claim is completely \nwithout merit.\n  First, let's look at what the law actually says. The key provision at \nissue is section 258A of the Deficit Control Act of 1985. Section 258A \nwould allow the majority leader to introduce a joint resolution to \nmodify or provide an alternative to a sequestration order--and I \nquote--``issued under Section 254.'' That joint resolution could not be \nfilibustered and would pass the Senate with a simple majority vote. The \nsequestration orders under section 254 were put in place two decades \nago to enforce deficit targets and discretionary spending limits that \nhave long since expired.\n  A sequestration order under the Budget Control Act is not an order \nissued under section 254. The Budget Control Act created a new \nsequestration process under a completely different section of the law: \nsection 251A. Section 251A explicitly authorized a new set of \nPresidential sequestration orders in fiscal year 2013 for both \ndiscretionary and direct spending, and did so without any reference at \nall to the old section 258A procedures. The statutory language is \nclear, therefore, that these old procedures do not apply to \nsequestration under the Budget Control Act.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S5923, August 2, 2012, in the last column, four times, \nthe Record reads: . . . section 258(a) . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . section 258A \n. . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S5923, August 2, 2012, the Record reads: . . . different \nsection of the law: section 251 (a).

The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I think it is an important decision to \nget affirmed publicly so that we might proceed and not be engaged in \ndistractions.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                              NIH Funding\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, last spring Cathy Hutchison picked \nup a cup of coffee and took a sip. Now, why have I come to the floor of \nthe Senate to talk about Cathy Hutchison picking up a cup of coffee \nlast spring and taking a sip? Because 15 years earlier, Cathy Hutchison \nwas working in her garden when she suffered a stroke that left her \nparalyzed.\n  Cathy did not just lose the ability to use her arms and legs, she \nalso lost the ability to speak. I am sorry to say this condition is not \nunique to Cathy. It happens regularly enough that there is a medical \nterm for it, locked-in syndrome. That is how Cathy lived for nearly 15 \nyears: alert and mentally sharp but unable to move or speak, a prisoner \nin her own body.\n  All of this changed last spring when, for the first time in nearly 15 \nyears, Cathy picked up that cup of coffee and took a sip. Cathy \nHutchison is a patient enrolled in a clinical trial at Brown University \nin Providence, RI. They are testing a neural interface device known as \nBrainGate.\n  BrainGate works by placing a small sensor on the brain. The sensor is \nconnected to a computer that interprets the brain's signals to control \na specially designed robotic arm. The university researchers asked \nCathy to imagine that she was moving her arm in different directions. \nThen they monitored which neurons fired for those corresponding \nmovements, all in her imagination.\n  Using this brain wave information, researchers attached a robotic arm \nto the computer. The computer translated the electrical impulses \ndetected by the sensor in Cathy's brain back into commands to tell the \narm what to do.\n  Cathy communicates through a device that allows her to type using the \nmovement of her eyes, and she typed that she was ``ecstatic'' about the \nnew technology and hopes it can be expanded to one day allow her to \nwalk again.\n  The BrainGate team is also working to determine if this technology \ncan ultimately be used to help individuals paralyzed by stroke or \ninjury to regain greater independence. BrainGate is an example of what \nis possible when the best minds in science and engineering come \ntogether for the common good.\n  Researchers from Brown University, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the German Aerospace \nCenter collaborated on this project. Their efforts were supported by a \ngrant from the National Institutes of Health, as well as funding from \nthe Veterans' Administration, and several private foundations. \nBrainGate is just one of the most recent in a long list of medical \nbreakthroughs that are made possible by our National Institutes of \nHealth. The NIH is the cornerstone of our commitment to medical \nresearch for the benefit of humanity.\n  Research supported by the NIH has led to medical advances that have \nsaved and improved countless lives while making America the world \nleader in discovery and innovation. More than 80 Nobel prizes have been \nawarded for research supported by the National Institutes of Health.\n  In Rhode Island, Brown University has received NIH grants to support \ncutting-edge research on a multitude of diseases, including cancer, \ndementia, and muscular dystrophy. In fact, the scope of projects at \nBrown that receive NIH support is so diverse that the university \ndescribes its NIH-backed research as covering everything from autism to \nAlzheimer's. Yet there are those in Congress who have suggested cutting \nthe NIH's budget.\n  Let's be clear about what cutting the NIH's budget means. It means \ncutting off funding for research that has provided Cathy Hutchison her \nfirst taste of physical independence in 15 years. It means telling the \nmillions of Americans suffering from cancer that they have to wait \nlonger for lifesaving research. It means suffocating a vibrant area of \ninnovation and job creation.\n  Cutting the NIH budget has ripple effects far beyond just one Federal \nagency. Quite simply, it will hurt job growth. Medical research is one \nof the fastest growing fields nationwide. In Rhode Island and across \nthe country, cities are undergoing a renaissance sparked by the growth \nof high-paying careers in medical research.\n  I have heard friends on the other side of the aisle talk at length \nabout how we need to do more to create jobs. Well, I could not agree \nmore. Now is no time to put jobs at risk by cutting back on the \nresearch funding that makes them possible. I know the Appropriations \nCommittee recently reported a bill to the floor that would increase the \nNIH budget by $100 million for the coming fiscal year. I applaud my \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their commitment to this \nvital agency, and I hope we will soon be able to vote on their measure. \nBut there is something looming on the horizon that will render this \n$100 million increase all but meaningless. I am talking, of course, \nabout sequestration, under which it is estimated that NIH will face not \na $100 million increase but a $2.4 billion cut.\n\n  I know a lot of my colleagues have discussed the effect that the \nsequester will have on defense spending, but it is important to \nremember that 50 cents out of every dollar of cuts that will occur \nunder sequester will come out of nondefense spending, including \nspecifically the NIH.\n  ``Devastating'' is the word that keeps being used when people are \nasked how sequester would affect our National Institutes of Health. \nThat is how NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins described the effect of a \nnearly 8-percent cut to the agency's budget. Those who are familiar \nwith science know how important it is in ongoing experiments that there \nbe a consistent data set through the period of the research.\n  When we interrupt research for financial reasons, we can damage the \nvalue of research conducted in other years. I agree with my colleagues \nthat we must reduce our long-term deficit, but when we cut funding that \ncreates jobs and leads to lifesaving medical breakthroughs we are \npursuing policies that are the epitome of penny-wise but pound-foolish.\n  I hope we in the Senate can work together to find sensible solutions \nthat reduce the deficit while maintaining our longstanding commitment \nto medical research and innovation. We owe that much to Cathy and to \nthe millions of Americans whose futures will be brighter thanks to the \nresearch and jobs made possible by our American National Institutes of \nHealth. When Cathy Hutchison interacts with the BrainGate program, it \nis hard not to get the sense that we are looking into the future, a \nfuture where people like Cathy will know that disease or injury will \nnot transform their bodies into a prison.\n  It was Arthur C. Clarke who said ``any sufficiently advanced \ntechnology is indistinguishable from magic.'' For Cathy, for the \nBrainGate research team, and indeed for anyone who may one day benefit \nfrom this remarkable technology, that sip of coffee last spring taken \nby Cathy Hutchison was a moment of magic. Let's commit ourselves to \nproviding Cathy, the BrainGate team, and all of those who are relying \non us in this body to provide the support they need to keep making \nmagical moments like this possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                         Production Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I am here again on the Senate \nfloor, as I have been on 14 previous occasions, to urge all of us, to \nurge my colleagues in the Senate and, of course, our colleagues down \nthrough the Rotunda in the House to extend the production tax credit \nfor wind. It is also known by its shorthand as the PTC.\n\n[[Page S5925]]\n\n  The reason I am here on the floor, as I have said many times before, \nthis is about jobs. If we do not extend the production tax credit as \nsoon as possible, we will lose good-paying American jobs. It is that \nsimple. It is that straightforward.\n  I am going to keep speaking on the floor of the Senate until my \ncolleagues decide to act, until Congress decides to take the necessary \naction to extend the production tax credit and protect American jobs. I \nwant to underline that. We are going to protect American jobs and help \nsecure our energy future in the 21st century where clean energy will be \na dominant part of the mix.\n  It has been a treat to come to the floor to do this on one hand \nbecause I am touring the country. I focus on a State when I come to the \nfloor. Today I want to focus on the great State of Oregon, where the \nwind industry is a major part of their economy, and where the PTC's \npositive ripple effects have been felt statewide.\n  In short, Oregon is a national leader in wind power. I want to share \nsome of the statistics to make the case. According to the American Wind \nEnergy Association, Oregon ranks sixth in power derived from wind. The \nwind energy industry supports roughly 3,000 jobs in Oregon. That number \nis poised to grow but only if we extend the production tax credit.\n  As we look at the map of Oregon, we can see that Oregon has installed \nextensive wind power projects along the Colombia River Valley in the \nnorthern part of the State. The Colombia basically delineates the State \nof Oregon from the State of Washington on the right here along its \nnorthern boundary. There are enough projects there producing enough \npower so that 700,000 homes would have electricity from those wind-\npower projects.\n  The Biglow Canyon Wind Farm is the ninth largest wind farm in the \nNation. And Oregon's Second Congressional District, which is a very big \ndistrict, much like the Western Slope district, Colorado's Third \nDistrict, ranks fourth in the United States for installed wind \ncapacity. Over the last decade, one county alone, a relatively small \ncounty, Sherman County, has seen over $18 million in revenues coming \ninto that county due to the simple presence of the wind energy \nindustry.\n  That money has helped Sherman County do impressive things. They have \ncreated jobs and improved their infrastructure, including building a \nnew public school and library, supporting the Sherman County History \nMuseum, and installing solar panels on county property. A hybrid system \nis in use using renewable energy with those solar panels. Those are \nimpressive achievements.\n  Oregon's wind energy potential is tremendous. Currently there are \nplans to more than triple the amount of power that Oregon gets from \nwind.\n  That would mean a total of 9,000 megawatts of electricity. That would \npower over 2 million homes. Moreover, such a move, such an investment, \nwould create thousands of jobs.\n  I want to go back to my main point. The wind production tax credit \nhas been a major driver of this growth in the last decade, encouraging \nsome wind energy producers to invest in Oregon and the rest of our \ncountry. The PTC has encouraged American innovation, and innovation is \nhow we will grow our economy. It has supported American companies in \nthe wind energy sector. I know the Presiding Officer knows this--and I \nlook forward to the opportunity to talk about her State of North \nCarolina in the future. The PTC has enticed foreign companies to bring \ntheir operations--jobs--to the United States. Because of the PTC, these \ncompanies are building factories and offices in the United States.\n  I want to talk about Vestas, a Danish company that has a significant \nmanufacturing presence in Colorado--four different plants. Last \nSaturday, I was at a Vestas plant in Pueblo. They support many jobs in \nColorado. Vestas also has a strong presence in Oregon. In fact, their \nU.S. headquarters is located in one of the most livable cities in the \nworld, that being Portland. Vestas has made a real statement about the \npotential here in the United States.\n  Again, the point I am making is it is clear to me and a large, \ngrowing, and bipartisan group of colleagues in both Houses of Congress, \nincluding both of my colleagues from Oregon, Senators Merkley and \nWyden, that extending the production tax credit is the right thing to \ndo. It is the right thing to do for our future, for our economy, and \nfor our environment. Without the PTC--if you look at the other side of \nthis success story--the sustained growth of the wind industry in recent \nyears will slow--it already has--and possibly halt, and we actually may \nsee good-paying American jobs being lost to China and other countries. \nWhy would we want that to happen? We cannot let that happen. The \ncontinued uncertainty is not right and not fair when it comes to our \nU.S. wind industry and the people who work in that sector.\n  Last Saturday, I heard from the workers at the Vestas plant in Pueblo \nthat they didn't know whether they were going to have jobs in a few \nmonths. The looks on their faces alone should motivate all of us to get \nthe wind production tax credit extended. This is also an opportunity \nfor us in Congress to show the American public that we are not as \ndysfunctional as a Congress as the public believes. This is a chance to \nsupport economic growth and American manufacturing right here in our \ncountry. The American people expect us to produce results, and we can \nonly do so by working together.\n  I fear that the wind production tax credit has become a political \nfootball. We have a chance to show the American public, who are sick of \ncampaign year rhetoric and politics, business as usual and \npartisanship, that we can rise above that. I reiterate that this is a \nperfect opportunity for us because this is not a partisan issue. It has \nwidespread support from both parties across our country. I have been \nhighlighting that fact over the last few weeks.\n  What can we do? We ought to understand that the production tax credit \nequals jobs. We ought to pass it as soon as possible. As I wind down, I \nnote that the Senate Finance Committee is meeting right now to consider \na tax extenders package. I know many colleagues on the Senate Finance \nCommittee, including Oregon's senior Senator Ron Wyden, are working to \ninclude the PTC in the package. I add my voice to those who are already \nin place, urging the Finance Committee to pass an extension of the PTC \ntoday as a part of the tax extenders package, and then let's move the \nfull Senate to the point where we can pass the PTC as soon as possible. \nWhy? Because we are protecting American jobs and we are preparing the \nground for additional job creation that is crucial, growing, and \nexciting in the 21st century to the wind energy industry.\n  I thank the Chair for what her State is doing for wind power. I look \nforward to talking about North Carolina.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am delighted to follow the \ndistinguished Senator from Colorado and commend him for his persistence \nand his passion on preserving the wind production tax credit. We have, \nas he will recall from our previous discussions together on the floor, \nfacilities that we hope to have going up offshore of Rhode Island very \nsoon that will provide a local source of energy for us, reduce our \nreliance on imported oil, and create significant and well-paying jobs \nat home. So I am glad to be his wingman in this pursuit and thank him \nfor his leadership.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Madam President, yesterday marked the end of what is expected to be \none of the top five warmest months on record. The USDA recently \ndeclared nearly 1,400 counties in 31 States, including, I am sure, many \nin Colorado, disaster areas as a result of the ongoing drought. NASA \nand NOAA declared the last decade the warmest on record. In 2011, we \nfaced 14 weather-related disasters that totaled more than $1 billion in \ndamage each. We already have several more that have occurred in 2012.\n  I have come to the floor today to discuss the science of climate \nchange. Virtually all respected scientific and academic institutions \nhave agreed that climate change is happening, and that human activities \nare the driving cause of this change. A letter to Congress from a great \nnumber of those institutions in October 2009 stated that:\n\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear that \n     climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research \n     demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted\n\n[[Page S5926]]\n\n     by human activities are the primary driver. These conclusions \n     are based on multiple independent lines of evidence, and \n     contrary assertions are inconsistent with an objective \n     assessment of the vast body of peer-reviewed science.\n\n  If I were to translate that last phrase into layman's terms, it would \nbasically mean if you are saying anything different, we should be \nlooking for your motives.\n  This letter was signed by the heads of the following organizations: \nthe American Association for the Advancement of Science, American \nChemical Society, American Geophysical Union, American Institute of \nBiological Sciences, American Meteorological Society, American Society \nof Agronomy, American Society of Plant Biologists, American Statistical \nAssociation, Association of Ecosystem Research Centers, Botanical \nSociety of America, Crop Science Society of America, and a great many \nothers.\n\n  These are highly esteemed scientific organizations, and they don't \nthink the jury is still out on climate change. They recognize that, in \nreality, the verdict is in, and it is time to act.\n  Over the weekend, Dr. Richard Muller, professor of physics at the \nUniversity of California-Berkeley, and also director of the Berkeley \nEarth Surface Temperature Project, and a former MacArthur Foundation \nFellow--a so-called genius grant award winner--revealed in a New York \nTimes op-ed how he has become a converted climate skeptic. He cites \nfindings from his research, which ironically was partially funded by \nthe Koch brothers, that the Earth's land temperature has increased by \n2\\1/2\\ degrees Fahrenheit in the past 250 years and 1\\1/2\\ degrees over \nthe past 50 years. He states:\n\n       Moreover, it appears likely that essentially all of this \n     increase results from the human emission of greenhouse gases.\n\n  Unfortunately, human emission of greenhouse gases is on the rise. In \n2011, the famed Mauna Loa Observatory documented the biggest annual \njump yet in carbon dioxide. A monitoring station in the Arctic this \nyear measured carbon dioxide at 400 parts per million for the first \ntime, which is 50 parts per million higher than the maximum \nconcentration at which scientists predict a stable climate. Of course, \n400 parts per million is way outside the 170 to 300 parts per million \nbandwidth that has existed on this planet for the past 8,000 centuries. \nFor 800,000 years, we have been between 170 and 300 parts per million, \nand now in the bellwether leading-edge Arctic area, we cracked 400 in \nour climate.\n  A 2012 report by the IPCC concludes that climate change increases the \nrisk of heavy precipitation. Rhode Islanders are no stranger to heavy \nprecipitation. In 2010, we saw flooding that exceeded anything we have \nseen since the 1870s, when Rhode Island first started keeping records. \nAt the height of the rains, streets in many Rhode Island cities and \ntowns looked more like rivers than roads. Local emergency workers \nsailed down Providence Street, a main road in West Warwick, by boat and \njet skis--down a main road on boats and jet skis--in order to assist \nresidents trapped by the floodwaters. Of course, we cannot link that \nexact storm to climate change, but we know that climate change is \nincreasing the risk of extreme weather events like this one. It is \nloading the dice for more and worse storms.\n  As a New Englander, I was concerned by a report released this week by \nEnvironment America, titled ``When It Rains, It Pours.'' The report \nfound that in New England ``intense rainstorms and snowstorms [are] \nhappening 85 percent more often than in 1948. The frequency of intense \nrain or snowstorms nearly doubled in Vermont and Rhode Island, and more \nthan doubled in New Hampshire.'' Not only are these inundations \nhappening more often, but the largest events are actually dumping more \nprecipitation--around 10 percent more on average--across the country. \nFor States such as mine, these storms are dangerous, expensive, and \ncause lasting damage.\n  We are moving down a troublesome and unknown path. The best we can do \nnow is to prepare for dramatic environmental shifts. We must look to \nscience and scientists and use the best available data to protect and \nprepare both our natural and built environments, which sustain us and \nour economy. Ensuring the integrity of our infrastructure in the face \nof a rapidly changing climate is essential. I want to focus for a \nminute on that infrastructure. Coastal States face a particularly \nunique set of challenges, so the infrastructure challenge for Rhode \nIsland is worse than many places. We face what I call a triple whammy, \nas we must adapt not only to extreme temperatures and unusual weather \nbut also to sea level rise.\n  As average global temperatures rise, less water will be stored in \nsnowpack and on the ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland. We also \nknow that at higher temperatures water expands to greater volume, so \nthat leads to a sea level rise, which is predicted to range from 20 to \n39 inches by 2100, with recent studies showing that the numbers could \nbe even higher due to greater than expected melting of glaciers and ice \nsheets. This is not a theory. We are into the realm of measurement.\n  Long-term data from tide gauges in the historic sailing capital of \nNewport, RI, show an increase in average sea level of nearly 10 inches \nsince 1930. At these same tide gauges, measurements show that the rate \nof sea level rise has increased in the past two decades compared to the \nrate over the last century. This is consistent with reports that since \n1990 sea level has been rising faster than the rate predicted by models \nused to generate IPCC estimates.\n  Sea level rise is one thing, and the increase in storm surges that \nwill accompany it is even worse and promises to bring devastation to \nour doorsteps. Critical infrastructure in at-risk coastal areas--roads, \npowerplants, wastewater treatment plants--will need to be reinforced or \nrelocated. Additionally, our estuaries, marshes, and the barrier \nislands that act as natural filtration systems and buffers against \nstorms will be inundated, with little time or space to retreat and move \ninland as they have in the past. The oncoming weather is coming on too \nfast.\n  One consequence of rising sea levels is that local erosion rates in \nRhode Island have doubled from 1990 to 2006, and some freshwater \nwetlands near the coast are transitioning to salt marsh. Increased sea \nlevel and erosion puts critical public infrastructure at risk. In one \nexample, we have a small but vibrant coastal community, Matunuck, where \nbeaches have eroded 20 feet over the past 12 years. The town has to \nface difficult decisions as the only road connecting about 1600 \nresidents and several restaurants and businesses is protected now by \nless than a dozen feet of sand from the ocean. This road, which \nprovides access for emergency vehicles and lies on top of a water main, \nmust be protected. But what are the costs of protecting this piece of \nroad for areas nearby or farther down the shore? Often when you protect \none area of beach from erosion by hardening or altering the shoreline, \nyou do so to the sacrifice of other areas. It takes science and data to \nsort out how to do that right.\n\n  These are not easy decisions for communities. To best protect \ninfrastructure and the communities and families who live in these at-\nrisk areas, we have to, as a nation, plan ahead. We have to use the \nbest and most reliable science, and we have to be able to prioritize \nadaptation efforts.\n  In North Carolina, the State legislature considered a measure that \nwould have severely restricted the ability of their Coastal Resources \nCommission to employ scientific estimates of future sea level rise. \nThat is the ultimate case of the ostrich burying its head in the sand--\nin this case, the beach sand. This type of thinking will cost money and \nlives in the future.\n  In Rhode Island, we are taking a different approach.\n  We have to if we want to protect public health and safety. Rhode \nIsland has 19 ``high hazard'' dams that have been deemed ``unsafe'' by \nour Department of Environmental Management. We have 6,000 onsite waste \nwater treatment systems located near the coast, several landfills that \nmay be susceptible to coastal erosion and evacuation routes that could \nbe underwater as sea levels rise.\n  In 2008, our Coastal Resources Management Council adopted a climate \nchange and sea level rise policy to protect public and private \nproperty, infrastructure, and economically valuable coastal ecosystems. \nThe policy states the following:\n\n       The Council will integrate climate change and sea-level \n     rise scenarios into its operations to prepare Rhode Island \n     for these new,\n\n[[Page S5927]]\n\n     evolving conditions and make our coastal areas more \n     resilient.\n       It is the Council's policy to accommodate a base rate of \n     expected 3-5 foot rise in sea level by the year 2100 in the \n     siting, design, and implementation of public and private \n     coastal activities and to insure proactive stewardship of \n     coastal ecosystems under these changing conditions. It should \n     be noted that the 3-5 foot rate of sea-level rise assumption \n     embedded in this policy is relatively narrow and low. The \n     Council recognizes that the lower the sea level rise estimate \n     used, the greater the risk that policies and efforts to adapt \n     sea-level rise and climate change will prove to be \n     inadequate.\n\n  This policy is already helping the State make smart decisions. For \nexample, when a new pump station was needed at a sewage treatment \nplant, CRMC looked at sea-level rise models before determining where it \nshould go, avoiding future relocation costs or malfunction in the face \nof flash flooding and sea level rise.\n  In 2010, our general assembly created the Rhode Island Climate Change \nCommission to study the projected impacts of climate change on the \nState, develop strategies to adapt to those impacts, and determine \nmechanisms to incorporate climate adaptation into existing state and \nmunicipal programs. A draft progress report from the Commission lists \nmany ways the state is planning to adapt to climate change, including: \nCreating a ``Structural Concept and Contingency Plan to Inundation of \nthe Ferry Terminals and Island Roadway Systems''; creating the \n``Central Landfill Disaster Preparedness Plan''; national grid, our \nelectricity and natural gas utility, undertaking a ``Statewide \nSubstation Flooding Assessment''; the Army Corps of Engineers, FEMA, \nand the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency conducting a \n``Hurricane and Flooding Evacuation Study''; and the list goes on and \non.\n  In the town of North Kingston, RI, they have taken the best elevation \ndata available, and modeled 1, 3, and 5 feet of sea-level rise, as well \nas 1 foot of sea-level rise plus 3 feet of storm surge. By overlaying \nthese inundation models on top of maps identifying critical \ninfrastructure such as roads, emergency routes, railroads, water \ntreatment plans, and estuaries, the town will be able to prioritize \ntransportation, conservation, and relocation projects. They are also \nable to quantify the costs of sea-level rise. In one small area of the \ntown, 1 foot of sea-level rise would put two buildings, valued at $1.3 \nmillion, underwater. Five feet of sea-level rise, however, jeopardizes \n116 buildings valued at $91 million.\n  Similarly, by modeling how sea-level rise will impact estuaries, \ntowns can preserve areas that will stay wetlands or undeveloped areas \nthat will become wetlands in the future, as opposed to areas that will \nbe lost. Estuaries act as nurseries for our hugely valuable fisheries, \nand protect our homes, buildings and communities from storm surge. \nThere is already limited funding to protect these important ecosystems \nand this kind of planning promotes efficiency in spending.\n  Let me close by saying that it is now well past time for us as a \ncountry to start making policy that helps us adapt to the emerging \nscientific reality that our actions indeed do affect our environment. \nFor those of us who are ocean States, the state of our oceans and \ncoastlines is particularly significant, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport our National Endowment for the Oceans, which got all the way \ninto the conference committee on the highway bill before it was taken \nout in an unfortunate, unwise, and, frankly, unfair maneuver.\n  We are at a place now where nature could not be giving us clearer \nwarnings. Whatever higher power there is--and we each have our own \nbeliefs on that--that higher power that gave us our advanced human \ncapacity for perception, for calculation, for analysis, for deduction, \nand for foresight has laid out before us more than enough information \nfor us to make the right decisions. Only a wild and reckless greed or a \nfatal hubris could blind us to the distress signals coming from our \noceans, our atmosphere, and our world. Fortunately, these human \ncapacities still provide us everything we need to act responsibly but \nonly if we will.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5927-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5927-S5934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF GERSHWIN A. DRAIN TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                    THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF MICHIGAN\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read the nomination of Gershwin A. Drain, of \nMichigan, to be United States District Judge for the Eastern District \nof Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 1 hour of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this week, Senate Republicans \nfollowed through on their partisan opposition to the President by \nslamming the door on a highly qualified, consensus circuit court \nnominee with bipartisan support. It was the first time in history that \na circuit court nominee reported with bipartisan support from the \nJudiciary Committee was successfully filibustered. Judge Robert \nBacharach, who was nominated to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, had \nhad the strong support of his Republican home State Senators, Senator \nCoburn and Senator Inhofe. Unfortunately, they chose not to vote to end \nthe unprecedented filibuster of his nomination and cloture fell just \nshort. This deprived the people of Oklahoma and the Tenth Circuit of an \noutstanding judge who could today be serving the American people as an \nappellate judge. The Bacharach nomination is one of the many judicial \nnominees ready for final action by the Senate but being delayed by \nRepublican opposition.\n  There was an article in the Washington Post this morning entitled ``A \nBench with Plenty of Room'' about the judicial vacancies being \nperpetuated by partisanship all to the detriment of those seeking \njustice in our Federal courts. It notes that a lower percentage of \nPresident Obama's nominees have been confirmed than had been during the \nBush administration and that at this point during the Bush Presidency \nthere were only 28 judicial vacancies. It observes that ``Obama, with \n78 vacancies, may be the first president in decades to end his first \nterm with more judicial vacancies than when he began.'' We can change \nthat if Senate Republicans will cooperate in the consideration of the \n23 judicial nominees on the Senate Executive Calendar awaiting a final, \nup-or-down confirmation vote. I ask that a copy of that article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 1, 2012]\n\n                      A Bench With Plenty of Room\n\n       The Senate's rejection Monday of Oklahoma Magistrate Judge \n     Robert Bacharach for a U.S. Court of Appeals seat sent a \n     clear message to the three other appellate nominees hoping \n     for a vote on the Senate floor:\n       Fuhgeddaboudit.\n       Ditto for 16 U.S. District Court nominees also pending in \n     committee. The odds of judicial confirmations after this \n     August recess are exceptionally slim--at best. The Cubs will \n     win the pennant before you'll be putting on the black robes.\n       No nominees were confirmed after the August recess when \n     President Bill Clinton was running for reelection in 1996 and \n     only three when President George W. Bush was running for a \n     second term in 2004--although five got in during the lame-\n     duck session.\n       Still, a whopping 13 George H.W. Bush nominees, including \n     two for appellate seats, were confirmed after the August \n     recess in 1992, according to Senate Judiciary Committee \n     statistics.\n       Four Clinton judicial picks were confirmed after the recess \n     in 2000, when Bush II and Al Gore were running, and 10 Bush \n     judges were confirmed during the race between Barack Obama \n     and John McCain, the committee reports.\n       So with the numbers pretty much set, let's recap.\n       President Barack Obama, who started off slowly in getting \n     nominations up to the Senate, never fully caught up. He's \n     nominated fewer judges (200) than either Bush (228) or \n     Clinton (245) on Aug. 1 of their fourth year in office, \n     according to committee statistics.\n       At the same time, the Senate has confirmed a smaller \n     percentage of Obama nominees than Clinton nominees--78 \n     percent, compared with 80.8 percent--and a much smaller \n     percentage than in the Bush administration (86.4).\n       As a result, Obama, with 78 vacancies, may be the first \n     president in decades to end his first term with more judicial \n     vacancies than when he started.\n       At this point in their first terms, Clinton had 58 judicial \n     vacancies and Bush had 28. (The latter figure is pretty much \n     full employment.)\n\n[[Page S5928]]\n\n       Liberals have criticized Obama for not having pushed harder \n     for his nominees, noting that Bush issued a lengthy statement \n     at a 2002 news conference blasting ``a handful'' of Senate \n     Democrats for holding up his judicial nominees because they \n     ``fear the outcome of a fair vote in the full Senate.''\n       ``The Senate has an obligation to provide fair hearings and \n     prompt votes to all nominees,'' Bush said, ``no matter who \n     controls the Senate or who controls the White House.'' Obama \n     did, however, mention Senate delays in a State of the Union \n     address and in a Saturday radio address, we were told. And \n     Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) intends to \n     keep moving nominees this fall. Well, who knows? Deals are \n     always possible.\n       But, after those recess appointments of the consumer \n     finance watchdog and some labor folks in January, furious \n     Republicans are not feeling particularly cooperative on \n     appointments.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senate Republicans who took the floor earlier this \nweek relied on their distorted application of the Thurmond rule in \nseeking to justify their unprecedented filibuster of Judge Bacharach's \nnomination. The truth is that Senate Republicans are trying to find an \nexcuse for their partisan inaction that is stalling almost two dozen \njudicial nominees.\n  We now have a President who has worked with home State Senators to \nselect moderate, superbly qualified judicial nominees. Yet Republicans \nwho support these nominees will not vote to end filibusters against \nthem and will not stand up to the partisan obstruction. I am proud of \nmy record of working to lower vacancies and to move nominations whether \nthere is a Republican or Democratic President and of my role ensuring \nthat nominees are treated fairly and that the rights of every Senator \nare protected in the Judiciary Committee. But this is not about me. \nThis is about the American people. This is about ensuring that they \nhave functioning courts so they have access to justice.\n  With our Federal courts still severely overburdened, I hope that \nSenate Republicans will consider the needs of the American people. We \nneed to do better, filling vacancies to ensure a functioning democracy, \nfunctioning courts, and do our job for the American people.\n  There are currently 19 district court nominees who have been reported \nfavorably by the Judiciary Committee who can be voted on right now, \nalmost all of them completely noncontroversial with significant \nbipartisan support. Of the 19 district court nominees currently pending \non the floor, 16 were supported by nearly all Republicans on the \ncommittee. All have the support of their home State Senators, including \neight with Republican home State Senators.\n  The reason for this extensive backlog of nominees is that Senate \nRepublicans have allowed for votes on just one district court nominee \nper week for the last 7 weeks. We cannot allow this slow pace of \nconfirmations to continue with the judicial vacancy crisis that we \nface. There are currently 78 vacancies. Judicial vacancies during the \nlast few years have been at historically high levels and have remained \nnear or above 80 for 3\\1/2\\ years. Nearly 1 out of every 11 Federal \njudgeships is currently vacant. Vacancies on the Federal courts are \nmore than 2\\1/2\\ times as many as they were on this date during the \nfirst term of President Bush.\n  In contrast to the dramatic reduction in judicial vacancies during \nPresident Bush's first term, judicial vacancies are higher than they \nwere when President Obama came into office--another sad first.\n  We have heard lots of excuses from Senate Republicans, who have tried \nto shift the blame for the judicial vacancy crisis to the President. \nThey claim that the President has not made enough nominations. However, \nthere are 19 outstanding district court nominees who can be confirmed \nright now who are being stalled. Let's act on them. Let's vote them up \nor down.\n  The Senate should proceed to confirm all 19 district court nominees \nwho are ready for final confirmation votes. I know we can do this \nbecause we have done this before. On November 14, 2002, the Senate \nproceeded to confirm 18 judicial nominees on 1 day, and vacancies went \ndown to 60 throughout the country. If we confirm the 19 district \nnominees ready for final Senate action today, we can reduce vacancies \ndown to 60 as well. I hope that Senate Republicans will not extend \ntheir wrongheaded Thurmond rule shutdown to the confirmation of \nconsensus, well-qualified district court nominees. Given our \noverburdened Federal courts and the need to provide all Americans with \nprompt justice, we should all be working in a bipartisan fashion to \nconfirm these nominees.\n  Today, the Senate will vote on the nomination of Gershwin Drain to \nfill a judicial emergency vacancy in the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Michigan. Judge Drain has the strong support of his \nhome State Senators, Senator Levin and Senator Stabenow. His nomination \nwas reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee 4 months ago.\n  Judge Drain has been a State and local trial court judge in Michigan \nfor over 25 years, with jurisdiction over both civil and criminal \nmatters. In that time, he has presided over approximately 600 cases \nthat have gone to verdict or judgment after trial. The ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary has unanimously rated Judge Drain as \n``qualified'' to serve on the U.S. district court.\n  Currently a trial judge on the third Circuit Court of Michigan, where \nhe has been presiding since 1997, Judge Drain has also served on the \nRecorder's Court for the City of Detroit for a decade. Prior to that, \nhe served briefly as a judge for the 36th District Court of Michigan. \nBefore becoming a judge, he was a trial attorney for the Federal \nDefenders Office for nearly a dozen years, where he tried over 140 \ncases to verdict or judgment. Judge Drain's vast experience as both a \njudge and a litigator makes him well prepared to take the Federal \nbench.\n  There are some Senators who have expressed concerns about Judge \nDrain's views based on a few isolated public statements that Judge \nDrain made more than a decade ago. However, Judge Drain's 25 years on \nthe bench demonstrate that he is more than capable of being a fair and \nneutral judge who faithfully applies the law. His experience presiding \nover 600 civil and criminal matters provides further assurance that he \nmakes his decision based on the law and nothing more.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination \nof Gershwin A. Drain, to be U.S. district judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan. Judge Drain, currently serving as a Michigan \nState court judge, was reported out of committee on a 10 to 8 vote. He \ncould hardly be described as a consensus nominee.\n  Even as we turn to the 155th nominee of this President to be \nconfirmed to the district and circuit courts, we continue to hear \nunsubstantiated charges of obstructionism. The fact is, we have \nconfirmed over 80 percent of President Obama's District nominees. That \nexceeds the percentage for President Bush at this stage in his \nPresidency.\n  During the last Presidential election year, 2008, the Senate \nconfirmed a total of 28 judges--24 district and 4 circuit. This \nPresidential election year we have already exceeded those numbers. We \nhave confirmed 5 circuit nominees, and Judge Drain would be the 28th \ndistrict judge confirmed. That is a total of 33 judges this year versus \n28 in the last Presidential election year. Again, there is no credible \nbasis to argue that this President is being treated differently.\n  With regard to Judge Drain, I will not take the time to mention every \naspect of his record that I find troubling, but I do want to highlight \nsome of my concerns.\n  In 1994, Judge Drain wrote an article that was published in the \nMichigan Chronicle concerning the second amendment and the right of \nAmerican citizens to own and possess firearms. Judge Drain wrote that \nhe ``envisions a day when the National Rifle Association with its lobby \nwill not be feared, and that legislators and congressman will stand up \nstrong against them instead of bowing down to them.'' He also wrote \nthat he ``looks forward to the time when a person with a gun will be \nviewed as a coward or a chicken.''\n  I would note that it is not as if Judge Drain was a young and \ninexperienced lawyer when he took this view. On the contrary, he wrote \nthis article after he had been serving as a judge for approximately 7 \nyears. I recognize that Judge Drain told Senator Lee at his hearing \nthat, if confirmed, he would follow the precedent in McDonald and \nHeller. But, I also know that when individual has such strong and well-\nestablished views on a particular subject, it can be very\n\n[[Page S5929]]\n\ndifficult for them to set aside those strongly held views.\n  Judge Drain also has very strong views regarding his opposition to \nthe death penalty. In an article he authored in the Detroit News, he \nreferred to the death penalty as a ``primitive punishment that is \nbrutal and barbaric.'' He also said that deterrence was ``the only \nreasonably legitimate argument for killing the convicted,'' but he said \ndeterrence was actually a ``myth.'' Now, at his hearing, Judge Drain \nsaid that he wrote that article many years ago and he no longer holds \nto that position. But again, given how Judge Drain appears to have held \nvery strong views on this issue, I am concerned that he would not be \nable to completely set those views aside.\n  His views on criminal sentencing concern me as well. Judge Drain has \nbeen strident in his opposition to mandatory sentences. He once wrote \nthat, as a judge, ``one of my unpleasant tasks on occasion is to impose \nmandatory sentences.'' On another occasion, he expressed admiration for \njudges who refuse to hear drug cases where the law would require them \nto impose mandatory sentences. He called the judges who refuse such \ncases ``courageous.'' In my view, judges should accept the cases that \nare assigned to them, and it is their duty to do what the law requires \nof them. If they are unable to do that, then they should not be a \njudge.\n  At the State level, he urged his legislature to eliminate mandatory \nsentencing. At the Federal level, he criticized President Clinton's \n``three strikes and you're out'' legislation.\n  At his hearing, I asked him about his views on sentencing. I \nappreciate that he acknowledged that his obligation is to follow the \nlaw. And then he added, ``The fact that I wrote some side comments \nabout [sentencing], really shouldn't have anything to do with my \ndecision-making, and is really kind of irrelevant or unimportant to \nme.''\n  However, Judge Drain's articles and comments are not irrelevant. As I \nevaluate the nominee, I have to be comfortable that he will be able to \nset aside his strongly held personal views and do what the law \nrequires. Unfortunately, I am unable to reach that conclusion. I am \nsure Judge Drain is an admirable man, but I am unable to support him \nfor the Federal bench.\n  Judge Drain received his B.S. from Western Michigan University in \n1970 and his J.D. from the University of Michigan Law School in 1972. \nUpon graduation, he clerked for the Michigan Third Circuit Court \njudges. In 1973, Judge Drain worked as an attorney for a year in the \ndepartment of transportation in Detroit. There, he handled property \ndamage and minor personal injury cases. From 1974 to 1986, he worked as \na Federal public defender in Detroit on felony cases. He handled cases \nwhere defendants were charged with a variety of crimes, including drug \nviolations, bank robberies, counterfeiting, mail theft, interstate \ntransportation of stolen property, and gun charges.\n  In 1986, Judge Drain was appointed to the 36th District Court for the \ncity of Detroit. There, he had jurisdiction over traffic violations, \nlandlord-tenant disputes, misdemeanors, and civil cases where the \namount in controversy was less than $25,000. In 1987, he was appointed \nto the Recorder's Court for the city of Detroit, where he presided over \nfelony prosecutions.\n  Judge Drain was elected to the Third Circuit Court of Michigan in \n1997, where he presided over felony prosecutions in Wayne County until \n2000. In 2000, he became a civil judge in the Third Circuit and \npresides over State civil cases where the amount in controversy exceeds \n$25,000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I don't intend to talk about the \nnomination, but I have talked to my friend from Michigan about this, \nand I would ask unanimous consent that my time come from the Republican \ntime on the nomination discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cyber Security\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. I rise today on two topics. One, I want to say that while \nI don't agree with everything my good friend from Rhode Island just \nsaid about the issue he was talking about, the two of us have worked \nall this year to try to bring people together on the issue we failed to \ndeal with today on cyber security.\n  Senator Whitehouse and I, along with Senators Kyl and Mikulski, at \nthe very first of the year began to create opportunities for Senators \nto sit down together and talk about the threat we face and talk about \nwhat we need to do to deal with it. I am convinced and I believe all \nthe people I just mentioned are equally convinced that two things will \nhappen: No. 1, we will eventually have a cyber attack on our country \nthat will be successful in some way that many Americans will understand \nthe danger we face from the cyber threat and, No. 2, that we will \neventually pass a bill. My strong belief is that will be a better bill \nif we pass it before that event rather than after that event.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, may I simply interject, with the \nSenator's permission, to say how much of a pleasure it has been to work \nwith him on this issue and to say that I think a great number of \nSenators on both sides of the aisle have worked in very good faith to \nget to a point where we can pass a bill. And I pledge to him, despite \nthe unfortunate outcome of today's cloture vote, that I am committed to \ncontinuing to work with him, Senator Kyl, Senator Graham, Senator \nMcCain, and others--I guess Senator Chambliss--on the other side of the \naisle so we can indeed take the necessary steps to protect our Nation \nfrom this threat. But I say this with a strong consciousness of the \nvery good will and the very hard work Senator Blunt put into this \neffort and with great appreciation to him personally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank my friend from Rhode Island, and I think we can \nmove forward. I think there is good faith.\n  As I said, we started--the four of us--beginning to get people \ntogether. That group was quickly joined by Senators Collins and \nLieberman, so then six of us began to get people together. There were \nany number of meetings this week with about two dozen Senators, about \nequally divided between both parties, trying to find a way forward. I \ndidn't think we found that in the cloture motion today. The motion \nsaid: Here is how we are going to proceed to finish the bill, and so we \ndidn't move forward today. But I hope we can continue to work with \nSenator Reid and others to create the sense that Senator Whitehouse \njust expressed, that there is great bipartisan effort being made to \nfind a solution that not only would pass a Senate bill but would wind \nup with a bill on the President's desk sometime this year.\n  You don't have to look very far to find people who will say that the \ngreatest threat we face at this moment is the threat of some kind of \ncyber attack. At the highest levels of our military structure, of our \nintelligence structure, they quickly come to that conclusion. And \nleaving here for the work period in August that Congress has had since \nthe beginning of Congresses without having this done on the Senate side \nis disappointing to me.\n  On the other hand, there wouldn't have been a bill even if we had \npassed a bill today because we have to work with the House to have a \nbill that winds up with a piece of paper on the President's desk--a \nrelatively small stack of paper--that he can sign and that then becomes \nthe law that allows us to either minimize or hopefully avoid the \ncurrent certainty that someone will eventually begin to get to our \ncritical infrastructure in a way that makes it hard for the country to \nget water, to get electricity, to communicate, or to address the \nfinancial network. You know, 3 or 4 days anywhere in the country where \nthe electricity is out, suddenly you begin to see all of the things \nthat are dependent on just the electrical grid alone.\n  Hopefully we can do this. I know work is being done. I will be \ninvolved in some of it later today. As I said, I am disappointed we \ndidn't get this done, but it has to be done. We can't leave here this \nyear with the House saying ``we passed a bill'' and the Senate saying \neither ``we didn't pass a bill because one side didn't want to work \nwith the other'' or ``we passed a bill, but the House wouldn't agree to \nit.'' This is not a problem that we just need to have a political \nanswer to; this is a problem we need to have a real answer to.\n\n[[Page S5930]]\n\n                             Iran Sanctions\n\n  What I also came to the floor to talk about today is something we \nactually managed to get done just a few days ago when the Senate passed \nthe House-passed Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act. This \nis one thing people who don't agree on much of anything else in the \nHouse and Senate can figure out how to agree on. This bill, while I \nthink it could have been a little stronger, was still a strong effort \nto reach a conclusion that hopefully the President will sign as soon as \npossible and send the right message to Iran that even amid our vigorous \ndisagreements on all these other issues, including something as \nimportant as cyber security, Congress stands united against \nIran developing nuclear capacity.\n\n  Let me give some of the highlights of the bill. This would create \nstrong new measures on any entity that invests in Iran's petroleum, \npetrochemical, or natural gas sector, strong measures against any \nentity that provides goods, services, and infrastructure or technology \nto Iran's oil and natural gas and any entity that provides refined \npetroleum products to Iran.\n  Iran is an economic basket case. They have all this oil, but they \ncan't turn enough of it into gasoline for their own country because of \nthe kind of government under which they are suffering.\n  Again, this bill would create new, strong measures against any \ncompany or entity that insures or reinsures investments in Iran's oil \nsector; that engages in joint ventures with the National Iranian Oil \nCompany; that provides insurance or reinsurance to the National Iranian \nOil Company or the National Iranian Tanker Company; that helps Iran \nevade oil sanctions through reflagging or some effort that tries to \nhide the real source of oil coming from Iran; that sells or leases or \notherwise provides tankers to Iran; that transports crude oil from Iran \nconcealing the origin of Iranian crude in any way. These are good \nmeasures that strengthen what we have been doing, and what we have been \ndoing is having some impact. I believe we need to have more impact \nbecause the result would be so unacceptable if Iran successfully gets a \nnuclear weapon.\n  The bill prevents Iran from bringing money back when it sells oil in \nother countries. Now, 80 percent of their hard currency comes into the \ncountry that way. So we would say that can't happen. And 50 percent of \nall the money that runs the government comes in that way. When the \nPresident signs this bill, we are saying this shouldn't be allowed to \nhappen. It also prevents the purchasing of Iranian sovereign debt.\n  I have been working on this issue for a long time. In 2006 I worked \nwith my colleagues in the House and Senate and the administration to \nsecure the first Iran Freedom Support Act, which updated the Iran \nsanctions law and put into law many of the things we have been doing. \nThis bill, along with that bill, addresses problems we need to be \nconcerned about as a country.\n  Late last year the Senate passed an amendment to the Defense bill, \n100 to 0, to block Iran's access to global capital markets. Foreign \nbanks that do business with Iran's banks won't be able to do business \nwith the U.S. financial system.\n  Nobody disputes what a nuclear Iran would mean to the world. Iran is \ncurrently led by a man who has called for the destruction of our ally \nIsrael. Iran's government funds and supports terrorist organizations \nand regimes all over the Middle East that threaten American allies and \ninterests and American citizens. The Iranian regime is dangerous, it is \nundemocratic, it treats its own people brutally, and it associates \nitself with other countries that do the same thing. North Korea, \nVenezuela, and Syria are allies of Iran. What does that tell us? We can \nsometimes tell a lot about a country by the few friends it has left in \nthe world. Iran bankrolls Hezbollah and has strong financial ties with \nHamas. Remember, this is a country that can't even produce their own \ngasoline, even though they send oil out every day, because they are \nfocusing on nuclear activities when they have so many other needs. So \nthere is no reason to believe a nuclear Iran would not be a threat to \nthe United States.\n  Some of our country partners in that region, such as Turkey, feel \nthey have to develop nuclear programs if Iran does.\n  The Iranian people, many of whom advocate for freedom and \ndemonstrated their bravery in the 2009 uprisings, are not our enemies. \nThis government, however, is our enemy, and this government should not \nbe allowed to have a nuclear weapon.\n  We are going to have to work together to more vigorously persuade \ncountries such as Russia and China that their ties with Iran aren't in \nthe best interest of the world. We have to work to encourage our \nEuropean allies to accept some further risk as they also continue on \nthe path they are on to make these sanctions work better.\n  I understand there is some risk here, but the Senate--which doesn't \nagree on a lot of things--agrees that an unacceptable conclusion to \nwhat is going on in Iran right now would be a nuclear Iran.\n  I urge the President to sign this bill to implement the provisions as \nquickly as possible and to work with other countries in the world to \nsee that we all advance the interests of peace by insisting that Iran \nnot continue on the course it is on.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am very pleased that the Senate is now \ntaking up the nomination of Gershwin Drain to be a judge on the Eastern \nDistrict Court of Michigan.\n  Judge Drain has an impressive legal career. He graduated from the \nUniversity of Michigan Law School and then went on to earn a master's \nof judicial studies degree in 1991. He has served with distinction as a \ntrial judge for over two decades in all three of our trial courts, from \nthe lowest court, which is a so-called district court, to the \nrecorder's court and the circuit court.\n  He has demonstrated a career-long dedication to helping the people \nunderstand how our legal system works. As a longtime columnist for the \nMichigan Chronicle newspaper, he has explained often-complex legal \nissues in language accessible to lay readers, broadening understanding \nof and appreciation for our courts. Beyond his writing, Judge Drain has \nbeen very active in the community, including membership on the \neducation committee of the Southfield Christian School Board.\n  It is important to note that the confirmation of Judge Drain would \nhelp to remedy the judicial emergency in the Eastern District of \nMichigan. Vacancies and caseloads in the Eastern District meet the \nFederal judicial system's definition of an emergency. These judicial \nemergencies lead to delays and, even worse, to the risk of rushed \njudgments that could deprive Americans of the impartial justice that is \nso much a necessary component of our democratic system of government.\n  Judge Drain was asked about some of his past writings and statements \nduring his confirmation hearing at the Judiciary Committee on such \nissues as capital punishment and mandatory minimum sentences. He \nindicated that some of those views--some of them decades ago--have \nevolved. He was candid in saying where they have changed. I don't agree \nwith everything Judge Drain said 20 years ago, but nonetheless, without \nthe slightest hesitancy, Senator Stabenow and I have recommended him to \nbe a judge on the Eastern District Court for Michigan.\n  The test of his fairness has been shown by the fact that he has \nserved with distinction for over two decades on trial courts. Another \ntest of his fairness is how the legal community feels about Judge \nDrain.\n  Senator Stabenow and I have appointed a judicial advisory commission \nto make recommendations to us for the judicial positions we have on the \nFederal district courts. His nomination was the result of an \nexamination by and consideration of a host of people interested in \nbeing Federal court judges in the Eastern District. His competition was \ngreat. There are literally dozens of qualified people whom we \nconsidered--more accurately, our judicial advisory commission \nconsidered--to recommend to the President for nomination. He was one of \nthe persons they recommended. This is a commission we have appointed in \norder to remove the nominees whom we recommend to the President, as \nmuch as we can, from partisan politics and to\n\n[[Page S5931]]\n\nput them instead under consideration to be a judge with great \nobjectivity. We have a broadly based commission. I think the best test \nof his fairness and objectivity and his ability to judge people not \nbased on anything other than the merits of the case in front of him is \ntestified more than anything to by the fact that the broadly based \njudicial advisory commission recommended his nomination to us as one of \nthe people to be considered, and we recommended him to the President.\n  The American Bar Association has also spoken on this issue. He has \nbeen recommended unanimously as qualified for the Federal bench by the \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary of the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  So we are in a position here where we have a judicial emergency on \nthe Eastern District Court. We have a situation where the delays that \nresult deprive Americans of what they are entitled to. We have a \nnominee who has been recommended by a broadly based commission that \nSenator Stabenow and I have appointed. He has been given a unanimous \nrating of ``qualified'' by the American Bar Association. And I think \nhis commitment has been shown not just by his decades of service as a \ntrial judge but by the way he answered the questions in his \nconfirmation hearing. He said--and he has shown this in practice--that \n``my personal beliefs, both past and present, have no bearing on the \ndecisions I make in court.'' The notion that he would insert his own \npersonal judgment in place of the law is contradicted by not just his \ntestimony but by a record of decisions that indicate he abides by the \nconcept of judge as impartial arbiter.\n  Senator Stabenow and I strongly urge our colleagues to confirm Judge \nDrain. We hope that can happen in the next hour.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and ask that the time between now \nand the time for voting be equally divided between the majority and the \nminority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nquorum call will be equally divided.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Politicizing Israel\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise today out of disbelief with \nthe rhetoric coming from Republicans and their Presidential candidate \nconcerning the U.S. relationship with Israel. Frankly, it pains me to \nsee that a political trip to Israel is carried with a message to scare \nthe Israelis that President Obama and this administration are not as \nfast and as complete as they are.\n  I have had numerous trips to Israel. One was the 6-day war in 1967, \nwhen the Israelis had battled with the Egyptians, and I got there \nshortly after the guns stopped shooting. I went to the Sinai Desert and \nwatched the Israelis on guard while the Egyptian soldiers were carrying \nnecessary items, such as water and food, for their people. I was \nreminded then that the Israelis always have to be on guard. They are \nnever free to go about their domestic interests and problems without \nhaving one eye open to make certain the rockets that are being aimed at \nthem aren't going to tear their people apart again, as their people \nhave experienced--the worst of human relations, a blight on mankind \nwhich can never be forgotten, and the Israelis remember it very \nclearly.\n  Unfortunately, Republicans want to use our relationship with Israel \nas a political game, which is terrible for America's national security \nand bad for Israel. The implication that we are weak in our support for \nIsrael is foul play and encourages Israel's enemies to look and say: \nWell, maybe America is not as solid on its support of Israel, because \nMr. Romney, when asked the question about what he would do differently \nwith Israel, says he would do just the opposite of what President Obama \nhas done.\n  We have built a relationship between our countries that is firm and \nunshakable since 1948. To try to clumsily interfere with that is \nshameful. Republicans are distorting the state of U.S.-Israel relations \nfor political gain and sending the wrong signal to the rest of the \nworld.\n  When you listen to the Republicans--especially their Presidential \ncandidate, Mitt Romney discuss Israel, reality is often replaced with \ndistortion and fantasy. Mitt Romney says President Obama has not been a \nfriend of Israel. That couldn't be any further from the truth. When we \nexamine the record, it is clear that President Obama shares my \nconvictions about the enduring bond between Israel and the United \nStates. It is clear that there is no greater friend to Israel than this \nPresident.\n  But you don't have to take my word for it. Here is a chart that \ncarries a message from a distinguished leader in Israel, the Israeli \nDefense Minister, Ehud Barak. He says very clearly:\n\n       [T]his administration under President Obama is doing in \n     regard to our security more than anything that I can remember \n     in the past.\n\n  He made certain that it is quite understood that the relationship \nwith Israel and America is solid and well-balanced. This is coming \nfrom, as I said, a distinguished, decorated military leader. He helped \nplan the historic raid on Entebbe to rescue Israelis who were held in a \ngrounded airplane. He understands Israel's security.\n  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the Obama \nadministration's security policy for Israel ``unprecedented.'' But if \nyou listen to Republicans over here in the United States, they say we \nhave all but abandoned Israel's security. They are encouraging hostile \nneighbors with their misrepresentations. Shame on them.\n  Governor Romney in particular has demonstrated frightening ignorance \nabout Israel and its security needs. The prime example of this behavior \nis the Republican Presidential nominee's complete inability to \narticulate what exactly he would do differently than President Obama. \nWhen asked about what his policy regarding Israel would be, and I have \nto quote him here, he said: ``I'd look at the things the President has \ndone and do the opposite.''\n  What a threatening statement that is. He said he wants to do the \nopposite of President Obama. So let's look at what that would mean. \nObama blocked Palestinian statehood when it was brought up in the U.N. \nHe had a big fight on his hands to keep that from happening. So that \nmeans Romney, as President, would allow Palestinian statehood in the \nU.N. He said he is going to do the opposite.\n  Record high U.S. aid for Israel? Romney is going to do the opposite. \nThat means he has to lower the U.S. aid for Israel.\n  Obama says all options on the table for dealing with Iran are there. \nThat means that Mitt Romney, if President, would only use \n``containment'' of a nuclear Iran as his yardstick for dealing with \nthis incredible problem.\n  So, everybody, beware. Israelis, beware. Don't be taken in by this \nand don't let people in America be taken in by this. They know that \nIsrael is America's best friend.\n  Last September, when the Palestinian Authority aggressively pursued a \nU.N. vote on statehood, that is when President Obama stood strong and \nblocked it. If we are to believe Mitt Romney, however, as indicated \nhere, he would have allowed this unilateral action on Palestinian \nstatehood to proceed.\n  Just a few days ago, President Obama signed into law a new bill that \nwill strengthen U.S. security with Israel even further. But again, if \nwe are to believe Mitt Romney, he would have lowered Israeli aid and \nweakened, thusly, Israel's defenses against the threats it constantly \nfaces.\n  And last, President Obama has stood absolutely firm in his call to \nstop Iran from development of a nuclear weapon. The Obama \nadministration has been clear that all options are on the table to \nprevent Iran from becoming a nuclear threat to its neighbors. President \nObama has put in place the strongest sanctions ever against Iran, \nsanctions that have punished and isolated Iran more than ever before. \nIf we are to believe Mitt Romney here as well, under President Romney \nAmerica's policy toward Iran would be one of accepting a nuclear-armed \nIran that threatens Israel's--and the world's--very existence.\n\n[[Page S5932]]\n\n  The bottom line is this: These are not simple problems and they will \nrequire real leadership to tackle. We cannot play games with America's \nbest friend. Israel continues to be threatened by rockets launched by \nHamas from the Gaza Strip. Iran appears intent on developing a nuclear \nweapon and is the foremost state sponsor of terror. But instead of \napproaching these issues with the careful consideration they deserve, \nthe Republicans seem intent on twisting reality for political gain.\n  We see it on the domestic front, too. The Republican leader said--he \nsaid it here--his party's top priority is to make President Obama a \none-term President, and they are using any pretense they can to \nestablish that. Their top priorities, then, clearly do not include \nhelping everyday Americans by creating jobs, improving our schools, or \nstrengthening our health care system. If we take Mitt Romney at his \nword, they are certainly not aimed at doing what is in Israel's best \ninterest. And when they simply wish for our President's failure, they \nare hurting America's chance for success.\n  When they fail to put forth any ideas of their own, they show \nthemselves to be unfit to govern, unable to lead. Their mission, their \nprimary mission is to bring down the record that President Obama has \nestablished. We have recaptured a lot of jobs. Still, we have a long \nway to go to get our economy in better motion than it is, but everybody \nknows we are working on it. We have seen remarkable growth in jobs in \nthe automobile industry, which looked as though it might have ended up \nbeing unable to function in this country of ours.\n  The whole world knows that America's leadership depends on its \ndomestic strength and not on casual political rhetoric that challenges \nAmerica's loyalty to its friends.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise today to strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support the nomination of an outstanding judge, Gershwin \nDrain, to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \nMichigan. We will have an opportunity to vote in a few minutes. Senator \nLevin and I join together in the strongest possible recommendation to \nour colleagues on this nomination. I have known Judge Drain for many \nyears. I can tell you he is a very impressive individual with a long \nrecord of excellent public service. He has served in the district \ncourt, the Detroit Recorder's Court and the Wayne County Circuit Court.\n  He is active in the community. When I am in the community and have \nthe opportunity to be at events that are important for people, for \nfamilies, for communities, for children, for economic development, \nJudge Drain is always there, supporting the efforts of Detroit and of \nMichigan.\n  He is of course dedicated to his incredible family, who I know is \nvery proud of him, as we are. But don't take my word for it. The \nAmerican Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nunanimously rated Judge Drain ``qualified'' to serve on the District \nCourt. He was named a ``Man Of Excellence'' by the Michigan Chronicle \nnewspaper, and the Detroit News named him ``Michiganian of the Year''--\nboth very prestigious recognitions in Michigan.\n  This is a very important judgeship that has been vacant for more than \n2 years. It is important for people in Michigan and throughout the \neastern district to be able to have the full measure of justice they \nexpect and deserve when coming before the court. It is very important \nthat we fill this vacancy.\n  I am appreciative and proud that the President of the United States \nhas nominated him. I appreciate the support of the Judiciary Committee \nin bringing this nomination forward and the agreement to allow us to \nvote on this nominee.\n  Judge Drain has the qualifications, the experience, and the \ntemperament for this very important position. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support his nomination and to vote yes when it comes \nbefore us in the next few minutes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Gershwin A. Drain, of Michigan, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Eastern District of Michigan?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion \nto reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, that the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nS. 3326, a trade package that includes legislation sponsored by myself \nand Senator McConnell to renew the import ban on Burma for another \nyear.\n  I have been involved in the struggle for freedom and democracy in \nBurma for 15 years.\n  In 1997, former Senator William Cohen and I authored legislation \nrequiring the President to ban new U.S. investment in Burma if he \ndetermined that the Government of Burma had physically harmed, \nrearrested or exiled Aung San Suu Kyi or committed large-scale \nrepression or violence against the democratic opposition.\n  President Clinton issued the ban in a 1997 Executive order.\n  In 2003, after the regime attempted to assassinate Aung San Suu Kyi, \nSenator McConnell and I introduced the Burmese Freedom and Democracy \nAct of 2003, which placed a complete ban on imports from Burma. It \nallowed that ban to be renewed one year at a time.\n  It was signed into law and has been renewed annually since then.\n  It expired on July 26 which is why this legislation is before us \ntoday.\n  In past years, the debate on renewing the import ban on Burma has \nfocused\n\n[[Page S5933]]\n\non more than two decades of violence, oppression, and human rights \nabuses by the ruling Burmese military.\n  They annulled the last free parliamentary elections won by Aung San \nSuu Kyi and the National League for Democracy.\n  They kept Suu Kyi in prison or under house arrest, detained hundreds \nof political prisoners, and ignored democracy, human rights, and the \nrule of law.\n  They drafted a new constitution that maintained the military's grip \non power and prevented Suu Kyi and her party from participating in the \npolitical process.\n  But, I am pleased to report that this year is different. We have seen \nsome remarkable changes in Burma over the past year which appear to \nhave put Burma on the path of reform and rejoining the international \ncommunity.\n  Hundreds of political prisoners have been released.\n  New legislation broadening the rights of political and civic \nassociations has been enacted; and negotiations with ethnic minority \ngroups have begun and some cease-fires have taken effect.\n  In addition, Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy, NLD, were \nallowed to compete in by-elections for 45 open seats in the new \nparliament in April 2012.\n  Suu Kyi and the NLD won 43 of the 44 seats they contested.\n  For those of us who have been inspired by her courage, her dedication \nto peace and her tireless efforts for freedom and democracy, it was a \nthrilling and deeply moving event. Years of sacrifice and hard work had \nshown results--the people of Burma had spoken with a clear voice in \nsupport of freedom and democracy.\n  The United States has responded to this reform process in a number of \nways.\n  Secretary Clinton traveled to Burma last December and met with Suu \nKyi and President Thein Sein.\n  The United States and Burma resumed full diplomatic relations, with \nAmbassador Derek Mitchell becoming the first U.S. ambassador to Burma \nin 22 years.\n  Earlier this month, the administration announced that it was \nsuspending U.S. sanctions on providing financial services to Burma and \ninvesting in Burma.\n  I supported these actions. It is entirely appropriate to acknowledge \nthe steps Burma has already taken and encourage additional reforms.\n  Some may ask then: why stop there? Given the reforms, why renew the \nimport ban?\n  The fact of the matter is, the reforms are not irreversible and the \nGovernment of Burma still needs to do more to respond to the legitimate \nconcerns of the people of Burma and the international community.\n  First, it must address the dominant role of the military in Burma \nunder the new constitution.\n  The military is guaranteed 25 percent of the seats without elections \nand remains independent of any civilian oversight.\n  In addition, the commander in chief of the military has the authority \nto dismiss the government and rule the country under martial law.\n  It goes without saying that such powers are incompatible with a truly \ndemocratic government.\n  Second, Burma must stop all violence against ethnic minorities. I am \nparticularly concerned about reports that the Burmese military is \ncontinuing attacks in Kachin State, displacing thousands of civilians \nand killing others.\n  Third, the government must release all political prisoners.\n  I applaud the decision of the Government of Burma to release hundreds \nof political prisoners, including a number of high-profile democracy \nand human rights activists.\n  Yet, according to the State Department, hundreds more remain in \ndetention.\n  Unfortunately, the Government of Burma maintains there are no more \npolitical prisoners. We must keep the pressure on Burma until all \ndemocracy and human rights activists are free and able to resume their \nlives and careers.\n  I believe that renewing this ban will help keep Burma on the path to \nfull democratization and national reconciliation and support the work \nof Suu Kyi, the democratic opposition, and the reformists in the ruling \ngovernment.\n  It will give the administration additional leverage to convince Burma \nto stay on the right path.\n  And the administration will still have the authority to waive or \nsuspend the import ban--as it has suspended sanctions on investment and \nfinancial services--if the Government of Burma took the appropriate \nactions.\n  If we do not renew the import ban, however, and Burma backslides on \nreform and democratization, we would have to pass a new law to reimpose \nthe ban.\n  By passing this legislation, we ensure that the administration has \nthe flexibility it needs to respond to events in Burma as it as done so \nwith financial services and investment.\n  Suu Kyi herself has argued that ``sanctions have been effective in \npersuading the government to go for change.''\n  I think renewing the import ban will push it to go further.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be dispensed with.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are considering this morning--the AGOA-\nCAFTA-Burma sanctions package--has several parts, but I want to focus \non the very real impact that one provision will have on jobs in my home \nState of North Carolina.\n  This provision would make non-controversial technical fixes to the \nDominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement.\n  When the DR-CAFTA was first negotiated nearly a decade ago, the \nintention of all the parties was to preserve the benefits of tariff \nreductions on yarn for the countries at the negotiating table.\n  That is how the United States has traditionally negotiated the \ntextile chapter of its free-trade agreements.\n  But when the DR-CAFTA was agreed to in 2005 an out-of-date definition \nfor sewing thread was used that inadvertently allowed non-CAFTA nations \nto export a certain kind of yarn into the CAFTA region duty free.\n  Textile manufacturers in countries like China began exploiting this \nloophole to substitute their yarn for U.S.-produced yarn, and this \naction severely damaged textile manufacturers in North Carolina and the \nrest of the United States.\n  Let me give you one example.\n  Unifi is a textile manufacturing company headquartered in Greensboro, \nNC, with plants throughout the State. Half of their employees tied to \nthe thread business have lost their jobs since 2006 when CAFTA took \neffect and the yarn loophole was exposed.\n  Unifi is not alone.\n  There are nearly 2,000 jobs in the United States that are directly \naffected by the exploitation of this loophole.\n  Creating jobs in North Carolina is my No. 1 priority.\n  Now I am proud of North Carolina's historic textile industry. It \ncontinues to innovate its way through advanced manufacturing and \ninvestments in research and development.\n  But times are tough enough as it is for the American textile \nindustry.\n  We simply cannot afford to lose good-paying manufacturing jobs in \nNorth Carolina's textile industry because foreign countries are \nexploiting drafting errors and Congress delays fixing them.\n  We should be looking for ways to allow our textile companies to \ncompete with their foreign counterparts on a level playing field. This \nbill is a step in that direction.\n  The corrections in this bill were brought to the attention of other \nCAFTA countries by the United States, were agreed to in February 2011 \nand have since been enacted by all the other CAFTA countries.\n  I am glad that we overcame this hurdle to ally ensure the integrity \nof the textile provisions of the Central American Free Trade Agreement.\n  This fix is long overdue.\n  I want to express my deep appreciation to Chairman Baucus for his \nleadership in moving this bill forward.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud Senate passage \nof the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. The measure extends for \nanother year the import ban with regard to Burma.\n  I would like to clarify two issues that have prompted some confusion \nregarding this legislation.\n\n[[Page S5934]]\n\n  First, the measure we are passing renews import sanctions for 1 year \nand 1 year only. I emphasize this point because it has been misreported \nthat this bill renews sanctions for 3 years. That is not accurate; the \nbill renews them only for 1.\n  Second, enactment of this bill does not overturn the easing of \ninvestment and financial sanctions that the administration unveiled \nearlier this year. In fact, this year's bill, as in years past, \nprovides authority for the administration to waive the import sanctions \nshould it determine that certain conditions have been met. Before \ndeciding whether to waive import sanctions, I would strongly urge the \nadministration not only to consider the changes occurring within Burma \nbut also to consult closely with Nobel Peace Prize laureate Daw Aung \nSan Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy.\n  This year's legislation comes at a time of historic changes on the \nground in Burma. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, long a political prisoner in the \ncountry, is now a member of Parliament. The National League for \nDemocracy, once a banned organization, now actively participates in the \npolitical life of Burma.\n  For these reasons, the administration has taken a number of actions \nto acknowledge the impressive reforms that President Thein Sein and his \ngovernment have instituted. The United States has responded by sending \nan ambassador to Burma for the first time in two decades. The \nadministration also largely waived the investment ban and financial \nrestrictions, permitting U.S. businesses to begin investing again in \nBurma.\n  For my part, I want to see investment in the ``new'' Burma. I want to \nsee Burmese reformers empowered accordingly, and I want to see greater \neconomic development come to this underdeveloped country. And, frankly, \nduring challenging economic times here at home, I want American \nbusinesses to be able to compete in Burma now that sanctions have been \nremoved by other Western governments.\n  That said, high standards for accountability in American business \noperations in Burma are important going forward. This seems \nparticularly acute with regard to transactions involving Myanmar Oil \nand Gas Enterprise. I would urge U.S. businesses to show the Burmese \npeople and the world the positive effects that American investment \nprompts. I am confident that, as they do elsewhere around the world, \nU.S. enterprises in Burma will set the standard for ethical and \ntransparent business practices and lead the way for others to follow.\n  I would be remiss if I did not note the significant challenges in \nBurma that lie ahead. Ongoing violence in Kachin State and sectarian \ntensions in Arakan State reflect the long-term challenge of national \nreconciliation. Hundreds of political prisoners remain behind bars. The \nconstitution still has a number of undemocratic elements. And the \nregime's relationship with North Korea, especially when it comes to \narms sales with Pyongyang, remains an issue of grave concern.\n  Even with these challenges, however, I am greatly encouraged by the \nprogress that has been made over the past year and a half in Burma. My \ncolleagues and I in the Senate will continue to monitor developments in \nthe country with great interest and with hope for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5934-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY AMENDMENT ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, at this late hour of our session, until \nSeptember, I think it is important we continue to pay attention to and \nbe concerned about the situation in Syria. Today, Kofi Annan, the \nformer Secretary General of the United Nations, announced the failure \nof his mission. If there is anything about the conflict in Syria that \ndid not surprise most of us, it is the fact that Kofi Annan's mission \nwas a failure. It was doomed to failure from the beginning. It was \nbased on the premise that somehow Bashar Assad would be motivated to \nstop the massacre of his people. It was motivated on the premise that \nsomehow U.N. observers could come in and stand between the two fighting \nforces but totally ignore the fundamentals of this conflict.\n  The fundamentals of this conflict are simple: It is the Syrian people \nattempting to assert their God-given rights and throw off the yoke of a \nbrutal and unconscionable dictator, and on the other side of the \nequation Bashar Assad's commitment to doing whatever is necessary, \nincluding massacring now as many as 20,000 of his own people in his \ndesperate quest to remain in power in Syria.\n  Let's not forget that one of the reasons we have seen heavy Russian \ninvolvement in the form of supplies of arms and equipment and continued \nRussian veto of resolutions in the U.N. Security Council that would \nhave imposed even the mildest sanctions on Bashar Assad is what seems \nto be some kind of nostalgia on President Putin's part for the old \nRussian empire and the maintenance of their one base on the \nMediterranean port in Syria.\n  The Russians' behavior in this throughout, as they continue to block \none resolution after another, of course, is revealing of the true \nnature of the Putin regime, the autocracy and kleptocracy that has now \nasserted its full power and weight in Russia. In addition to that, of \ncourse, we have the Chinese joining Russia in their sustaining of \nvetoes in the U.N. Security Council.\n  It is hard to overstate the damage these actions by Russia and China \nhave done to them, but it is also hard to overstate the damage that has \nbeen done to the Syrian people, with Russian equipment being supplied \nconstantly, Iranian boots on the ground helping to set up torture \ncenters, and continued encouragement of Bashar Assad to remain in \npower.\n  I am not here to again critique this administration's abysmal record, \nbut isn't it ludicrous--isn't it ludicrous--to base your entire policy \ntoward Syria on the belief that somehow the Russians would convince \nBashar Assad that he should leave Syria? Isn't it foolish to somehow \nbase your policy and nonintervention on the belief that somehow the \nmission of a former Secretary General of the United Nations would \nsucceed when it was clear the Syrian people were not going to be \nsatisfied with the continuous barbarous regime of Bashar Assad, and \ncertainly Bashar Assad was not going to give up?\n  It is clear through Iran's actions that its rulers are playing for \nkeeps in Syria, and they will stop at nothing to prevent the fall of \nBashar Assad. Why are the Iranians so committed and involved? The words \nof General Mattis, the Commander of U.S. Central Command, described it \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee when he said that the fall \nof Bashar Assad would be ``the greatest blow to Iran in 25 years.''\n  So the United States does have more than a humanitarian interest in \nwhat\n\n[[Page S5935]]\n\nhappens in Syria. In fact, if Bashar Assad falls, Syria loses its \nposition as far as Lebanon is concerned, the Lebanese people have an \nopportunity to lose their client status of Syria, and Hezbollah absorbs \na serious blow because they lose their patron in Syria.\n  So the fall of Bashar Assad is not only a victory for the force of \ndemocracy and freedom, but it would also mean a significant--a \nsignificant--advance in our interest in the region as our major concern \ntoday remains the Iranian continued development of nuclear weapons. The \npath they are on sooner or later may provoke an attack by either Israel \nand/or the United States of America.\n  I say that with some authority because the President of the United \nStates, President Obama, has appropriately said it would be \nunacceptable for Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.\n  I have been, along with my friend Joe Lieberman, to a refugee camp in \nTurkey on the Syrian border. There have now been thousands and \nthousands of additional residents there who have had to flee the \nbrutality of Bashar Assad inside Syria. I met young men who were \nfreshly wounded. I met defectors from the Syrian Army who described how \nthey are instructed--they are instructed and indoctrinated to rape, to \nmurder, and to torture. I met individuals who have watched their \nchildren murdered before their very eyes, and I met a group of young \nwomen who had been gang raped.\n  I wish every American could have had the opportunity to see these \npeople whose only reason--only reason--to rise up is because they want \nto achieve their God-given rights.\n  What is going on now in Syria is very important, because the longer \nthe conflict drags out, the more jihadists and foreign fighters and \nextremists come into the fight.\n  Every day that goes by that Bashar al-Assad is in power is another \nday which will make it more difficult once he leaves--and he will \nleave, but the question is when--but how difficult it will be for Syria \nto knit their country back together and become a functioning democracy.\n  There is also a very serious issue of chemical weapons. It is well \nknown, and for the first time recently, the Syrian government \nacknowledged that they have stores of chemical weapons. These chemical \nweapons pose a great threat in a very unstable region. There are \nvarious scenarios that we should be deeply concerned about. One of them \nis that if chemical weapons fall into the hands or shift to Hezbollah, \nwhat kind of a threat does that pose to Israel? I remind my colleagues \nthat Hezbollah has committed to the extinction of the State of Israel, \nas has Iran.\n  So what happens with these chemical weapons is a very important \nissue. The more chaos and the more disorder and the more frustration \nand anger that is displayed on both sides, the more likely it is that \nthese chemical weapons can fall into the wrong hands, and they are not \nlocated in one place.\n  So there is a great deal at stake. There is one thing I hope we could \nall agree on; that is, the longer it lasts, the greater the danger, the \ngreater the chaos, the more killing, the more rapes, the more murders.\n  Today we have information that the President of the United States has \nmade a decision--and I am not sure of the details because I only know \nthe media reports, but the best way to describe, as I understand it \nis--to facilitate the flow of weapons to the Syrian resistance \nfighters. I don't know how that is done. I don't know how that is \naccomplished, but I do know this, that they also need a sanctuary. They \nneed an area that is secure, the same way the Libyans needed Benghazi, \nso they can train, equip, and establish a government.\n  The resistance, as we all know, is fractured. The best way to join \nthem together is to have a central council they can answer to and that \ncan make sure the weapons go to the right place. That is a vital \ncomponent that should happen sooner rather than later.\n  None of us seeks to put American boots on the ground for a whole lot \nof reasons. I know the American people are war-weary and focused on our \nown domestic challenges. Both of these sentiments are genuine and \nlegitimate. But what has unfolded in Syria over the past 1\\1/2\\ years \nnot only offends the conscience of our country, it also poses real and \ngrowing risk to our national security interests and to those of some of \nour closest allies.\n  I don't believe Bashar Assad can last, even under current conditions. \nBut I do know for sure America's national security interests in Syria \nwill remain long after Assad's fall. In many ways, they could become \nmore precarious because of our inaction, because of the failure of the \nPresident of the United States to speak up for these people. Why \ndoesn't the President of the United States speak up for them? I have \nnever understood that.\n  Because of our inaction, the people who will inherit the country in \nSyria will remember that in their hour of greatest need, when the \nbravest among them were fighting and dying for their freedom in a \ngrossly unfair fight, America stood idly by and refused to help.\n  As the sister of a fallen opposition fighter in Syria recently \nremarked, ``When we control Syria, we won't forget that you forgot \nabout us.'' Millions of her fellow Syrians share that sentiment.\n  If we continue on this path of inaction, mass atrocities will \ncontinue to unfold in Aleppo and other places in Syria. We have the \npower to prevent this needless death and advance our strategic \ninterests in the Middle East at the same time. If we don't, if we \ncontinue this shameful behavior, our failure of leadership will haunt \nus for a long period to come.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             THE DREAM ACT\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I hope that many of my colleagues, in \nreturning to their home States for the August recess, may have an \nopportunity to attend a citizenship ceremony. I do so regularly when I \ngo home. During the July 4th break, I had the wonderful opportunity to \nattend several. These ceremonies can occur in courthouses or in \ntownhalls. They swear the oath and are newly made citizens. They are \naccompanied by families and friends. It is a uniquely joyous and proud \nday in their lives. Many have waited years to become U.S. citizens, and \nthey do so not only willingly but joyfully. There are tears in many of \ntheir eyes, and there are tears in my eyes as well because it recalls \nto me the day many years ago, decades ago, when I first attended such a \nceremony, which in turn recalls for me the stories of my own relatives \nwho came to this country from other shores. So did many of the parents \nor grandparents--forebears of we who serve in this body.\n  The meaning of citizenship of the United States and the value of \nthose rights that come with citizenship are often forgotten or \nunappreciated by many of us who were born in this country. We \nsometimes, unfortunately, take them for granted. But there is a \ntremendous value placed on those rights and liberties by people who \ncome to the United States.\n  Today I wish to talk about people who come to the United States or \nmore precisely are brought to the United States as young people, as \ninfants or children, many under 4 or 5 years old, and this country \nbecomes the only one they have known. The history of this country is \ntheir history. They may not even know the language of the country from \nwhich they came. The language of this country is the only one they \nknow, and they have no memories or scant recollections of the countries \nwhere they were born. These young people are here, and they were \nbrought here perhaps by parents who came illegally, but they are here \nthrough no fault of their own.\n  Many of them have achieved remarkably and have contributed \nextraordinarily. Their promise of future achievement is staggering, \nextraordinarily impressive in its potential contribution to the lives \nof their communities--to teaching, to giving back to their \ncommunities--their contributions in terms of scientific or literary \naccomplishments.\n  One such young person is Muller Gomes. I am going to tell his story \ntoday much as Senator Durbin has told\n\n[[Page S5936]]\n\nother stories on the floor of this Chamber in his steadfast and \nenergetic advocacy of a measure called the DREAM Act. I want to follow \nhim in engaging this Chamber in this effort. I thank distinguished \ncolleagues, such as Senator Durbin, who have been tireless advocates \nfor the passage of the DREAM Act.\n  The DREAM Act, called by its full name, ``Development, Relief, and \nEducation for Alien Minors,'' should be a top priority for this \nCongress. States such as Connecticut have passed their versions of it, \nbut a national and uniform effort is essential. Much as we hope and I \nsupport that we will have comprehensive immigration law reform, I also \nbelieve the DREAM Act is an idea whose time has more than come. We \nshould be adopting it as soon as possible in this Chamber to provide \nthe kind of certainty and promise that is so important to young people \nlike Muller Gomes.\n  Muller Gomes was brought to this country from Brazil when he was 5 \nyears old. He came with a tourist visa in 1995. The tourist visa \nexpired a year later, in 1996, so he has been here without proper \ndocumentation since then. He has been through the Bridgeport public \nschools, Central High School in Bridgeport, and then he went to \nFairfield University.\n  This is this young man at his graduation from Fairfield University--\nhis graduation summa cum laude. He was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, Pi \nMu Epsilon and Sigma Xi. He won the American Chemical Society \nOutstanding Senior Chemistry Major Award, and he has been accepted at \nthe University of California at Berkeley's physical chemistry Ph.D. \nprogram.\n  All that he lacked was a student visa to pursue his studies at UC \nBerkeley. He lacks a student visa, and if he returns to Brazil to seek \none, he will be denied it because he has been undocumented in this \ncountry.\n  If there were ever a catch-22, Muller Gomes is its poster child under \nour current immigration law. Under current law, that student visa will \nbe denied him. Fortunately, on June 15, 2012, the Obama administration \nmade a very strong statement of support for young men and women like \nMuller Gomes. They issued a regulation or a directive that will permit \nhim to remain in this country. That directive is lacking in a number of \nrespects compared to the DREAM Act. It will be temporary--only for a \ncouple of years. It is not a path to citizenship, as the DREAM Act \nwould provide. It does not make him eligible for the kind of financial \naid he would need. Most importantly, it requires him to go through the \nstress and uncertainty of applying again for deferred action. It is \nonly a deferral of deportation.\n  So the DREAM Act remains a vitally important measure for literally \nthousands of young people--between 11,000 and 20,000 young people \nliving in Connecticut who would benefit from the DREAM Act and 2 \nmillion young people nationwide. Under the DREAM Act, they would comply \nwith rigorous standards and requirements--lack of criminal record, \ncriminal history, and they would in effect be provided this pathway to \ncitizenship because of their promise and their potential for \ncontributing to this country--in Muller Gomes' case, the potential for \ncontributing to this country as a scientist who would make new \ndiscoveries, perhaps breakthrough discoveries that would benefit the \nentire country. We laud young people like him who are motivated and \nsmart and dedicated to this country.\n  I am committed to comprehensive immigration reform achieved through \nbipartisan congressional action. That ought to be one of our immediate \ngoals so that young people like Muller Gomes, brought to this country \nas children through no fault of their own, will have the opportunity to \ncontribute to this Nation and be part of their communities, as the \nDREAM Act would provide and as comprehensive immigration reform would \nalso achieve. But in the meantime, let's pass the DREAM Act so these \ndreamers, such as Muller Gomes, will have the basic guarantees and \ncertainty that they can remain in this country and that the promise of \nthe greatest Nation in the history of the world will be truly theirs \nand irrevocable. This country will be theirs regardless of religion, \nrace, gender, or any of the arbitrary labels we say consistently and \nconstantly should have no place in our judgments about human beings.\n\n  Our Nation will be better because Muller Gomes will be with us and \nour Nation would be better still if the millions like him have the \nsecurity and certainty of a path toward citizenship--a path that will \nbenefit them and benefit the greatest Nation in the history of the \nworld.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cyber Security\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, first, let me express my disappointment \nthat my colleagues on the other side of the aisle blocked consideration \nof vitally important cyber security legislation. The Secretary of \nDefense, when asked about a potential threat to the United States, \ndeclares emphatically that his biggest concern is that the next Pearl \nHarbor will be a cyber attack upon the United States and if we cannot \nat least fully debate, amend the bill, and pass the bill, then I think \nwe are not performing up to the expectations of the American people.\n  So I am very disappointed that we were not able to complete this \nlegislation in a timely fashion this week and give the necessary tools \nto our national leadership to protect the country against potential \ncyber threats.\n\n\n                     Federal Housing Finance Agency\n\n  Having said that, I also want to rise today to express my profound \ndisappointment in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's decision to \nprohibit the use of principal reduction by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nas one more tool to avoid foreclosure under the HAMP Principal \nReduction Alternative (PRA).\n  As conservator, the acting FHFA Director, Mr. DeMarco, has a duty to \nnot only carry on the business of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac but \nalso to preserve and conserve the assets of both, which FHFA has stated \nrepeatedly requires them to minimize losses. At the same time he has \nother statutory responsibilities. Under section 110 of the Emergency \nEconomic Stabilization Act, there is a requirement that FHFA \n``implement a plan that seeks to maximize assistance for homeowners and \nuse its authority to encourage the servicers of the underlying \nmortgages, and considering net present value to the taxpayer, to take \nadvantage of . . . available programs to minimize foreclosures.''\n  So there is a clear statutory direction to do all that he can to \nminimize foreclosures while he is also balancing the portfolio and \nminimizing losses to Fannie and Freddie.\n  To boil all of this down, FHFA has to minimize Freddie Mac and Fannie \nMae losses, and pursuant to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, \nwhich passed this Chamber on a strong bipartisan vote of 74 to 25, this \nrequirement to protect homes from foreclosure or the people from the \nthreat of foreclosure is a strong bipartisan objective. FHFA was \ndirected by Congress to throw its weight in favor of avoiding \nforeclosures, especially in those instances in which a policy decision \nmay be a close call. I believe that is the plain meaning of ``maximize \nassistance'' to ``minimize foreclosures.'' Maximize assistance--not \nprovide assistance but to maximize assistance to avoid foreclosure. I \nwould further note that section 110 of the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act explicitly permits ``reduction of loan principal.''\n  So we consciously gave the Acting FHFA Director the specific tool of \nprincipal reduction and the specific directive to maximize assistance \nto minimize foreclosure. We did that in the context of the overall \nmission to try to minimize losses of the Fannie and Freddie portfolio. \nBut to turn essentially a blind eye to the thousands of Americans who \nare facing foreclosure is to ignore a vital responsibility and a vital \nauthority which he has been given.\n\n[[Page S5937]]\n\n  After reading FHFA's July 31, 2012, letter to Members of Congress, my \nimpression is that FHFA has done exactly the opposite of what we have \nasked them to do. Indeed, the letter contradicts itself in arriving at \nits conclusion. FHFA states in one part of the letter that it will not \nallow principal reductions under the PRA program. But in another part \nof the letter, FHFA goes on to write,\n\n       Short sales and deeds-in-lieu, which the Enterprises offer, \n     result in principal forgiveness as part of exiting the house.\n\n  In other words, it seems, in their view, principal reduction is \nacceptable in some cases, especially if the owners leave their home.\n  Now, I think there are thousands of Americans who are facing huge \nchallenges to stay in their homes. It is ironic that FHFA will reduce \nthe principal, only after the person actually loses their home. But if \nit, through PRA, allows a person to keep their home, and avoid \nforeclosure, then FHFA will not do it.\n  In the same letter FHFA also states that:\n\n       Forgiving debt owed pursuant to a lawful, valid contract \n     risks creating a longer-term view by investors that the \n     mortgage contract is less secure than ever before. Longer-\n     term, this view could lead to higher mortgage rates, a \n     constriction in mortgage credit lending or both, outcomes \n     that would be inconsistent with FHFA's mandate to promote \n     stability and liquidity in mortgage markets and access to \n     mortgage credit.\n\n  So forgiving debt is inconsistent with FHFA's mandate, but FHFA \nadmits to allowing principal forgiveness in certain cases? Again, let \nme repeat their own words.\n\n       Short sales and deeds-in-lieu, which the Enterprises offer, \n     result in principal forgiveness as part of exiting the house.\n\n  But FHFA also states:\n\n       Forgiving debt owed pursuant to a lawful, valid contract \n     risks creating a longer-term view by investors that the \n     mortgage contract is less secure than ever before.\n\n  Well, how does this make any real common sense? We will forgive \nprincipal if homeowners are going to get kicked out of their house, \nwhich presumably upsets the long-term perspective of investors and \nbonds that support those mortgages. But if homeowners are staying in \ntheir house, we will not reduce principal through PRA.\n  Turning to the point of moral hazard, which is implicit in all that \nhas been discussed by FHFA, and given that FHFA has blessed principal \nforgiveness in these two instances of short sales and deeds-in-lieu, \nand additionally permits principal reduction as part of the Hardest Hit \nFund, which also utilizes Treasury incentives, I can only assume that \nFHFA must have found a way to control and avoid moral hazard when they \nwant to and use moral hazard as an excuse when they don't want to do \nsomething.\n  Either it is an issue that must be consistently addressed, which they \ndon't do, or it is an after-the-fact rationalization for failure to \npursue a policy which for other reasons they don't want to do.\n  Having made these points, let me give FHFA the benefit of the doubt \nhere and assume for the sake of argument that FHFA wants greater \ncertainty and assurances. I think they said as much when they wrote:\n\n       FHFA weighed these potential benefits and costs, \n     recognizing the inherent uncertainties associated with these \n     estimates, and concluded that the potential benefit was too \n     small and uncertain relative to known and unknown costs and \n     risks to warrant the dedication of additional taxpayer \n     resources to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to implement HAMP \n     PRA.\n\n  I have heard a couple of my Republican colleagues talk about how what \nFHFA should be doing is what the private sector is doing, looking to \nthe business men and women, who protect their shareholders. In fact, I \nthink that is a good place to look for some direction. But what is the \nprivate sector doing when it comes to principal reduction?\n  For one, Laurie Goodman, Senior Managing Director at the Amherst \nSecurities Group, a broker/dealer specializing in the trading of \nresidential and commercial mortgage-backed securities that performs \nextensive, data-intensive studies to keep its clients informed of \ncritical trends in the residential mortgage-backed securities market, \nhas testified before the Senate Banking Committee that principal \nreductions are, in her words, ``the most effective type of \nmodification.''\n  Next, John DiIorio of 1st Alliance Lending, whose clients consist of \nmajor banks, investment banks, and sophisticated financial \ncounterparties, has stated that his clients are in favor of principal \nreduction ``not out of a sense of charity, but because they believe it \nis in their best financial interest to do so.'' In other words, there \nis a very strong business case for principal reduction--a business \nargument, apparently, that FHFA has ignored or totally rejected.\n  Finally, when we look at the newest data from the Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency, we see that banks have granted principal \nreductions on 28.9 percent of the loans they hold, which is up from \n11.5 percent a year earlier. By the way, they also have lower default \nrates than Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  So when we look at the private sector, what they are doing appears to \nbe different; indeed, perhaps the opposite, of what FHFA is doing. They \nare going through their portfolios and, in appropriate ways, reducing \nprincipal not because they want to provide charity, but because it is \nthe best way to preserve their portfolio and generate value for their \nshareholders. That is what their business is doing. In fact, they have \na fiduciary duty to do that.\n  So it would appear the private sector seems not only completely \ncomfortable with principal reduction, but they, in fact, are doing it \nbecause it is good for their bottom line.\n  Yet, we have FHFA essentially saying, well, we can't do PRA. I think \nthis is one of those examples where they just don't get it, frankly.\n  If principal reduction provides greater value than foreclosure to a \nprivate investor, such as these banks I cited, and on top of that keeps \na family in their home, aren't these the types of decisions we should \nmake and we should support?\n  The real moral hazard, if there is one, is that FHFA is inexplicably \nchoosing not to use every available tool, especially one the private \nsector is already using extensively to help homeowners and investors \ntime and time again.\n  There are people in this Chamber on both sides of the aisle who say \nwe have to run this government more like a business. Well, guess what. \nThe businesses are using principal reduction, and FHFA is saying they \ncan't do PRA. This is shortsighted and it is wrong. I urge the FHFA to \nreconsider and, in the meanwhile, I am going to continue my efforts to \ndo what I can do to help these homeowners who are facing foreclosure.\n  It is very difficult--and I know it is for my colleague from New \nHampshire and my colleague from Utah--to go back home and see a \nhomeowner who is struggling with a mortgage that might be 5 percent or \n6 percent, knowing that banks can borrow at less than 1 percent, and \nthis homeowner has difficulty getting access to a better mortgage rate \nbecause he or she is underwater.\n  I hope we adopt some of the smarter business practices around here \nand that FHFA leads the way, and I am going to do all I can to ensure \nthat outcome becomes a reality.\n  With that, I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague from Utah for \nhis consideration in letting me speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague. He is always gracious and a very \nfine man, and I enjoy serving with him very much.\n\n\n                             Cyber Security\n\n  Mr. President, I was very disappointed that we were not able to \nproceed with the cyber security bill today. This side had the votes \nagainst cloture. The reason is because the Senate is not being run as \nan open Senate anymore.\n  This is such an important bill. It is not some itty-bitty bill that \nwe can call up and foreclose any amendments. In fact, most bills are \nnot that are brought to the floor. I think if it were the other way \naround and the Republicans were in the majority and they started doing \nwhat we have been going through lately--I don't blame Senator Reid for \nthis; I know it comes from his caucus. If we were pulling the same type \nof thing, I have to say the Democrats would be in orbit.\n  Usually in the Senate we never build a procedural pyramid until after \nthere has been a reasonable time for debate\n\n[[Page S5938]]\n\nand open amendments. That is the way it is usually done. In recent \nmonths--frankly, over the last few years--they call up a bill, file \ncloture as though we are filibustering when we are not, and then tie up \nthe parliamentary tree so we can't have amendments, in the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world, supposedly. That has been very \nirritating to people on our side.\n  I would caution my friends on the other side: This is getting to the \npoint where it is becoming a matter of grave concern to everybody and \nirritation to everybody as well. I think we ought to get back to being \nthe Senate that we all know works better if we respect both sides and \ntheir ability to come up and say what they need to and bring the \namendments up that they feel are good amendments.\n\n  But be that as it may, that is the way it is right now. We have to do \nthe cyber security bill. Everybody knows that. The fact that cloture \nwas not invoked does not mean we shouldn't return to that bill and put \nthe time into it and make sure we resolve the conflicts that have \narisen, some of which are very important suggestions, and allow the \ntype of proceeding that the Senate has always been known for.\n\n\n                            Value-Added Tax\n\n  I wish to change the subject. Recently, there has been some \ncommentary about the lack of substance in our political debates. This \nconcern, that Washington has failed to confront our deepest political \nchallenges, which are, in large part, fiscal challenges, is not without \nsome merit. But I would add one caveat to this analysis. It is not for \nlack of trying on the part of Republicans to have a grownup debate \nabout our Nation's fiscal and economic future. Republicans are putting \nforward real ideas about tax and entitlement reform with real numbers \nattached. However, I would submit that only one side has put a team on \nthe field for this debate. When it comes to putting forward solutions \nto our nearly $16 trillion of debt and our archaic Tax Code, the \nPresident and his Democratic allies have largely stayed on the \nsideline. Instead of offering up bold proposals to bring down the debt \nthat has ballooned, given the President's commitment to ever larger and \nmore active government, they have determined to give the American \npeople talking points that attack the wealthy and successful small \nbusinesses in the name of equality.\n  Given the fiscal cliff threatening America's families and businesses, \nthis decision to put politics above solutions is madness. But there is \na method to it. The fact is the President and his liberal allies are \nnot able to put forward serious solutions because they are between a \nrock and a hard place. The rock is their base--a liberal minority that \nrefuses any meaningful reforms of the spending programs that are \nbankrupting our country. The hard place is the vast majority of the \nAmerican people who flatly object to the massive tax increases, and \nespecially those 940,000 small businesses that would be hit the \nhardest. Of course, those massive tax increases would be required to \nfinance on a permanent basis the President's commitment to larger \ngovernment.\n  The bottom line is that the President is unable to come clean. He \ncannot tell the American people what the true tax bill would be for his \nexpansion of government. He suggests that our books can be balanced by \ntaxing the rich. We all know that is poppycock. Hence his commitment to \nthe Buffett tax and other redistributionist schemes that have been \npursued by the Senate's Democratic leadership over the past 2 years as \nthough they are serious. Give me a break. No serious person believes \nthe Obama administration's government can be financed simply by going \nafter the so-called wealthy. The only way to do it is by going after \nall Americans and raising taxes on all citizens. That is the silent \nplan the President will not discuss on the campaign trail. That is the \nDemocrats' phantom budget. And that is what I want to discuss today.\n  When it comes to addressing our deficits and debt, only one party in \nWashington has been willing to put its cards on the table. Only one \nparty has been willing to acknowledge the difficult choices that have \nto be made. The other side has refused to provide any concrete \nsolutions of their own, while demonizing anyone who has had the \ntemerity to propose anything resembling a workable solution.\n  A case in point. It has been more than 3 years--3 years--since the \nSenate, which has been under Democratic control the entire time--passed \na budget resolution. Those budget resolutions are mandatory. Yet they \nblindly ignore it. Three years--three years--without a budget. Four \nyears ago, if someone wrote a novel or a screenplay about a Senate \nmajority that refused to pass a budget for 3 years, people in both \nparties would have laughed and called it absurd. Yet here we are 3 \nyears later.\n  In fact, the only budget proposals from the Democrats have come from \nthe White House and they have been anything but serious. According to \nthe CBO, the President's most recent budget would keep the United \nStates on the same unsustainable path, with an ever-widening gap \nbetween revenues and spending, varying from 8.7 percent to 2.5 percent \nof GDP, and averaging 3.2 percent of GDP.\n  We should keep this in mind when we hear the President and his allies \nsuggest we can get our debt under control simply by raising taxes on \nthe wealthy. The President raises plenty of taxes on upper income \nindividuals and small businesses in his budget. Yet under the \nPresident's budget, debt held by the public would still reach 76.3 \npercent of GDP by the end of the budget window.\n  Even the President's budget, which raises taxes significantly, comes \nin with a debt limit that is well above what leading economists such as \nKenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart consider the danger zone of 70 \npercent. The President claimed a few weeks ago that his biggest failing \nover the last 3 years was that he cared too darn much about policy. If \nonly that were true. But the fact is he ignores the policy experts and \ntheir warnings when it comes to the debt.\n  Consider what CBO Director Elmendorf wrote to House Budget Committee \nChairman Paul Ryan regarding the debt earlier this year. I have to say, \nMr. Elmendorf is a Democrat, but I found him to be extremely \ntrustworthy and honest. Here is what he wrote:\n\n       Budgetary policies affect the economy in a variety of ways \n     . . . All else being equal, scenarios with higher debt tend \n     to imply lower output and income in the long run than do \n     scenarios with lower debt, because increased government \n     borrowing generally crowds out private investment in \n     productive capital, leading to a smaller stock of capital \n     than would otherwise be the case.\n\n  Director Elmendorf continues:\n\n       Moreover, that same crowding out leads to increases in \n     interest rates, raising the government's interest payments \n     and therefore further boosting government deficits and debt. \n     A perpetually rising path of debt relative to GDP is \n     unsustainable.\n\n  That is what our CBO Director, a Democrat, says. Again, I will vouch \nfor the fact that he is a very good economist who, as far as I have \nseen over all of these years I have worked with him in Washington and \nwatched him help our committees, is totally honest.\n  No one can legitimately dispute that our entitlement programs--\nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, in particular--are the major \nforces driving our future national debt. No one can dispute that.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber, produced by the Bipartisan Policy \nCenter, shows the cannibalization of the budget and ultimately the \nAmerican economy if we go with the status quo on health care \nentitlements.\n  Look at this blue line on the chart: health care spending. Under the \nquestioning by Members of Congress, leading Obama administration \neconomic policy officials, such as Treasury Secretary Geithner, \nbasically demur on dealing with the runaway entitlement spending. You \ncan see, it is running away.\n  In February, Secretary Geithner identified to House Republicans that \nthe administration was putting forth no plan to reform entitlements, \nbut, as he said: ``we know we don't like yours.''\n  The only official proposals we receive from the President and his \nadministration would simply maintain the status quo--a status quo that \nis so unacceptable that not one Member of the House or the Senate \nsupported the President's budget, not one in either body.\n  So what proposals do Senate Democrats support?\n  Keep in mind, this blue line on the chart is the health care spending \nline. The red line shows Social Security, which is relatively flat. It \ngoes up a little bit. That is the Social Security\n\n[[Page S5939]]\n\nline. The green line happens to be discretionary spending, which has \ngradually come down--or will come down from 2012 to 2052, according to \nwhat we are trying to do. Other mandatory programs are pretty much \neven. But health care spending is running out of control. That is \nMedicaid and Medicare and all the other health care spending--but \nespecially Medicaid and Medicare.\n  What proposals do the Senate Democrats support?\n  On that, they prefer to keep the American people guessing. Perhaps \nthe President will keep the American people in the dark until he \npossibly gets ``more flexibility.''\n  Democrats have not been willing to put their vision down on paper. By \ncomparison, there is the budget put forward by Paul Ryan. Unlike the \nDemocrats who are hiding the ball from the American people, Republicans \nhave not been afraid to talk about the Ryan budget.\n  This is a comparison of budgets on this chart. The Ryan budget \nconstrains Federal spending and keeps it close to its historic average \nat 21 percent of GDP. Here is the House Ryan budget, as shown on this \nchart in the red. By exercising that spending discipline, the budget \npulls the deficit down to 1.7 percent of GDP.\n  By comparison, President Obama's budget deficits are at 3.2 percent \nof GDP, on average--nearly double those of the Ryan budget.\n  When you boil it down, there is $3.5 trillion more in deficit \nreduction in the Ryan budget than in the President's budget, which is \nrepresented by the blue line on the chart. There is a $3.5 trillion \ndifference between these two. That is how much the Federal Government \ncurrently spends in 1 year.\n  Because of the President's failure to tackle runaway entitlement \nspending, that yawning fiscal gap between the two plans only gets much \nbigger in the outyears.\n  As you can see right here on this chart, look at how health care \nspending is going up in these outyears, from 2012 all the way to 2052. \nAs you can see, it is constantly going up from 2012.\n  Whether we are debating the budget or the debt ceiling or \nTaxmageddon, one thing is clear: The President and the Democrats in \nCongress do not like to talk in specific numbers. Instead, they want \nthe American people to measure specific Republican alternatives like \nthe Ryan plan against a series of campaign speeches and attack ads.\n  The current fiscal debate is between the Ryan budget and a phantom \nDemocratic budget. Apparently, the Chicago campaign sharpies have \ndetermined it is safer to wait until after the election to finally \nunveil the details of the phantom budget, which just in health care \nspending is going to go forever up and eat our country alive. And their \nadvice has been heeded by the Democrats.\n  If your proposals are never written down, no one can check your math. \nWe do not know the actual fiscal position of my friends on the other \nside of the aisle, but we can fill in some blanks.\n  We know by their vicious attacks on the spending restraints in the \nRyan budget and other Republican proposals that the President and his \nallies in Congress have no interest--zero; no interest--in reducing \nspending.\n  We know their income tax proposals do not add up to much in terms of \nrevenue. Even if they let the entirety of the current tax relief \nexpire--which is a distinct possibility given the game of chicken they \nare currently playing with the fiscal cliff--there probably is not \nenough money to be found in the income tax to pay for the coming \nexplosion in entitlement spending. You can see it right there on this \nchart in health care alone.\n  So where does the Democrats' phantom budget find the fiscal juice to \nfill its structural hole? The answer is simple: a European-style value-\nadded tax, the VAT, or its green cousin, a carbon tax.\n  I am quite certain my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will \nwrite this off as fear-mongering and fabrication. But what other \nconclusions are left to draw?\n  Without significant reductions in spending or reforms in our \nentitlement system--neither of which we can expect from this President \nor the Democrats currently in Congress--there is not enough money to be \nfound in traditional revenue streams to cover the President's spending \nbill. A VAT, a value-added tax--or some other euphemized form of a \nVAT--appears to be the only option left to our friends on the other \nside of the aisle if they want to continue spending at current \nprojections.\n  Many prominent Democrats have expressed some level of support for the \nvalue-added tax in the past. In 2009, during an appearance on the \nCharlie Rose show, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that a VAT was \n``on the table.''\n  A year later, President Obama, in a CNBC interview, expressed a \nwillingness to consider a VAT to address the deficit.\n  Countless high-profile Democratic strategists and advisors--people \nsuch as John Podesta and Paul Volcker--have unapologetically suggested \nimplementing a VAT in the United States.\n  Ezra Klein, a writer with real cache among liberal Democrats, \nexpressed similar views in the Washington Post in 2009. Here is a \nrevealing quote from Mr. Klein's article:\n\n       First, a simple fact: Tax rates will rise over the next \n     decade. Even with painful spending cuts, tax rates will rise. \n     At some point, taxes have to come further into line with \n     spending, and that means the direction they will travel is \n     up. But--and this isn't a fact--they won't rise within the \n     current system. People don't trust the current tax system. It \n     feels opaque and unfair, largely because it is. An increase \n     in revenues will have to come alongside a change in the tax \n     system. And the change in the tax system that most economists \n     prefer and that most other countries use is a value-added \n     tax.\n\n  I agree with Mr. Klein that our current tax system is a mess. But \nwhile he and other liberals see that as an opportunity to seek larger \npots of tax revenue elsewhere, my fellow Republicans and I see it as a \ncall to reform the Tax Code.\n  And we disagree on the fundamental assumption behind Mr. Klein's \narguments. Like most of my friends on the other side, Mr. Klein takes \nat face value the benefits of future spending. Notice how he uses the \nphrase ``taxes will have to come further into line with spending.''\n  His focus is almost entirely on the revenue side, with only a passing \nreference to the possibility of reducing spending.\n  A VAT would increase Federal revenues, but it would also effectively \nbe a tax hike on every American, including those who currently pay no \nincome tax. If a VAT were imposed on top of our existing income tax \nsystem, it would likely cripple our economy by imposing new costs on \nvirtually every purchase of goods and services in the United States. It \nwould hamper manufacturing and kill entire retail sectors. Worst of \nall, it would be the most regressive tax ever imposed on the American \npeople, disproportionately impacting families with lower incomes who \nspend a higher percentage of their wages on necessities.\n  Simply put, a VAT would be bad policy in a strong economy. But in the \nmidst of a slow economic recovery, it would be tantamount to economic \nsuicide. It would be jet fuel for larger and larger government.\n  Numerous studies, including a 2010 study by former CBO Director \nDouglas Holtz-Eakin, have demonstrated that in virtually every \ninstance, the implementation of a VAT in other industrialized countries \ninexorably led to increased spending and an expansion of government.\n  Make no mistake, the current administration and my Democrat friends \nknow only one way of engaging in fiscal reform--broaden the base. And \nevery middle-income family in America should know that they will get \nhit with higher taxes to pay for the Democratic goal of ever-expanding \ngovernment control over our economy, over our lives, and over your \npaychecks.\n  The contention that implementing a VAT would make our government more \nfiscally responsible is a dog that just won't hunt. The purpose of a \nVAT would not be to shore up deficits and pay down debts, but to expand \nthe government into new areas backed by an all-new source of funding.\n  Once again, I am quite certain that virtually all of my Democratic \ncolleagues would publicly deny that their phantom budget includes a \nVAT. For now, they want us to ignore the VAT behind the curtain and \ninstead listen\n\n[[Page S5940]]\n\nas the Great and Powerful Oz proclaims that every government program \ncan be funded and every budget balanced simply by eliminating the so-\ncalled tax cuts for the rich.\n  But the American people are not so easily duped. And they are showing \nup at Emerald City looking for real leadership and real answers, not \njust talking points.\n  That is the real choice facing the American people today. They can \nchoose the fiscal leadership of those such as Chairman Ryan who have \nput forth actual, real-world proposals to bring about reasonable \nrestraints on entitlement spending and maintain taxation at its \nhistoric levels, or they can choose the President's impersonation of \nfiscal leadership, which is built on a phantom budget and large-scale \nattacks on anyone, such as Chairman Ryan, who offers a real, verifiable \nalternative.\n  But let's be clear. The phantom budget simply cannot translate into \nreality without collecting taxes that go far beyond those the President \nand congressional Democrats publicly support. Given the limitations on \nexisting revenue streams, a value-added tax, even with all of its many \ndrawbacks, is one of very few logical alternatives left to the other \nside. If they do not plan on instituting a VAT, they need to come clean \nwith the American people and let everyone know how they plan to pay for \ntheir outsized spending.\n  Regardless of who wins this election, Congress will have to do more \nthan just click its heels and wish for enough money to pay all our \nbills. Therefore, I think it is fair to assume that, in lieu of a line \nitem for ruby slippers, the Democrats' phantom budget includes levels \nand forms of taxation heretofore unseen in the United States. You can \nbe sure that if it is not a VAT, it will be something equally damaging \nto our economy.\n  Let me end with one other thought; that is, that we all know, \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation, of which I am a member--\nbut it is a nonpartisan committee run by very good economists--the \nbottom 51 percent of all households--not just people; all households--\ndo not pay a dime of income tax.\n  We have brought that about out of compassion for them, I have to say, \nbut it means the upper 49 percent are paying for just about everything. \nWell, my friend Treasury Secretary Geithner pointed out: But, yes, they \npay payroll taxes. Well, we all do. That is Social Security. They do \nnot pay a dime of income taxes. I was quick to point out to Mr. \nGeithner that 23 million of them, approximately, get refundable tax \ncredits from the government that are more than they pay in payroll \ntaxes, so they are really not paying payroll taxes. Almost 16 million \nof them get refundable tax credits from all of us others out there, \nfrom the government itself, which is more than they and their employers \npay in payroll taxes.\n  The fact is, I fail to understand why my friends on the other side \nare looking for ways to spread the base to an unsuspecting 51 percent \nwho currently do not pay any real income taxes. I think there has to be \na better way of spreading the base than doing it through a VAT, which \nin Europe has proven to be a ready way for politicians to increase \nspending over and over without really any inhibition or any real \ninhibition.\n  So if what I am talking about today is prophetic, it means without \nquestion that our friends on the other side want to keep spending. They \nwant the Federal Government to keep growing, all at a cost to \nindividuals, and they want to do it because that is what has kept them \nin power all of these years, taking all of your money out there and \nclaiming that they are compassionate with your money when they are \nunwilling to be compassionate enough to keep living within our means.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it has been 2 years since Congress passed \nlegislation that provided for transparency in the mineral industry. It \nwas a provision that was included in the Dodd-Frank bill. It was \nincluded as an amendment on which Senator Lugar and I worked. I wish to \nthank Senator Lugar for his incredible leadership on this issue--\ntransparency--as well as so many other issues that affect the security \nof not only America but global security.\n  The provision is something we worked on to provide transparency in \ndeveloping countries. It provided a visible sign of U.S. leadership, \nthat we are going to do everything we can to promote good governance \naround the world; to demonstrate that we understand that for the \nstability of America, we need countries that have good governance.\n  The United States spends more money than any other country in the \nworld on our national security budget. In fact, we spend more than most \nof the other countries combined spend on national defense. We have the \nability to use our military for our national defense, but it is much \nbetter if we can develop stable countries around the world. The way to \ndevelop stable countries is to help them build a stable economy, to \nhelp them build wealth, and to help them have good governance.\n  It is impossible to see the type of progress we want in the \ndeveloping countries unless they have good governance. I might say that \nthe more we can help in this regard, the more we promote good \ngovernance and economic growth, the better off we will be. Our direct \nsecurity burdens will be reduced, and we will have new markets, which \nwill create economic opportunities for America.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, this is the guiding principle of the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. We used the \nHelsinki Commission as our implementing arm. The Helsinki Accords that \nwere signed in 1975 between Europe--all of the countries of Europe--the \nUnited States, and Canada recognized that it was in our national \nsecurity interests to support stable countries that respect human \nrights and have good governance.\n  This is the reason the Cardin-Lugar amendment was so important in the \nDodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation. Let me explain what it does. \nIt requires mineral companies to list the payments they make to extract \nthe minerals they take out of a country. Whether we are talking about \ngas or oil, whether it is diamonds or copper--the companies need to \ndivulge their individual payments to foreign countries in their reports \nto the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC.\n  We did that for many reasons.\n  One reason, quite frankly, is that although many countries in the \nworld have vast sums of mineral wealth, these are some of the poorest \ncountries in the world. We call it the ``resource curse'' because the \nnatural resource wealth of the country isn't just being denied to the \npeople for their economic growth, it is being used to fuel corruption \nwithin their own country. So one of the reasons for the provision we \nincorporated in the Dodd-Frank bill was to provide transparency so that \nthe people of the country, along with the international community, will \nknow exactly where payments are being made for the extraction of \nmineral wealth in a country.\n  Senator Lugar and I also thought that such information would be \nimportant for U.S. investors, too. If someone is going to invest in a \nmineral company, he or she has a right to know where that company is \nsigning contracts and paying money for access to the natural \nresource(s).\n  It is also important for U.S. interests. We need stable mineral \nreserves. As the Presiding Officer knows, we have gone to war over the \nneed for oil. We need stable markets so that we do not jeopardize our \nown economic progress.\n  So the Cardin-Lugar provision gives us a chance to follow the money, \nas the saying goes, in a particular country.\n  For all of these reasons, Mr. President, we passed a provision as \npart of the Dodd-Frank legislation that requires every company that is \ninvolved in extracting minerals to list those payments specifically by \nproject in their SEC filings.\n  It was pretty clear as to what needed to be done. We gave the \nauthority to the SEC to issue the necessary regulations. Well, we have \nbeen waiting 2 years for these regulations--2 years. We are now well \nbeyond the time limit that was spelled out in the legislation for the \nSEC to issue its regulations. Yet the SEC still hasn't issued final \nregulations.\n  I have read the statute over and over again. I helped write the \nstatute. Senator Lugar has read the statute. We do not understand the \ndifficulty. It was not a complicated provision. It said exactly what \nthe companies have to do. So we are somewhat puzzled why it has taken \nthis length of time for the SEC to issue its final regulations. In the \nmeantime, we are being denied the benefit of this law. We are being \ndenied the opportunity to protect our investors. We are being denied \nthe opportunity to follow the money, to help promote good governance \nabroad. All that has been delayed as a result of the SEC's failure to \nissue regulations.\n  I must say that it also jeopardizes U.S. leadership. Yes, there are \nother countries interested in following what the United States is \ndoing. We have heard from Europe, and we have heard from Asia. They \nwant to adopt similar laws. They do not know what to pass because they \nare still waiting for the SEC to act. So the failure to act isn't just \naffecting our ability; it is also affecting other countries. \nCollectively, between Asia, Europe, and the United States, we can \npretty much cover all of the international extractive companies and \ntherefore have a real, major impact on transparency on this issue.\n  I might say that one of the criticisms I have heard is about why we \nhave a separate bill. We already have what is known as the Extractive \nIndustries Transparency Initiative, or EITI. There is an international \norganization that is voluntary. Countries can join. The United States \nhas participated in the EITI. EITI participants help countries with \nbest practices for developing the governance to deal with how they \nhandle their mineral wealth. EITI is an important program. It is a \nvoluntary program. It works well.\n  The Cardin-Lugar provision in the Dodd-Frank legislation complement \nthe EITI. The two work together. Between the two, the EITI and our \nlegislation, there's a way that we can really require companies to make \nthe information available in an open way. The EITI gives developing \ncountries the technical assistance they need to manage their mineral \nwealth in the most effective way for the benefit of their own people, \nto elevate their wealth and to have a more sustainable economy.\n  This delay has caused a great deal of concern to many of us. Quite \nfrankly, Oxfam, for example, has filed suit against the SEC for its \nfailure to issue regulations, and I am very sympathetic to that \nlawsuit.\n  I wish to inform Senators that we have now been told the SEC will \nfinally issue its regulations on August 22, in just a few weeks. SEC \nofficials have formally responded to the Oxfam lawsuit, saying the \nagency will issue regulations on August 22. I have received a letter \nfrom the SEC indicating the same thing. It is long overdue.\n  I am looking forward to seeing the regulations from the SEC. I hope \nthe SEC follows the letter and spirit of the legislation. It is up to \nCongress to pass the laws. SEC needs to implement the laws under \ndirection and guidance from Congress. We have made it clear that we \nwant openness and transparency. I know some oil companies may not like \nthat, but they do not write the laws, we do. It is up to the SEC now to \npromulgate the regulations that carry out the intent of our law and \nhelp us move forward so that the resource wealth of countries in the \ndeveloping world become a real asset, a real benefit, as they develop \nsustainable economies and good governance, which helps global stability \nand helps the global economy.\n  We will be watching the SEC. I know we will be in recess on the 22nd, \nbut we will be watching the SEC. I hope that Congress and the SEC will \nbe working\n\n[[Page S5942]]\n\ntogether and that the United States will continue exercising its \nleadership, so that we will see other countries follow suit where we \nreally can make a difference in the wealth and growth of countries \naround the world that for too long have been suffering even though they \nhave enormous mineral wealth.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have had a great deal of \nconversation these past several days regarding cyber security. There is \nno question that we all agree it is a critical issue. I am sure every \nMember of this body shares the concern that our Nation is vulnerable to \ncyber attacks, and those attacks could have severe economic and \nnational security ramifications.\n  We saw just this week over 180 amendments filed to the cyber \nlegislation. I think it is pretty clear that a lot of us have ideas on \nhow best to protect our critical infrastructure. I think that is just \none of the reasons I was disappointed that the amendment tree was \nfilled and cloture was filed on the cyber measure.\n  I don't think that was the process we were promised when the Senate \noverwhelmingly agreed to consider the cyber security bill. Because \nMembers were denied the opportunity to have a thoughtful and complete \ndebate, the cloture vote failed on a bipartisan basis this morning.\n  We have heard a lot about the electric grid during this debate and \nhow legislation is needed to protect our Nation's transmission systems \nfrom cyber attack. What perhaps has been missing from this debate and \ndiscussion is a recognition that Congress had already moved to protect \nour grid system, and they did so 7 years ago. They enacted the \nbipartisan Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n  I am the ranking member on the committee of jurisdiction. I reassure \nmy colleagues that we already have mandatory cyber security standards \nin place for our electric grid. In the 2005 Energy Policy Act, Congress \ndirected the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, the grid's \nregulator, to set mandatory enforceable reliability standards, \nincluding standards for cyber security. And because these standards can \nbe very technical--extremely complex--Congress decided they should be \ndeveloped through a consensus-driven stakeholder process that is \noverseen by the Electric Reliability Organization--an organization that \nwe call NERC.\n\n  We thought this was so important back in 2005 that we even expanded \nFERC's traditional jurisdiction to include municipal and cooperatively \nowned utility systems under these grid reliability standards. Now, it \nmight surprise some to learn that the FERC-NERC mandatory cyber \nsecurity regime currently regulates over 1,900 different entities and \nthat the electric power sector is already subject to Federal penalties, \nand these penalties are serious--up to $1 million per day for \nnoncompliance. So there is teeth attached to these standards.\n  In fact, one of our own government entities--the Southwestern Power \nAdministration--was recently fined by the grid regulators for violating \ntwo mandatory cyber standards.\n  The point is the electric power sector and our grid regulators have \nbeen working extremely hard these past 7 years to develop and to \nimplement these cyber standards. We have already taken substantial \nmeasures to safeguard our electric utility systems. We have identified \nour critical assets and established security management controls, \nperformed risk assessments, and trained personnel. We have established \nsabotage reporting and mandated disaster recovery plans. These are all \nprocesses and procedures that have been put in place.\n  Also, it might surprise some to learn the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission--the NRC--has already taken action to protect the Nation's \nnuclear facilities from cyber attack. The nuclear industry developed a \ncyber security program for critical assets over a decade ago. The NRC \nnow mandates cyber security plans for nuclear plants, including the \nidentification of critical cyber assets and required contingency and \nincident response plans. Failure to comply with the NRC cyber \nrequirements also can result in fines and even an order to shut down \nthe nuclear reactor.\n  So, again, there are standards that have been put in place with \ncompliance requirements and penalties that are attached for failure to \ncomply.\n  One concern was that the cyber bill was brought to the floor via rule \nXIV. A concern with this was that it would undermine the existing \nmandatory framework that Congress has already established within the \nelectric utility grid. By establishing a competing regime--even if that \nregime was truly voluntary--the Cybersecurity Act the Senate just \nrejected could duplicate, conflict with, and even supercede the hard \nwork that has already been put in over these past several years to \nsafeguard both our grid and our nuclear facilities.\n  One of the amendments I had filed to the bill, and I had hoped we \nwould have an opportunity to discuss, was a strong savings clause--a \nsavings clause that would maintain the mandatory protections that are \nin place. Two competing systems are not workable and could, in fact, \nmake the Nation's grid and nuclear facilities even more vulnerable to \ncyber attack.\n  One thing we have learned in the Energy Committee, in overseeing our \nmandatory cyber practices, is not everything necessarily needs to rise \nto the level of a foundational standard. But with cyber threats and \nvulnerabilities that are constantly emerging and constantly changing, I \nthink the one thing we would agree on is that we always need more \ninformation.\n  I think we can also all agree the Federal Government needs to form a \npartnership with the private sector. The government and the private \nsector share the same goals--to keep our computer systems and our \nNation safe from cyber intrusions. We need the private companies to be \ntalking with each other and with the government about the cyber \nproblems they face as well as potential strategies and the solutions to \ncombat them. We also need our government to provide timely and \nactionable information to the private sector. It has to go both ways.\n  So as we go off to our respective States and discuss with our \nconstituents back home the many issues that are out there, I would \nencourage Members to take a look at what has been introduced by the \nranking members--the SECURE IT cyber legislation. Take a look at what \nhas been offered as an alternative. It is a commonsense approach to \naddressing our ever-increasing cyber threats.\n  Our bill focuses on four areas where we believe we can reach \nbipartisan support and which will result in legislation that can get \nenacted, even given the politics of an election year. The four areas we \nfocus on are information sharing, FISMA reform, criminal penalties, as \nwell as additional research.\n  Mr. President, I want to close with just some observations quickly \nabout the process. Back in 2005, when the Senate passed the bipartisan \nEnergy Policy Act, it passed by a considerable margin. It was 85 to 12. \nBut we spent a full 2 weeks on the floor considering amendments at that \ntime. We had earlier spent 2 weeks marking up the bill in committee. So \nwhat I would like to leave folks with is just the reminder that process \nreally does matter. That is how strong bipartisan pieces of legislation \nare enacted.\n  When you forego that process, you don't do that hard work in \ncommittee and send an ever-changing bill directly to the floor via rule \nXIV and then fill the amendment tree, the legislation just doesn't \nwork. It is bound to fail, and that is what we saw today.\n  A few months ago I came to the floor to advocate for cyber \nlegislation and to express my concern that the all-or-nothing approach \nto cyber security could result in nothing. After today's vote, that is \nwhere we are. That is what we have. I do remain hopeful we can find a \npath forward on the cyber issue that will result in a truly bipartisan \nand effective--effective--piece of legislation that will help our \nNation's critical infrastructure.\n  With that, Mr. President, I see my colleague from Louisiana is here, \nand I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5943]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                            Education Reform\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, as Congress prepares to adjourn for the \nAugust State work period, nearly 50 million students are preparing to \nhead back to approximately 100,000 elementary and secondary public \nschools across the country. What a great responsibility it is for us in \nCongress and our partners at the State and local levels to engage with \nparents and teachers to ensure that these 50 million students are well \neducated. When I travel back to Louisiana this month, I will be \nvisiting students and schools throughout the State, from Lafayette to \nNew Orleans to Bogalusa. I am looking forward to watching stimulating \nlessons, meeting enthusiastic students and teachers, and learning more \nabout the successes and challenges of Louisiana's schools.\n  The National Center for Education Statistics estimates that $544.3 \nbillion will be spent in public education this upcoming school year. \nThat is an estimated $11,000 per student. Are we making the most of \nthose dollars? In Congress, we perennially debate the amount of Federal \nfunds we should invest in our public school students. We recognize that \nmany of our States' education systems are underpreparing young people \nfor the changing workforce and increasing global competition. Yet we \ncannot agree on the appropriate amounts to invest at the Federal level \nto ensure that all students receive the opportunity for an excellent \neducation. All too often, the debate has been about ``How much?'' \nrather than about ``How to get better results?'' with existing \nresources.\n  Over the last several years, Federal, State, and local governments \nhave taken helpful steps to change the way taxpayer dollars are \ninvested to ensure that our limited resources are driven toward high-\nimpact solutions in education. Mayors and governors across the country \nare increasingly using data and evidence to steer public dollars to \nmore effectively address the educational needs of their communities and \nStates. At the Federal level, innovation funds have been created to \ninvest in and scale proven solutions. Some of these Federal programs, \nsuch as the Social Innovation Fund, Investing in Innovation, and the \nHigh-Quality Charter Schools Replication and Expansion Program, provide \ncompetitive grants to nonprofit organizations in order to grow \npromising, evidence-based solutions.\n  The Social Innovation Fund in particular focuses on three priority \nareas: economic opportunity, healthy futures, and youth development. \nIts unique Federal funding model requires all grantees and subgrantees \nto match Federal resources 1:1, thereby increasing the return on \ntaxpayer dollars and strengthening local support. This program relies \non outstanding existing grant-making ``intermediaries'' to select high-\nimpact community organizations rather than building new government \ninfrastructures. Additionally, it emphasizes rigorous evaluations of \nprogram results.\n  In my home State of Louisiana, the Social Innovation Fund recently \nprovided the Capital Area United Way with $2 million to replicate and \nexpand effective early childhood development programs to increase \nschool readiness among children in low-income and rural parishes within \nthe Greater Baton Rouge area. We know that education does not begin in \nkindergarten, education begins in a child's earliest years of life. New \nProfit, Inc., received a Social Innovation Fund grant of $15 million \nover 3 years to collaborate with innovative youth-focused, nonprofit \norganizations in helping young people navigate the increasingly complex \npath from high school to college and productive employment. The project \nwill expand the reach of these nonprofits to improve the lives of \nnearly 8,000 young people in low-income communities throughout the \ncountry.\n  Another program investing in what works is the Investing in \nInnovation Fund, commonly known as the i3 Program. This program \nprovides competitive grants to local school districts and nonprofit \norganizations with records of success to help them leverage public-\nprivate partnerships to implement education practices that have \ndemonstrated positive impacts on student achievement. Since 2010, the \nU.S. Department of Education has awarded competitive i3 grants to 72 \nlocal school districts and nonprofit organizations in 26 States and \nWashington, DC.\n  I am proud that New Schools for New Orleans, in partnership with the \nLouisiana Recovery School District and Tennessee Achievement School \nDistrict, received $28 million in i3 funds in 2010 to significantly \nincrease the number of high-quality charter schools in New Orleans and \nultimately improve education outcomes for New Orleans' students. With \nthese funds, New Schools for New Orleans is replicating Sci Academy, a \nhigh-performing charter high school that New Schools for New Orleans \nincubated four years ago. Sci Academy just graduated its first class of \nseniors--with 96 percent matriculating to 7-year colleges. Two new high \nschools modeled after Sci Academy will open this fall. With the i3 \ngrant, New Schools for New Orleans is also funding the turnaround of a \nK-8 school, Craig Elementary School in the Treme neighborhood. Dr. \nDoris Hicks, who runs the very successful Dr. Martin Luther King \nCharter School in the Lower Ninth Ward, will be overseeing the \nturnaround of Craig Elementary School, lending her expertise and \ncommunity credibility to the effort.\n  The High-Quality Charter Schools Replication and Expansion Program \nprovides competitive grants to successful nonprofit charter management \norganizations to allow them to increase enrollment at existing charter \nschools or open one or more new charter schools based on their \nsuccessful model. Both Rocketship Education out of California and KIPP, \nKnowledge is Power Program, out of Houston, TX, have received critical \nfunds from this competition in order to expand their reach and serve \nmore students. Both of these well-known and highly popular charter \nmanagement organizations are opening and operating charter schools in \nLouisiana and other States across the United States.\n  On May 18, 2012, the Office of Management and Budget issued a \n``Memorandum to Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies'' asking \nthem to demonstrate the use of evidence throughout their fiscal year \n2014 budget submissions. This is exactly the right kind of directive--\none which taxpayers will be happy to hear. In particular, I am \nenthusiastic about the potential impact of the provisions in the memo \nthat urge agencies to propose new types of evaluations and consider how \nevidence can be used in both formula and competitive grant-making \nprograms.\n  For the Federal Government to make this shift toward requiring more \nevidence of impact and prioritizing the investment of taxpayer dollars \nin proven programs, I recognize that there are a number of challenges \nto address, including a lack of agreement about what constitutes \n``evidence'' of impact; the difficulty of measuring certain kinds of \ninterventions or their desired outcomes; the resources it takes to \nconduct the most rigorous evaluations; a concern that those communities \nmost in need will be unable to compete and, therefore, fall further \nbehind; and a concern that many well-intentioned organizations will \nlose public funding because they do not currently have the evidence \nnecessary to prove their impact. These are very valid concerns, and I \nencourage the Office of Management and Budget and all Federal \ndepartments and agencies to address them through a thoughtful design of \npolicy approaches.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues in the Senate to visit a variety \nof public schools in their home States this month. Talk with students, \nparents, teachers, and school leaders. Learn more about their successes \nand challenges, and consider this question: What is truly working in \neducation and how can the Federal Government be more strategic about \ninvesting in evidence-based solutions in our classrooms?\n  We need to be smarter about how we invest in education if we are \ngoing to close the achievement gap, prepare students for the 21st \ncentury workforce, and compete in the global arena. Joel Klein, \nCondoleezza Rice, and a Council on Foreign Relations-sponsored task \nforce recently produced a report called ``U.S. Education Reform and \nNational Security.'' According to the report, ``Educational failure \nputs the United States' future economic prosperity,\n\n[[Page S5944]]\n\nglobal position, and physical safety at risk. Leaving large swaths of \nthe population unprepared also threatens to divide Americans and \nundermine the country's cohesion, confidence, and ability to serve as a \nglobal leader. . . . The United States will not be able to keep pace--\nmuch less lead--globally unless it moves to fix the problems it has \nallowed to fester for too long.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor allowing me to take a few moments to speak when he was waiting his \nturn.\n  I wish to also say Senator Hoeven has been a terrific member of our \nAgriculture Committee, coming in, in his first term, and has made a \nsignificant difference. He and our chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Conrad, have been terrific powerhouses, and they never let me \nforget that 90 percent of the land in North Dakota is farmland. I thank \nhim for allowing me to take a moment.\n\n\n                      Agriculture and the Drought\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am not sure the House has completed \nthe vote yet on a partial disaster assistance program, but I am rising \nto urge colleagues in the House to join with us in passing the \nAgricultural Reform Food and Jobs Act, commonly known as the farm bill.\n  I wish to commend the chairman and ranking member in the House for \ndoing what we did in Senate, which is to work together on a bipartisan \nbasis. They worked very hard with their committee and reported out a \nbill. We have some differences with that bill, but they worked very \nhard together, and I know we can come to agreement on something that is \na compromise between the House and the Senate. I commend them for doing \nthat.\n  I am very concerned and very disappointed that the Speaker and the \nHouse leadership did not support their efforts to bring this to the \nfloor in July. I was on the Agriculture Committee in the House. This is \nmy fourth farm bill. I have never heard of a situation where there was \na bipartisan farm bill reported out of committee and not taken up on \nthe floor. It is very concerning. But nonetheless, I support the \nchairman and ranking member in the House and look forward to working \nwith them to actually get this done.\n  My colleagues, of course, remember the long and intense debate we had \non this bill, both in committee and on the floor, with more than 70 \namendments. I wish to again greatly thank our majority leader for \nunderstanding the significance of this bill to the economy and to rural \nAmerica and to jobs across the country. The majority leader and the \nRepublican leader both allowed us the time to do that, and I very much \nappreciate that.\n  We passed the bill, as we all know, with an overwhelming bipartisan \nvote, 64 to 35. The Senate came together and did what the Senate is \nsupposed to do, and we worked very hard together to be able to get that \ndone.\n  Especially given the drought and the disaster farmers are dealing \nwith--not just drought but other disasters--it is critical the House \nfollow our lead and both pass a comprehensive disaster assistance \nprogram but in the context of real reform and a 5-year farm bill.\n  The House Agriculture Committee passed their bill. I am anxious and I \nam, frankly, disappointed they did not have the support they needed to \nbe able to bring it up, bring to the Senate, and put us in a situation \nwhere we are able to go to a formal conference committee, which I would \nlike very much to do to resolve differences.\n  But we do intend to begin that process, speaking together, listening \nto each other, negotiating in the next few weeks to see if we can't \ncome together informally, to be able to offer a compromise bill to the \nHouse and the Senate for consideration.\n  I wish to remind my colleagues that the farm bill is a jobs bill. \nSixteen million people work in our country because of our agricultural \neconomy and our food industry. We have the safest, most affordable food \nsupply in the world. The bright spot is agriculture. Export surplus is \nin agriculture. We should be doing everything possible to support \nagriculture, our farmers, our ranchers, both in the short term for \ndisaster assistance but also looking down the road on a 5-year farm \nbill.\n  Second, the farm bill expires on September 30, less than 2 months \naway. We need to get it done. We are racing against the clock right \nnow.\n  We also know that this year our Nation is experiencing the worst \ndrought in a generation. You turn on the news, and you see serious \nwildfires in Colorado, Nebraska, Utah, Oklahoma, Arizona, and Montana, \namong others. You look in Michigan and you see a fruit disaster that \nrelates from warmth and then freeze. We have more than half of the \ncounties in the United States that have been declared disaster areas \nnot just because of drought, which is what the House has addressed \npartially, but because of weather disasters. That is 1,584 counties \nacross the country, 82 of them in Michigan. We have only one county in \nMichigan that has not been declared a disaster area. Eighty percent of \nthe country is now experiencing abnormally dry, moderate, or extreme \ndrought, 22 percent of the country is facing extreme doubt, and so on.\n  As an emergency measure, USDA has opened 3.2 acres of conservation \nland for grazing and haying, but we know there is a lot more to be \ndone. That is what I want to speak about because when we look at this, \nall the disasters--and we understand we have to address drought. We \nhave to address what is happening to livestock. I am very proud of what \nwe have done in the Senate, what we passed, which is a stronger \nLivestock Disaster Assistance Program. It is permanent--not just for a \ncouple of months, it is permanent. But we also understood that there \nare other kinds of disasters. For those fruit growers and cherry \ngrowers in Michigan who have no access to crop insurance--it is not \navailable to them--we made sure there was support for them. For apple \ngrowers, for sweet cherries, for juice grapes, for others across the \ncountry, we have put in place provisions in the Senate bill.\n  Frankly, I believe we need to do more and can do more as we look at \nhow this has developed. We need to have the next few weeks to fully \nlook at all that has happened, whether it is livestock in the drought, \nwhether it is wildfires, whether it is what is happening to fruit \ngrowers, and put together a comprehensive effort in the context of \npassing a 5-year farm bill.\n  But when we look at all this, these are the disaster areas, but most \nof Michigan is not helped by what the House is doing because it does \nnot include the efforts to help those who currently do not have crop \ninsurance, the fruit growers. Michigan is not helped. The Northeast, \nagain, with fruit, or Florida with fruit, or out West, whether it is \nCalifornia or Oregon or in this whole area--not helped by what the \nHouse is doing. I appreciate the first step, and I certainly understand \nthat the agriculture leadership in the House is trying to do whatever \nthey can to take a step, and I commend them for that. But it does not \ncover this. It covers a good share, but it does not cover every kind of \ndisaster we have before us. And frankly, it doesn't cover disasters \nwaiting to happen because of inaction on a 5-year farm bill.\n  Let me go through the differences right now between what the House \nand the Senate have done. We passed a comprehensive 5-year farm bill as \nwell as a comprehensive disaster assistance bill. I will underscore \nagain that I believe that after looking through the next few weeks and \nlooking at everything that has happened, we ought to be looking at what \nelse we can do--not less, as the House did, but potentially more.\n  Both the House and the Senate have extended the livestock disaster \nprogram to 2012. We extend it permanently.\n  On tree assistance, if you lose the entire tree in an orchard, you \nare helped--not if you just lose the food, like most of our growers, \nbut the entire tree. These things are the same, so we have sort of \ndisaster-lite up here.\n  Then, in the Senate bill, we increase payments for livestock \nproducers facing severe drought, so we actually have a stronger payment \nsystem and safety net for our livestock producers.\n  As I said before, we help fruit growers impacted by frost and freeze. \nWe create new crop insurance options so that, going forward, we don't \nhave to be back here every year because we strengthen crop insurance \nand create opportunities for fruit growers who do not have insurance \nnow to be able to\n\n[[Page S5945]]\n\nhave crop insurance--which, by the way, producers pay into, and there \nis no payout unless you have a loss.\n  We also address urgently needed dairy reforms to save dairies from \nbankruptcy. In 2009, under the current dairy policy, we lost farms \nacross the country. If we do not act in a 5-year farm bill, in the area \nof dairy, of milk producers, it is a disaster waiting to happen. So we \nneed to have a comprehensive farm bill that deals with dairy reforms \nbecause that is part of avoiding the next disaster.\n  There is permanent funding, as I said, for livestock disaster \nassistance and conservation efforts to prevent another dust bowl. One \nof the reasons we don't have a dust Bowl in many areas where the \ndrought has been horrible, just horrible, is because of conservation \nefforts that we put in place that have worked. We need to strengthen \nthose.\n  We give the Forest Service tools to protect and improve forest health \nand deal with another disaster not dealt with here, which is forest \nfires all across the country.\n  We improve crop insurance to protect against disasters, and finally, \nwe provide farmers and ranchers with long-term certainty. They want to \nknow going forward not only what help they will receive this year--and \nthey need it, and we will make sure that happens--but they want to make \nsure going forward that they have long-term certainty.\n  I appreciate in my own home State that the commodity growers are very \nconcerned--strongly supportive of the Senate bill, want to support the \nSenate disaster assistance efforts. In fact, the Michigan Farm Bureau \ncame out today opposing what the House is doing because, from a \nMichigan perspective, it just doesn't cut it. It is just not enough.\n\n  We have gone through efforts that, in fact, will allow us to solve \nthe problem long term and to also address the short term. What we need, \nafter hearing from farmers and ranchers across the country, is a \nbipartisan farm bill that gives producers long-term certainty so they \ncan make business decisions without worrying about risk-management \nprovisions that are going to expire on September 30--which, by the way, \nis just 58 days away.\n  I would like all my colleagues to know that we have really a dual \nstrategy right now, knowing how important this issue is all across the \ncountry to rural America and really to everybody--everybody who eats. I \nthink that is everybody. We all have a stake in having a strong \nagricultural policy, nutrition policy, conservation policy that \nmaintains our position as the world leader in access to safe, \naffordable food. With or without official conferees and so on, it is \nour intent to have conversations to see if we might come together on \nsomething that would bridge the differences between House and Senate \nagricultural perspectives.\n  We know there are things we need to work on together. We are proud of \nthe fact that we passed a farm bill on a strong bipartisan basis, but \nwe understand we need to work with our colleagues and listen. It is our \ngoal to do one of two things: to either have the opportunity to come \ntogether in September and offer something that would be a compromise \nwith the House and the Senate that we could offer and look for an \nopportunity to pass--that is the best thing. It includes comprehensive \ndisaster assistance as part of that. That is far and away what we are \nhearing from farm country and what we are hearing from those across the \ncountry whose livelihood depends on agricultural production in the food \neconomy.\n  If for some reason we are not able to succeed, we need to assess all \nof what has to happen in the next 4 weeks and come back together and do \nwhat we need to do in September to pass a very strong, comprehensive \ndisaster assistance program--not just for livestock, as important as \nthat is, but for all of our communities in every State where there has, \nin fact, been a disaster.\n  We will work with colleagues. We will be offering a bipartisan \neffort. I am extremely hopeful that we can come together around what \nreally needs to get done, which is a 5-year farm bill. If not, we \ncertainly will make sure that in September we have the opportunity to \nwork together.\n  As I close, let me just indicate the reason--what happens if we do \nnot do the whole farm bill. We lose deficit reduction. The only thing \nwe voted on in a bipartisan way with deficit reduction, we passed here \ntogether. I see colleagues of mine who played a tremendous role in \nthis. The former head of the Department of Agriculture, the Secretary \nof Agriculture from Nebraska, the distinguished Senator from South \nDakota--North Dakota--we did this on a bipartisan basis, $23 billion \ndeficit reduction. We repealed subsidies that we all agreed from a \ntaxpayers perspective we should not be doing anymore. We made some \ndifficult decisions on that. We want to make sure we support farmers \nfor what they grow but not give a payment for what they don't grow. And \nthe number of reforms we did around payment limits and other things, \nincluding going through every part of this bill and doing what \neverybody says we ought to do, some of which is look for duplication, \nwhat doesn't work, what ought to be eliminated--and we actually \neliminated more than 100 programs and authorizations.\n  If we don't do a real farm bill, all of this goes away. I suppose you \ncan say the folks who do not want reform would be trying to stop us \nfrom passing a 5-year farm bill--certainly the Senate bill--people who \ndo not want reform, people who would like to keep status quo and would \nlike to continue with a system that has not worked for many growers and \nranchers. We in the Senate have come together, and we think that is not \nthe right way to go.\n  I am committed to working with my colleague, the ranking member from \nKansas, who I know cares deeply as well about what is happening to \nlivestock producers in his State. We have talked. I know how committed \nhe is to making sure we have the right help to be able to support them. \nWe are committed to doing that. But let's not do half a disaster \nassistance bill. Let's not do something short term that is less than \nwhat producers across the country are counting on us to do. They have \nsent a loud message. They want us to get it done. There is no reason we \ncannot. We did it here in the Senate. I believe that if we work in good \nfaith, if we listen to each other, if we trust each other, we can get \nthe whole thing done in September and have, really, something to \ncelebrate and to offer to all of those in rural America, all of those \nwho count on us, every one of the 16 million people who have a job \nbecause of agriculture and our food industry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. My colleague from North Dakota has \nbeen extremely patient, and I am very much appreciative of his \nwillingness to allow me to speak.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Senator from Michigan, and actually I am \ngoing to yield to the good Senator from South Dakota. I know he has a \ncommitment. He will be brief, so I yield to my colleague from South \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n        European Union Emissions Trading Scheme Prohibition Act\n\n  Mr. THUNE. I know it is very confusing, and I thank my colleague from \nNorth Dakota for yielding to his colleague from the South.\n  I hoped to come down and to ask unanimous consent to pass S. 1956 \nwith a committee-reported amendment. My understanding is there is an \nobjection on the other side. I am disappointed about that. I had hoped \nwe would be able to get unanimous consent today to pass what is a very \nbipartisan bill. It is the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme \nProhibition Act. It is a bill that passed by voice vote earlier this \nweek from the Commerce Committee, and a similar measure was passed \nearlier this year in the House of Representatives by a voice vote. The \naviation industry, the administration, consumers, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, just about everyone believes that the EU must be reined in \nand it must happen quickly.\n\n  In fact, just this week at the Commerce Committee markup Senator \nBoxer, who is the chairwoman of the Environmental and Public Works \nCommittee, and also a member of the Commerce Committee, said, referring \nto my bill:\n\n       I think moving it fast is critical because I think it will \n     send a message to the international organization we are \n     trying to nudge forward and know this is the way this is \n     going to be dealt with.\n\n  I could not agree more. In 2005, the European Union began their \nemissions\n\n[[Page S5946]]\n\ntrading scheme which attempts to cap emissions of carbon dioxide from \nstationary sources within the European Union. Starting in 2012, in \nJanuary of this year, aviation operators departing from or landing in \nEurope began to be included in this emissions scheme. Under this \nprogram, any airline, including non-European airlines, flying into and \nout of Europe will be required to pay for EU emissions allowances. \nAllowances will be collected for the entirety of the flight including \nportions in U.S. and international airspace.\n  This is a great example of this unfair application that is happening \nright now. We have Olympic athletes flying to and from the London games \nby air. One such Olympian is from my home State of South Dakota, Paige \nMcPherson, and she is competing in Taekwondo next week. She arrived in \nLondon last week and the final leg took her from Newark Airport to \nHeathrow Airport. During this flight, approximately 555 miles of the \n3,500 miles flown, or 16 percent, was actually in EU airspace, but her \nflight was taxed as if 100 percent of it was in EU airspace. Obviously, \nthis unilateral imposition of the EU ETS on U.S. aviation operators is \narbitrary, unfair, and a clear violation of international law. Plus it \nis being done without any guarantee for environmental improvements and \nat a huge cost to the aviation industry and constituents we serve.\n  Let me be clear that no one in Congress is against the EU \nimplementing this European trading scheme within their boundaries. That \nis obviously their prerogative; that is their jurisdiction. However, I \nbelieve any system that includes international and other non-EU \nairspace must be addressed through the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization, known as ICAO, of which the United States and 190 \ncountries, including all of the EU member states, are members. That is \nwhy I introduced this simple bipartisan bill. It gives the Secretary of \nTransportation the authority to take the necessary steps to ensure \nAmerica's aviation operators are not penalized by any system \nunilaterally imposed by the European Union.\n  The bill also requires the Secretary of Transportation, the \nAdministrator of the FAA, and other senior U.S. officials to use their \nauthority to conduct international negotiations and take other actions \nnecessary to ensure that U.S. operators are held harmless from the \nactions of the European Union.\n  It is time for the Senate to join the House of Representatives and \nthe administration in voicing our strong opposition to application of \nthe European Union's emission trading scheme system to American \noperators. I am sorry that it couldn't be done today because, as I \nsaid, this was unanimously reported out of the Commerce Committee \nearlier this week. We have broad bipartisan support. Democrats and \nRepublicans agree this is an issue that needs to be addressed.\n  Frankly, it is one that I think could be addressed in a very timely \nway. The longer we wait, the longer we have American air carriers and \ntherefore American travelers paying into a system where is no guarantee \nit is going to be used for any kind of environmental improvements in \nEurope. It is, in effect, a tax on American travelers that would fund \nEuropean governments. If we want to put it in a crass way, we could say \nthat the American public is being taxed to bail out European nations. \nThat is as simply as I can put this. It is a violation of international \nlaw; it is a violation of American sovereignty. It is unfair, unjust, \nand an illegal tax. It needs to be stopped. This legislation would \nallow that to happen.\n  It is unfortunate that we have an objection on the other side to \nprevent that from happening tonight. I intend to work with my \ncolleagues to get a vote on this when we return in September.\n  I want to thank my colleague from North Dakota for his graciousness \nin allowing me to make that statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, does the Senator from North Dakota have the \nfloor?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise on another issue, but I yield at \nleast temporarily to see what the good Senator from Missouri has to \nsay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                          Agriculture Disaster\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I am concerned that we are going to go home \nwithout an agriculture disaster bill farm families can rely on. This \ndisaster is real. The disaster programs for livestock ran out a year \nago, September 30 of last year. We have a chance to do something about \nthat, and I wish to see us do something about that.\n  The idea that we would decide we could put this off another month, \nthat we can put those families in jeopardy for another month not \nknowing what their solution seems to me is totally unacceptable.\n  I will yield the floor to my friend from North Dakota, but I intend \nto do everything that I can to see we solve this problem with a real \nsolution, not just another Washington excuse as to why we can't do what \nneeds to be done.\n  The Agriculture industry is a key economic driver for our country, \nsupporting approximately 16 million jobs nationwide. The families that \nown and run these farms and ranches represent less than 2 percent of \nAmerica's population, but they raise enough food and fiber to feed the \nnation. These producers have been greatly impacted by the worst and \nwidest reaching drought to grip the United States in decades, which \ncontinues to get worse with no signs of slowing down as we head into \none of the warmest months of the year.\n  On Wednesday the USDA added 218 counties from 12 drought-stricken \nStates to its list of natural disaster areas--bringing the overall \ntotal to 1,584 counties in 32 States. That's more than half of all U.S. \ncounties. As of the end of last month, the entire State of Missouri was \ndesignated a State of severe to exceptional drought--the worst level of \ndrought possible.\n  For a State like Missouri, which is heavily reliant on agriculture \nrevenue, this drought has been devastating. Missouri has more than \n100,000 individual farms--the second highest number of farms of any \nstate in the nation. Missouri also ranks No. 2 in the Nation in cow \ncalf operations.\n  Nationwide, 48 percent of our corn crop is now in poor to very poor \ncondition, compared to 45 percent one week ago. Last year, only 14 \npercent was poor to very poor, while 62 percent was rated good to \nexcellent. Among the hardest hit States, Missouri tops this list with \n83 percent of our corn crop rated at poor to very poor. Based off the \nmost recent data, approximately 73 percent of the domestic cattle \ninventory in the country is within an area experiencing drought. \nMeanwhile, 57 percent of American pasture and rangeland is in poor to \nvery poor condition this week, compared to 55 percent last week and 36 \npercent a year ago.\n  I have talked to many livestock producers who are being forced to \ndecide whether to continue to feed their livestock or whether to \nliquidate otherwise productive livestock and dairy herds. For the few \nthat have been able to put up hay, they are already taking it back out \nof the barn to feed--well before the normal feeding time in the winter \nmonths. A dairy producer and good friend of mine, Larry Purdom, said \njust the other day: ``Some are just giving up. Yesterday I saw three \ndairy herds sell out at the Springfield livestock auction and two more \nherds were ready to go. I think we could lose up to a third of our \ndairy cow numbers in Missouri.''\n  Undoubtedly, the best solution to assist our farmers and ranchers \nwould be for Congress to pass a long term farm bill that includes \nfunding for these disaster programs. I voted for the Senate farm bill, \nand I still believe we need a long-term bill to provide certainty to \nour producers. Many of these disaster programs have lapsed, leaving \nAmerican producers with very few options to make it through this \ndrought. While USDA has granted a primary disaster designation to every \ncounty in Missouri, qualifying them for emergency loan--this only gets \nour producers so far. It's time we step up and take further action. We \nhave an obligation to our nation's producers to act immediately.\n  The House has passed and sent us a targeted disaster aid bill. This \nbill is fully offset, and it immediately helps those farmers and \nranchers who are facing the worst drought in decades. But instead of \nmoving forward and providing our producers with the assistance they \nneed, the majority has decided to play politics with drought relief.\n\n[[Page S5947]]\n\n  Now, the Democrats want to send the House the same bill that has \nalready passed Senate, with no immediate disaster assistance attached. \nAs we head into the August work period with no sign of relief in sight, \nit is unacceptable for the Majority to stand in the way of helping our \nproducers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my esteemed colleague, the \nSenator from Missouri. I appreciate working with him on many issues, \nincluding agriculture, and I share his concern.\n  I have been on the floor of the Senate this week and past weeks, \nexpressing my desire to pass a farm bill, including agriculture \nassistance. I believe we can do that. We passed a farm bill here in the \nSenate. The Agriculture Committee has come forward with a product. We \nabsolutely need to come together, House and Senate, on the farm bill \nfor the good of our farmers and ranchers, including drought assistance \nand for the good of the country.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hoeven pertaining to the introduction of S. 3512 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Thank you, Mr. President. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Terrorist Detainment\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, it was reported today that Iraq has \ndenied the request of the United States to extradite senior Hezbollah \nfield commander and confessed terrorist Ali Mussa Daqduq, who was \nrecently ordered released by the Iraqi court after our government \nturned him over to Iraqi custody when our troops left the country.\n  The administration had years to transfer Daqduq to our detention \nfacility at Guantanamo Bay, but because the President seemed to lack \nthe political will to do so--I think because of campaign promises he \nimprovidently made--one of the most dangerous, reprehensible terrorists \never in our custody will likely be allowed to go free. We should never \nhave been in this position.\n  I and others saw this coming and we pleaded with the administration \nnot to allow it to happen. Sadly, our warnings fell on deaf ears and, \nsadly, we were proven correct. Daqduq is responsible for the torture \nand murder of five American servicemen in Karbala, Iraq, including PVT \nJonathan Millican of Locust Fork, AL, who was posthumously awarded the \nSilver Star for gallantry in action as he attempted to protect his \ncomrades from Daqduq's terrorist actions outside the rules of war. \nDaqduq and his followers wore American uniforms--an action that he \ndirected. His actions were clearly against the laws of war and he can \nbe held not only as a prisoner of war but as a violator of the rules of \nwar and can be tried and should have been tried before an American \nmilitary commission.\n  When U.S. forces captured Daqduq, then the most senior Hezbollah \nfigure in U.S. custody, he provided detailed testimony about the \nsupport and training provided by Iran to Iraqi insurgents and admitted \nto violating the laws of war. He is not a criminal defendant. He is not \na member of an organized crime syndicate or some drug dealer. He is a \nconfessed terrorist who committed atrocities against American soldiers \nduring a war duly authorized by Congress. That makes him an unlawful \nenemy combatant who may be detained until the conclusion of the war or \nsubjected to trial by a military commission. He could be imprisoned for \nup to life or he could be executed.\n  Once the military determined he was no longer of use for intelligence \npurposes when he was in Iraq, he should have been brought to Guantanamo \nBay. That was the perfect place for him to be detained. This should \nhave been an open-and-shut case. But President Obama and Attorney \nGeneral Holder have obstinately clung to the failed law enforcement \napproach to counterterrorism. They just have. It has been a dispute all \nthe way through the campaign and since they took office. They believe \nin treating foreign enemy combatants as normal criminal defendants \nentitled to U.S. constitutional protections and civilian trials. This \nis contrary to history and contrary to the laws of war. It is contrary \nto our treaty obligations. Other nations don't do this.\n  The problem began when, upon taking office, the President decided to \nban any new additions to the prisoner population at Guantanamo Bay. We \nremember that. He didn't like Guantanamo Bay. He thought that was some \nbad place. So if he transferred Daqduq, or anyone else, for that \nmatter, to Gitmo, he would anger certain of his supporters and violate \nsome of his improvident campaign promises, one of which was to the \neffect that Gitmo was a cause of terrorism, not a way to prevent \nterrorism and prevent terrorists from murdering innocent civilians and \nattacking our military.\n  So when the report surfaced that the administration planned to \ntransfer Daqduq to the United States for a civilian trial--that was the \nfirst report, that he would be brought here for a civilian trial--my \ncolleagues and I wrote to the Attorney General urging him to reconsider \nand try him before a military commission. For a time, the Attorney \nGeneral appeared to have relented. But a few months later, it was \nreported that instead of transferring him to Gitmo, the administration \ndecided to release Daqduq to Iraqi custody.\n  This time, we wrote to Secretary of Defense Panetta asking him to \nreconsider that decision. We warned that the Iraqi Government \npreviously had released terrorists who later returned to the \nbattlefield to kill American servicemen. Yet as the deadline for the \nUnited States withdrawal from Iraq approached, it became clear the \nPresident had no intention of removing Daqduq from Iraq.\n  The President then struck a deal with Prime Minister al-Maliki to \ncharge Daqduq before an Iraqi criminal court for his acts of terrorism, \nforgery, and illegal entry, and other offenses.\n  Now the Iraqi court has had a trial and ordered him released, in \nspite of the volume of evidence turned over by the United States to be \nused in the trial, including his uncoerced confessions detailing his \nrole in training the insurgents and his role in the Karbala massacre \nthat I referred to. It appears that it is only a matter of time before \nhe will now be set free.\n  Recent press reports indicate that the Iraqi authorities are trying \nto find a way to release Daqduq without angering the White House or \nembarrassing the President ahead of the election. Well, no one should \nbe surprised that Iraq will not turn him over. We were concerned from \nthe beginning that this would happen.\n  The administration knew well before it handed over Daqduq that its \ndecision was an abdication of its responsibility to prosecute a \nterrorist for war crimes against American soldiers--the murder of \nAmerican soldiers. The administration knew if the Iraqi courts failed \nto bring him to justice, we may never get a second chance. That was \nknown. And they knew that Iraq would not agree to an extradition \nrequest. That has been their policy. So the fact of the matter is we \nwouldn't be in this position if we had prosecuted Daqduq when we had \nthe opportunity. But now, not only is justice perverted, but he could \nbe returned to the battlefield to kill more Americans, Iraqis, and \nothers.\n  Unfortunately, Daqduq was not the first, nor will he be the last, \nexample of this administration's unwillingness to confront dangerous \nterrorists effectively and to process them effectively.\n  In July of 2009, Senator Jon Kyl and I wrote President Obama urging \nhim to adhere to this Nation's longstanding policy of not negotiating \nwith terrorists and not to release the Khazali brothers--two of the top \nIraqi terrorists trained by Daqduq who were complicit in the Karbala \nmassacre in 2009; but they went forward--in exchange for the release of \nBritish hostages held by the terrorist organization called the League \nof the Righteous.\n\n  President Obama authorized the Khazalis' release as part of what the \nIraqi Government called its ``reconciliation efforts'' with insurgent \ngroups.\n\n[[Page S5948]]\n\nBut in reality, this release was a thinly veiled ploy to use Iraq as a \nmiddleman in a terrorist-for-hostage exchange in direct violation of \nPresident Reagan's policy not to negotiate with terrorists. In fact, \nthere was an Executive order he issued to that effect.\n  When Iraq released the Khazalis to the League of the Righteous, the \nterrorist group responded by releasing five British hostages, but, \nsadly, four of them had already been executed. Qais Khazali \nimmediately, upon his release, resumed his position as leader of the \nterrorist group and orchestrated the kidnapping of a U.S. civilian \ncontractor in Baghdad less than a month after his release, and Abdul \nReza Shahlai, an Iranian Quds Force officer now in Iraq--the Quds Force \nis one of the most loyal and vicious parts of the Iranian regime--\nhelped Khazali and Daqduq plan the Karbala massacre and helped \ncoordinate the attempt to assassinate the Saudi Arabian Ambassador to \nthe United States on U.S. soil. Do you remember that? That is the same \nguy.\n  Despite this alarming track record and the obvious lessons to be \nlearned from its previous mistakes, the administration recently \ninsisted on engaging in negotiations with the Taliban to release five \nterrorist detainees from Guantanamo Bay--detainees who were categorized \npreviously as ``too dangerous to transfer'' by the administration's own \nGuantanamo Review Task Force--and they were to be released in exchange \nfor the Taliban's promise in Afghanistan to ``begin'' talks with the \nAfghan Government.\n  Negotiating, I suggest, with terrorists is not a profitable \nenterprise, and in effect that is what that was. Three of the five have \nties to al-Qaida. Another met with Iranian officials on behalf of the \nTaliban immediately following 9/11 to discuss Iran's offer of weapons \nand support to attack U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Another detainee then \nunder consideration, Mohammad Fazl, is a close friend of the supreme \nTaliban commander, Mullah Omar, who is accused of killing thousands of \nAfghan Shiites, and who was responsible for the prison revolt that \nclaimed the life of CIA Officer Johnny Michael Spann, the first \nAmerican killed in Afghanistan and, incidentally, another brave \nAlabamian.\n  As time has passed, it has become clear that the policy of not \nnegotiating with terrorists is sound and essential, and the \nadministration's actions in violation of that policy have failed and \nthey are dangerous.\n  Indeed, the administration's failed terrorist detention policies \nappear to have led to a policy that favors killing rather than capture \nand interrogation of enemy combatants. It is an odd event, but it does \nappear to have some truth to it.\n  So today we face a situation in Afghanistan that is similar to that \nwhich we faced in Iraq in 2009. Parwan Prison currently houses roughly \n2,000 to 3,000 individuals, including high-value detainees.\n  In August 2011, the Washington Post--last August--reported:\n\n       U.S. officials say that giving Afghans control over the \n     fates of suspected insurgents would allow dangerous Taliban \n     fighters to slip through the cracks of an undeveloped legal \n     system.\n\n  I will tell you what that means. It means they will not be able to \nkeep them in those jails. History shows that. They will get their way \nout of there--through violence, through bribery, through threats, or \nsome other mechanism, and that is what is continuing to happen. It is a \nbig concern of the military. As a Federal prosecutor, who observed this \nparticular issue over the years in Iraq and Afghanistan, it has been a \nsource of concern to me.\n  In March of this year, the administration agreed to a gradual \ntransfer of control of the prison to the Afghan Government over a \nperiod of 6 months, with the United States holding veto power over the \nrelease of certain prisoners. However, the Washington Post reported in \nMay--just May of this year--that the administration has been secretly \nreleasing high-value detainees held in Afghanistan in exchange for \ncertain ``promises of support'' from leaders of insurgent groups.\n  Now, how long do you think that will last? Once we release the \nprisoner, they are out, but the promises by some Taliban or some \nterrorists are not going to be honored. Not only do some of these \nprisoners have ties to Iran or al-Qaida and other terrorist \norganizations that continue to attack our troops, but their release is \nnot even conditioned on them severing their contact with the insurgent \ngroups.\n  According to the Washington Post, the administration has approved \nthese releases in part because they do not require congressional \napproval. That is what they report. It also has been reported that the \nadministration is attempting to repatriate some of the 50 most \ndangerous militants over which the United States currently retains \ncustody to Pakistan and other Arab countries--this in the face of \nreports from the Director of National Intelligence that nearly 28 \npercent of former Gitmo detainees are either confirmed or suspected to \nhave returned to the battlefield to attack America and our allies. That \nis 28 percent. How many are doing so and we have not yet proven that \nthey have been in the game? I suspect many more than that 28 percent.\n  So the question inevitably arises: When American detention operations \nin Afghanistan come to an end, where will the administration take those \n50 or so dangerous prisoners, assuming it has not already negotiated \nwith other insurgent groups for their release? If they are not going to \nrelease them, what are they going to do with them?\n  Once again, the administration has kicked the can down the road, just \nas it did in Iraq, which eventually culminated in the Daqduq mess.\n  The country cannot afford to continue down this dangerous path, \nespecially in light of the impending withdrawal of our troops from \nAfghanistan and the administration's agreement to transfer detainees in \nU.S. custody to the Kabul Government. The same unacceptable result will \nsurely occur.\n  The President is the Commander in Chief. He has serious \nresponsibilities, and one is to defend the honor, the dignity, and the \ncredibility of the United States. I do not believe we are doing so when \nwe are dealing with terrorists who double-cross us at every turn. He \nhas a duty to those magnificent troops who have answered his call to go \ninto harm's way to execute U.S. policy.\n  Part of that duty is not to give away what they have fought and bled \nfor, not to give it away after they fought and bled for it, and \ncaptured these people. That includes not giving up prisoners whom these \nsoldiers, at great risk and effort, have captured--terrorists who seek \nto destroy what we have, terrorists we have worked so hard to capture, \nterrorists who may return to kill more Americans and more Afghans.\n  This policy cannot be defended. It has to end. So I urge the \nPresident and his team to act forcefully now. It may not be too late. \nWith strong action we may be able to ensure that Daqduq is not \nreleased, that he is able to be tried for the murders he committed and \nthe American soldiers he killed.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Georgia Peanut Commission Anniversary\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of the Georgia Peanut Commission. In 1961, Georgia peanut \nfarmers came together to form a commission that would promote their \nindustry, perform research, educate the community, and conduct outreach \naround the State. Thus, the Georgia Peanut Commission was born.\n  We have come a long ways since 1961. As we celebrate this 50th \nanniversary, it is important to note that Georgia peanut farmers in \n1961 harvested 475,000 acres of peanuts with an average yield of 1,200 \npounds per acre. But thanks to the evolution of technology and \ntechniques and the hard work and the innovation of Georgia's peanut \nfarmers, farmers in 2011 in Georgia harvested the same amount of land \nwith a yield of more than 3,500 pounds per acre.\n\n[[Page S5949]]\n\n  Agricultural producers face a combination of challenges, including \nunpredictable weather and market volatility that determine profit or \nloss in any given year. Through the Georgia Peanut Commission, Georgia \npeanut farmers have persevered through the hardships. Georgia leads the \nNation in peanut production, producing nearly 50 percent of our \nNation's annual crop.\n  Anyone who has ever stopped by a congressional office on Capitol Hill \nand taste-tested the complimentary peanuts we offer can thank the \nGeorgia Peanut Commission. Those little red bags are recognized by \nhungry constituents and staffers alike as a symbol of Georgia \nagriculture.\n  Annually, the commission distributes 2 million of those little red \nbags. The peanut industry is vital to Georgia's economy, contributing \nsome $2 billion annually, and creating nearly 50,000 jobs across the \nsector. In the past 50 years, peanut farmers with the help of the \ncommission have reduced production costs through research and have \nworked to stimulate and increase consumption.\n  Last year, the Georgia Peanut Commission broke ground at the site for \nits new headquarters in Tifton, GA, which will be the first net-zero \nenergy building affiliated with State government in Georgia. There are \nmany changes happening in rural America. The facade of these rural \ntowns may look different year after year, but the challenges \nconfronting our small towns and communities have not changed. The \nGeorgia Peanut Commission has been critical to the foundation of not \njust rural Georgia but our entire State's economy.\n  I am proud to recognize the work the Georgia Peanut Commission has \ndone for our State and congratulations to them on their 50th \nanniversary.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 6079\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, earlier this week, the majority leader \nand a number of his colleagues took to the floor to defend the \nPresident's health care law and to tout provisions they believed to be \npopular with the public. What they didn't do was allow a vote on the \nentirety of the bill, which proves to be even more of a disaster with \neach passing day and which the majority of Americans continue to \nvigorously oppose.\n  Put another way, Senate Democrats spent nearly an entire day talking \nabout parts--parts--of ObamaCare that polled well but refused to spend \n15 minutes being caught on camera voting to uphold the entire law. What \nare they afraid of? Why will they not allow a vote?\n  When the health care bill was working its way through Congress, you \nwill recall, former Speaker of the House Pelosi famously said: We need \nto pass the bill to find out what is in it. Now that we have had some \ntime to study its consequences, I can't think of any reason why \nSenators wouldn't want to stand and be counted with a vote on the floor \neither for or against repeal.\n  Does ObamaCare get a passing grade or not? That is all I asked for on \nTuesday, a vote to either reaffirm or repudiate the votes we all took \non ObamaCare based on everything we know about it now that we didn't \nknow back then.\n  It has been clear, in my view, that the Democratic health care law is \nmaking things worse and should be repealed in full. A week doesn't seem \nto pass that we don't learn about some problem this law creates or \ndoesn't solve.\n  There is a headline in the Wall Street Journal today: ``Small Firms \nSee Pain in Health Law.'' And just yesterday we learned it will \nincrease Federal spending and subsidies on health care by $580 billion, \nwhich means even after you count the more than $700 billion it takes \nout of Medicare, it still increases Federal health spending and \nsubsidies by more than one-half of $1 trillion.\n  So let's have a vote. Let's have a vote: Is ObamaCare making things \nbetter or worse? Let's show the American people where we stand. It is \nwhat the American people want. It is a vote they deserve.\n  When my friends on the other side are represented on the floor, I \nwill ask consent for a vote that would follow the completion of cyber \nsecurity, so I will defer on asking that consent until the majority \nleader or one of his representatives comes to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would say to my friend, the majority \nleader, I have already made some comments about why I will be \npropounding the consent agreement I now propound with him here on the \nfloor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the disposition of \nthe pending cyber security bill, but no later than September 28, the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 451, H.R. 6079, an \nact to repeal the President's health care bill or the so-called \nObamaCare; further, that there be 1 hour of debate on the bill, no \namendments be in order to the measure, and following that debate the \nbill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to the vote on \npassage, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there is no \nother way to say this than my Republican friends are hopelessly stuck \nin the past. They continue to want to fight battles that are already \nover.\n  At the beginning of this Congress, when we were trying to pass an air \ntransportation bill, the Republican leader offered an amendment to \nrepeal the Affordable Care Act. On February 2 of last year, the Senate \nvoted that amendment down. It was defeated.\n  In March of this year, when we considered the highway jobs bill, \nRepublicans insisted on voting on stopping women from getting \ncontraceptive coverage--part of the Affordable Care Act. On March 1, \nthe Senate voted that amendment down.\n  Just this week, when we have been considering a bill to protect our \ncountry from cyber attack, the Republican leader gave notice that he \nwanted once again to offer an amendment to repeal the Affordable Care \nAct. Remember, the House has already voted 34 times to repeal the \nAffordable Care Act. I repeat, they are hopelessly stuck in the past.\n  They are stuck in the past when before the Affordable Care Act, \ninsurance companies didn't have to pay for preventive care. They are \nstuck in the past when before the Affordable Care Act, there was a gap \nin coverage for seniors' prescription drugs. That is the doughnut hole \nthat we are filling. Republicans are stuck in the past when before the \nAffordable Care Act passed, insurance companies didn't have to allow \nyoung adults up to age 26 to stay on their parents' health insurance.\n  I have spoken here at least a half a dozen times about my friend from \nSearchlight, NV, who, at 22 years old, went off his parents' insurance. \nThe time ran out. Within weeks, he was diagnosed with testicular \ncancer. It about broke his parents. He had no insurance and had two \nsurgeries. That will not happen in the future. This young man was in \ncollege. That is what this is to protect.\n  They are stuck in the past when before this act passed, insurance \ncompanies could deny coverage to people because of preexisting \nconditions. And, by the way, one of those conditions was being a woman; \nor diabetes; or if a woman had been a victim of domestic abuse. They \nare stuck in the past when insurance companies could charge women more \nthan men. Republicans are stuck in the past when women didn't have \naccess to the services they need. They are stuck in the past when \ninsurance companies could drop your coverage when you got sick or set \nsome arbitrary limit on how much insurance would pay.\n  I have talked about a man in Las Vegas who was badly injured, living \na pretty decent life even though he was paralyzed--and suddenly he \nfinds he has no insurance, which led him into an awful situation.\n\n[[Page S5950]]\n\n  Republicans are stuck in the past when insurance companies could use \npremium dollars for bonuses for the bosses rather than health care. All \naround America this month there will be hundreds of thousands of people \nwho will be getting a rebate because insurance companies weren't \nspending enough money on them but, rather, on their own salaries. We \nset a limit: You have to spend 80 percent of a premium to help people \nget well. They are stuck in the past and they want to return to when \ninsurance companies were king. They are hopelessly stuck in the past.\n  But there was a vote that we should all focus on, on the Affordable \nCare Act. It was a 5-4 vote that upheld that bill. The Supreme Court of \nthe United States did that. But I guess they didn't get the news. The \nSupreme Court ruled the act is constitutional. It is the law of the \nland now.\n  We need to move on. They need to catch up on the fact that people \nwant us to work to create jobs, whether it is in Alaska, Nevada, \nKentucky--any of the States. But they want us to vote on repealing the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  On July 19, they blocked us from voting on a bill to prevent \noutsourcing jobs--which, by the way, their Presidential nominee is very \ngood at doing. Now they want us to vote on repealing the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  On July 12, they blocked passage of the small business jobs bill that \nwould have helped small businesses all over this country. They wanted \nto vote on repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n  But on March 29, they blocked a bill to promote renewable energy.\n  On March 13, they blocked Senator Stabenow's amendment to extend \nexpiring energy tax credits.\n  They wanted to vote on the Affordable Care Act, and they stopped us \nfrom proceeding to put workers back on the job building and modernizing \nAmerica, and that was done on November 3.\n  On October 20, they blocked the motion to proceed to a bill to keep \nteachers and first responders on the job.\n  They so badly want to go back and fight these old battles that they \nblocked a motion to proceed to the American Jobs Act.\n  They blocked us on a bill to reauthorize the Economic Development \nAdministration, something that has been done as a matter of fact in the \npast, creating thousands of jobs in America. They wanted us to vote on \nrepealing the Affordable Care Act.\n  One day last year, after weeks of debate, they blocked the bill to \nimprove small business innovation. That, by the way, is one of the \nprograms that has done so many interesting things, including inventing \nthe electric toothbrush.\n  Republicans are hopelessly stuck in the past. They need to stop \ntrying to repeal a law enacted 3 years ago. The Supreme Court has \ndeclared it constitutional. Let's move on to try to get jobs for \npeople.\n  So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe we are now on a motion to proceed \nto S. 3457; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. I have a cloture motion at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 476, S. 3457, a bill to require the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs to establish a veterans jobs \n     corps, and for other purposes.\n         Harry Reid, John F. Kerry, Bernard Sanders, Kent Conrad, \n           Al Franken, Tom Udall, Christopher A. Coons, Mark \n           Begich, Patty Murray, Bill Nelson, Amy Klobuchar, \n           Thomas R. Carper, Robert Menendez, Jim Webb, Kirsten E. \n           Gillibrand, Jeff Merkley, Jack Reed.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum under \nrule XXII be waived and that the vote with respect to this motion occur \nat 2:15 on Tuesday, September 11.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman Murray \nfor her work on the Veterans Jobs Corps Act.\n  The unemployment rate for our young, returning veterans is higher \nthan that national average, and this is a travesty. This important bill \nwould invest $1 billion in creating a Veterans Jobs Corps to help our \nveterans transition into civilian life and get job placements in \nimportant areas of law enforcement, first responders positions, or \npositions in parks and forests involving restoration and protection of \nour public lands.\n  The bill makes other strategic investments to improve our \ninfrastructure to help veterans with their job search. Veterans deserve \naccess to Internet at one-stop job centers, as well as qualified \noutreach specialists to help disabled veterans seek employment. It is \ndesigned to help ensure that veterans get the credit they deserve for \ntheir training and military experiences when they seek civilian \ncertification and licenses.\n  I would also like thank Leader Reid and Chairman Murray and their \nstaffs for working with me to find an acceptable offset for this \nlegislation, which would have had an impact on the National Energy \nTechnology Laboratory, NETL, located in West Virginia. NETL does \ncritically important research on improving the safety and environmental \nsustainability of offshore oil and gas development and importantly for \nmy State they are working on identifying measures that can be taken to \nreduce the environmental impact and improve the safety of shale gas \nproduction. I am pleased that we will be able to switch out the \nobjectionable offset and move this bill forward quickly as soon as we \nreturn from recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5950-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, the Disabilities Convention enjoys strong \nbipartisan support in the Senate, with Senators McCain, Durbin, Kerry, \nBarrasso, Coons, Tom Udall, Moran, and Harkin leading the charge to \nratify the Convention. With their help, I hope we will be able to move \nthis treaty forward in the future.\n  Twenty-two years ago, Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities \nAct to lift the barriers Americans with disabilities faced in everyday \nlife. And ever since the passage of that law, the United States has \nbeen a leader in expanding disability rights across the globe.\n  We have led, other countries have followed, and persons with \ndisabilities have found ever greater opportunities to succeed. Now we \nare presented with an opportunity to strengthen our leadership on \ndisability rights around the world by joining the Convention on the \nRights of Persons with Disabilities.\n  This convention is another step towards ensuring that all people with \na disability, in any country, are treated with dignity and given the \nright to achieve to their full potential.\n  Let me read part of a recent statement to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee from one of my esteemed predecessors, former Senate Majority \nLeader Bob Dole, recipient of two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star for \nheroic achievement, who was wounded fighting for our country in World \nWar II.\n\n       U.S. ratification of the [Convention] will improve \n     physical, technological and communication access outside the \n     U.S., thereby helping to ensure that Americans--particularly, \n     many thousands of disabled American veterans--have equal \n     opportunities to live, work, and travel abroad. . . . An \n     active U.S. presence in implementation of global disability \n     rights will promote the market for devices such as \n     wheelchairs, smart phones,\n\n[[Page S5951]]\n\n     and other new technologies engineered, made, and sold by U.S. \n     corporations.\n\n  This convention will help U.S. citizens and veterans abroad, and U.S. \nbusinesses here at home. And it won't cost us anything. It won't \nrequire any changes to existing U.S. law and or new contributions to \nthe United Nations.\n  As we watch the Olympics this week and admire the incredible feats of \nall of the athletes, we are reminded of what each of us can achieve.\n  Just look at Oscar Pistorius from South Africa--also known as the--\n``Blade Runner,'' who this Saturday will run the 400-meter sprint in \nthe Olympics on carbon-fiber legs.\n  Or watch Jessica Long, an American gold-medal bilateral amputee \nswimmer, participate in her third Paralympics Games at the age of 20.\n  This convention will help make the path smoother for Olympians such \nas Oscar and Jessica.\n  It has the support of veterans group and disability groups from \naround the Nation. It has the strong backing of a bipartisan group of \nSenators as well as leading Republicans such as President George H.W. \nBush and Senator Dole.\n  Just like passing the Americans with Disabilities Act, ratifying this \nConvention is, quite simply, the right thing to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5951-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5951-S5952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING PHILIP PENDLETON ARDERY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nhonored Kentuckian and a man of great accomplishment who leaves behind \na towering legacy of service with his passing. Mr. Philip Pendleton \nArdery of Louisville, KY, passed away on July 26, 2012, at his home. He \nwas 98 years old.\n  Mr. Ardery's life story reads like a well-written novel of action, \nsuspense, and drama or several novels, given how much living he packed \ninto his 98 years. A war hero, philanthropist, author, public servant, \nand committed flag bearer of New Deal liberalism, he made such a \nprofound impact on my hometown of Louisville, the Commonwealth of \nKentucky, and our Nation that I feel compelled to come to the floor and \nsay a few words about his passing.\n  I have great admiration and respect for Phil and his remarkable life. \nThat may surprise some, given that he and I did not have a lot in \ncommon with respect to our political or ideological views. I am certain \nthat much of what I have done in my career in public life did not \nplease him one bit. Having said that, every American, no matter where \nyou stand on the political spectrum, has to recognize the extent of \nPhilip Ardery's commitment to service. Service was the watchword of his \nlife, be it service to State, Nation, or those less well off than \nhimself.\n  Phil was born in 1914 in Lexington, KY, the son of William \nBreckinridge and Julia Hoge Spencer Ardery. Later in life, he moved to \na farm on the Paris-Lexington Pike. His youth in Bourbon County forever \nleft an imprint on him, and he loved to share his love for the area \nwith others.\n  Phil graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Kentucky in 1935 \nand graduated from Harvard Law School in 1938. Also in his Harvard Law \nclass was Phil's boyhood friend from Bourbon County, Edward F. \nPrichard, Jr.\n  After law school, Phil joined the Army Air Corps, and during World \nWar II he became a B-24 squadron commander. Phil flew a full combat \ntour of 25 missions, dropping bombs on Norway, Austria, Crete, Italy, \nFrance, Belgium, and Holland. He then volunteered for one more mission \non D-day and commanded a division of about 200 pilots. For his bravery \nin uniform, Phil was awarded the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying \nCross, and the French Croix de Guerre. He later wrote a book about his \nwar exploits, called ``Bomber Pilot: A Memoir of World War II.''\n  While still training as a pilot in Texas, Phil met the woman who \nwould become his wife, Anne Stuyvesant Tweedy. Together they had four \nchildren. They married on December 6, 1941, the day before the attack \non Pearl Harbor.\n  After the war, Phil practiced law with a focus on representing the \nelectric cooperatives bringing power and lights to rural Kentucky. A \nloyalist of Franklin D. Roosevelt's, he would remain committed to the \nideals of New Deal liberalism for the rest of his life. He ran for \noffice a few times, including in the Democratic primary for a Senate \nseat in 1946 and in the general election for the House of \nRepresentatives seat from Kentucky's Third District in 1956. He lost \nboth those races, but did win a race for Jefferson County Fiscal Court \nin 1958.\n  Meanwhile, Phil's longtime friend and Harvard Law School classmate \nEdward F. Prichard, Jr., was having quite the political career in \nPresident Roosevelt's administration. Known in Kentucky as ``the boy \nwonder,'' it was a near certainty that Prichard would run for Governor \nor Senator someday, and almost surely win.\n  But a dramatic twist that would ruin the two men's friendship caused \nthat not to be. Prichard came to Phil and confessed to him that he had \nparticipated in a crime. Phil took Prichard to Phil's father, who was a \nBourbon County circuit judge at the time, to relate his story. This \nchain of events eventually led to Prichard's conviction of stuffing the \nballot box in the State's 1946 election. He was sentenced to 2 years in \nFederal prison.\n  In yet another book Phil wrote, a memoir titled ``Heroes and Horses: \nTales of the Bluegrass,'' Phil wrote that it was not Edward's crime in \nand of itself that created the rift between the two friends, but his \npublic denial of wrongdoing. ``That put [him] in the position of making \nmy father appear to be a liar,'' Phil wrote. ``So Prich and I had to be \nenemies.''\n  This story does, however, have a happy ending. Although friction \nremained between the Ardery and Prichard families, in 1976, Prichard \nfinally admitted his guilt in a newspaper interview. In 1984, Ardery \nreached out to his old friend, who was by then blind due to diabetes. \nPhil paid the expenses for the two men to visit Harvard for a \ncelebration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of their former law \nprofessor, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter.\n  After watching a friend's son struggle with schizophrenia, Phil \nhelped found what has become Wellspring, a network of 19 facilities \nthat provides housing and rehabilitation to people with severe and \npersistent mental illness. Wellspring has helped more than 6,000 people \nover its 30 years in existence, thanks in large part to millions of \ndollars raised by Phil.\n  Phil also helped found the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation, a \nnational mental health research group that has awarded roughly $300 \nmillion in grants to scientists around the world in the past 25 years.\n  Phil served as the first commander of the Kentucky Air National \nGuard, and led it during the Korean War in England, where he served as \na NATO wing base station commander. He retired with the rank of major \ngeneral in 1965. As a pilot in London, he met and befriended famous \nnames like Edward R. Murrow and T.S. Eliot.\n  Phil's many philanthropic activities also include service as director \nand president of the Frazier Rehab Center, as a director of the Jewish \nHospital Health Care Systems, and as a member of the Kentucky Horse \nPark Foundation, the Kentucky Humanities Council, and the executive \ncommittee of the Kentucky Historical Society. He was the chairman of \nthe American Heart Association and the Kentucky Heart Association.\n  I know several members of the Ardery family well, and I want to \nconvey my and Elaine's deepest condolences to all those who knew and \nloved Philip Ardery. We are particularly thinking today of his wife, \nAnne; his son and daughter-in-law Joseph and Anne; his son and \ndaughter-in-law Philip and Cecilia; his daughter and son-in-law Julia \nand William; several grandchildren; and many other beloved family \nmembers and friends. Phil was preceded in death by his son Peter.\n  As I hope I have made clear, Philip Ardery packed an amazing amount \nof success and accomplishment in his long and rich life. We can be \ngrateful that such a devoted public servant was granted so much life on \nthis Earth to do his good works. There is no doubt that thousands of \npeople--from the rural Kentuckian who needed electricity, to the \nbeneficiaries of his charitable work, to the many whose lives were \nsaved thanks to his service in uniform--have reason to be thankful for \nMr. Ardery.\n\n[[Page S5952]]\n\n  I would ask my Senate colleagues to join me in commemorating his \ncommitment to service and in extending sympathies to the Ardery family. \nThe Commonwealth of Kentucky will be proud to remember the life and \ndeeds of Mr. Philip Pendleton Ardery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5952-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING JANIE CATRON\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise in memory of Janie Catron \nof Corbin, KY. Elaine and I mourn the passing of our dear friend Janie, \nwho served as my field representative in eastern Kentucky for many \nyears when I was first elected to the Senate. She was a great friend \nand she will be missed. Elaine and I send our condolences to Janie's \nfamily and to all those who knew her.\n  Born on July 2, 1940, in Eubank, KY, to Jesse and Pauline Griffin, \nJanie was a registered nurse by trade. She was ordained in the Sacred \nOrder of Deacons with the Episcopal Diocese of Lexington and began \nserving as Chaplain of St. Agnes House. She also was my eastern \nKentucky field representative for 10 years.\n  Always interested in politics, Janie was active her whole life in \ncivic service to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. In 1977, she was named \nthe Fifth District governor of the Kentucky Federation of Empowered \nWomen. She, besides aiding me in eastern Kentucky, was active in the \nState central committee and even became secretary of the committee. In \nrecognition of her dedication to Kentucky and the Republican Party, in \n1995, she was inducted into the Fifth District Lincoln Hall of Fame, \nwhich honors Kentuckians who have committed to promoting the values of \nthe Republican Party.\n  Yet, Janie's legacy is greater than her career and political \nrecognitions. As a pastor, she will be remembered as a woman who aided \nthose around her and helped improve their lives. As a mother, she will \nbe remembered as a selfless woman who always loved her children. As a \nfriend, I will forever admire how hard she worked for the people she \nloved and the causes in which she believed.\n  Today, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in extending \ncondolences to Janie Catron's children, family, and friends. The Times \nTribune, a publication from Whitley County, KY, published an obituary \nthat highlighted Janie's life achievements. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that said article appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From the Times Tribune, July 10, 2012]\n\n                              Janie Catron\n\n       Reverend Janie G. Catron, 72, of Lexington, passed away \n     Sunday, July 8, 2012, at the University of Kentucky Chandler \n     Medical Center in Lexington.\n       Janie was born on July 2, 1940, in Eubank, daughter of the \n     late Jesse and Pauline Griffin. She was a member of the \n     Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd in Lexington. Janie was \n     ordained in the Sacred Order of Deacons with The Episcopal \n     Diocese of Lexington, where she served as a chaplain of St. \n     Agnes House. She was very devout to her calling and held a \n     particular interest in pastoral care. She was selfless and \n     giving in her actions, words, and deeds, and genuinely \n     enjoyed helping to improve the lives of those around her. A \n     registered nurse by profession, she also enjoyed Kentucky \n     politics and worked for 10 years as the eastern Kentucky \n     field representative for U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell. She will \n     be fondly missed by all who knew her.\n       Janie is survived by her children, Frances Catron Cadle \n     (Ron), Lexington; Reba Catron Beirise (Tim), Lexington; Dr. \n     Charles Paul Catron (Nicky), Vidalia, Ga.; and James Catron \n     (Lillian), London; a sister, Kay Denham (Jackson), Somerset; \n     a brother, Jeff Griffin (Sue), Eubank; one daughter-in-law, \n     Sharon Wagers, Rome, Ga.; grandchildren, Matthew Alexander, \n     Caneyville; Laura Catron, Lexington; Frank Thomas, Frankfort; \n     Frank H. ``Hank'' Catron III, Rome, Ga.; Takoda and Emily \n     Hacker, London; Mary Lauren and Julia Catron, Vidalia, Ga.; \n     and one great-grandchild, Collin Alexander, Southshore; along \n     with a host of family and friends.\n       She was preceded in death by her son Frank H. ``Casey'' \n     Catron Jr.\n       Visitation will be held today (Tuesday, July 10, 2012) at \n     Kerr Brothers Funeral Home, 3421 Harrodsburg Rd., Lexington, \n     Ky. from 5 to 8 p.m.\n       A celebration of Janie's life will be held on Wednesday, \n     July 11, 2012, at 10 a.m. at The Church of the Good Shepherd, \n     533 E.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life of Mr. \nMorgan French, of Radcliff, KY, who passed away in February 2012 at the \nage of 92. The U.S. Army's Warrior Transition Battalion at Fort Knox \nwill soon be honoring Morgan by naming its barracks after him. Today, I \nwould like to pay tribute to this American hero.\n  Originally from Perryville, KY, Morgan was a military veteran who \npersonified the ``greatest generation.'' He served in the U.S. Army \nwith the renowned ``Harrodsburg Tankers,'' Company D of the 192nd Tank \nBattalion. The Harrodsburg Tankers--including Morgan and his brother, \nEdward--were in the Philippines' Bataan Peninsula in the spring of 1942 \nand came under heavy attack by Japanese forces. Morgan's brother, \nEdward, was killed and Morgan was taken as a prisoner of war, POW, by \nJapanese troops. He spent nearly three-and-a-half years of his life as \na POW, enduring extreme conditions and harsh treatment. This brave \nKentuckian maintained hope and courage throughout these hardships and \nwas finally liberated by Allied Forces in September 1945. Morgan's \nmilitary service did not end with World War II, however. Following his \nnearly three-and-a-half years as a POW, he returned to active duty, \nserved two tours in the Korean War, and became a member of the Kentucky \nNational Guard. Morgan retired from the military in 1962 after 23 years \nof service. He continued to work selflessly as a civilian, teaching at \nthe U.S. Army Armor School at Fort Knox until 1984.\n  Morgan and his wife, Maxine--who preceded him in death--made Radcliff \ntheir home for almost half a century. I can't think of a more fitting \ntribute than for the U.S. Army to name the Warrior Transition Battalion \nbarracks at Fort Knox after Morgan French, an American hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5952-3", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5952-S5954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               STOCK ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

John Conyers, Jr.,\n     Ranking Member of the House Committee on the Judiciary, House \n         of Representatives.\n       Dear Congressional Leaders: We are writing to express \n     concern about section 11 of the Stop Trading in Congressional \n     Knowledge Act (the STOCK Act), which requires that the \n     financial disclosure forms of senior executive branch \n     officials be posted on the Internet by August 31. While we \n     agree that the government should have access to the financial \n     information of its senior officials to ensure the integrity \n     of government decision making, we strongly urge that Congress \n     immediately pass legislation allowing an exception from the \n     Internet posting requirement for certain executive branch \n     officials, in order to protect the national security and the \n     personal safety of these officials and their families.\n       The STOCK Act was intended to stop insider trading by \n     Members of Congress. However, section 11 of the Act, which \n     was added without any public hearings or consideration of \n     national security or personnel safety implications, requires \n     that financial data of over 28,000 executive branch officials \n     throughout the U.S. government, including members of the U.S. \n     military and career diplomats, law enforcement officials, and \n     officials in sensitive national security jobs in the Defense \n     Department, State Department and other agencies, be posted on \n     their agency websites.\n       It is not clear what public purpose is served by inclusion \n     of Section 11. We are not aware that any transparency \n     concerns have been raised about the adequacy of the existing \n     review process for executive branch officials, most of whom \n     have devoted their careers to public service. For several \n     decades, executive branch officials have prepared and \n     submitted SF-278 financial disclosure forms to their \n     employing agencies. The completed forms and the extensive \n     financial data they contain are carefully reviewed by agency \n     ethics officers in light of the specific responsibilities of \n     the officials submitting them in order to identify and \n     eliminate potential conflicts of interest. Although the forms \n     may be requested by members of the public, they are not \n     published in hard-copy or on the Internet. Moreover, \n     individuals requesting copies of the forms must provide their \n     names, occupation, and contact information. Agencies \n     generally notify the filing officials about who has requested \n     their personal financial information.\n       In contrast, Section 11 of the STOCK Act would require that \n     the financial disclosure forms of executive branch officials \n     be posted on each agency's website and that a government-wide \n     database be created containing the SF-278s that would be \n     searchable and sortable without the use of a login or any \n     other screening process to control or monitor access to this \n     personal information.\n       We believe that this new uncontrolled disclosure scheme for \n     executive branch officials will create significant threats to \n     the national security and to the personal safety and \n     financial security of executive branch officials and their \n     families, especially career employees. Placing complete \n     personal financial information of all senior officials on the \n     Internet would be a jackpot for enemies of the United States \n     intent on finding security vulnerabilities they can exploit. \n     SF-278 forms include a treasure trove of personal financial \n     information: the location and value of employees' savings and \n     checking accounts and certificates of deposit; a full \n     valuation and listing of their investment portfolio; a \n     listing of real estate assets and their value; a listing of \n     debts, debt amounts, and creditors; and the signatures of the \n     filers. SF-278s include financial information not only about \n     the filing employee, but also about the employee's spouse and \n     dependent children.\n       Posting this detailed financial information on the Internet \n     will jeopardize the safety of executive branch officials--\n     including military, diplomatic, law enforcement, and \n     potentially intelligence officials--and their families who \n     are posted or travel in dangerous areas, especially in \n     certain countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Embassy \n     and military security officers already advise these officials \n     to post no personal identifying information on the Internet. \n     Publishing the financial assets of these officials will allow \n     foreign governments, and terrorist or criminal groups to \n     specifically target these officials or their families for \n     kidnapping, harassment, manipulation of financial assets, and \n     other abuse.\n       Equally important, the detailed personal financial \n     information--particularly detailed information about debts \n     and creditors--contained in the SF-278s of senior officials \n     is precisely the information that foreign intelligence \n     services and other adversaries spend billions of dollars \n     every year to uncover as they look for information that can \n     be used to harass, intimidate and blackmail those in the \n     government with access to classified information. Yet under \n     the STOCK Act, these SF-278s will be placed on the Internet \n     for any foreign government or group to access without \n     disclosing their identity or purpose and with no notice to \n     the employees or their agencies. We should not hand on a \n     silver platter to foreign intelligence services information \n     that could be used to compromise or harass career public \n     servants who have access to the most sensitive information \n     held by the U.S. government.\n       Section 11 could also jeopardize the safety and security of \n     other executive branch officials, such as federal prosecutors \n     and others who are tracking down and bringing to justice \n     domestic organized crime gangs and foreign terrorists. Crime \n     gangs could easily target the families of prosecutors with \n     substantial assets or debts for physical attacks or threats.\n       Finally, publishing detailed banking and brokerage \n     information of executive branch officials, especially with \n     their signatures, is likely to invite hacking, financial \n     attacks, and identity theft of these officials and their \n     families, particularly by groups or individuals who may be \n     affected by their governmental work.\n       Given these inevitable adverse national security \n     consequences, we urge you to amend the STOCK Act to protect \n     U.S. national security interests and the safety of executive \n     branch officials by creating an exception from the \n     requirements of Section 11 for senior executive branch \n     officials with security clearances. The exception should also \n     apply to other officials based on a determination by an \n     agency head that an exception is necessary to protect the \n     safety of the official or the official's family. At the very \n     minimum, Congress should act to delay implementation of \n     Section 11 until the national security and personal safety \n     implications can be fully evaluated.\n       If the financial disclosure forms of senior executive \n     officials are actually posted on the Internet in August, \n     there will be irreparable damage to U.S. national security \n     interests, and many senior executives and their families may \n     be placed in danger. This issue is too important to be \n     trapped in partisan politics. We urge Congress to act \n     swiftly, before the Congress goes on its summer recess on \n     August 6.\n           Sincerely,\n       Richard Armitage, Deputy Secretary of State, 2001-2005; \n     John B.

Mr. President, in January of this year the President \nof the United States made several appointments without obtaining the \nSenate's advice and consent. He asserted that the Recess Appointments \nClause of the Constitution authorized these appointments, even though \nthe Senate was conducting a series of pro forma sessions at the time of \nthe appointments. According to the administration, these pro forma \nsessions had no legal effect on the President's authority under this \nClause because pro forma sessions do not allow the Senate to perform \nits constitutional functions or conduct business. The Congressional \nResearch Service has found, however, that pro forma sessions, such as \nthe ones occurring during the time of these so-called recess \nappointments, have satisfied--and continue to satisfy--numerous \nConstitutional, statutory, and legislative requirements, and that the \nSenate, in fact, has conducted business during such sessions. The \nCongressional Research Service also has found that the administration \nhas repeatedly recognized the legal validity of pro forma sessions for \npurposes of satisfying these various requirements. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the analysis of the Congressional Research Service from \nMarch 8, 2012 entitled ``Certain Questions Related to Pro Forma \nSessions of the Senate'' be printed in the Record following this \nstatement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Congressional Research Service,\n\n                                                    March 8, 2012.\n     MEMORANDUM\n     To: Senate Minority Leader\n     From: Christopher M. Davis, Analyst on Congress and the \n         Legislative Process, 7-0656\n     Subject: Certain Questions Related to Pro Forma Sessions of \n         the Senate\n       This memorandum responds to your request for information \n     about certain pro forma sessions of the Senate. Specifically, \n     you asked CRS to identify instances in which a pro forma \n     session of the Senate might be interpreted as accomplishing \n     some further end in addition to meeting the constitutional \n     requirement that neither chamber recess or adjourn for \n     extended periods without the permission of the other.\n\n\n                Pro Forma Sessions of Congress Generally\n\n       Under Article I, Section 5, Clause 4 of the Constitution, \n     neither chamber of Congress may adjourn or recess for more \n     than three days without the consent of the other. In \n     calculating such a three day period, either the day of \n     adjourning or the day of convening must be included. Sundays \n     are excluded from the calculation, being considered a dies \n     non under longstanding parliamentary law.\n       A chamber can adjourn within the three day limit, for \n     example, from Thursday to Monday, or from Friday to Tuesday, \n     by simply adopting a motion. Should a chamber wish to leave \n     for a longer period, however, the other chamber must consent \n     to the absence. Historically, for such purposes, the two \n     houses have most often adopted a concurrent resolution \n     through which each consents to the absence of the other for a \n     specified period.\n       In the normal course of business, party leaders in one or \n     both chambers may wish to schedule periods of absence that \n     exceed the three day constitutional limit by only a short \n     period, perhaps by as little as one day. It is not uncommon, \n     for example, for the House or Senate to adjourn from Thursday \n     to Tuesday, or from Friday to Wednesday. In instances of this \n     type, the chambers have evolved a practice of holding a short \n     session sometime during the absence to comply with the \n     constitutional limit described above. Such ``pro forma'' \n     sessions, or sessions held for the sake of formality, allow a \n     chamber to comply with the Constitution but not expend the \n     time or trouble of acting on an adjournment resolution. In \n     most cases, little or no business is conducted during such \n     sessions because it is generally understood that few Members \n     are present, and that the primary purpose of the meeting \n     is to obviate the need to agree to an adjournment \n     resolution. The Senate often adopts an order by unanimous \n     consent which specifies that such a meeting or series of \n     meetings is to be pro forma and that no legislative \n     business is to be conducted on such days.\n       It is important to note that the term pro forma describes \n     the reason for holding the session, it does not distinguish \n     the nature of the session itself. In common congressional \n     usage, Members and staff often use the term pro forma as \n     being synonymous with a session at which no business will be \n     conducted. While the primary purpose of a pro forma session \n     of the Senate may be to comply with the constitutional \n     strictures on adjournment, a pro forma session is not \n     materially different from other Senate sessions. While, as \n     noted above, the Senate has customarily agreed not to conduct \n     business during pro forma sessions, no rule or constitutional \n     provision imposes this restriction. Should the Senate choose \n     to conduct legislative or executive business at a pro forma \n     session, it could, providing it could assemble the necessary \n     quorum or gain the consent of all Senators to act. The House \n     of Representatives, which is bound by the same constitutional \n     requirements as the Senate, regularly permits business on pro \n     forma days, including the introduction and referral of \n     legislation, the filing of committee reports and \n     cosponsorship forms, and the receipt and referral of \n     executive communications and Presidential messages. Even in \n     cases in which the Senate has agreed not to conduct business \n     at a pro forma session, it could subsequently adopt a second \n     consent agreement which would permit them do so.\n\n\n   Other Motivations or Purposes for Pro Forma Sessions of the Senate\n\n       While the primary purpose of a pro forma session of the \n     Senate has been to comply with the constitutional limits on \n     adjournments and recesses, it is possible that such meetings, \n     being sessions of the Senate, may have additional purposes as \n     well. At your request, CRS examined pro forma sessions of the \n     Senate which occurred between the 109th Congress (2005-2006) \n     and the present as well as the opening day of each Senate \n     session between 1934 and the present, in order to identify \n     sessions which may have satisfied some other purpose in \n     addition to compliance with Article I, Section 5, Clause 4 of \n     the Constitution. On the basis of these data, CRS identified \n     two pro forma sessions at which legislative business was \n     conducted, three periods of pro forma sessions that allowed \n     the Senate to avoid returning nominations to the President, \n     and six pro forma days that satisfied the constitutional or \n     statutory requirement that the Senate convene a new session. \n     In addition, both the Senate and the Executive Branch take \n     pro forma sessions into account in calculating various \n     required time periods pursuant to expedited procedure \n     statutes. The following sections discuss each of these \n     categories in turn.\n       The instances cited in this memorandum cannot be said to be \n     exhaustive, but are intended to underscore the idea that pro \n     forma Senate sessions may be motivated by factors other than \n     complying with the constitutional limit on adjournments, and \n     may satisfy the requirements of other procedural authorities, \n     including other provisions of the Constitution, Senate rules, \n     and statutes.\n\n\n     Pro Forma Sessions At Which Legislative Business Was Conducted\n\n       Using information from the Legislative Information System \n     of the U.S. Congress (LIS) and relevant issues of the daily \n     Congressional Record and Senate Calendar of Business, CRS \n     identified 114 pro forma sessions of the Senate which \n     occurred between January 4, 2005 and March 8, 2012. These pro \n     forma sessions are identified in Table 1.\n       Of these 114 pro forma meetings of the Senate, CRS \n     identified two at which legislative business appears to have \n     been conducted. On both of these occasions, the two houses \n     had agreed to no adjournment resolution, so that the Senate \n     was required to meet in order to avoid violating the \n     constitutional prohibition on absences of more than three \n     days length. The days in question are:\n       December 23, 2011: On this day, the Senate adopted an order \n     by unanimous consent which provided for Senate passage of a \n     H.R. 3765, a House measure extending the, ``payroll tax, \n     unemployment insurance, TANF, and the Medicare payment fix.'' \n     The consent order further provided that upon receiving a \n     message from the House of Representatives requesting a \n     conference with the Senate on H.R. 3630, the Middle Class Tax \n     Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, the Senate agree to the \n     request, and the Senate presiding officer be authorized to \n     appoint Senate conferees with a party ratio of 4-3. An \n     enrolled measure was also signed on this day by Sen. Reid, \n     serving as Acting President Pro Tempore.\n       August 5, 2011: On this day, the Senate, by unanimous \n     consent, passed H.R. 2553, a measure to amend the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the funding and expenditure \n     authority of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund and to amend \n     title 49, United States Code, to extend the airport \n     improvement program.\n       In the first instance cited above, the previous meeting of \n     the Senate had occurred on Tuesday, December 20, 2011. In the \n     second instance, the Senate had most recently met on Tuesday, \n     August 2, 2011. At both of these pro forma sessions, pursuant \n     to unanimous consent orders adopted by the Senate, no \n     legislative or executive business was to be conducted. The \n     Senate subsequently, however,\n\n[[Page S5955]]\n\n     decided to conduct business during the session.\n\n\nPro Forma Sessions Which Satisfied Senate Rules Governing the Return of \n                        Presidential Nominations\n\n       CRS also identified three distinct periods of recent pro \n     forma Senate session which, in addition to satisfying the \n     constitutional limits on recesses and adjournments discussed \n     above, also seemed to satisfy provisions of the Senate's \n     standing rules related to the consideration of presidential \n     nominations. Paragraph 6 of Senate Rule XXXI, states in part:\n       . . . if the Senate shall adjourn or take a recess for more \n     than thirty days, all nominations pending and not finally \n     acted upon at the time of taking such adjournment or recess \n     shall be returned by the Secretary to the President, and \n     shall not again be considered unless they shall again be made \n     to the Senate by the President.\n       In short, unless the Senate takes action (such as adopting \n     a unanimous consent request) to override the provisions of \n     Rule XXXI, the Senate Executive Clerk is supposed to return \n     all nominations to the President at the outset of any period \n     in which the Senate is to be absent for more than thirty \n     calendar days.\n       In the three instances identified, the Senate held only pro \n     forma meetings during periods in excess of thirty days. In \n     each period, however, nominations were not returned to the \n     President pursuant to Rule XXXI. It seems apparent that the \n     Senate viewed its occasional pro forma meetings as a means of \n     preventing a recess of more than thirty days for purposes of \n     these requirements of it rules. Arguably, the Executive \n     Branch, not having had its nominations returned to it as \n     would be the well-established practice, was also at least \n     aware of the Senate's understanding in this regard. The three \n     periods in question identified are:\n       August 2--September 6, 2011: The Senate held pro forma \n     sessions during this 34-day period of recess. No unanimous \n     consent agreement was identified to hold pending nominations \n     in status quo and they were not returned to the President.\n       September 29--November 15, 2010: The Senate held pro forma \n     sessions during this 47-day period of recess. No unanimous \n     consent agreement was identified as being adopted prior to \n     the recess to hold pending nominations in status quo and they \n     were not returned to the President.\n       2008-2009: The Senate held pro forma sessions during three \n     relevant periods of recess in 2008-2009: August 1-September \n     8, 2008 (31 days); October 2-November 17, 2008 (46 days); and \n     November 20, 2008-January 3, 2009, the balance of the 110th \n     Congress (43 days). Consequently, although no unanimous \n     agreement was identified as having been adopted in 2008 to \n     hold pending nominations in status quo, they were not \n     returned to the President until the sine die adjournment of \n     the Congress.\n\n\n  Pro Forma Sessions of the Senate Which Satisfied the 20th Amendment\n\n       CRS also identified six pro forma meetings of the Senate \n     which satisfied the provisions of Clause 2 of the 20th \n     Amendment to the Constitution.\n       Clause two of the 20th amendment to the Constitution \n     states:\n       The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, \n     and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of \n     January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day.\n       At your request, CRS examined the opening day session of \n     each regular and special session of the Senate held between \n     1934 and the present, the period coinciding with the period \n     that paragraph 2 of the 20th Amendment has been in force. CRS \n     identified six Senate pro forma opening day sessions which \n     satisfied the constitutional requirements for convening its \n     session on the prescribed date. These opening day pro forma \n     sessions were:\n       January 3, 1980\n       January 3, 1992\n       January 3, 2006\n       January 3, 2008\n       January 5, 2010\n       January 3, 2012\n       With one exception, the January 3, 1980 session, each of \n     these meetings was pro forma in nature, with no legislative \n     or organizational business conducted. In the case of the \n     January 3, 1980 session, the Senate referred a previously-\n     received message from President Jimmy Carter transmitting his \n     veto of S. 2096, a bill to provide for a study by the \n     Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare of the long-term \n     health effects in humans of exposure to dioxins. In addition, \n     five Senators inserted undelivered remarks in the \n     Congressional Record on this day. The approximate duration of \n     the January 3, 1980 session of the Senate was two minutes.\n\n\n Pro Forma Sessions Count for Purposes of Computing Certain Statutory \n                              Time Periods\n\n       Finally, CRS has identified several rules enacted in \n     statute under which pro forma sessions are treated as \n     sessions of the Senate like any other for purposes of \n     computing certain time periods related to actions taken by \n     Congress and the President. Pro forma Senate sessions satisfy \n     not only the limits on recesses and adjournments contained in \n     Article I, Section 5, Clause 4, but also the provisions of \n     each of these statutory rules in the eyes of both the \n     Executive and Legislative Branches.\n       Congress sometimes chooses to include in law provisions \n     which delegate to the President or another Executive Branch \n     official the authority to issue a regulation or take some \n     other specified action. As part of this delegation of \n     authority, Congress often reserves the right in the law to \n     pass its own judgment on the proposed regulation or action, \n     typically by passing a joint resolution to approve or \n     disapprove it before it takes effect. To facilitate action on \n     such a joint resolution, Congress often writes into law \n     special parliamentary procedures for considering the measure, \n     including strict time periods for the introduction, committee \n     action, and floor consideration of such a joint resolution. \n     Such statutory procedures are often colloquially referred to \n     as ``fast track'' procedures because they expedite the \n     consideration of specified legislation in one or both \n     chambers.\n       Time periods under such statutory rules are usually \n     calculated in one of two ways. The first way marks time by \n     counting days of ``House/Senate session.'' Under such a \n     mechanism, any day which the House or Senate meets counts \n     toward the deadline established by the law. Under the terms \n     of the Congressional Review Act, for example, the Senate has \n     60 days of ``Senate session'' to act under fast track \n     procedures on a joint resolution which would disapprove a \n     proposed rule promulgated by the Executive Branch. Both \n     branches understand and have agreed to this time period for \n     expedited action before a proposed agency rule can enter into \n     force. When calculating time periods under statutory rules of \n     this type, pro forma sessions of the Senate count as days of \n     Senate session; that is, they are viewed as a session of the \n     Senate like any other.\n       The second way of counting time which is common in such \n     statutory rules is known as counting ``days of continuous \n     session.'' This way of calculating time periods takes into \n     account the differing schedules of the House and Senate. When \n     counting days of continuous session, every calendar day is \n     counted, including Sundays and holidays, and the count pauses \n     only when either the House or Senate (or both) have adjourned \n     for more than three days pursuant to an adjournment \n     resolution. For example, under the terms of the Defense Base \n     Closure and Realignment Act of 1990, the Secretary of Defense \n     may not close or realign any of the specified military \n     installations until 45 ``days of continuous session'' have \n     elapsed after a base closure plan is submitted to the House \n     and Senate. As with the Congressional Review Act described \n     above, both the Legislative and Executive Branch understand \n     and have agreed to be bound by this manner of counting.\n       As with days of Senate session, pro forma meetings of the \n     Senate are also taken into account by both branches when \n     calculating ``days of continuous session'' for purposes of \n     such statutory rules. Should the Senate meet in a series of \n     pro forma sessions, a statutory ``days of continuous \n     session'' clock would continue to run not only on the days of \n     the pro forma sessions themselves, but also during the \n     intervals of three or fewer days between the pro forma \n     sessions, when the Senate was absent but formally in recess.\n       CRS has identified 22 statutory legislative procedures now \n     in law which calculate time periods in either or both of the \n     ways discussed above and which take pro forma days of Senate \n     session into account in conducting a specific calculation. \n     These statutory rules are:\n       Executive Reorganization Authority (5 U.S.C. 902-912). \n     (Days of continuous session);\n       District of Columbia Home Rule Act, 303(b), 602(c), 604. \n     (Days of continuous session);\n       Title X of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control \n     Act of 1974, 1011-13, 1017.

About 2 weeks ago, I visited a farm near my home town of \nSpringfield, IL to see the impact of the ongoing drought.\n  From the road, I couldn't tell there was anything wrong with the \ncrop.\n  But as we went into the field, it quickly became clear that the crop \nwas in poor shape.\n  Following that visit, I met with the Illinois corn growers and the \nsoybean growers and farmers from across the state.\n  The message I heard was straightforward; it is as bad or worse than \nit has been in decades.\n  Since that visit to a Springfield farm, drought conditions have only \ngotten worse.\n  100 percent of Illinois and 64 percent of the country is facing \nsevere or harsher drought conditions.\n  Today, USDA announced 66 additional Illinois counties as primary \ndisaster counties.\n  With this announcement, all but four counties, Will, Cook, Kane, \nDuPage--in Illinois qualify for disaster assistance\n  Very little rain, combined with abnormally high temperatures, is \ndecimating many of the primary crop-growing areas of the country.\n  71 percent of the corn crop and 56 percent of the soybean crop in \nIllinois is rated as poor or very poor.\n  This is in a State that regularly ranks as a top producer for both of \nthese commodities.\n  That means feed prices for livestock and eventually food prices for \nthe rest of us are increasing.\n  Everyone is going to feel the impact of this historic drought\n  In response to conditions on the ground, Governor Quinn created a \nmulti-agency drought task force in Illinois.\n  The task force is coordinating State and Federal resources to ensure \nproducers and communities are receiving the timely assistance.\n  President Obama and Secretary Vilsack have done a commendable job of \ntaking steps to help provide assistance to impacted producers and \ncommunities.\n  They have sped up the disaster declaration process helping producers \nmore quickly gain access to the limited disaster programs currently \navailable.\n  They have reduced interest rates on emergency loans.\n  They have made it easier for land that is in conservation to open \nearlier for haying and grazing for livestock producers.\n  And the administration is working with crop insurance companies to \ntry to give producers more time to make premium payments.\n  But we can do more.\n  And since we can't make rain, the single most important step Congress \ncan take is to pass a farm bill.\n  Most farmers will tell you they can survive one bad year.\n  But right now farmers can't even plan for future years.\n  More than a month ago, the Senate passed the Local Food, Farms, and \nJobs Act, more commonly known as the farm bill, with a 64--35 \nbipartisan vote.\n  The bill would reauthorize several expired disaster programs to \nimmediately help producers.\n  Equally, if not more important, the bill would provide certainty for \nproducers--allowing them to make long-term plans for getting through \nthis drought and recovering from a bad year.\n  Unfortunately the House has failed to act.\n  In the roughly 40 days since the Senate passed a bill, the House has \nnot even brought a companion measure to the House floor. During those \n40 days another 20 percent of the country has developed drought \nconditions. During those 40 days, 98 of 102 counties in Illinois \nqualified for disaster assistance. During those 40 days, many farmers \nin Illinois have lost their crops.\n  It is well past time for the House to take up and pass a farm bill \nthat includes robust disaster assistance paired with the long-term \npolicy farmers need.\n  I will repeat something I said 2 weeks ago.\n  Our producers and rural America already face a natural disaster. I \ndon't think it is too much that we spare them a manmade disaster by \nfailing to pass a farm bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5956-2", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5956-S5957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEATH OF OSWALDO PAYA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, some of you may have seen in the press \nlast week that an inspiring Cuban citizen who tirelessly fought for a \npeaceful transition to democracy recently died in a tragic car accident \non that island.\n  Oswaldo Paya was a modest man. A brave man. A hero. A Cuban patriot.\n\n[[Page S5957]]\n\n  And he was also very wise.\n  He realized that one of the best ways to change the cruel and \nrepressive Cuban regime was to work from within.\n  He used a provision in Cuba's constitution to seek peaceful political \nchange and openness.\n  More specifically, he and his team created the Varela Project to \ngather more than 11,000 signatures of Cuban citizens on a petition that \ncalled for a more open political system.\n  Keep in mind that putting one's name on a petition to the Cuban \nGovernment is a courageous thing to do on that island. It puts that \nperson and his or her family at great risk.\n  Nonetheless, in May 2002, he bravely presented the petition to the \nCuban National Assembly for action exactly as allowed for in the Cuban \nConstitution.\n  What did the Cuban Government do in response to a heroic and \nreasonable call for change allowed for under the country's own laws?\n  It harassed Paya and his followers. It began its own referendum that \nmade the island's socialist system ``irrevocable,'' even after an \nadditional 14,000 signatures were added to the Varela Project petition.\n  A year later many of Paya's allies were arrested in a crackdown that \nsent many dissidents, writers, and even librarians to prison.\n  Can you believe this craven response?\n  The Cuban Government couldn't blame this Cuban-born effort on the \nUnited States, on other outside forces, on any of the usual suspects on \nwhich it blames all the island's woes.\n  Thousands of brave Cubans asking for political reform within the \nbounds of their own constitution were simply belittled, ignored, and \nharassed.\n  Paya was a modest man. I had hoped to meet him on my trip to the \nisland earlier this year, but we were unable to visit--you see, the \nCuban government doesn't want outsiders to visit people like Paya.\n  His peaceful and tireless efforts for peaceful change earned him the \nEuropean Parliament's Sakarov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 2002, the \nNational Democratic Institute's W. Averell Harriman Democracy Award in \n2003, and a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize from Vaclav Havel in \n2005.\n  Paya's daughter Rosa Maria said amid her loss and tears last week \nthat her father never gave up hope that the country could be changed \nfrom within and that ``he just wanted for Cubans to have their rights . \n. . that's all he ever wanted.''\n  Tragically the Cuban Government even arrested almost 50 Cubans who \nshowed up to pay their respects at Paya's funeral.\n  Can you imagine--arresting people at a peaceful memorial service?\n  My colleagues, Senators Bill Nelson, Menendez, and Rubio, have \nintroduced a Senate resolution recognizing his work and calling for the \npeaceful democratic changes in Cuba that Paya spent his life pursuing. \nI am pleased to be a cosponsor of that resolution and was happy to see \nthat it passed the Senate just yesterday.\n  Lastly, let me note that Paya was often concerned for his safety--\nsadly, given the Cuban Government's treatment of those wanting \npolitical freedom, not an unwarranted fear.\n  So I want to emphasize an important point in the Senate resolution on \nMr. Paya. Specifically, I call on the Cuban Government to conduct a \ncredible and transparent investigation into the auto accident that \ncaused his death.\n  The Cuban Government owes this Cuban patriot and the Cuban people \nnothing less than a full accounting of his death. It also owes them the \nbasic freedoms he tirelessly stood for.\n  Mr. President, I want to also take this opportunity to talk about \nanother tragedy that continues day after day in Cuba--that of the \ndetention of American citizen Alan Gross.\n  Alan was arrested more than 2\\1/2\\ years ago while trying to help the \nCuban people have greater ability to communicate with one another.\n  When you go to Cuba, you realize the Castro regime not only blames \nthe United States for all its woes but cynically makes it difficult for \neveryday Cubans to communicate or connect to the outside world using \nthe Internet.\n  That is why thousands upon thousands of Cubans use a free Internet \nlibrary every year at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.\n  Alan Gross was arrested initially as a spy and eventually sentenced \nto 15 years in prison.\n  That is right--15 years.\n  Mr. Gross apologized for his actions and has asked for Cuban \ncompassion to allow him to visit his 90-year old mother suffering from \ninoperable lung cancer in the United States. The United States recently \nlet a former Cuban detainee who was out on supervised release in the \nUnited States visit his ailing brother in Cuba, but the Cuban \nGovernment has shown no such decency in return.\n  I met Alan in January in Cuba, and I am appreciative of the Cuban \nGovernment for allowing me that visit. He tried to remain in good \nspirits, but it wasn't easy. He has lost more than 100 pounds since his \nincarceration. He struggles to keep busy and healthy in jail, but it is \nnot easy. Quite simply, he has been separated from his family for far \ntoo long.\n  Alan Gross is a kind, decent man. He is no spy. He is no threat to \nanyone. In fact, despite all that has happened, he noted to me how \ndeeply he still cares for the Cuban people.\n  Let me say this as clear as I can: Alan Gross should no longer be a \npawn of the Cuban Government in its disagreements with the United \nStates.\n  The Cuban Government has made its point. It will get nothing but \ninternational shame from holding Alan any longer.\n  Let me also note that I do not support the failed U.S. embargo \nagainst Cuba and think the best way to see change on the island is to \nflood it with American ideas and people.\n  But I will have to think long and hard before I do anything further \nto ease our relations while Alan remains so cruelly behind bars.\n  To Oswaldo Paya's family and brave colleagues and to Alan Gross, \nplease know that you are not forgotten here in the Senate and around \nthe world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5957-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5957-S5958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO REPRESENTATIVE PAUL FINDLEY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor former Congressman \nPaul Findley--a great American who served his country in war and in the \nhallowed halls of Congress, a son of Illinois, a prolific writer and \nLincoln scholar, a former political adversary, and my now friend.\n  Paul Findley was born in Jacksonville, Illinois, on June 23, 1921. \nAnd at 91 years of age, today Paul is as active and involved as he has \never been. Paul earned a bachelor's degree from his beloved Illinois \nCollege in his hometown in 1943, where he was inducted into the \nprestigious Phi Beta Kappa society. After college, Paul served as a \nlieutenant in the Navy in the Pacific Theater from 1943 to 1946. His \nhonorable service and that of the dwindling number of living Americans \nwho served during World War II--one of the most difficult periods in \nour country's history is something we should all take time to reflect \non and thank them for.\n  After the war, Paul became president of Pike Press, Inc., in \nPittsfield. He spent several years as editor of this small town weekly \nnewspaper. In 1952, Findley lost a bid for the Republican nomination \nfor State senator--something he and I have in common, having lost our \nfirst campaigns for public office--but it didn't stop either of us.\n  In 1960 Paul Findley was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives \nrepresenting the 20th Congressional District of Illinois. He served in \nthe House honorably for more than 20 years, until in 1982 a young \nlawyer from Springfield and a long shot to win surprised a lot of \npeople, including many of his supporters, by unseating the incumbent \nFindley. Though Paul Findley and I were opponents in that campaign, I \nalways respected him and his public service. Notwithstanding what is \noften a bitter and rancorous climate of partisan politics, I am proud \nto call Paul Findley my friend.\n  One of Paul Findley's greatest accomplishments during his long and \ndistinguished congressional career was his dogged, ultimately \nsuccessful effort to preserve a great American treasure--the \nSpringfield home of our beloved son of Illinois, Abraham Lincoln. \nStrolling today through this historic neighborhood at the heart of \nSpringfield, as thousands of visitors do each year, it would be almost \ninconceivable that preserving Lincoln's home was ever a matter of \ndebate. But it once\n\n[[Page S5958]]\n\nwas. Back in the 1950s, the site visitors see today looked very \ndifferent.\n  Where now-restored historic homes line a gravel street in a stately \nand peaceful neighborhood, then stood souvenir shops surrounded by a \nneighborhood that Paul Findley would later recall was, ``rundown and \ndecaying in all directions.'' The Lincoln home itself--what Lincoln's \nown private secretary once called ``the precious heirloom of the \nrepublic''--was then the property of the State of Illinois.\n  For years, developers had tried to encroach on the historic site with \nthe goal of exploiting the area for commercial opportunities. Some \nwanted a theme park. Others tried to build wax museums or hotels or \nbuffet restaurants in close proximity. Still others had been trying \nunsuccessfully to ensure the home's restoration and the preservation of \nthe historical integrity of the surrounding area. In Congressman Paul \nFindley, those who wanted to honor this piece of history found their \nchampion.\n  Findley traces his own interest in this project back to a \npresentation at a meeting of the Pittsfield Chamber of Commerce in 1955 \nwell before he held elected office. At the meeting, a Springfield \nresident presented a case for preserving the Lincoln Home and \ndeveloping the site commercially. While the plan for development never \ngot off the ground, the presenter did make a point that Findley never \nforgot--that the Lincoln Home had largely been neglected compared to \nother Presidential homes. This, Findley regarded as ``shameful, awful, \nscandalous.'' It was in 1967, as the congressman representing the \ndistrict that encompassed the Lincoln site that Findley became directly \ninvolved and took up the mantle of this effort. After years of lining \nup local, state, and national support, Congressman Findley announced in \n1969 at a Springfield dinner that he would introduce legislation in \nCongress to make the site part of the National Park System. At that \ndinner was New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, whom Findley had \nsuccessfully enlisted in the effort,\n   The late Senators Charles Percy and Everett Dirksen introduced \ncompanion legislation in the Senate. The bills had the support of every \nmember of the Illinois congressional delegation. But even with all this \nsupport, as those of us who have been around here long enough know, the \nfight wasn't over. Money, as always, was an issue. People began trying \nto raise private funds. Congressman Findley worked tirelessly to get \nthe attention of the relevant committee and subcommittee chairs--\nDemocrats held the majorities in both Chambers at the time. Among other \nthings, he invited key members to Springfield to tour the site after \nwhich they usually agreed to support his efforts.\n  I have no doubt that the commitments of these members to support his \nbill had as much to do with Findley's tenacity, passion, and \ndetermination as it did the power of seeing the Lincoln Home in person.\n  Then the Nixon administration threw its support behind Findley, and \neven asked that the bill be amended to fully authorize the \nappropriation required for the site--so the private fundraising was \nunnecessary. The House passed the bill first, and it enjoyed, as \nFindley says, ``swift approval'' in the Senate we can't say that about \ntoo many matters around here anymore. On August 18, 1971, years of \nefforts culminated in a ceremony in the Old State Capitol in \nSpringfield, just blocks away from the Lincoln Home. With Congressman \nFindley looking on, President Richard Nixon signed the Findley bill \nauthorizing the establishment of the Lincoln Home National Historic \nSite.\n  Think about it, this was an effort championed by a Republican \nCongressman, passed by a Congress controlled by Democrats, and signed \nby a Republican President. It was a different time. One year after the \nsigning ceremony, then-President of the Illinois State Senate, Paul \nSimon, signed legislation transferring the title for the Lincoln home \nto the National Park Service.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Congressman Paul Findley and the many \nlocal supporters of his efforts--including then-Springfield Mayor \nNelson Howarth, the first superintendent of the Lincoln Home National \nHistoric Site Albert Banton, the architect of the Lincoln Home Visitor \nCenter and early supporter of preservation efforts Wally Henderson, and \ncountless others--visitors to the site today can stroll the street \nLincoln once strolled and take in the neighborhood in much the same way \nit would have looked to him more than 150 years ago.\n  The experience of visiting the Abraham Lincoln National Historic Site \nwill undoubtedly inspire generations of young Americans to serve their \ncountry, just as Paul Findley has and as Abraham Lincoln did.\n  This is Paul Findley's legacy.\n  It is a legacy that forever will be intertwined with President \nLincoln--an honor that Paul richly deserves.\n  Throughout his 91 years on this Earth, my friend and this great \nAmerican, Paul Findley, has made an indelible mark on our State of \nIllinois and our country--and he has not done yet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5958-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5958-S5959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee reported out the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities.\n  How fitting that this treaty was considered and passed by the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee on the 22nd anniversary of the enactment of \nAmericans with Disabilities Act.\n  If anyone questions how important this treaty is to the millions of \nAmericans living with disabilities, all they needed to do was look \naround the room at the hearing earlier this month. The hearing room was \nfilled to capacity--standing room only--with people urging the Senate \nto ratify this important document.\n  The United States has led the world in creating the legal framework, \nbuilding the infrastructure, and designing facilities that ensure \ninclusion and opportunity for those living with disabilities. We \ncelebrated the 22nd anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct--``ADA''--by reporting the treaty out of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee on a strong bipartisan basis. I thank Sen. Kerry for holding \nthat hearing and moving the treaty through the committee process.\n  As the majority leader has made clear, the Convention on the Rights \nof Persons with Disabilities will soon be considered on the Senate \nfloor. The Members of this body will have an opportunity to affirm our \nNation's leadership on disability issues by ratifying this important \ntreaty. I hope that we will do so. And I hope we will ratify this \ntreaty with the strong bipartisan support that has always characterized \nthe Senate's work on disability issues.\n  For the 54 million Americans living with a disability, laws like the \nADA have provided an opportunity to learn, travel, work, and live \nindependently. Perhaps no one knows that better than Ann Ford of \nSpringfield, Illinois. Ann had polio as a child and for many years she \ncommuted on crutches. This challenging and energy-consuming task \nrequired Ann to meticulously plan every trip. At the grocery store, Ann \nwould purchase all she needed in 20 minutes, in order to be home before \nbecoming exhausted.\n  After the ADA was enacted, the store manager invited Ann to use a \nrecently purchased electric scooter. Ann remembers that day clearly, in \npart because she shopped for an hour and a half going up and down every \naisle in the store.\n  Most of us don't give a second thought to buying groceries. But for \nAnn and millions like her, our Nation's commitment to removing physical \nbarriers has expended their world. Now, we have an opportunity to \ndemonstrate our commitment and advance disability rights around the \nworld by ratifying this treaty.\n  The support for this treaty is broad and bipartisan. I thank my \nfriend, Senator John McCain, for leading this effort with me. Heis a \ngreat ally and without him we would not have made such great progress.\n  I also thank Senator Barrasso, Harkin, Tom Udall, Moran, and Coons \nfor their bipartisan support and dedication to the ratification effort.\n  This treaty is supported by 165 disability organizations, including \nthe United States International Council on Disabilities, the American \nAssociation of People with Disabilities, Disability Rights Education & \nDefense Fund, and the National Disability Rights Network, and 21 \nveterans groups, including\n\n[[Page S5959]]\n\nthe Wounded Warrior Project, the American Legion, Disabled American \nVeterans, and Veterans of Foreign Wars are also calling on us to ratify \nthis treaty. President George H.W. Bush, who signed the ADA into law, \nand former Senator Bob Dole, a lifelong advocate for disability rights, \nare strong proponents of this treaty.\n  The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is a human-\nrights treaty that seeks to ensure that people living with disabilities \nare afforded the same opportunities available to others. Thanks to the \nADA and similar laws, the United States has been so successful \nproviding opportunities, increasing accessibility, and protecting the \nrights of those living with disabilities that our Nation is already in \nfull compliance with all terms of the treaty.\n  Before transmitting this treaty, the Obama administration conducted \nan exhaustive comparison of the treaty's requirements to current U.S. \nlaw. It concluded that the United States does not need to pass any new \nlaws or regulations in order to meet the terms of the treaty. The fact \nthat we already meet or exceed the treaty's requirements is a testament \nto our nation's commitment to equality and opportunity for those living \nwith disabilities. There are, nevertheless, very important reasons to \nratify this treaty.\n  Disabled Veterans and Other Americans Traveling Abroad--There are \nmore than 5.5 million veterans living with disabilities. They and \nthousands of other Americans living with disabilities travel, study, \nwork, and serve overseas, often with their families. Ratifying the \ntreaty will ensure they enjoy the same accessibility and opportunity \nabroad that they have here at home.\n  Accessibility in Other Countries--ratifying this treaty will give the \nUnited States a seat at the international table, so that the U.S. can \nprovide its guidance and expertise to other countries working to adopt \nlaws, upgrade infrastructure, and modernize facilities to meet the very \nhigh standards we have set.\n  Leveling the Playing field for American Businesses--American \nbusinesses have invested time and resources to comply with the ADA. \nBusinesses in some countries are not required to comply with similar \nstandards. Compliance with the treaty levels the playing field by \nrequiring foreign businesses to meet accessibility standards similar to \nthose in the U.S.\n  New Markets for American Businesses--we lead the world in developing \naccessible products and technology. As other countries comply with the \ntreaty, American businesses will be able to export their expertise and \nproducts to the new markets serving the more than 1 billion people \nliving with disabilities around the world.\n  While this treaty will ensure inclusion and access for those living \nwith disabilities, it is also important that we note what the treaty \nwill not do.\n  The treaty will not change any U.S. law or compromise U.S. \nsovereignty in any way.\n  The treaty will not lead to new law suits because its terms do not \ncreate any new rights and it cannot be enforced in any U.S. Court.\n  For families that choose to educate their children at home, the \ntreaty will not change any current rights or obligations.\n  The treaty will not require the U.S. to appropriate any new funding \nor resources to comply with its terms--not a single dime.\n  Leading pro life groups, like the National Right to Life Committee, \nconfirm that the treaty does not promote, expand access, or create a \nright to an abortion.\n  Thanks to decades of bipartisan cooperation, our country embodies the \nworldwide gold standard for those living with disabilities.\n  When the Senate ratifies the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities, we can be proud that our coworkers, friends, family \nmembers, and courageous veterans will soon enjoy the same access and \nopportunity when they travel abroad that they have come to expect here \nat home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5959-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING SHELBY HARRIS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life of Mr. \nShelby Harris, from Rock Island, IL. When he passed away on July 25, \n2012, at the age of 111, he was the oldest man in the country and the \nthird oldest man in the world.\n  Mr. Harris was born in Indiana on March 31, 1901. That same year \nPresident William McKinley was assassinated and Vice President Theodore \nRoosevelt took over the White House, there were only 45 stars on the \nAmerican flag, and the life expectancy in this country was just 47 \nyears of age.\n  Throughout his 111 years, Mr. Harris lived a varied and rich life. In \nIndiana, he worked at a coal mine. He moved to the Quad Cities in 1942 \nwhere he enlisted in the Army during World War II. He also worked for \nthe former Union Malleable and the John Deere Foundry in East Moline. \nHe outlived two wives and three daughters. His oldest grandchild is 57 \nyears old, and he was a great-great-great-great grandfather. Mr. Harris \nwas a lifelong Democrat and credited his longevity to his faith in God.\n  Age did not slow him down. Mr. Harris served as a deacon of Second \nBaptist Church until he was 102 years old and had a bucket list that \nincluded getting remarried and playing baseball. A month after his \n111th birthday, Mr. Harris was able to cross baseball off his list \nafter he threw out the first pitch at a Quad Cities River Bandits minor \nleague baseball game.\n  Living beyond the age of 110 made Mr. Harris a supercentenarian. This \ndesignation is particularly rare for a man because women typically live \nthe longest all over the world. The oldest person in the world today is \na woman who has reached age 115.\n  Mr. Harris will be missed by the staff at the Rock Island Nursing and \nRehabilitation Center where he lived since he was 105 years of age. For \nthe past 5 years the nursing home has thrown a big party on his \nbirthday, and the staff there plan to hold a remembrance for him next \nyear on the date.\n  It is my honor to recognize the long and full life of Mr. Shelby \nHarris.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5959-2", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5959-S5960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 LIBOR\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, It was recently revealed that at least one \nbank--Barclays Bank of Great Britain--attempted to manipulate LIBOR \nover a 4-year period beginning in 2005.\n  LIBOR stands for the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate. This rate is a \nbenchmark used by industries all over the world to set interest rates \nfor nearly $800 trillion worth of financial instruments.\n  LIBOR determines how much people across the world pay for student \nloans, mortgages, and credit card fees. The higher LIBOR is, the more \nit costs a college student to borrow money for school or a business to \nobtain a line of credit.\n  This means that people across the world with student loans, mortgages \nand credit cards, and municipalities selling bonds may have paid more \nto borrow money because of Barclays' actions.\n  Barclays settled with U.S. and British authorities and paid over $450 \nmillion in penalties to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the \nU.S. Department of Justice, and British regulators.\n  Now, as many as 20 megabanks, including several U.S. banks, are under \ninvestigation or named in lawsuits alleging they also rigged LIBOR.\n  Over the next several weeks and months we will learn more details \nabout exactly what happened.\n  But it seems clear we are facing a scenario that is all too familiar: \nthe largest banks have once again put greed and profit above the best \ninterests of their customers and the economies of at least six nations, \nincluding the United States.\n  At the same time--nearly 4 years after the worst financial crisis in \nour lifetime and 2 years since the Democratic-majority Congress passed \nWall Street reform--my Republican colleagues continue to undermine the \nfinancial regulators by cutting their funding and spending countless \nhours in the House of Representatives debating and passing bills to \nroll back the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act.\n  This is not good for our financial system and it certainly isn't good \nfor the American people.\n  But let me back up. What is LIBOR? It is a benchmark used by \nindustries all over the world to set interest rates\n  LIBOR impacts--directly or indirectly--nearly every person in the \nworld.\n\n[[Page S5960]]\n\n  Here is how it works.\n  LIBOR is calculated for 10 currencies and 15 maturities. For example, \none of the most important LIBOR rates is the 3-month dollar LIBOR.\n  A select panel of 18 major banks report how much they believe it \nwould cost to borrow money in dollars for 3 months at 11 a.m. on a \nparticular day.\n  The top four estimates and bottom four estimates are discarded, and \nthe remaining rates are averaged to calculate LIBOR. LIBOR is published \nevery day at 11 a.m., and companies across the world use this rate to \nset interest rates for consumers.\n  So why would the major banks want to manipulate LIBOR?\n  The simple answer is profit. And greed.\n  Many of the major banks that help set LIBOR stand to lose or gain \nmillions of dollars each day based on the smallest change in LIBOR.\n  As the leading trader of derivatives in 2007, it has been estimated \nthat Barclays stood to lose or gain $40 million per day.\n  The settlement between regulators and Barclays lays bare a scenario \nwhere traders not only regularly attempted to manipulate LIBOR, but \nthey didn't even try to hide it.\n  Once the financial crisis hit in 2008, manipulating LIBOR was also \nabout survival.\n  Banks were under intense scrutiny. If it cost a bank more to borrow \nmoney, it could be an indicator that other banks thought lending to the \nbank was risky.\n  In Barclays' settlement with regulators the bank admitted that it \nunderreported the cost of borrowing during the financial crisis to \nmislead regulators and the public about the true financial health of \nthe firm.\n  Unfortunately, it seems as if the Barclays settlement is just the tip \nof the iceberg.\n  Lawsuits worth billions of dollars have been filed against banks \nalleging wrongdoing. Regulators in the U.S., Canada, Japan, EU, \nSwitzerland, and Britain are reportedly investigating.\n  U.S. regulators should be fully engaged in investigating the LIBOR \nprocess and any wrongdoing by U.S. banks.\n  However, U.S. financial regulators can't conduct the necessary \ninvestigations into claims of wrongdoing or enforce new laws meant to \nrein in Wall Street if they don't have the people, software, and \nresources necessary to do the work.\n  Congress passed Wall Street reform because the largest financial \ninstitutions in this country took advantage of loopholes and the \nunregulated swap markets.\n  They drove our country into the worst economic recession in our \nlifetime.\n  In the aftermath, we said we are not going down that road again. No \nmore too big to fail, no more bailouts. We are going to have \ntransparency and accountability when it comes to swaps.\n  We gave the job to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\n  With the recent approval of final rules defining swaps, the CFTC and \nthe SEC have now triggered the implementation of an array of other \nrules to finally bring the swaps market out of the shadows and into the \nlight.\n  This is a huge step forward.\n  But now, just when the financial regulators have the rules in place \nto oversee the $300 trillion market that nearly destroyed our economy, \nthe Republicans are trying to cut the agencies off at the knees.\n  Their philosophy is if you can't repeal reforms by passing \nlegislation, you can undermine the agency's ability to enforce the law.\n  Let me put this in perspective. The $37 trillion futures market has \nhistorically been policed by the CFTC. That is an enormous market to \noversee, by anyone's calculation.\n  But it pales in comparison to the complex and previously unregulated \n$300 trillion swaps market now under CFTC's purview because of Dodd-\nFrank. That is eight times the size of the futures markets.\n  Common sense tells you that it is impossible for an agency to \nincrease its responsibility eight-fold while its resources are cut by \n41 percent.\n  Yet, that hasn't stopped the Republicans in the House. They recently \nreported out of Committee a bill that cuts funding requested in the \nPresident's fiscal 2013 budget by $195 million for the SEC and $128 \nmillion for the CFTC.\n  That's a 41 percent cut for the CFTC and a 12 percent cut for the \nSEC--from the President's request.\n  Keep in mind that while Congress sets the level of funding for the \nSEC, it is largely funded through fees on trading volumes. So the cuts \nto the SEC aren't about concern for saving taxpayer dollars--it is \nsimply a way to remove the regulators' ability to properly function.\n  When financial tragedies befall people--think of missing customer \nfunds at MF Global or Peregrine--we want investigators to find out what \nhappened and seek recovery of money to the families and farmers who \ntrusted those companies.

One was the \ncreation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau- the only agency \nin the Federal Government solely dedicated to looking out for \nconsumers' financial interests.\n  This agency has already been a game-changer when it comes to curbing \nthe tricks in consumer financial products. It is bringing transparency \nand fairness to mortgages, private student loans, and credit cards.\n  Last week, the CFPB announced its first ever enforcement action. It \ndirected Capital One to pay about $150 million to more than 2 million \nconsumers who had purchased deceptively marketed add-on products to \ntheir credit cards.\n  This is a big step forward. It shows there is a real cop on the beat \nwhen it comes to consumer protection.\n  I am proud of what this agency has accomplished so far, and I look \nforward to seeing it continue its important work for years to come.\n  Another important provision in the Wall Street Reform bill was the \nprovision I drafted to reform debit card swipe fees.\n  The swipe fee is a fee that a bank receives from a merchant when the \nmerchant accepts a credit or debit card that the bank issued. This fee \nis taken as a cut of the transaction amount.\n  Now, the vast majority of bank fees are set in a transparent and \ncompetitive market environment, with each bank setting their own fee \nrate and competing over them. That is not the case with swipe fees.\n  With swipe fees, the big banks decided they would designate the two \ngiant card companies, Visa and MasterCard, to set fees for all of them. \nThat way each bank could get the same high fee on a card transaction \nwithout having to worry about competition.\n  And swipe fees are anything but transparent. Most consumers and even \nmost merchants have no idea what kind of swipe fee is being charged \nwhen they use a debit or credit card.\n  The swipe fee system became an enormous money-maker for Visa, \nMasterCard, and the banks. They were\n\n[[Page S5961]]\n\ncollecting an estimated $16 billion in debit swipe fees and $30 billion \nin credit fees each year.\n  Those billions are paid by every merchant, charity, university, and \ngovernment agency that accepts payment by card, and the costs are \npassed on to American consumers in the form of higher prices.\n  By 2010, the U.S. swipe fee system was growing out of control with no \nend in sight. U.S. swipe fee rates had become the highest in the world- \nfar exceeding the actual costs of conducting a debit or credit \ntransaction.\n  And there were no market forces serving to keep fees at a reasonable \nlevel. Merchants and their customers were being forced to subsidize \nbillions in windfall fees to the big banks.\n  I stepped in and introduced an amendment to the Wall Street reform \nbill that for the first time placed reasonable regulation over debit \nswipe fees.\n  My amendment said that if the Nation's biggest banks are going to let \nVisa and MasterCard fix swipe fee rates for them, then the rates must \nbe reasonable and proportional to the cost of processing a transaction. \nNo more unreasonably high debit swipe fees for big banks.\n  The regulatory steps that my amendment proposed were modest. Most \nother countries have gone much further in regulating swipe fees.\n  But the banks and the card companies screamed bloody murder.\n  My amendment passed the Senate with 64 votes, and it was signed into \nlaw with the rest of Wall Street reform. And the swipe fee reforms took \neffect last October.\n  As it turns out, debit swipe fee reform is working pretty well.\n  So far, reform has led to an estimated $7 to $8 billion in annual \ndebit swipe fee savings for merchants.\n  That savings is a real shot in the arm for American businesses that \nhave been crushed by ever-rising swipe fees.\n  Consumers are also benefiting as savings are passed along from \nmerchants through competition.\n  After reform took effect in October, we saw a massive level of \nretailer discounting that extended beyond the usual holiday season \ndiscounts.\n  And according to a USA TODAY article from May 11, a number of \nindividual merchants are offering debit card discounts for items such \nas gas, furniture, and clothing. This trend is expected to continue and \nto grow.\n  Furthermore, the banking industry had claimed that small banks and \ncredit unions would be hurt by debit swipe reform- even though all \ninstitutions under $10 billion in assets were exempted from fee \nregulation.\n  As it turns out, small banks and credit unions have thrived since \nreform took effect.\n  Why? Because under my amendment, small banks and credit unions can \ncontinue to receive the same high interchange rates from Visa and \nMasterCard far higher than the rates that their big bank competitors \nreceive.\n  In May, the Federal Reserve confirmed that exempted banks and credit \nunions were receiving the same average interchange rates they had \ngotten before reform.\n  The American Banker newspaper has noted that the ``Small Banks' \nDurbin Shield Worked'' and prominent card industry analyst Andrew Kahr \nnoted that the ``Durbin Doomsday Never Came.''\n  Credit unions in particular are doing well after swipe reform. Last \nyear 1.3 million Americans opened new credit union accounts, up from \nabout 600,000 the year before. And credit unions now have a record \nnumber of members- almost 92 million overall.\n  Now, it is important to note that there should be even more savings \nfrom swipe fee reform to merchants and consumers.\n  When the Federal Reserve was writing its final rule, the banks \nlobbied them to weaken the final rule and raise the debit swipe cap \nfrom 12 to 24 cents. Then Visa and MasterCard promptly jacked up any \nswipe fee rates that were below 24 cents so that this 24 cent ceiling \nbecame a floor.\n  Basically, the banks and card companies lobbied the Fed for a \nloophole, and when they got one, they ran through it.\n  This needs to be fixed going forward, and I am confident it will be \nfixed.\n  The bottom line, though, is that the swipe fee reform that Congress \nenacted in 2010 has gotten off to a good start. It is working, and it \nis laying a solid foundation for further reforms to improve the credit \nand debit systems.\n  I am afraid, however, that while swipe fee reform has made important \nstrides in Congress, the big banks and card companies are trying to \nundercut that reform in the courts.\n  Recently a proposed settlement was announced in a long-running class \naction lawsuit. This lawsuit had been filed back in 2005 by a number of \nmerchants against Visa, MasterCard, and the big banks that issue most \nof their credit cards.\n  The lawsuit was over credit card interchange fees and the associated \nrules that Visa and MasterCard impose on merchants. The suit alleged \nthat these fees and rules violate the antitrust laws in the way that \nthey are set.\n  This lawsuit had the potential to bring about important changes to \nthe credit card system that would have promoted transparency, enhanced \ncompetition, and helped consumers.\n  But the proposed settlement does not do that. In fact, I believe this \nproposed settlement represents a capitulation to the Wall Street banks \nand credit card giants. It is a sweetheart deal for them and a bad deal \nfor merchants and for consumers.\n  The settlement was negotiated in secret between Visa, MasterCard, the \nbig banks, and the attorneys representing a small number of merchants. \nThe vast majority of merchants had no idea what was in the proposed \nsettlement until it was unveiled.\n  The terms of the settlement include a $6 billion dollar payout from \nVisa, MasterCard and the banks to the plaintiff merchants. That is a \nlarge number it is nearly twice as much as the previous record payout \nin an antitrust case. And it is a clear sign that the card companies \nknew that their fees were unreasonably high.\n  But, $6 billion is only 2 months worth of credit card interchange \nfees. And the settlement does not prevent Visa and MasterCard from \nsimply jacking up their fees even higher than before.\n  The settlement does nothing to change the anticompetitive fee-fixing \nthat Visa and MasterCard do on behalf of their member banks. In fact, \nit gives Visa and MasterCard broad and permanent legal immunity to \ncontinue doing exactly that in the future.\n  Also, the settlement not only binds the merchants who are parties to \nit, but it also binds every single American merchant, charity, \nuniversity, and State or local agency that accepts a Visa or a \nMasterCard today or in the future.\n  It bars all of them from ever bringing a legal claim in the future \nagainst Visa, MasterCard, or the big banks relating to any swipe fee, \nother merchant fee, or network rule, no matter how unfair or \nunreasonable the fees or rules may be.\n  And this settlement gives Visa and MasterCard legal immunity not just \nfor credit cards, but also for debit cards, and prepaid cards and \nmobile payment systems.\n  The extent of the free pass Visa and MasterCard would get under this \nproposed settlement is breathtaking. No wonder the banks and cards were \nso quick to come out in favor of this settlement. And no wonder Visa's \nstock hit an alltime high the next business day.\n  Now, the proposed settlement would make some temporary changes to \nVisa's and MasterCard's rules. But in my view, these proposed changes \nwill be ineffective in reining in Visa and MasterCard's unreasonable \nfees.\n  The bottom line is that this proposed settlement does not make our \ncredit card system better.\n  Instead, it gives Visa and MasterCard free reign to carry on their \nanticompetitive swipe fee system with no real constraints and no legal \naccountability to the millions of American businesses that are forced \nto pay their fees.\n  This is a stunning giveaway to Visa and MasterCard, all for a payout \nof a mere 2 months worth of swipe fees.\n  This is a bad deal, but it is not a done deal. The merchant \nplaintiffs still have to decide if they will support it, and the court \nmust approve it. Several plaintiffs--the National Association of \nConvenience Stores, the National Grocers Association and the National \nCommunity Pharmacists Association--have already rejected the deal.\n  Now, I am not a party to this lawsuit, but I care deeply about making\n\n[[Page S5962]]\n\nthe credit and debit card systems in this country more transparent, \nmore competitive, and more fair.\n  I have worked hard over the years to make sure that merchants and \nconsumers do not get nickled and dimed to death with hidden and \nunreasonable fees from Visa and MasterCard, and we have made great \nstrides.\n  That is why I am speaking out about my concerns with this proposed \nsettlement. I know that Visa, MasterCard, and the banks are thrilled \nwith this settlement, but this is not a settlement I would agree to.\n  I hope that the remaining merchant plaintiffs will review the \nproposed settlement carefully and think hard about whether it will be \ngood for the future of our credit and debit card systems. They should \nnot be anxious to sign away that future and settle for a bad deal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5962-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JOE MATAL\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to recognize the \nservice of one of my longtime legal counsels on the Judiciary \nCommittee, Joe Matal. Joe will be leaving the Senate in a few weeks \nafter 12 years of Senate service, and I wanted to say a few words of \nthanks.\n  Joe is well-known on Capitol Hill as a sharp, tenacious, and \nprincipled lawyer who fights hard for principle and the public good. It \nis frankly remarkable to reflect on the breadth of issues where Joe has \nplayed a major role in his years of service, but I will list a few.\n  Joe was intimately involved in our efforts to grapple with post-9/11 \nrealities, in particular through the Military Commissions Act and the \nDetainee Treatment Act and the reauthorizations of the USA Patriot Act.\n  Joe has been instrumental in efforts to ensure appropriate DNA \ntesting of criminals and to ensure that the rape-kit backlogs are \ncleared. He worked on the Adam Walsh Act and the Internet SAFETY Act. \nHe is a go-to lawyer on criminal sentencing issues. Very recently, he \nhas been an essential adviser on negotiations relating to the \ncybersecurity legislation.\n  I could go on and on. Joe has worked on the animal crush video law I \nsponsored, on False Claims Act amendments, on open government laws, and \non legal reform bills such as asbestos litigation reform, the Class \nAction Fairness Act, and Bankruptcy Reform. He is also an expert on \nIndian Law and has been an indispensable counsel on my work that \nrelates to Indian Country in Arizona, but also on Indian policy \nnationwide.\n  Finally, and most obviously, in recent years Joe has justly earned \nthe respect of the legal and policy community nationwide as a major \nforce in the development of the patent reform bill that Congress passed \na year ago. In fact, when Joe leaves my office, he will remain in \ngovernment service and begin work as an assistant solicitor in the U.S. \nPatent and Trademark Office. Joe's service there will be essential \ngiven that the agency is continuing to implement the patent reform bill \nthat Joe did so much to create.\n  I would be remiss if I did not also note that some of Joe's important \nservice has been in the bills he helped ensure did not become law. Our \njob as legislators is not to jump at every shadow, but to exercise \ncaution when others seek to rush ill-considered legislation through the \nbody. Joe's counsel and his strategic guidance have been essential in \nprotecting the Nation from many, many bills that would have been \ncontrary to good public policy.\n  So I want to thank Joe and wish him the best as he leaves for the \nPTO. I also want to thank his wife, Maren, and his three children, \nJohn, Liddy, and Margaret, for supporting him in these years of public \nservice. I appreciate Joe's hard work and patriotic service and wish \nhim the best in his new position.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5962-2", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5962-S5963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CULTURE DOES MATTER\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, Governor Romney suggested on a recent trip to \nIsrael that the culture of a society plays a role in its prosperity. \nSome took offense to these remarks, and others disagreed with his \npremise. During the last few days, a debate has ensued about how \nculture promotes prosperity.\n  I believe Governor Romney made an important point. In a National \nReview piece entitled, ``Culture Does Matter,'' he asks, ``What exactly \naccounts for prosperity if not culture?''\n  After all, U.S. culture emphasizes freedom, equality, hard work, \nmeritocratic excellence, upward mobility, the rule of law, and a \ndevotion to family, education, and a purpose higher than oneself. These \ncultural values, and others, have made America the world's leading \nsuperpower--a beacon of prosperity, freedom, and strength. Millions of \npeople have left their homes over the centuries to come to America and \nbe part of our way of life.\n  As Governor Romney writes, Israel is also a telling example of the \nrole of culture and prosperity. Like the United States, Israel's \nculture is based on freedom and the rule of law. He writes that \nIsrael's embrace of political and economic freedom:\n\n     . . . has created conditions that have enabled innovators and \n     entrepreneurs to make the desert bloom. . . . In the face of \n     improbable odds, Israel today is a world leader in fields \n     ranging from medicine to information technology.\n\n  Of course other factors, such as economic policies, contribute to a \ncountry's prosperity. But the evidence shows that the role of culture \nshouldn't be marginalized or dismissed.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Governor Romney's entire article, \n``Culture Does Matter,'' be printed in the Record. I urge my colleagues \nto read it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the National Review Online, July 31, 2012]\n\n                          Culture Does Matter\n\n                            (By Mitt Romney)\n\n       During my recent trip to Israel, I had suggested that the \n     choices a society makes about its culture play a role in \n     creating prosperity, and that the significant disparity \n     between Israeli and Palestinian living standards was \n     powerfully influenced by it. In some quarters, that comment \n     became the subject of controversy.\n       But what exactly accounts for prosperity if not culture? In \n     the case of the United States, it is a particular kind of \n     culture that has made us the greatest economic power in the \n     history of the earth. Many significant features come to mind: \n     our work ethic, our appreciation for education, our \n     willingness to take risks, our commitment to honor and oath, \n     our family orientation, our devotion to a purpose greater \n     than ourselves, our patriotism. But one feature of our \n     culture that propels the American economy stands out above \n     all others: freedom. The American economy is fueled by \n     freedom. Free people and their free enterprises are what \n     drive our economic vitality.\n       The Founding Fathers wrote that we are endowed by our \n     Creator with the freedom to pursue happiness. In the America \n     they designed, we would have economic freedom, just as we \n     would have political and religious freedom. Here, we would \n     not be limited by the circumstance of birth nor directed by \n     the supposedly informed hand of government. We would be free \n     to pursue happiness as we wish. Economic freedom is the only \n     force that has consistently succeeded in lifting people out \n     of poverty. It is the only principle that has ever created \n     sustained prosperity. It is why our economy rose to rival \n     those of the world's leading powers--and has long since \n     surpassed them all.\n       The linkage between freedom and economic development has a \n     universal applicability. One only has to look at the contrast \n     between East and West Germany, and between North and South \n     Korea for the starkest demonstrations of the meaning of \n     freedom and the absence of freedom.\n       Israel is also a telling example. Like the United States, \n     the state of Israel has a culture that is based upon \n     individual freedom and the rule of law. It is a democracy \n     that has embraced liberty, both political and economic. This \n     embrace has created conditions that have enabled innovators \n     and entrepreneurs to make the desert bloom. In the face of \n     improbable odds, Israel today is a world leader in fields \n     ranging from medicine to information technology.\n       As the case of Israel makes plain, building a free society \n     is not a simple task. Rather, it is struggle demanding \n     constant courage and sacrifice. Even here in the United \n     States, which from our inception as a nation has been blessed \n     with freedom, we faced monumental challenges in harmonizing \n     our ideals with our institutions. We fought a bloody civil \n     war against slavery and it took a nonviolent civil-rights \n     movement to bring political and social equality to all \n     Americans. In these epic struggles we changed our ``culture'' \n     and vastly improved it.\n       I have just returned from a trip abroad. I visited three \n     lands--Israel, Poland, and Great Britain--which are defined \n     by their respective struggles for freedom. I met with some of \n     the greatest heroes of those struggles. I am always glad to \n     return to American soil. On this occasion, I am only \n     strengthened in my conviction that the pursuit of\n\n[[Page S5963]]\n\n     happiness is not an American right alone. Israelis, \n     Palestinians, Poles, Russians, Iranians, Americans, all human \n     beings deserve to enjoy the blessings of a culture of freedom \n     and opportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5963-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               AUTOPILOT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that Congress has agreed \nto put government funding decisions on autopilot for the first 6 months \nof fiscal year 2013 through another continuing resolution. This means, \nin effect, that a half year's worth of hearings, briefings, and \ndrafting of a dozen appropriations bills will have been for naught.\n  I recognize there are many factors at play this year as the clock \nticks toward the end of a fiscal year and toward November. But \ncontinuing resolutions are no way to run a government, and the \nconsequences for the American people's priorities, and for the agencies \nand the dedicated workers who implement our policies, will be dramatic.\n  The world does not stand still, and time does not stand still. \nCircumstances that should be reflected in our budget decisions are \nchanging all the time. Budgets are about choices. Budgets are about \nsetting priorities. Doing this carefully and thoughtfully through \nhearings, through fact-finding and through negotiations among the \npeople's representatives in Congress is not an easy process, but it was \nnot meant to be easy. Setting the process on autopilot is anathema to \nmaking the right decisions for our country.\n  As the veteran reporter David Rogers put it today in Politico:\n\n       Continuing resolutions do only one thing well: `continue.' \n     They don't allow for new starts and typically set funding at \n     the current rate enjoyed by an agency--with no room for new \n     ideas.\n\n  In fact, it is worse than that. As chairman of the State and Foreign \nOperations Subcommittee I am particularly mindful of changes that have \noccurred around the world in the past year. The situation in the Middle \nEast and North Africa is one of many examples. Our posture in Iraq and \nAfghanistan is changing significantly. Humanitarian crises in Syria and \nSouth Sudan are far greater than anyone envisioned 1 year ago. At a \ntime when the Chinese are ratcheting up their strategic investments \nacross the globe to advance their national interests, the United States \nis stuck in neutral.\n  I sympathize with the chairman and vice chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and all the committee staff, who have worked \nhard to draft and report bipartisan bills. The State and Foreign \nOperations bill was reported on May 24 by a nearly unanimous, \nbipartisan vote. It has the strong support of Ranking Member Graham, \nwho worked closely with me in drafting it, as well as minority leader \nSenator McConnell. With a day or so of floor time we could pass it and \ngo to conference. That is the way it should be. Yet continuing \nresolutions are becoming increasingly common because they are a \nconvenient and temptingly easy way to avoid hard decisions. \nUnfortunately, the American people lose, the country loses, and a great \ndeal of time, effort and money are wasted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5963-2", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION IN ECUADOR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, several weeks ago I spoke in this Chamber \nabout the assault on freedom of expression in Ecuador, where President \nCorrea has sought to silence his critics including the Special \nRapporteur for Freedom of Expression at the Organization of American \nStates.\n  Last week, these attacks on legitimate expression reached a new \nheight when, according to press reports, Ecuador's Secretariat of \nPueblos, Mireya Cardenas, said the government is investigating \nFundamedios to determine if the support it receives from the U.S. \nAgency for International Development--USAID--is being used to interfere \nin ``internal political affairs''. She specifically criticized \nFundamedios for lodging complaints at the Inter-American Human Rights \nCommission. She also attacked USAID for supporting sustainable \nforestry, civil society organizations, and the development of local \nproductive enterprises, which are designed to protect the environment \nand improve the livelihoods of the Ecuadoran people.\n  Mr. President, Fundamedios is a respected Ecuadoran nonpartisan \norganization that seeks to defend freedom of the press at a time when \njournalists and media organizations in that country are being vilified \nand threatened by officials of the very government that should be \nprotecting them. It is similar to the conduct we have seen in Russia, \nEgypt, Azerbaijan, Venezuela, and other countries whose governments \nmistakenly equate legitimate advocacy by civil society organizations \nwith unlawful political activity, as if Ecuador's political affairs are \nthe sole province of those who the government approves of.\n  It is also important to reaffirm the indispensable role of the Inter-\nAmerican human rights system, which has recently been targeted not only \nby President Correa, but also by the leaders of other Latin countries \nwith weak and corrupt judicial systems who, in the name of ``reform'', \nseek to limit access to alternative fora for its citizens to obtain \njustice for abuses by government security forces. It is interesting \nthat these same governments welcome the support of the OAS when it \nsuits them, but campaign to weaken its mandate when it does not.\n  To make a bad situation worse, President Correa again recently \nattacked one of Ecuador's most respected newspapers. A few weeks ago, \nhe said on TV that an editor with El Universo was ``sinister.'' And on \nJuly 28, he suggested that the editor of El Comercio was ``mentally \nill'' and ``unethical'', for what appear to be nothing more than public \ncomments made on the paper's website by readers who questioned \npresidential decisions.\n  On July 31, members of the police and the labor ministry, reportedly \nwithout a warrant, seized several items and information from the \noffices of the magazine Vanguardia for allegedly violating labor laws. \nThe magazine's director, Juan Carlos Calderon, said the incident is an \nattempt to silence the independent press in Ecuador.\n  For those of us who want closer relations between the United States \nand other countries in the hemisphere, including Ecuador, and who \nbelieve it is everyone's responsibility to stand up for universal human \nrights of which freedom of expression is the most cherished, it is \ndisappointing to see the path the Correa government is taking.\n  This is not about competing political philosophies, party \naffiliation, or national sovereignty. It is about protecting the right \nof Ecuadoran journalists and Fundamedios to be free of government \ninterference, and of defending the constitutional rights of all of \nEcuador's citizens. The country's first constitution, written in 1830, \nstipulated that ``every citizen can express their thoughts and publish \nthem freely through the press.'' Its current constitution, just 4 years \nold, protects each citizen's right ``to voice one's opinion and express \none's thinking freely and in all of its forms and manifestations.''\n  The people of Ecuador have a right to receive uncensored information. \nSometimes that information is accurate, sometimes it is not. Everyone \nin public office knows that.

By all accounts, he lived a life of \nservice, hard work, and faith.\n  While learning about Captain Pace's life, I was struck by the \ndescription of those closest to him. They repeatedly described the \nCaptain as someone who ``strived to do well.'' As a youth, he faced \nobstacles which would keep many from pursuing athletics. However, as a \ntestament to his character, Captain Pace pushed himself and overcame \nthis hurdle by becoming an accomplished athlete in basketball and \nswimming. His coaches described him as someone who ``took \nresponsibility for himself and the team but never blamed his teammates. \nHe's the type of player every coach wants . . . in fact ever coach \nwants five of him . . . Scott was a coach's dream and a leader. He'll \nbe missed dearly in this community.''\n\n[[Page S5964]]\n\n  In addition, to his accomplishments in athletics, Captain Pace \nexcelled in academics. He was at the top of his class in High School. \nHe initially attended Brigham Young University, before being called to \na mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in \nCordoba, Argentina. After his mission, he was accepted to the United \nStates Military Academy at West Point.\n  At West Point, Captain Pace continued to set the example by not only \ngraduating with a major in nuclear engineering, but continuing his love \nof athletics by playing varsity basketball, sprint football, and was a \nmember of West Point's intercollegiate handball team. In fact, Captain \nPace was named the most valuable player when West Point's Handball Team \nwon the Division II National Championship.\n  Upon graduating West Point, at the same time as his brother, Rick, \nCaptain Pace chose aviation and became a OH-58 Kiowa Warrior helicopter \npilot and a platoon leader. He then served two back-to-back \ndeployments, for a total of 20 months, in Iraq.\n  When he returned in 2009, Captain Pace was assigned to Fort Huachuca, \nAZ. There he completed the Captain's Career Course and intelligence \ntraining. After completing his studies, he was assigned to Fort Bragg, \nwhere he became the commander of Fox Troop, 1st Squadron, 17th Cavalry \nRegiment, 82nd Airborne Division. It was in this leadership role, when \nhis helicopter was shot down while engaging the enemy in Ghazni \nProvince, Afghanistan.\n  I was also quite taken by the comments of Captain Pace's teammates, \nfellow servicemembers, and friends who stated he always motivated them, \nnot only to do their best, but to be their best, even when no one else \nwas watching.\n  Captain Scott Patrick Pace was an outstanding young man. He was among \nthe best our Nation has to offer. I know I am joined by the entire \nSenate in extending our heartfelt condolences to Captain Pace's family. \nElaine and I will always keep them in our prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5964-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION AIRCRAFT TRANSFER ACT OF 2012\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as Members depart Capitol Hill for August \nrecess, wildfires will be raging across much of the Nation perhaps in \ntheir home States. Over 1.3 million acres have burned this summer, and \nhistoric drought conditions will continue to fan the flames. Last year, \nmy home State of Arizona experienced the largest wildfire in State \nhistory, the Wallow Fire, which consumed over 500,000 acres. This year \nhas been particularly distressing for States like Colorado, where the \nWaldo Canyon Fire near Colorado Springs forced the evacuation of \nthousands of residents, destroyed more than 350 homes, threatened the \nU.S. Air Force Academy, and became the most expensive fire in that \nState's history. Currently, there are 29 large uncontained wildfire \nburning across the Nation, according to the National Interagency Fire \nCenter.\n  Wildfires like these underscore the urgent need to start modernizing \nour antiquated Forest Service airtanker fleet. Airtankers are a vital \ntool capable of rapidly altering the paths of major fires and providing \nimmediate protection to ground personnel. Many of the core aircraft \noperated by the Forest Service are Korean-era DC-3s and P-2Vs that are \nrapidly failing. Just last month, a P-2V built in 1962 crashed in Utah, \ntragically killing the pilot and co-pilot. These are but a few examples \nin long list of terrible accidents where worn out aircraft are being \noperated far beyond their intended service lives, the perfect recipe \nfor future accidents.\n  That is why Senator Bill Nelson, Senator Dianne Feinstein, Senator \nMike Johanns, and I have introduced S. 3441, the Wildfire Suppression \nAircraft Transfer Act of 2012. Our bill would transfer fourteen excess \nC-27J aircraft from the U.S. Air Force to the Forest Service to help \nrecapitalize their airtanker fleet. These are nearly-new aircraft that \nwill greatly enhance the mission flexibility and lifespan of the Forest \nService fleet. This legislation is supported by the Forest Service as \nwell as certain stakeholder groups like the International Association \nof Fire Chiefs.\n  My colleagues and I attempted to pass this legislation before the \nSenate adjourned for August recess. Regretfully, there are several \nmembers with an interest in keeping these aircraft operating who \nobjected to our bill, even though the Pentagon wants to retire them. \nThis is disappointing because our legislation would not interfere with \nthe Congressional prerogative to approve or reject the Department of \nDefense force structure plan for Fiscal Year 2013. Clearly, there are \ndiffering opinions over divesting the C-27J, and I respect the right of \nSenators who want to address that issue in the context of the National \nDefense Authorization Act. Our legislation is intended as a post-\ndivestment authority to ensure that that the C-27J is put to good use \nfighting wildfires instead of being mothballed. Over the August recess, \nI hope to work with the Members who have objected to S. 3441 because I \nbelieve these platforms can be utilized to save lives and property.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5964-2", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\n  I am pleased to report that the Foreign Relations Committee approved \nthis Treaty on July 26, the 22nd anniversary of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. I am also pleased that, like the ADA, the \nDisabilities Convention has strong bipartisan backing.\n  This treaty is personal to so many of us. I am deeply grateful to our \ncommittee members for their thoughtful input on the treaty and the \nresolution of advice consent, and to Senator McCain and former Majority \nLeader Dole, who are as deeply committed to this cause as Senator \nKennedy was to the original Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  Passing this treaty isn't just the right thing to do. It is also the \nsmart thing to do. It will extend essential protections to millions of \ndisabled Americans, including our disabled service men and women and \nveterans, when they travel, study, work, and live abroad. In addition \nto enshrining the principles of the ADA on the international level, the \nconvention will provide us with a critical tool as we advocate for the \nadoption of its standards globally standards to which all of us should \naspire. By joining, we put ourselves in a stronger position to advance \nthe goals of equality of opportunity, independent living, economic \nself-sufficiency, and full participation for individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  The Disabilities Convention is a reflection of our values as a \nnation. It is who we are from the Civil Rights Act to the Voting Rights \nAct to the ADA. We saw how America responded to horrifying civil rights \nimages--our country met collectively to right a wrong at home and break \nthe back of Jim Crow. Now is the time to step up and meet collectively \nto help make it right for the millions of Americans with disabilities \nwhen they are overseas and for the hundreds of millions of disabled \nindividuals throughout the world.\n  This is one of those moments the Senate was intended to live up to--\nand it calls on all of us to provide leadership and find the common \nground. The winners of this treaty will not be defined by party or \nideology. The winners will be the American people.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to ensure that the Senate approves the Disabilities Convention \nduring the 112th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5964-3", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5964-S5965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, a few weeks ago the president of the ABA \na--purportedly nonpartisan organization--wrote a letter to the majority \nand Republican leaders regarding nominations and the Leahy-Thurmond \nrule. I noticed that my good friend the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee entered a copy of that letter in the Record.\n  That letter failed to mention quite a few pertinent facts. The \nRepublican leader and I sent the ABA a letter which highlighted some of \nthose facts. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S5965]]\n\n\n                                  Office of the Republican Leader,\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2012.\n     Mr. William T. (Bill) Robinson III,\n     President, American Bar Association, 321 North Clark Street, \n         Chicago, IL.\n       Dear Mr. Robinson: We were surprised to receive your letter \n     of June 20, 2012 urging, for the first time, confirmation of \n     particular circuit court nominees despite the existence of \n     the Leahy-Thurmond Rule. By any objective measure--overall \n     circuit court vacancy rate, vacancies on the respective \n     circuit courts, or judicial emergency designation--our \n     appellate courts are doing, at least as well, and in most \n     respects much better, now than when our democratic colleagues \n     invoked the Rule both times during the last administration. \n     Given this exceptionally fair treatment of President Obama's \n     judicial nominees, it is curious that your organization would \n     choose now to urge the Senate not to follow its practice of \n     suspending the processing of circuit court nominations in the \n     months preceding a presidential election. This unprecedented \n     action raises questions about the American Bar Association's \n     objectivity and neutrality.\n       While the circuit court vacancy rate in June 2008 was the \n     same as it is now, there were twice as many judicial \n     emergencies in the circuit courts at that time. The Fourth \n     Circuit Court of Appeals, in fact, was in crisis. Fully one-\n     fourth of its seats were empty, even though the prior \n     administration had nominated outstanding individuals to till \n     them. Despite the crisis facing the Fourth Circuit in June of \n     2008, our democratic colleagues refused to process any of \n     President George W. Bush's four, well qualified nominees.\n       For instance, the Senate twice had unanimously confirmed \n     Judge Robert Conrad to the important positions of United \n     States Attorney and federal district court judge. By this \n     time in June of 2008. his nomination to the Fourth Circuit \n     had been pending for 344 days. Our democratic colleagues \n     refused to process his nomination, notwithstanding support \n     from home state senators, a unanimous well qualified rating \n     from your organization, and--in contradistinction to any of \n     the three nominees mentioned in your letter--the \n     Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts had declared the \n     vacancy to which he was nominated to be a judicial emergency.\n       Senate democrats refused to process three other qualified \n     nominees to the Fourth Circuit. Steve Matthews had support \n     from home state senators, and by this time in 2008, had been \n     pending for 293 days. Judge Glen Conrad had been confirmed to \n     the district court in 2003 by the unanimous vote of 89-0. \n     Both home state senators, one republican and one democrat, \n     strongly supported his nomination. Rod Rosenstein, the then \n     and current U.S. Attorney for Maryland, also would have \n     filled a judicial emergency on the Fourth Circuit. \n     Nonetheless, democrat home state Senators blocked his \n     nomination--incredibly--for the reason that he was doing a \n     ``good job'' as U.S. Attorney and ``that's where [they] need \n     him.''\n       Our democratic colleagues' record with respect to these \n     nominees was so abysmal that even the Washington Post \n     editorial board called them to task, writing. ``[T]he Senate \n     should act in good faith to fill vacancies--not as a favor to \n     the president but out of respect for the residents, \n     businesses, defendants and victims of crime in the region the \n     4th Circuit covers.'' The ABA, by contrast, said nothing when \n     Senate democrats invoked the Leahy-Thurmond Rule and stopped \n     processing circuit court nominations in June of 2008. These \n     outstanding nominees, along with others like Peter Keisler--\n     who by this date in June of 2008 had been bottled up in \n     committee for an astonishing 727 days--did not merit any \n     special consideration by the ABA in the months preceding the \n     last presidential election.\n       The situation on our circuit courts was equally dismal in \n     June of 2004 when President Bush was concluding his first \n     term in office. The overall vacancy rate on our circuit \n     courts was much higher than it is now. And the Sixth Circuit, \n     like the Fourth Circuit in 2008, was in crisis, with fully \n     one-fourth of its seats empty, even though the prior \n     administration had nominated qualified individuals to fill \n     those vacancies as well. And as in 2008. the ABA said nothing \n     when our democratic colleagues cited the Leahy-Thurmond \n     Rule--this time to justify filibustering several circuit \n     court nominees in the months preceding the 2004 presidential \n     election.\n       The ABA presents itself to the public as a non-partisan. \n     professional organization. However, it has chosen to advocate \n     for this Administration's circuit court nominees in the few \n     remaining months before this presidential election, when it \n     chose not to do so before either of the last two presidential \n     elections despite much more compelling circumstances. This \n     sort of selective advocacy is precisely why so many people \n     question the ABA's professed neutrality.\n       We will continue to work with the senate majority to \n     process judicial nominations, consistent with the practices \n     of the Senate--practices strongly defended by our Democratic \n     colleagues during the previous administration and about which \n     the ABA said nothing. Indeed, the Senate will vote on another \n     judicial nomination tomorrow. If confirmed, that will be the \n     151st lower court confirmation already for this \n     Administration, in addition to two Supreme Court \n     nominations--a confirmation total far greater than what was \n     achieved under comparable circumstances during the last \n     administration. We hope that in the future the ABA will take \n     a balanced approach to assessing the judicial confirmation \n     process in the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mitch McConnell,\n       Republican Leader, U.S. Senate.\n     Chuck Grassley,\n       Ranking Member, Judiciary Committee U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5965-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5965-S5966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING THE SISTERS OF ST. JOSEPH OF BRENTWOOD, NY\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, We rise today to honor three great \nAmerican heroes and their devoted organization. In Long Island, NY \nthere are three American nuns that have been working to ease the burden \nof the poor and the sick and educate our youth for the past 80 years.\n  Sister Francis Gerard Kress, Sister Edward Joseph Murphy and Sister \nAlice Francis Young are all nuns with the Sisters of St. Joseph of \nBrentwood, NY and have given this order and their community over 80 \nyears of service.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. The Sisters of St. Joseph first came to the United \nStates to Carondelet, MO in 1836, and established a school dedicated to \nthe education of deaf children. Mother Austin Kean, accompanied by \nSister Baptista Hanson and Sister Theodosia Hegeman, came to Brooklyn \nin 1856 to found what is now, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Brentwood, \nNY. The goal of the Sisters of St. Joseph continues to be to foster \nlove, unity and reconciliation among all people and with this earth. \nFor over 150 years, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Brentwood, NY have \nbeen faithful in their vision to serve the world and its people. Since \nthe creation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Brentwood order in 1856, \nthere has been over 2,500 Sisters to serve, and currently there are 588 \nserving or in retirement throughout the United States.\n  There is not enough time in this Congress to fully describe the work \nand accomplishments of the Sisters of St. Joseph. But I would like to \nhighlight some of the work of these three remarkable nuns.\n  Sister Alice Francis Young joined the Convent of the Sisters of St. \nJoseph in 1932, and since then has proven to be a pioneer and integral \nforce in early childhood education. Sister Young's career milestones \ninclude helping to start the first Head Start program in New York, \nworking as a master teacher at St. Joseph's College in Brooklyn for 20 \nyears, and being a professor of child study at St. Joseph's for over 40 \nyears. She has helped educate thousands of children and given them the \nability to reach their potential.\n  Sister Francis Gerard Kress has been a Sister of St. Josephs for 80 \nyears, working on community activism and being a champion for health \ncare and environmental protection. In September 1982, Sister Kress \ntestified before the U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on \nWater Resources and in doing so shed light on her work around the \nenvironmental dangers that existed near Newton Creek in Williamsburg, \nBrooklyn, NY. Her work has since helped to protect a community from \nthese dangers and enlighten the Nation to the importance of the Clean \nWater Act.\n  Sister Edward Joseph Murphy is 99 years old and joined the Order of \nthe Sisters of St. Joseph in 1932. She spent her life educating at the \nprimary and secondary levels, helping children throughout this Nation \nimprove their lives through education and community service, as well as \nhelp new arrivals to this Nation with English by way of her Orders' \nEnglish as a Second Language programs. Sister Murphy also spent over 20 \nyears caring for the community and residents of Merrick, Long Island, \nNY by visiting homes, nursing homes and hospitals, bringing food and \ntoys, and assisting in times of crisis.\n  For the past 80 years, Sister Francis Gerard Kress, Sister Edward \nJoseph Murphy and Sister Alice Francis Young have dedicated their lives \nfor the betterment of others in New York, the United States and around \nthe world. We are humbled to have the opportunity to recognize the life \nand service of these amazing women and everlasting mark they left on so \nmany.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we would like the United States Senate to\n\n[[Page S5966]]\n\nrecognize and honor the work of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Brentwood, \nNY; and the lifelong dedication of Sisters Francis Gerard Kress, Edward \nJoseph Murphy and Alice Francis Young for their 80 years of service to \ntheir religion, professions and country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5966-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING GORE VIDAL\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the great \ntalents and accomplishments of Gore Vidal, the extraordinary American \nwriter who died this week at age 86 in California, where he spent the \nlast 9 years of his life.\n  Gore Vidal was a child of the Senate--or more precisely, a grandchild \nof the Senate. His maternal grandfather was Senator Thomas Pryor Gore \nof Oklahoma, and the writer's happiest childhood memories were of the \ntimes he lived at Senator Gore's Washington home. According to Vidal's \nNew York Times obituary, ``He loved to read to his grandfather, who was \nblind, and sometimes accompanied him onto the Senate floor.'' Vidal \nhimself later said, ``At something like 13 or 14, I wanted to be a \npolitician, but knew that I was a writer. . . .''\n  This change of career path worked out best for everyone. Gore Vidal's \nprose was elegant and crystal clear, and his range as a writer has \nseldom been equaled. His essays, perhaps his greatest triumph, utilized \nand displayed his wide-ranging interests, encyclopedic learning, and \ndazzling wit. He also wrote more than two dozen novels including a \nseries on American political history that is widely read and admired on \nboth sides of the aisle--as well as plays, screenplays, television \ndramas, and two volumes of memoirs.\n  Gore Vidal twice ran for office, losing a 1960 run for Congress in \nupstate New York and a 1982 Senate primary in California. Despite these \npolitical setbacks, he remained convinced that ``There is no human \nproblem which could not be solved if people would simply do as I \nadvise.'' He dispensed his advice with great wit and intelligence for \nmore than 60 years, and America is far the richer for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5966-2", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5966-S5967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DROUGHT IMPACT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \ndevastating impact the drought gripping nearly 80 percent of the \ncountry is having on food producers.\n  Fewer natural occurrences are more devastating to agricultural \nproduction than extreme drought. The drought conditions the United \nStates is facing today are considered the worst the country has seen in \nmore than 50 years.\n  Data computed in the Palmer Drought Severity Index indicate that the \nseverity of the current drought is on par with the Dust Bowl of the \n1930s.\n  USDA has determined that more than 1,000 counties in 26 States, \nencompassing more than two thirds of the lower 48, are experiencing \ndrought conditions. Drought conditions stretch from coast to coast and \nencompass nearly every State south of 42nd parallel west of the \nMississippi River while also including nearly all of Florida, Alabama, \nGeorgia and South Carolina. It is also worth noting that farmers on \nDelmarva peninsula are coping with a drought of their own as well as \nrecord high temperatures.\n  While these conditions undoubtedly present challenges for commodity \ngrowers, agricultural science, modern farming techniques and a series \nof financial support programs help commodity growers cope with \nincreasingly difficult growing conditions.\n  These advances in farming, combined with robust grower supports like \ncommodity direct payments and federally subsidized crop insurance \npremiums, along with a high market price for corn, driven by increased \ndemand for corn from a variety of sectors, including ethanol producers \nwho must meet government mandates to produce 15.2 billion gallons of \nethanol this year, all help U.S. grain growers survive this difficult \ngrowing season.\n  Our national farm support programs are centered on assuring the \nfinancial security of commodity growers. However, there is little to no \nassurances on the availability and affordability of corn feed for \nlivestock and poultry and for food production broadly.\n  This issue hits very close to home for me as Maryland's poultry \nindustry continues to struggle tremendously during this drought because \nthere is so little corn feed available. What feed is available is \nextremely expensive.\n  Feed accounts for more than 75 percent of the cost of raising \npoultry. Corn futures project the price of corn hitting $9 dollars a \nbushel by the end of the summer. As the price of feed continues to \nrise, feed costs will make up an even greater percentage of the cost to \ngrow birds to market weight.\n  And unlike raising hogs and cattle, which ruminant species that can \neat other types of feed like soybeans or hay, chickens can only eat \ngrains--in other words corn.\n  To understand how important the availability of affordable corn is \nlet's take a look at chicken by the numbers:\n  As of today, the price per bushel of corn is $8.20.\n  One bushel of corn equals 56 pounds of shelled corn.\n  On average, it takes 7 weeks and 13\\1/2\\ pounds of corn to raise a \nsingle chicken to market weight.\n  Market weight for a single chicken is approximately six pounds, \nalthough the weight of the bird that is actually meat is probably \nsomewhere closer to three or four pounds.\n  Approximately four birds can be raised, from egg to slaughter, on a \nbushel of shelled corn--or, a little more than $2 worth of corn.\n  The retail price for a whole three pound chicken at a popular \nMaryland supermarket chain is $6 (at $2 per lb).\n  That means that the retail price of a pound of chicken is equal to \nthe price of corn feed. And corn is just one input cost to raising \npoultry.\n  Clearly market conditions like this are not sustainable for \nmaintaining a viable domestic poultry industry.\n  Domestic poultry, beef, and pork producers operate without the safety \nnets commodity growers have. Those domestic producers that are still \nowned by U.S.-based companies are at an even greater disadvantage, \nbecause many of the foreign owned meat and poultry companies in the \nU.S. can afford to operate at a loss for extended periods of time \nbecause they have financial backing from state-run banks overseas.\n  Our meat and poultry producers are in dire need of relief if they are \ngoing to survive into the future. One way to provide some relief for \npoultry and livestock growers would be to modify the Renewable Fuel \nStandard's ethanol production mandate for corn ethanol so as to provide \nour farmers better access to the corn stocks they need.\n  Food producers--including livestock and poultry producers, who use \ntremendous amounts of corn to raise their livestock and produce food--\ndo not have the luxury of a mandated market for their products.\n  I understand the important role domestic ethanol production will play \nin helping our Nation achieve greater energy security. However, the \nnurturing and growth of our domestic biofuels industry must not come at \nthe expense of our domestic food supply. In other words, we cannot \nsacrifice U.S. food security for energy security. That is why I do not \nsupport the use of food based feedstocks like sugar and corn to be \ncommercially produced into ethanol.\n  Domestic food production is reaching a state of crisis driven by the \nincreasing cost of inputs, like corn, that the food producers have to \nunfairly compete with industries that are operating with under \ngovernment production mandates.\n  That is why Senators Boozman, Mikulski and I introduced legislation \nmaking a simple change to the Renewable Fuel Standard to help provide \ndomestic food producers access to corn.\n  This legislation will link the amount of corn ethanol required for \nthe RFS to the amount of U.S. corn supplies. This legislation sets up a \nprocess so that when the USDA reports on U.S. corn supplies towards the \nend of each year, based upon the ratio of corn stocks to expected use, \nthere could be a reduction made to the RFS mandate for corn ethanol. \nThis is a commonsense solution to make sure that we have enough corn \nsupplies to meet all of our corn demands.\n  Once a year, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \nwill review the current corn crop year's ratio of U.S. corn stocks-to-\nuse ratio in making a determination of the RFS.\n  Another way to deliver some of this needed relief would be for the \nHouse to immediately pass the Senate Farm Bill\n\n[[Page S5967]]\n\nthat passed with bipartisan support in the Senate in June.\n  The livestock disaster provisions originally enacted in the 2008 Farm \nbill expired in 2011, leaving producers without disaster assistance for \nthe current crop year. The Senate bill strengthens these programs and \nmakes them retroactive to address the current drought of 2012.\n  As of July 17, approximately 73 percent of cattle producing areas \nwere affected by moderate or more intense drought.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the Delmarva peninsula, where a fair amount \nof the corn is raised for feed for Delmarva poultry, is in a state of \ndrought, as are the regions of the country where the rest of the corn \nDelmarva poultry uses is shipped in from.\n  Livestock disaster programs are critical as farmers and ranchers \nexperience losses in livestock and grazing land due to extreme heat, \ndrought, and fire. The 2012 Farm Bill provides permanent funding and \nauthority for the Livestock Disaster Programs.\n  Beyond helping livestock and poultry growers, the 2012 Farm Bill also \nprovides much needed assistance to fruit and vegetable growers, too, by \nexpanding crop insurance coverage to these farmers. The bill also \nallows the Risk Management Agency to conduct research and development \non new crop insurance products to expand access to index-based weather \ninsurance products for fruit and vegetable growers.\n  The House appears poised to just kick the can for a year. The House \nis likely to consider a measure to merely extend the 2008 Farm Bill for \na year, while also offering some drought assistance--paid for from cuts \nto conservation programs.\n  This is a plan that the American Farm Bureau opposes, and \ndemonstrates both the dysfunction of the House--in that they won't \nsimply do what's easiest and best for farmers by taking up and passing \nthe Senate bill--while also ignoring how vital farm conservation is to \npreventing agricultural disasters.\n  The Senate Farm Bill preserves USDA conservation programs. The \nNatural Resource Conservation Service, formerly known as the Soil \nConservation Service, was born out of the tragedy of the Dust Bowl.\n  The disastrous droughts of the 1930s taught us the lesson that we \nneed to do more to protect water and soil resources so that we do not \nrepeat the mistakes of the past.\n  The 2012 Senate Farm bill conservation programs are critical for \nkeeping America's farmers and ranchers doing what they do best--growing \nand producing a safe and stable food supply. Crops need healthy soil \nand plentiful water to grow, and natural disasters like drought have a \nlong-term impact on soil and water quality.\n  The Farm bill's conservation title provides farmers and ranchers \naccess to the tools they need to conserve and keep our Nation's natural \nresources as resilient as possible, even in the face of drought and \nother natural disasters.\n  For the good of American agriculture and the American consumer, I \nurge the House leadership to take advantage of this last opportunity \nbefore the August recess to do what is right and pass the Senate Farm \nbill. My hope is that House leadership will realize that it behooves \nus, when we go home to our districts during the summer recess and \nattend State and county fairs, to be able to tell our farming \ncommunities that we sent a Farm bill to the President with meaningful \nreforms and essential disaster relief to help them through these \ndifficult times.\n  Personally, I want to be able to tell my poultry growers that \nWashington hears their plight. That is why, in addition to urging House \npassage of the Senate Farm bill, I would also like to see further \nrelief for poultry growers in the form of improved access to corn feed.\n  For decades, America's corn growers were outproducing demand for corn \nfrom food producers. While consumers may have benefitted from \nrelatively low corn prices, American corn and grain growers were \nhurting badly.\n  Since 2007, the tides have been turning significantly. National \ndemand for corn is at an all-time high and corn is likely to reach $9 a \nbushel in the near future. A growing and hungry Nation, combined with \nnew demands for corn that are the result of technological innovations, \nhave created new uses for corn in the form of ethanol as both a motor \nfuel additive and in plastics. These new uses, combined with expanded \ntraditional uses, have fueled the upward spike in corn prices.\n  The effects of the 2012 drought are obviously a catastrophe that we \ncannot legislate away. However, there are actions that the USDA and EPA \ncould take to help improve market access to the corn stocks food \nproducers need to keep feeding America.\n  Senators Hagan, Chambliss, Pryor, Boozman, and I have authored a \nletter to the EPA administrator calling for the waiver of the Renewable \nFuel Standard's conventional ethanol production mandate for this year. \nDoing so would allow food producers to compete fairly with ethanol \nproducers for corn.\n  While ethanol production is down, due to high corn prices ethanol \nproducers are sitting on roughly 2.5 billion production credits, known \nas RINs (Renewable Identification Numbers), that they could cash in and \nfurther reduce the perceived demand for corn and increase the supply \navailable to food producers.\n  I understand the important role domestic ethanol production will play \nin helping our Nation achieve greater energy security. However, the \ngrowth of our domestic biofuels industry must not come at the expense \nof our domestic food supply. We cannot sacrifice U.S. food security for \nenergy security. That is why I do not support the use of food based \nfeedstocks like sugar and corn to be commercially produced into \nethanol.\n  I believe the future of biofuels must be in the development and \nproduction of cellulosic and advanced biofuels that are not derived \nfrom feedstocks that are part of essential food sources.\n  Because of corn's many uses, it has become a commodity that is in \nhigh demand. Assuring our domestic food producers' access to this \nvaluable and increasingly scarce crop is so important to controlling \nthe cost of food in America and maintaining the economic viability of \nour U.S. food companies.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Hagan, Boozman, Pryor, \nChambliss and I in calling on EPA to waive the RFS corn ethanol \nproduction mandate and call on the House to pass the Senate's Farm \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5967-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5967-S5968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      BRUMIDI GOLD MEDAL CEREMONY\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remarks I \ndeliver on July 11 at the Brumidi Gold Medal Ceremony be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Statement on S. 254\n\n\na bill to award posthumously a Congressional Gold Medal to Constantino \n    Brumidi Constantino Brumidi Gold Medal Ceremony, Rayburn Room, \n                     delivered July 11, 2012--11 am\n\n       Mr. Speaker, Leaders, Mr. Ambassador, fellow Italians--and \n     friends of Italy. This is a process that started about five \n     years ago, and it's the first one that one hundred Senators \n     ever sponsored. It's taken 5 years but for Constantino \n     Brumidi, there was no greater honor than being called an \n     American citizen. It was a title he sought and then signed \n     with pride on the best of his work.\n       For my own family and for many of you, it wasn't long after \n     Constantino Brumidi left for America, that my own ancestors \n     heard the call for freedom and came here as well. Just like \n     Constantino Brumidi they left the beauty of Italy--its \n     mountains and its sunny shores--to come and be a part of the \n     great adventure called the United States.\n       And I swear that if you walk through these halls late at \n     night you can almost hear the whispers of the past and the \n     hushed echoes of the voices of our Founding Fathers, past \n     Senators and Representatives as they debated and discussed \n     the issues of the day. And perhaps Constantino, as he talks \n     about the art.\n       The history books tell us that Constantino Brumidi was born \n     in Rome of Italian and Greek heritage, and he had a great \n     talent for painting that revealed itself at an early age. \n     After he came to the United States and one day, after \n     completing a commission, he stopped in Washington, DC, to \n     visit the Capitol on his way home, and looking at its tall, \n     blank walls and empty corridors, he must have felt the \n     excitement and inspiration only an artist facing an empty \n     canvas can know. On that day he began what was more than an \n     assignment for him--it was a labor of love--as he brought to \n     life the great moments in American history for all of us to \n     see on the walls and ceilings. His efforts were destined to \n     earn him the title of ``America's Michelangelo.''\n\n[[Page S5968]]\n\n       Liberty is the philosophy that guided Constantino Brumidi's \n     hand as it fired his imagination and inspired his creations \n     in our nation's Capital. Imagine what he would think if he \n     could walk these corridors today. He would see that his \n     beautiful work has stood the test of time, especially after \n     being cleaned up after the accumulated lamp smoke. He would \n     know of the appreciation and admiration of countless visitors \n     from our shores and around the world. He would see that his \n     art continues to thrill the millions who flock here every \n     year. I believe he would be both proud and humbled to be the \n     center of such attention.\n       Throughout the Capitol, each careful stroke of Brumidi's \n     brush will continue to remind us that we are blessed and \n     truly fortunate to live in this land of promise and \n     opportunity.\n       Now it is only fitting that the Congress of the United \n     States of America should bestow on Constantino Brumidi the \n     nation's highest civilian honor--the Congressional Gold \n     Medal--which incidentally is to be permanently displayed in \n     the Capitol. It will be the only one displayed in the \n     Capitol, and will give people an opportunity to see what a \n     Congressional Gold medal looks like.\n       And now I would like to introduce my colleague and fellow \n     Italian-American, Senator Pat Leahy of Vermont, who served \n     since 1974, and if you check his left lapel, he is wearing \n     one of the highest awards that Italy can give to a son of \n     Italy. He was one of the original sponsors on my Senate \n     Constantino Brumidi bill and helped me gather every single \n     signature to support this bill. Senator Leahy is the Chairman \n     of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and is a senior member of \n     both the Agriculture and Appropriations Committee. I give you \n     my fellow Italian, Senator Pat Leahy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5968-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CPSIA ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, few states appreciate the importance of \noutdoor recreation the way we do in Minnesota--whether it is cross-\ncountry skiing, snowmobiling, fishing, hiking or off-roading, these \nactivities are more than just hobbies for us--they are a way of life \nand they are woven into the fabric of our economy. That is why today I \nrise to commemorate the 1-year anniversary of the passage of the lead \nstandard exemptions for youth all-terrain vehicles.\n  Minnesota is home to many strong recreational product manufacturers \nthat provide jobs and have helped move our economy forward during these \ndifficult times. Our economy doesn't hinge on churning money around \nWall Street, it hinges on building things and the motorcycle and all-\nterrain vehicle industry is a shining example of that. This industry is \nnot just about recreation--it is about jobs, it is about manufacturing, \nand it is about preserving a key part of our culture and economy.\n  I supported the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act when it \npassed in 2008 because it addressed serious safety concerns about lead \nin children's toys. But when we have legislation as detailed and \nsweeping as the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, certain \nadjustments and clarifications sometimes need to be made, as we saw \nwith the lead limits for youth all-terrain vehicles. Simply put, \nchildren's off-road vehicles were never supposed to be subject to \nrequirements in the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act.\n  The law was designed to protect our kids, but by banning youth-sized \nall-terrain vehicles children were put at risk because they started \nriding oversized adult vehicles that don't take the same considerations \nas a model meant to accommodate children. Once it became clear that the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission was going to hold youth all-terrain \nvehicles to the new lead requirements, I began working to find a \nsolution to the problem.\n  That is why I pushed to pass the amendments to the Consumer Product \nSafety Improvement Act last year to exempt youth all-terrain vehicles \nfrom lead standards. August 12th will be the 1-year anniversary of \nenactment of these amendments to Consumer Product Safety Improvement \nAct into law.\n  I would like to commemorate the 1-year anniversary of passage of \nthese amendments to Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act that help \nprotect our children and ensure they enjoy the outdoors for many years \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5968-2", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO TOM SULLIVAN\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nexceptional leadership and dedication of my deputy chief of staff Tom \nSullivan, who has been with me since my first days in the Senate and \nwill soon be leaving to accept a senior adviser role at the U.S. State \nDepartment.\n  To say that Tom will be missed would be an understatement. Over the \nlast 6 years, he has distinguished himself as an invaluable member of \nmy staff, rising through the ranks and filling many key roles along the \nway. He started out as a legislative assistant, but it wasn't long \nbefore he was serving as my deputy legislative director and, \neventually, my deputy chief of staff.\n  In many ways you could call Tom the nerve center of my office--the \nutility player who can step in and perform virtually any task that is \nasked of him, regardless of whether it is press strategy or scheduling \nor legislative analysis. No policy was ever too complex for him, no \nassignment too daunting, no challenge too thorny.\n  Tom's versatility is especially apparent in his knowledge of policy, \nwhich spans the full spectrum of State and Federal issues. He came to \nmy office with a background in foreign relations but quickly became an \nexpert in everything from energy to technology to health care, \nmastering and remembering even the most minute of details without \nlosing sight of the forest for the trees. That is a rare talent, and \nTom has it in spades.\n  Mr. President, as you know, Senate offices often become like their \nown little family units. In the last 6 years, Tom Sullivan has become \nan esteemed member of the Klobuchar family, and he will be sorely \nmissed--not just for his skill and expertise but for his composure, \nkindness, and unflappable good nature. We wish Tom well in his new \nposition at the State Department and know that we can expect to see \ngreat things from him as he begins a new and exciting journey in public \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5968-3", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5968-S5969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \nimportance of passing the Violence Against Women Act, and reauthorizing \nthis critical funding for survivors of domestic violence. We have heard \nabout the protections the Senate version offers that the House does \nnot, to women on college campuses, to women on tribal lands, to LGBT \nvictims, and to immigrants. It is important to remember all of the \nother programs supported by this important legislation.\n  On this day, when preventive health care finally becomes available to \n47 million women, including free domestic violence screening and \ncounseling, it is worth taking a look at how domestic violence impacts \nhealthcare for women and families in this country.\n  According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control, the average \ncost of health care services for women is more than twice the average \ncost for men, and this is largely due to the costs and impact of \ndomestic violence.\n  The CDC estimates the direct health care costs associated with \ndomestic violence to be around $4.1 billion every year. And we know \nthis is a conservative estimate, because many victims never come \nforward.\n  But we have a proven tool in this fight, and that is the protections \nin the Violence Against Women Act. Since the bill first went into \neffect in 1994, reporting has increased by 51 percent according to the \nDepartment of Justice. The FBI reports that the number of women killed \nby an intimate partner has decreased by 34 percent. And VAWA saved \n$12.6 billion in its first 7 years alone.\n  It is not just that women are safer because of VAWA, our economy also \nimproves when domestic violence is successfully prevented, because \nfewer women are going to the emergency rooms, missing work, or deciding \nthey cannot care for their children.\n  I have had a chance to visit several crisis centers in New Hampshire \nwho benefit directly from VAWA funding. Most recently, I visited the \nMonadnock Center for Violence Prevention in Keene, and had a chance to \nspeak with caseworkers and survivors. I spoke with two women who told \nme that when they decided it was time to leave their abuser, they had \nno place else to go.\n  And I asked them, ``What would have happened if this center wasn't \nhere?''\n  ``My husband would have killed me,'' replied one woman.\n  This is why we need to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. \nThis\n\n[[Page S5969]]\n\nis about women who are in danger, and desperately need our help.\n  I also had a chance to meet some children who were staying at the \ncenter. And I would like to take a moment to talk about how important \nthis bill is for them, both children who witness domestic violence, or \nare victims themselves.\n  Centers all over New Hampshire and the United States have child \nadvocacy programs that offer support groups for children. Dawn Reams, \nDirector of the Bridges Crisis Center in Nashua, NH, described that \nthey have a full-time child advocate who receives funding from VAWA. We \nknow that children are particularly vulnerable and ill-equipped to deal \nwith trauma.\n  And this trauma affects them for their entire lives. A study by the \nWorld Health Organization found that children raised in households \nwhere domestic violence occurred are more likely to have behavioral \nproblems, drop out of school early, and experience juvenile \ndelinquency. A child who witnesses domestic violence between his or her \nparents is more likely to view violence as an acceptable method of \nconflict resolution. Boys who witness domestic violence are more likely \nto become abusers, and girls who witness domestic violence are more \nlikely to become victims of domestic violence as adults.\n  The advocate at Bridges does her best to prevent this cycle by \nproviding safety planning for the children, teaching them that they can \nlive a life free of violence. There is free preventive care for \nchildren.\n  She told the story of one young boy, Brian, who was nervous about \nreturning to school. He was supposed to bring with him a story about \nsomething fun he had done over the summer. Brian was staying at Bridges \nwith his mother, and it had not been a fun summer. So the child \nadvocate organized a barbeque in a park across the street from the \ncrisis center.\n  This is the type of healing we need more of, and we can start by \nreauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act. I urge all of my \ncolleagues in the House to pass the Senate VAWA, for women, for \nchildren, for all survivors and for those that have not yet come \nforward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5969-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING GAETANO ``TOM'' MAZZARELLA\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize the 200th \nanniversary of the city of Frostburg in western Maryland. Frostburg is \nlocated in the mountainous terrain of Alleghany County and sits on the \neastern slope of Big Savage Mountain. Frostburg's first settlers \narrived during the construction of the National Road in 1811; the first \npermanent residents settled there a year later, in 1812, which is the \nbicentennial we are observing September 14-16, 2012. The town was \nformally incorporated in 1816. It was originally called Mount Pleasant \nbut the name was changed to Frostburg, after Josiah and Meshach Frost. \nMeshach Frost built the city's first house which later became home to \nthe Stockton Stagecoach Company and prompted the construction of other \nhotels and accommodations for travelers on the National Road. This \ntraffic along the road contributed to the growth of the town as it \nbecame a regular stopping point.\n  Although coal had been discovered near the town as early as 1782, \ndifficulties in transportation made mining in western Maryland \nimpractical. But with the local development of the Baltimore & Ohio \nRailroad and the Chesapeake & Ohio Canal in the 1840s, coal mining \nbegan to flourish, providing tremendous economic opportunities for \nFrostburg. In 1846, Meshach Frost opened the Frostburg Coal Company and \nbegan to send the first large shipments of coal to the east. Only 4 \nyears later, numerous other companies became active in the area, \nincluding the Allegany Coal Company, the Maryland Coal Company, and the \nWashington Coal Company. By 1863, the economy of Frostburg and the \nsurrounding area was firmly tied to the increasingly profitable coal \nindustry. Another industry to develop during this period was the \nmanufacturing of fire bricks from high grade clays found in the area. \nIn 1902, the Big Savage Fire Brick Company was formed and to this day \nis one of the major manufactures of fire bricks on the east coast.\n  Frostburg State University, founded in 1898, was donated to the State \nby the citizens of Frostburg and was intended to train teachers for \nMaryland's public schools. The school grew slowly from an original \nenrollment of 91 students and has expanded to serve over 6,000 students \ntoday. The University has become a major economic engine for the \ncommunity and a hub for academic and cultural activity.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mayor W. Robert \nFlanigan and the residents of the city of Frostburg on its bicentennial \nbirthday and 200 years of industry and ingenuity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5969-3", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5969-S5970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR.

For the past 10 years, Dr. Morgan has played an \ninstrumental role in the expansion of agricultural research in her \ndepartment and the development of higher education in our State. As she \nsteps down from her position as dean to rejoin the University of \nDelaware's faculty, I give my most sincere thanks to her and her staff \nfor their diligent and enduring efforts to maintain the College of \nAgriculture and Natural Resources' reputation as one of the best in the \nNation.\n  Throughout her tenure as dean, Dr. Morgan conducted many studies that \nhighlighted the substantial contribution of agriculture to Delaware's \neconomy. Through her research and professional leadership, she has \nrelentlessly\n\n[[Page S5970]]\n\nsupported agriculture in Delaware and has emphasized its importance to \nthe financial well-being of our State. Dr. Morgan has always taken \ngreat pride in her faculty, which brings new skills, ideas, and \ninnovation in various fields to the future of agriculture and natural \nresources. Over the past decade, under Dean Morgan's guidance, the \nnumber of undergraduate applications to the College of Agriculture and \nNatural Resources has doubled.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a native \nNevadan for her accomplished career and lifelong commitment to the \nSilver State. Susan Martinovich, director of the Nevada Department of \nTransportation, NDOT, will be retiring this summer after 28 years with \nthe agency. As an incredible leader in recognizing and addressing the \ntransportation needs of my home State for nearly three decades, Susan's \ntalent will be difficult to replace.\n  Susan started her career at NDOT as a rotation engineer where she \nbecame familiar with the inner workings of the department. Shortly \nthereafter, she was promoted to the bridge division and was responsible \nfor the design of several structures in the State. Over the next \ndecade, Susan worked her way up through the agency and contributed to \nthe development of several major freeway projects. In 2007, she was \nappointed as the first female director of NDOT, where she assumed the \nrole of managing the agency of more than 1,800 individuals. As \ndirector, Susan continuously advocated for a solid and comprehensive \ntransportation plan, focused on creating jobs for Nevadans.\n  In 2011, she was named the first female president of the American \nAssociation of State Highway Transportation Officials, AASHTO, a \nnational organization representing highway and transportation \ndepartments across the country. As president, she supported AASHTO's \nmission of promoting the development, operation, and maintenance of a \ncohesive national transportation system.\n  I wish Susan the best of luck in her future endeavors and look \nforward to what she will accomplish next. Today, I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in recognizing her indelible service to the great State of \nNevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5970-2", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNIZING TIMBERLINE LODGE\n\n Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today I wish to celebrate the 75th \nanniversary of Timberline Lodge.\n  Since being constructed in 1937 under President Roosevelt's Works \nProject Administration, Timberline Lodge has served as a beacon for \nthose looking to enjoy year-round recreational activities on one of the \nNation's most magnificent mountainsides--Oregon's Mount Hood.\n  Overcoming a series of challenges in the first part of the 20th \ncentury that threatened to close this lodge, Oregon's Timberline Lodge \nwas declared a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of the \nInterior on December 22, 1977. Without the tireless work of those who \nhave cared for Timberline Lodge over the years, specifically Richard L. \nKohnstamm and the Friends of Timberline, the legacy of this national \ntreasure would not have endured.\n  Today, over 1.9 million people visit Timberline Lodge every year. \nThis includes the U.S. Ski Team, which trains at Timberline every \nsummer.\n  Part of Timberline's rich history is its role in many films. Most \nnotably, visuals of the exterior of the lodge were used to depict the \nOverlook hotel in ``The Shining.''\n  As President Roosevelt said in 1937 when he dedicated this lodge: \n``The people of the United States are singularly fortunate in having \nsuch great areas of the outdoors in the permanent possession of the \npeople themselves--permanently available for many different forms of \nuse.''\n  It is my honor to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Timberline Lodge, \na landmark that Oregon, and the Nation, is lucky to have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5970-3", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS BIRDIE ELISE DAVIDSON\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL.

She moved to St. Louis when she married Mr. \nLouis Sachs. She and Mr. Sachs have three children, seven \ngrandchildren, and six great granddaughters. Her daughter, Marjorie, is \nmarried to Mr. Louis Susman, the U.S. Ambassador to Court of St. James \nin the United Kingdom. Her daughter, Nancy, lives in Highland Park, IL. \nHer son Louis, Jr., lives in San Diego, CA.\n  After retiring with her husband to Key Biscayne, FL, Birdie earned \nrecognition for her philanthropic activities. She is best known for her \nwork for the American Cancer Society.\n  The social and technological developments that Birdie has witnessed \nin her lifetime are truly incredible. She has lived through two world \nwars, the rise and fall of the Soviet Union, and the Great Depression. \nShe has experienced the birth of the Internet, humanity's journey into \nspace, and the eradication of polio and smallpox. Birdie was born \nbefore women had the right to vote, but ninety-six years later, she \nsupported President Obama's 2008 Presidential campaign. Upon meeting \nthen-candidate Obama, she told him: ``Young man, I have been alive \nthrough 17 Presidents and I am counting on you being the 18th--don't \ndisappoint me!'' She urged President Obama to set new records and to \nchallenge conventional wisdom because she knows the scope and speed of \nchange possible in American life as few others do.\n  Today, I join with my colleagues in the Senate in congratulating \nBirdie and her family on this amazing occasion, and wishing her good \nhealth and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5970-4", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                KANSAS STATE FIRE FIGHTER'S ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr.ROBERTS. Mr. President, this August the Kansas State \nFirefighters Association will commemorate 125 years of providing the \ngreat State of Kansas with the safety, resources, and preparedness it \ntakes to ensure our firefighters are able to protect our citizens. On \nAugust 3, 1887, five service leaders met and organized the Kansas State \nVolunteer Firemen's Association. Today, that organization is known as \nthe Kansas State Firefighters Association and has grown to 518 member \nfire departments. In 125 years, the Kansas State Firefighters \nAssociation has never faulted on its motto: Dedicated to the safety and \neducation of the Kansas firefighter.\n  We all know this summer has been hot and dry. We have seen the deadly \ndestruction fire can cause often with little warning. In times like \nthese, fires created by heavy drought have the potential to get out of \ncontrol quickly. Our courageous firefighters stand ready to battle the \nflames whether naturally created or man-made. The Kansas Fire Fighter's \nAssociation makes certain these selfless, dedicated men and women have \nthe proper tools and resources to battle whatever they face.\n  With that in mind, it is with great pride that I ask the Senate to \nrecognize the Kansas Fire Fighter's Association for all it has done \nover the past 125 years and for the crucial work the members continue \nto do to protect us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5970-5", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5970-S5971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE RUN TO HOME PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhighlight the groundbreaking work that some extraordinary citizens from \nMassachusetts are doing to help veterans of the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. After a decade of conflict, tens of thousands of \nservicemen and women are returning home with invisible wounds. They and \ntheir families are struggling to cope with the effects of deployment-\nrelated\n\n[[Page S5971]]\n\nstress and traumatic brain injury. In New England alone, an estimated \n50,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans experience invisible wounds \nrelated to combat, often requiring rigorous, individualized care.\n  The Department of Veterans' Affairs plans to hire an additional 1,900 \nmental health staffers across the country. This is a promising start, \nbut the increasing demand for mental health services, delays in mental \nhealth treatment and appointments, and the growing divide between \nmental health specialists and veterans requires that we do more.\n  Thankfully, in New England, concerned citizens are not standing on \nthe sideline waiting for the VA to solve the problem. They are coming \ntogether around our veterans and their families right now to provide \nthem with the support they need.\n  The Run to Home Base Program offers our heroes and their families a \nplace to turn. Developed through a collaborative effort of The Red Sox \nFoundation and Massachusetts General Hospital, veterans have an \nopportunity to receive the compassionate support they deserve from \ntrained mental health caregivers. The Run to Home Base Program is a \nperfect example of the kind of unique partnerships and innovative \napproaches that are sure to provide our newest generation of veterans \nwith the world-class care that their selfless sacrifices deserve.\n  I have been proud to participate for the past 2 years in the Run-Walk \nto Home Base at Fenway Park in Boston. This year's event in May raised \nover $7 million for the cause, a remarkable showing of support for our \nNation's heroes. Imagine what could be done for other veterans and \ntheir families around our country if this inspiring model were to \nspread. We have an obligation to honor our veterans and their families \nthrough timely, predictable and effective care and compensation. Thanks \nto the Run to Home Program, many in New England are making a difference \nto better serve our veterans today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5971-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING MARY LOUISE RASMUSON\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Mary \nLouise Rasmuson, who passed away on July 30, 2012, in Anchorage, AK. \nShe was an Alaskan pioneer in every sense of the word--as a trailblazer \nin Alaska soon after statehood, to serving in the military, creating \npathways for Alaskan access to better health and living conditions, and \nas an advocate of stronger education and culture. I have known Mary \nLouise my entire life. She was a warm, gracious woman with a boundless \ncapacity to give herself and energy to causes that impact every one of \nus.\n  Mary Louise was born in East Pittsburgh, PA, on April 11, 1911. Her \nfather, George Milligan, died when she was 12. Her mother, Alice, \nemigrated from France at the age of 16. Mary Louise remained close to \nher mother and her brothers, George and Malcolm, for the rest of their \nlives. She enrolled in the Margaret Morrison Carnegie College, \ngraduating with a bachelor's degree in education, and later earned a \nmaster's in school administration from the University of Pittsburgh. \nMary Louise also received an honorary doctor of laws degree from the \nCarnegie Institute of Technology. She was one of the first two women to \nreceive this degree.\n  In 1942, as the United States entered World War II, Mary Louise left \nher job as an assistant principal in a school district near Pittsburgh \nand became a member of the first class of the new Women's Army Corp. \nShe rose quickly through the ranks, and in 1957 became the fifth \nCommandant, a position she occupied for 6 years as an appointee of \nPresident Eisenhower and President Kennedy. During her 20 years of \nservice, she was awarded multiple medals and honors. As director of the \nWomen's Army Corp unit, military historians credit her with major \nachievements, including increasing the Women's Army Corp's strength, \ninsisting on effectiveness in command, working with Congress to amend \nlaws that deprived women of service credit and benefits, and expanding \nthe range of military opportunities open to women. At one event \nhonoring her, former U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry said, \n``When you hear about women seizing new opportunities to serve, \nremember that they march behind Colonel Rasmuson.''\n  On November 4, 1961, she married Elmer E. Rasmuson, chairman of the \nNational Bank of Alaska and a civilian aide in Alaska to the Secretary \nof Defense. She announced that she would retire from the Women's Army \nCorp as of July 31, 1962. In 1962, a civilian once more, Mary Louise \nRasmuson moved to Anchorage with her husband. The city had perhaps \n50,000 residents at the time. She quickly became active in civic \naffairs, and together Mary Louise and Elmer formed a dynamic team that \nwas influential in the developing State. Mary Louise quickly adapted to \nlife in Alaska and became active in community groups. She was a member \nof the Veterans of Foreign Wars and several other military \norganizations, the American Association of University Women, Zonta, \nRotary Wives, Pioneers of Alaska, Anchorage Women's Club, League of \nWomen Voters, Anchorage Republican Women's Club, Alaska Native \nSisterhood, and National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople, among other groups.\n  In 1967, Mary Louise began what would become 45 years of service on \nthe board of the Rasmuson Foundation, a board whose mission is to \nsupport Alaskan nonprofit organizations to help them become more \nefficient and effective in improving the quality of life for Alaskans. \nShe maintained an active role in the affairs of the foundation and \nregularly attended board meetings until her late nineties. In addition \nto helping direct millions of dollars in grants to Alaska nonprofit \norganizations through the foundation, she expressed her own \nphilanthropy to institutions like Providence Healthcare in Alaska, \nBrother Francis Shelter, and the Alaska Native Heritage Center.\n  Perhaps her most visible impact on Alaska came from her service as \nhead of the Municipality of Anchorage Historical and Fine Arts \nCommission and later as chair of the Anchorage Museum Foundation. Her \nvision, passion, and personal effort led to the creation of the \nAnchorage Museum of Art and History in 1968.\n  Mary Louise was intelligent, diplomatic, principled, ethical, gentle, \nand firm. She spent her life breaking barriers, challenging \nconventions, and seeking to improve opportunities for those around her. \nHer impact can be felt virtually everywhere in Alaska, whether \nimproving the position of families, founding a world-class museum, \nenhancing health care research, or advancing education of Alaska Native \ncultures on a national stage. Her contributions have reached every \ncorner of Alaska.\n  I join all Alaskans in paying my respects and honoring the \nextraordinary life of Mary Louise Rasmuson and know that for \ngenerations to come, everyone who walks into the Anchorage Museum \nbearing her name will be doing the same. May she rest in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5971-2", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5971-S5972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING SHUCKS MAINE LOBSTER\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, my home State has a worldwide \nreputation of excellence in the seafood industry. The natural blessings \nof our rich, rugged coast coupled with our fishermen's hard work and \ncommitment to quality is a recipe for success. Maine's seafood industry \nhas blossomed to prestige and is known for its superior product. This \nreputation has been cultivated by Maine's industry leaders through \nyears of careful quality control and efforts to foster brand \nrecognition. I rise today to commend one such company--Shucks Maine \nLobster of Richmond, ME that exhibits the ingenuity and innovative \nspirit so characteristic of the small businesses in Maine.\n  Founded in 2007 by CEO John Hathaway, Shucks Maine Lobster is a \nseafood processing company with an inventive solution to the most \ncommon predicament with lobster--extracting the meat is so much work. \nBuying wild-caught lobster straight from local fishermen, Shucks then \nprocesses the whole lobster using highly pressurized water to loosen \nthe shell from the meat. The lobsters are then carefully shucked by \nhand and packaged in a vacuum-sealed container for freshness and \nextended refrigerator shelf life. This allows for the lobster meat to \nbe extracted whole--no easy feat, I assure you. This unique method \nyields fresh, never cooked, preshucked lobster meat that is now \navailable on a large commercial scale.\n\n[[Page S5972]]\n\n  It is through the exceptional effort of companies such as Shucks \nMaine Lobster that Maine's seafood industry has garnered its world \nrenowned reputation for premium quality products. The worldwide acclaim \nShucks Maine Lobster continues to receive at international food shows \nand chef competitions adds to the long tradition of Maine's superior \nseafood. Their well-deserved accolades also promote Maine as a brand. \nBy producing such a delicious and more user-friendly way to enjoy \nMaine's fresh lobster, Shucks introduces and expands to new markets and \nfurthers the positive reputation of all Maine seafood.\n  The creativity, dedication, and can-do spirit, so characteristic of \nMaine entrepreneurs, can be seen at Shucks Maine Lobster in abundance. \nFrom a small lobster shack in Kennebunkport to a leader in the frozen \nlobster industry, Shucks has seen both the challenges and rewards of \nseeing an opportunity and sailing towards it. I commend Shucks Maine \nLobster for all their success and wish them well in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5972-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO JUDGE HOWARD A. DAWSON, JR.\n\n Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nHoward A. Dawson, Jr., a native son of the State of Arkansas, and his \nlifetime of exemplary service to our Nation.\n  On August 21, 2012, Judge Dawson will celebrate the 50th anniversary \nof his appointment to the U.S. Tax Court. He is the longest serving \njudge in the history of the court, and one of only four Federal judges \nappointed by President Kennedy who continue to serve on the bench \ntoday. His longevity is remarkable, but his achievements are even more \nso.\n  Judge Dawson hails from Okolona, AR, and comes from a long line of \neducators--parents, uncles, and grandparents--who made their mark in \nArkansas as teachers, school superintendents, and State Education \nDepartment officials.\n  Judge Dawson's earliest Federal service had some ups and downs. \nSenator Hattie Caraway--the first woman Senator from Arkansas and the \nfirst woman in the country elected to serve a full term as a Senator--\nfacilitated his appointment as an elevator operator in what is now the \nRussell Senate Office Building. Since then, however, Judge Dawson's \ncareer has been ``all ups.''\n  As a young captain in the U.S. Army in World War II, Judge Dawson \nserved in France and Germany. After graduation from law school in 1949 \nand a brief stint in private practice, Judge Dawson joined the Internal \nRevenue Service Office of Chief Counsel and held a series of \nincreasingly responsible positions, rising to assistant chief counsel, \nadministration, at the time of his appointment to the Tax Court bench \nin 1962.\n  At the court in the late 1960s, Judge Dawson worked with his mentor, \nfellow Arkansan, and chairman of the powerful House Committee on Ways \nand Means, Congressman Wilbur D. Mills, to help shape legislation that \nreformed the Tax Code and the U.S. Tax Court. Judge Dawson also worked \nto establish the small tax case procedure, which has made the arcane \nworld of tax litigation accessible to self-represented taxpayers, and \nhe became the first judge in charge of the small tax case division.\n  During his five decades of service to the Tax Court, Judge Dawson's \ncolleagues have three times chosen him as their chief judge. His work \nethic is legendary, and he has authored some 1,200 opinions. But his \ncontributions go far beyond his legal opinions, for with kindness, \npatience, and humor he has made his mark on the lives and careers of \nmany at the court as colleague, mentor, and friend.\n  Judge Dawson has been supported in this work by his wife of more than \n66 years, Marianne Dawson. Judge Dawson exemplifies the very best \nqualities of both a jurist and a public servant, and it is with great \npleasure that I rise to salute him today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5972-2", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO JUDGE HOWARD A. DAWSON, JR.\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the longest \nserving judge in the history of the U.S. Tax Court--Judge Howard A. \nDawson, Jr.--who will mark his 50th year as a Federal judge on August \n21, 2012.\n  Judge Dawson, a native of Okolona, AR, comes from a family of \nArkansas educators. Because of his groundbreaking work to unify many \nrural schools in Arkansas, Judge Dawson's father was dubbed ``Dr. Rural \nEducation.'' That reputation earned Judge Dawson's father a position \nwithin the Department of Interior and the family relocated to \nWashington, DC.\n  Judge Dawson started his Federal service right here at the U.S. \nCapitol complex. A fellow Arkansan, Hattie Caraway--the first woman to \nwin election to the U.S. Senate--helped Judge Dawson get a job as an \nelevator operator in what is now the Russell Senate Office Building\n  During World War II, Judge Dawson served as a captain in the U.S. \nArmy, where he was stationed in France and Germany. After the war, he \nearned his law degree at George Washington University School of Law. \nJudge Dawson eventually joined the Internal Revenue Service Office as \nchief of counsel after a brief time working in private practice. In \n1962, Judge Dawson was appointed to the Tax Court bench by President \nJohn F. Kennedy.\n  Well respected among his peers, Judge Dawson was chosen to be chief \njudge three times during his five-decade tenure. He has authored over \n1,200 opinions, but he is also known for contributions that extend \nbeyond his legal writings.\n  As a judge, Dawson worked with fellow Arkansan, Wilbur Mills, to help \nshape the legislation that created today's U.S. Tax Court as an \nindependent judicial body under article I of the Constitution.\n  In order to help self-represented taxpayers, Judge Dawson worked to \nestablish the small tax case procedure to simplify and allow tax \nlitigation to be more accessible. He became the first judge in charge \nof the small tax case division.\n  I would like to recognize Judge Howard A. Dawson, Jr., for his \ncommendable service as a Federal judge. I am proud of his contribution \nto our Nation and to the Natural State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5972-3", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5972-4", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The messages received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5972-5", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5972-S5973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5986.

Bush, attacked al-Qaeda sanctuary bases in \n     Afghanistan in conjunction with local Afghan forces opposed \n     to the terrorist organization operating in their country; and\n       Whereas, the United States military, in the finest \n     traditions of America's fighting forces, had great success in \n     disrupting, dispersing, and destroying al-Qaeda operations \n     and eliminating many of its senior leaders; and\n       Whereas, President Barack Obama, succeeding President Bush \n     as Commander-in-Chief, did continue and strengthen the \n     efforts to completely destroy al-Qaeda; such efforts resulted \n     in the killing of Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda, \n     bringing the world's leading terrorist to justice for the \n     many acts of murder which he and his organization carried \n     out; and\n       Whereas, the United States, having joined forces with \n     nations from around the world, led an effort to stabilize \n     Afghanistan by supporting infrastructure projects beneficial \n     to all Afghans and by helping the Afghans understand the \n     positive benefits of equal rights for all, judicial due \n     process, and the rule of law; and\n       Whereas, after more than a decade of extended military \n     operations to enhance security and with contributions of \n     hundreds of billions of dollars of nation-building resources \n     having been put into the country to foster development, much \n     progress has been made toward the goals of a free and secure \n     society within Afghanistan; and\n       Whereas, while this progress has come at a high financial \n     cost, it has also cost the lives of more than 1,500 brave \n     American service members and dozens of fighting forces of \n     other nations, all of whom made the ultimate sacrifice in \n     service to their country; and\n       Whereas, despite this progress, it appears from recent \n     events involving all the International Security Assistance \n     Forces (ISAF) that the presence of the United States military \n     and that of other countries, as well as the civilian \n     consultants that are working to help the Afghan people, has \n     not been accepted by a broad spectrum of the Afghanistan \n     population; and\n       Whereas, this lack of acceptance places all foreign \n     military and civilian consultant personnel in grave danger, \n     which results in an inability for those personnel to properly \n     conduct the types of operations in which they are engaged; \n     and\n       Whereas, there is already in place a plan to withdraw most \n     forces from Afghanistan in the 2014 time frame; therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     Seventh General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we \n     urge the President and Congress to begin an expedited \n     withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan, to the fullest extent \n     possible consistent with strategic military objectives, thus \n     accelerating the current withdrawal plan set in place; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be sent \n     to the President, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the President pro tempore of the United \n     States Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-131.

A bill to implement the provisions of the Hague Agreement \nand the Patent Law Treaty; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today legislation \nthat will help American businesses and inventors by reducing obstacles \nfor obtaining patent protection overseas. This bipartisan measure \nimplements two patent law treaties that were signed under President \nClinton and submitted for the Senate's advice and consent by President \nGeorge W. Bush. The Senate voted to ratify the treaties in 2007 without \na single Senator in dissent. With this implementing legislation, \nCongress will complete its work so that the treaties at last can be \nratified and go into effect.\n  Our patent system plays a key role in encouraging innovation and \nbringing new products to market. The discoveries made by American \ninventors and research institutions, commercialized by our companies, \nand protected and promoted by our patent laws, have made our system the \nenvy of the world. But in this global economy, it is not enough to have \nan effective domestic patent system; we must also help American \ninventors and businesses to protect their inventions and thrive in \nmarkets around the world. Consistent with last year's landmark patent \nreform legislation, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, this \nlegislation will benefit American inventors by implementing two \nmeasures to reduce application barriers around the world.\n  The Hague Agreement Concerning International Registration of \nIndustrial Designs provides a simplified application system for U.S. \ncreators of industrial designs who, by filing a single standardized \napplication for a design patent at the U.S. Patent and Trademark \nOffice, can apply for design protection in each country that has \nratified the Treaty. American design patent applicants who previously \nhad to file separate applications in numerous countries may now file a \nsingle, English-language application at the U.S. Patent Office, \nreducing the costs and burdens of obtaining international protections. \nThe U.S. Patent Office may also receive applications that have been \nfiled internationally, but its substantive examination process remains \nunchanged. The standard for obtaining a design patent is not affected. \nBy simplifying the process for American businesses to obtain design \npatents overseas, the Hague Agreement will reduce barriers for small \nand mid-size companies to expand into foreign markets.\n  The Patent Law Treaty also streamlines the process for American \nbusinesses seeking patent protection overseas. It limits the \nformalities different countries can require in patent applications, \nwhich are often used to disadvantage American applications in foreign \njurisdictions. American businesses and inventors will benefit from \nharmonized applications, reducing the cost of doing business and \nencouraging U.S. innovators to protect and export their products \ninternationally.\n  In June, Director Kappos of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office \ntestified before the Judiciary Committee about the important need for \nthis implementing legislation, stating that the treaties are ``pro-\nAmerican innovation, pro-global innovation, pro-jobs, pro-\nopportunity.'' I agree. I urge the Senate to act quickly on this final \nstep so that the treaties can at last be ratified, and American \ninnovators and businesses can benefit from them as U.S. products \ncontinue to thrive on the global stage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3486\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect first amendment rights of journalists and \ninternet service providers by preventing States and the United States \nfrom allowing meritless lawsuits arising from acts in furtherance of \nthose rights, commonly called ``Strategic Lawsuits Against Public \nParticipation'' or ``SLAPPs'', and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Free Press Act. \nThe FPA would create a Federal anti-SLAPP statute for journalists, \nbloggers, and other news media, authorizing them to bring a special \nmotion to dismiss lawsuits brought against them that arise out of their \nspeech on public issues. Once the special motion to dismiss is brought, \nthe nonmoving party must present a prima facie case supporting the \nlawsuit; if the nonmovant fails to do so, the lawsuit is dismissed and \nfees and costs are awarded to the movant.\n  Anti-SLAPP laws effectively make it impossible for frivolous or \nmarginal libel lawsuits arising out of protected speech to advance \nbeyond an initial stage of litigation. Such laws thereby protect \njournalists and bloggers from the financial impact of defending against \nsuch suits. Approximately 30 States have anti-SLAPP laws, though their \ncoverage varies. There is no federal law. The FPA would create a \nfederal anti-SLAPP law, and allow parties to remove some state SLAPP \nclaims to Federal court.\n  At the conclusion of my remarks today, I will submit for the record a \nsection-by-section summary of the FPA. I will first, however, comment \non several features of the bill, including the meaning of some of the \nlanguage that is used, and Congress' authority to enact such \nlegislation.\n  The FPA's special motion to dismiss requires the plaintiff to present \n``prima facie evidence'' supporting his cause of action. The standard \ndefinition of ``prima facie evidence,'' which is employed by the FPA, \nis that given by Justice Story in his opinion for the court in Kelly v. \nJackson, 31 U.S. 622, 632, 1832: ``What is prima facie evidence of a \nfact? It is such as, in judgment of law, is sufficient to establish a \nfact; and, if not rebutted, remains sufficient for that purpose.'' For \nsimilar statements, see Bailey v. Alabama, 219 S.Ct. 219, 234, 1911, \nquoting Kelly v. Jackson; and Neely v. United States, 150 F.2d 977, \n978, D.C. Cir. 1945, which notes ``Justice Story's often quoted \ndefinition of prima facie evidence.''\n  This definition is also employed by Black's Law Dictionary, which \ndefines ``prima facie evidence'' as:\n\n       Such evidence as, in the judgment of the law, is sufficient \n     to establish a given fact and which if not rebutted or \n     contradicted, will remain sufficient. [Prima facie evidence], \n     if unexplained or uncontradicted, is sufficient to sustain a \n     judgment in favor of the issue which it supports, but [it] \n     may be contradicted by other evidence.\n\n  In a recent concurring and dissenting opinion, Justice Scalia went so \nfar as to describe this definition of ``prima facie evidence'' as \n``canonical.'' He also stated:\n\n       The established meaning in Virginia, then, of the term \n     ``prima facie evidence'' appears to be perfectly orthodox: It \n     is evidence that suffices, on its own, to establish a \n     particular fact. But it is hornbook law that this is true \n     only to the extent that the evidence goes unrebutted. ``Prima \n     facie evidence of a fact is such evidence as, in judgment of \n     law, is sufficient to establish the fact; and, if not \n     rebutted, remains sufficient for the purpose.'' 7B Michie's \n     Jurisprudence of Virginia and West Virginia Sec.  32, 1998, \n     (emphasis added).\n\n  Virginia v. Black, 538 U.S. 343, 369-70, 2003, Scalia, J., concurring \nin part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part.\n  Other Federal courts continue to use this definition of ``prima facie \nevidence:''\n\n       ``A prima facie showing simply means evidence of such \n     nature as is sufficient to establish a fact and which, if \n     unrebutted, remains sufficient for that purpose.'' Cumulus \n     Media, Inc. v. Clear Channel Communications, Inc., 304 F.3d \n     1167, 1176 n.13, 11th Cir. 2002.\n\n[[Page S5984]]\n\n       ``Under [the prima facie evidence] standard, it is \n     plaintiff's burden to demonstrate the existence of every fact \n     required to satisfy both the forum's long-arm statute and the \n     Due Process Clause of the Constitution. The prima facie \n     showing must be based upon evidence of specific facts set \n     forth in the record. To meet this requirement, the plaintiff \n     must go beyond the pleadings and make affirmative proof. \n     However, in evaluating whether the prima facie standard has \n     been satisfied, the district court is not acting as a \n     factfinder; rather, it accepts properly supported proffers of \n     evidence by a plaintiff as true and makes its ruling as a \n     matter of law. When the district court employs the prima \n     facie standard appellate review is de novo.'' United States \n     v. Swiss American Bank, Ltd., 274 F.3d 610, 618-19, 1st Cir. \n     2001, citations and quotations omitted.\n       ``Prima facie evidence consists of specific factual \n     information which, in the absence of rebuttal, is sufficient \n     to show that a fairness doctrine violation exists. * * * * In \n     general terms, prima facie evidence is evidence which is \n     sufficient in law to sustain a finding in favor of a claim, \n     but which may be contradicted.'' American Security Council \n     Education Foundation v. F.C.C., 607 F.2d 438, 445-46 & n.24, \n     D.C. Cir. 1979.\n       ``A prima facie case is established by evidence adduced by \n     the plaintiff in support of his case up to the time such \n     evidence stands unexplained and uncontradicted. The words \n     `prima facie,' when used to describe evidence, ex vi termini \n     imply that such evidence may be rebutted by competent \n     testimony. The term prima facie evidence' implies evidence \n     which may be rebutted and overcome, and simply means that in \n     the absence of explanatory or contradictory evidence the \n     finding shall be in accordance with the proof establishing \n     the prima facie case.'' In re Chicago Rys. Co, 175 F.2d 282, \n     289-90, 7th Cir. 1949, citations and quotations omitted.\n       ``The term prima facie evidence means * * * * [e]vidence \n     good and sufficient on its face; such evidence as, in the \n     judgment of the law, is sufficient to establish a given fact, \n     or the group or chain of facts constituting the party's claim \n     or defense, and which if not rebutted or contradicted, will \n     remain sufficient. Prima facie evidence is evidence which, if \n     unexplained or uncontradicted, is sufficient to sustain a \n     judgment in favor of the issue which it supports, but which \n     may be contradicted by other evidence.''' Gibson v. Zant, 547 \n     F.Supp. 1270, 1276, M.D. Ga. 1982, quoting Black's Law \n     Dictionary, 5th Edition.\n       `Prima facie evidence' is evidence which, if unrebutted or \n     unexplained, is sufficient to establish the fact to which it \n     is related. It proves the fact until other proof contradicts \n     or overcomes the factual hypothesis initially set up by the \n     presumption.'' DAL Int'l Trading Co. v. The SS Milton J. \n     Foreman, 171 F.Supp. 794, 798, E.D.N.Y. 1959.\n\n  The FPA makes its special motion to dismiss available in cases \narising out of speech on matters of public concern. It bears emphasis \nthat ``matters of public concern'' include commentary on consumer \nproducts. As the Pennsylvania intermediate court of appeals recently \nnoted, in American Future Systems, Inc. v. Better Business Bureau of \nEastern Pennsylvania, 872 A.2d 1202, 1211, Pa. Super. 2005, a \n``statement regarding the effectiveness of a consumer product addresses \na matter of public concern.'' Similarly, the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Ninth Circuit, in Unelko Corp. v. Rooney, 912 F.2d 1049, 1056, 9th \nCir. 1990, concluded that ``statements about product effectiveness'' \naddress matters of public concern. And the Second Circuit, in Flamm v. \nAmerican Assoc. of University Women, 201 F.3d 144, 150, 2d Cir. 2000, \nhas held that a negative evaluation of an attorney's services, directed \nto potential customers, addresses a matter of public concern.\n  The following quotation from a New Jersey Supreme Court opinion, \nciting other courts' decisions, illustrates the breadth of support for \nthe proposition that commentary on products or services offered to \nconsumers is a matter of public concern. That court noted, in Dairy \nStores, Inc. v. Sentinel Publishing Co., Inc., 104 N.J. 125, 144-45, \n516 A.2d 220, 230, 1986, that:\n\n       Some courts have developed criteria for determining whether \n     the activities and products of corporations constitute \n     matters of public interest. As previously indicated, matters \n     of public interest include such essentials of life as food \n     and water. See Steaks Unlimited, Inc. v. Deaner, supra, 623 \n     F.2d 264; All Diet Foods Distribs., Inc. v. Time, Inc., \n     supra, 56 Misc.2d 821, 290 N.Y.S.2d 445; Exner v. American \n     Medical Ass'n, supra, 12 Wash.App. 215, 529 P.2d 863. \n     Widespread effects of a product are yet another indicator \n     that statements about the product are in the public interest. \n     Robinson v. American Broadcasting Cos., 441 F.2d 1396 (6th \n     Cir.1971) (possible causes of cancer are a matter of public \n     concern); Lewis v. Reader's Digest Ass'n, supra, 366 F.Supp. \n     at 156, article on an arthritis cure is in public interest \n     because significant portion of population is afflicted with \n     arthritis; American Broadcasting Cos., Inc. v. Smith Cabinet \n     Mfg. Co., Inc., 160 Ind.App. 367,----, 312 N.E.2d 85, 90, \n     1974, flammability of 25,000 baby cribs held to be matter of \n     public interest; Krebiozen Research Found. v. Beacon Press, \n     Inc., 334 Mass. 86,\n     ----, 134 N.E.2d 1, 6-9, cert. denied, 352 U.S. 848, 77 S.Ct. \n     65, 1 L.Ed.2d 58, 1956, possible cures for cancer are matter \n     of public concern. Still another criterion is substantial \n     government regulation of business activities and products.\n\n  The FPA thus protects speech consisting of consumer commentary that \nfocuses solely on the quality, reliability, or effectiveness of a \nconsumer product, regardless of whether such commentary addresses \nbroader social issues. The quality of goods and services offered to the \npublic is itself a matter of public concern. The FPA protects the \ndissemination of any information about a product that would be of \ninterest to potential consumers.\n  Finally, the FPA allows removal to Federal court to be sought by a \ndefendant. Although current law only allows removal when the Federal \nquestion appears on the face of a well-pleaded complaint, this rule is \nonly statutory. Congress is well within its power to allow removal of \ncases that raise a colorable Federal defense.\n  Two current Federal statutes clearly allow removal by defendants \nbased only on the assertion of a Federal defense. One is 28 U.S.C. \nSec.  1442(a), which allows Federal officers, among others, to remove a \nstate civil action or prosecution to federal court. The other is 9 \nU.S.C. Sec.  205, which allows removal of disputes that appear to be \ncovered by an international arbitration agreement.\n  Although such a limitation is not stated on the face of section 1442, \nthe Supreme Court has long held that ``federal officer removal must be \npredicated on the allegation of a colorable federal defense.'' Mesa v. \nCalifornia, 489 U.S. 121, 129, 1989. See also id. at 133-34, which \nnotes that ``an unbroken line of this Court's decisions extending back \nnearly a century and a quarter have understood all the various \nincarnations of the federal officer removal statute to require the \naverment of a federal defense.''\n  The most recent Supreme Court pronouncements confirm that `Article \nIII `arising under' jurisdiction is broader than federal question \njurisdiction under Sec.  1331,'' Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of \nNigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 495 (1983), and note that Article III federal-\nquestion jurisdiction ``has been construed as permitting Congress to \nextend federal jurisdiction to any case of which federal law \npotentially forms an ingredient,'' Franchise Tax Board v. Construction \nLaborers Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 8 n.8 (quoting Osborn v. Bank of \nthe United States, 9 What. 738, 823 (1824)).\n  In Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 348-49, 1816, the Supreme \nCourt also noted that\n\n       ``[t]he judicial power * * * * was not to be exercised \n     exclusively for the benefit of parties who might be \n     plaintiffs, and would elect the national forum, but also for \n     the protection of defendants who might be entitled to try \n     their rights, or assert their privileges, in the same \n     forum,'' and further noting that ``we are referred to the \n     power which it is admitted congress possess to remove suits \n     from state courts to the national courts.''\n\n  The Federal-defense-based removal authorized by the FPA is thus well \nwithin Congress's constitutional authority.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na section-by-section summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 3493\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A party may move to \n     quash a request to obtain the personally identifying \n     information of a person that is made in relation to a legal \n     claim arising out of speech on public issues. (E.g., a \n     company seeks discovery from an ISP of the identity of \n     persons posting unfavorable comments about the company's \n     goods or services on a blog.) If the motion to quash is \n     properly brought, the nonmovant must show that the legal \n     claim is supported by a prima facie showing of facts \n     sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment. If the nonmovant \n     fails to meet this burden, the request for personally \n     identifying information is quashed.\n       Section 4206. Removal. A state-court claim arising out of \n     speech on public issues may be removed to federal court by a \n     party that intends to file a special motion to dismiss the \n     claim. Removal may not be requested on the basis of a cross \n     claim or third-party claim. (This exception is made to \n     prevent defendants from removing cases in which the complaint \n     does not assert claims arising out of speech on public \n     issues.) A proceeding to enforce discovery requesting \n     personally identifying information may also be removed, but \n     removal is limited to the discovery-enforcement proceeding.\n       Section 4207. Fees, Costs, and Sanctions. A party that \n     prevails on a special motion to dismiss or quash shall be \n     entitled to reasonable attorneys fees and costs.

Mr. President, on May 13, 2011, the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services issued Change Request 7397 to stop compounding \npharmacies that prepare medications used in implanted infusion pumps \nfrom billing Medicare directly for these services. This was an attempt \nto reverse a policy that has been permissible in several States for \nover 20 years. Since then, I have worked with Senator Wicker and other \nMembers of Congress to delay the implementation of this change until \nits effects have been fully considered.\n  This policy change has been met with opposition from pharmacies, \nphysicians, and patients. In Mississippi, pharmacies are prohibited \nfrom selling infused pain medications to physicians, which would result \nin decreased access to effective treatments for chronic pain disorders. \nWhile this is a particular issue in my State, this policy change will \nhave serious implications across the Nation.\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has worked with us \nover the past year to delay this policy change and to propose a rule \nthat is now receiving comments. However, CMS officials have continued \nto demonstrate a lack of understanding about the potential consequences \nof changing payment policy. We should protect practices that have been \neffective in treating patients and support those who supply drugs \nnecessary for the well-being of patients. This bill would explicitly \nallow compounding pharmacies to bill Medicare directly for their \nservices in the interest of helping patients continue to receive the \nquality care they deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. McConnell):\n  S. 3510.

A bill to amend subtitle D of the Solid Waste Disposal Act \nto facilitate recovery and beneficial use, and provide for the proper \nmanagement and disposal, of materials generated by the combustion of \ncoal and other fossil fuels; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on \nanother matter, important energy legislation for our country. I am \ntoday introducing the Hoeven-Conrad-Baucus Coal Ash Recycling and \nOversight Act of 2012.\n  In my home State of North Dakota there is a large powerplant just \nnorth of the State capital in Bismarck. It is a coal creek power \nstation. Now this power station generates 1,100 megawatts of \nelectricity every year. There are two 550 megawatt plants. It has the \nlatest, greatest technology emission control and clean coal technology. \nThey capture the steam that was formally exhausted from the plant. They \ncapture that steam and use it to run an ethanol plant. They produce \ntransportation fuel with steam, a by-product of the electric generation \nprocess.\n  One of the other things they do, instead of land filling the coal \nash, fly ash, or coal residuals, they recycle. So, in essence, they \ntake that coal ash--they work with a natural resource company, \nHeadwaters, based out of Utah, and they turn the coal ash into a \nconcrete product, FlexCrete. It is used to make roads, bridges, \nbuildings, and also products like shingles. They make building \nmaterials.\n  So whereas they used to take about 600,000 tons a year of coal \nresiduals and coal ash flash and landfill it, and it costs $6 a ton or \nso to landfill it, now they take that 600,000 tons a year of fly ash \nand residuals and turn it into building products.\n  The difference instead of paying to dispose of something and now \nbeing paid to recycle something is about a $16 million a year revenue \nitem for that plant. That means lower cost for electricity for \nbusinesses in States such as the great State of North Dakota and the \ngreat State of Minnesota and other States as well. It truly benefits \nour consumers, our families, and our economy. It benefits small \nbusinesses throughout the upper Midwest. So it is truly a great example \nof American ingenuity and innovation.\n\n[[Page S5987]]\n\n  In fact, I have a picture right here. This is the North Dakota \nHeritage Center. Right now there is a $50 million expansion being \nconstructed in that Heritage Center which is located on the capital \ngrounds in Bismarck. It is a $50 million expansion. They are using \nbuilding materials made of coal ash for this facility. That is what it \nis going to look like after they do this $50 million expansion.\n  Let me give another example. This is the National Energy Center of \nExcellence at Bismarck State College. It is a 2-year college that \ntrains people for the energy industry. It is located right above the \nMissouri River. This beautiful window overlooks the Missouri River. \nAgain this is a building constructed with building materials made of \nfly ash. We can see how this product is being used and how effectively \nthis is being used.\n  As a matter of fact, if we look nationwide, by recycling coal ash we \nreduce energy consumption by 162 trillion Btus every year. That is the \namount of energy we would use to 1.7 million homes in a year. It is \npretty substantial energy savings. Or measure it in terms of water use. \nBy recycling coal ash, we reduce water usage by 32 billion gallons \nannually. That is about one-third of the total amount of water that the \nState of California uses in a year.\n  Why do I tell the story? Because right now the EPA is looking at \nchanging the regulation of coal ash. They are looking at changing the \nregulation of coal ash to doing it under subtitle C of the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act. The problem is that is the hazardous \nwaste section. Right now coal ash is regulated under subtitle D of the \nResource Conservation and Recovery Act, which is the nonhazardous waste \nsection. The EPA is looking at making that change in spite of the fact \nthat the Department of Energy, the Federal Highway Administration, \nState regulatory agencies, and the EPA itself have done studies, and \nthose studies have shown that is not a toxic waste.\n  The EPA first proposed this new regulation in June of 2010. This \nregulation would truly undermine the industry, drive up costs, and \neliminate jobs when our economy can least afford it. In fact, according \nto industry estimates, it would increase electricity costs by up to \nalmost $50 billion annually and eliminate 300,000 American jobs.\n  Let me elaborate. Meeting the regulatory disposal requirements under \nthe EPA's subtitle C proposal would cost between $250 and $450 per ton \nas opposed to about $100 per ton under the current system. That would \ntranslate into $47 billion in terms of burden on electricity generators \nthat use coal and, of course, most importantly, their customers who \nwould see their bills increased. As I said, overall it would cost about \n300,000 American jobs for our economy.\n  That is why I am introducing the Hoeven-Conrad-Baucus Recycling and \nOversight Act, which is S. 3512, and it has very strong bipartisan \nsupport. It is truly a bipartisan bill, including 12 Republican \nsponsors and 12 Democratic sponsors. The Republican sponsors include \nmyself, Senator McConnell, Senator Portman, Senator Boozman, Senator \nBlunt, Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Moran, Senator Alexander, Senator \nToomey, Senator Graham, Senator Thune, and Senator Hatch. The \nDemocratic cosponsors include Senator Conrad, Senator Baucus, Senator \nKohl, Senator Landrieu, Senator Manchin, Senator Warner, Senator Pryor, \nSenator McCaskill, Senator Ben Nelson, Senator Bill Nelson, Senator \nCasey, and Senator Webb. I wish to thank them for their willingness to \njoin together in a bipartisan way--12 Republicans, 12 Democrats--coming \ntogether to provide the kind of energy legislation that is going to \ntruly help move this country forward, empowering not only more energy \ndevelopment but better environmental stewardship.\n\n  This legislation is similar to H.R. 2273, which was sponsored by \nRepresentative David McKinley of West Virginia in the House, and it \npassed the House with strong bipartisan support. This legislation is \nvery similar. We have made some enhancements, but it is very similar.\n  The bill not only preserves coal ash recycling by preventing these \nby-products from being treated as hazardous, it also establishes--and \nthis is important because it is also about good environmental \nstewardship--it also establishes comprehensive Federal standards for \ncoal ash disposal. Under this legislation, States can set up their own \npermitting program for the management and the disposal of coal ash. \nThese programs would be required to be based on existing EPA \nregulations that protect human health and the environment. If a State \ndoes not implement an acceptable permitting program, then EPA regulates \nthe program for the State. As a result, States and industry will know \nwhere they stand under the bill, since the benchmarks for what \nconstitutes a successful State program will be set in statute. EPA can \nsay yes, the State does meet those standards, or no, it does not, but \nthe EPA cannot move the goalposts.\n  This is a States-first approach that provides regulatory certainty. \nLet me repeat that. This is a States-first approach that provides \nregulatory certainty, and it is that regulatory certainty we need to \nstimulate private investment that will deploy the new technologies that \nwill not only produce more energy but will produce better environmental \nstewardship.\n  What is certain is that under this bill, coal ash disposal sites will \nbe required to meet established standards. Those established standards \ninclude groundwater detection and monitoring, liners, corrective action \nwhen environmental damage occurs, structural stability criteria, and \nthe financial assurance and recordkeeping needed to protect the public.\n  This legislation is needed to protect jobs and help reduce the cost \nof homes and roads as well as to help reduce electric bills.\n  I wish to thank both Republicans and Democrats who have taken a \nleadership role in this effort as original sponsors of the legislation. \nI especially wish to express thanks to my fellow Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Conrad, as well as Senator Baucus of Montana and their \nstaffs for the hard work that has gone into this legislation. I urge \nour colleagues to join us in this important energy legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 3513. A bill to promote the development of local strategies to \ncoordinate use of assistance under sections 8 and 9 of the United \nStates Housing Act of 1937 with public and private resources, to enable \neligible families to achieve economic independence and self-\nsufficiency, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Family Self-\nSufficiency Act.\n  The Family Self Sufficiency, FSS, program is an existing employment \nand savings incentive initiative for families that have section 8 \nvouchers or live in public housing. The FSS program provides two key \ntools for its participants: first, it provides access to the resources \nand training that help participants pursue employment opportunities and \nmeet financial goals, and second, it encourages FSS families to save by \nestablishing an interest-bearing escrow account for them. Upon \ngraduation from the FSS program, the family can use these savings to \npay for job-related expenses, such as the purchase or maintenance of a \ncar or for additional workforce training.\n  My legislation seeks to enhance the FSS program by streamlining the \nadministration of this program, by broadening the supportive services \nthat can be provided to a participant, and by extending the FSS program \nto tenants who live in privately-owned properties with project-based \nassistance.\n  First, to streamline the FSS program, my bill would combine the two \nseparate FSS programs into one. Currently, HUD operates one FSS program \nfor those families being served by the Housing Choice Voucher Program \nand another for those families being served by the Public Housing \nprogram, even though the core purpose of each FSS program, to increase \neconomic independence and self-sufficiency, is the same for both. As a \nresult, Public Housing Agencies, PHAs, have to operate essentially two \nprograms to achieve the same goal. With my bill, PHAs would be relieved \nof this unnecessary burden.\n  Second, my legislation broadens the scope of the supportive services \nthat may be offered to include attainment\n\n[[Page S5988]]\n\nof a GED, education in pursuit of a post-secondary degree or \ncertification, and training in financial literacy. Providing families \nin need with affordable rental housing is critical, but coupling it \nwith the support and services to help families get ahead is more \neffective. This legislation makes it easier for FSS participants to \nobtain the training necessary to secure employment and the education to \nmake prudent financial decisions to better safeguard their earnings.\n  Lastly, this bill opens up the FSS program to families who live in \nprivately-owned properties subsidized with project-based rental \nassistance. It shouldn't matter what kind of housing assistance a \nfamily gets, and families seeking to achieve self-sufficiency shouldn't \nbe held back by this sort of technicality.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, which will help give those \nreceiving housing assistance a better chance to build their skills and \nachieve economic independence.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 3516. A bill to encourage spectrum licenses to make unused \nspectrum available for use by rural and smaller carriers in order to \nexpand wireless coverage; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp expand wireless broadband to rural areas. Specifically, the Rural \nSpectrum Accessibility Act would direct the Federal Communications \nCommission, FCC, establish a program that would provide an incentive, a \nthree year extension to a spectrum license, to wireless carriers that \nmake available, through partitioning and disaggregation, unused \nspectrum to smaller carriers or carriers serving rural areas.\n  As the FCC National Broadband Plan reports ``most areas without \nmobile broadband coverage are in rural or remote areas.'' This \nlegislation would provide an additional incentive to increase wireless \nbroadband to these areas and make more spectrum available to smaller \nand rural wireless carriers through secondary market mechanisms.\n  This bill is loosely based on a wireless carrier's existing program, \nwhich creates a partnership with rural carriers to build and operate \nLong Term Evolution, LTE, wireless networks in rural areas. Through the \ncooperation the carrier provides spectrum and core network equipment \nand the rural carrier supplies the cell towers and backhaul.\n  The Rural Spectrum Accessibility Act is an effort to get other large \ncarriers to implement similar initiatives to create more opportunities \nfor the smaller and rural carriers. It should be noted the FCC actually \nalready has partitioning and disaggregation rules, see 47 C.F.R. \n22.948, this legislative proposal just provides a simple but attractive \nincentive for carriers to utilize them.\n  The main goal of this legislation is to provide another catalyst to \nexpand next generation, 4G, Wireless broadband service to rural areas, \nwhich will mean more reliable service, more innovation, and more choice \nto rural consumers and businesses.\n  The increasing importance of wireless communications and broadband \nhas a direct correlation to our Nation's competitiveness, economy, and \nnational security. We must reform existing spectrum policy and \nmanagement to ensure that all Americans continue to realize the \nboundless benefits of wireless broadband. Congress has taken some steps \nbut more can and must be done. That is why I sincerely hope that my \ncolleagues join me in supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 3518. A bill to make it a principal negotiating objective of the \nUnited States in trade negotiations to eliminate government fisheries \nsubsidies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fair Trade in \nSeafood Act.\n  Right now, our country is proud to be a world leader in the fishing \nand seafood processing industries. We rank among the world's top five \nexporters of seafood, and its largest importer. However, the U.S. \nseafood industry faces many challenges on the global stage from unfair \ncompetition. The Congress should be doing everything it can to make \nsure we retain our status as global leader. That is why I am \nintroducing the Fair Trade in Seafood Act. This bill will establish \nthis issue as a Principal Negotiating Objective of the United States in \nthe ongoing Trans-Pacific Partnership and World Trade Organization \ntalks.\n  Why is this bill important? According to the United Nations Food and \nAgricultural Organization, 85 percent of the world's fisheries are \nfully exploited, overexploited, depleted, or recovering from \ndepletion--the highest percentage since the Food and Agricultural \nOrganization began keeping records.\n  Many governments continue to provide significant subsidies that push \ntheir fleets to fish longer, more intensively, and farther away than \notherwise would be possible. These destructive fisheries subsidies are \nestimated to be at least $16 billion annually, an amount equivalent to \napproximately 20 percent of the value of the world catch. The \ndetrimental effects of these illegal subsidies are so significant that \neliminating them is the single greatest action that can be taken to \nprotect the world's oceans.\n  In contrast to these nefarious actors, the U.S. does not just talk \nabout the importance of sustainable fishing practices and marine \nconservation. We are practicing what we preach. That means enforcing \nregulations and changing old, counterproductive, destructive habits. \nOur seafood industry is stronger because of it. At the same time, our \nmarket is open. In my view, this is the way every country ought to run \nits seafood industry. Our foreign trading partners, as I mentioned, \noften support practices that can cause long-term harm to marine \nhabitat. In addition, our trading partners put up trade barriers that \nprevent sustainably caught U.S. seafood from reaching foreign \nconsumers. These are practices that skew the playing field in a \ncompetitive marketplace. They skew the playing field against American \nfishers and give foreign competitors a huge advantage in an industry \nthat depends on global trade. Forty percent of global fishery products \nare traded internationally, and seafood is more globally sourced than \ncoffee, rice, and tea combined.\n  These harmful foreign trade barriers and practices that encourage \noverfishing are top priorities that need to be addressed. These foreign \ntrade barriers harm our country's ability to create good-paying jobs. \nPreserving the wealth of the world's marine environment is of paramount \nimportance. The U.S. seafood industry represents a major portion of our \neconomy, employing over 1.5 million workers in the commercial sector \nalone. The commercial seafood industry has a significant presence in \nover 23 States and is an industry and, in fact, a way of life, a way of \nlife that binds communities and stitches together the regions of our \ncountry. The seafood sector employs more people than the mining or oil \nindustries.\n  It is also a foundation of our economy because, without fish, there \nare no jobs. Preserving the wealth of our oceans and rivers is an \neconomic imperative as much as a moral one. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor the Fair Trade in Seafood Act.\n  In short, this Act will codify an official trade negotiating \nobjective of the United States with respect to government fisheries \nsubsidies. More specifically, the negotiating objective will be to \neliminate fisheries subsidies provided by governments that unfairly \ndestroy markets to the detriment of the United States commercial \nfishing interests and that perpetuate unsustainable fishing practices. \nThe bill aims to ensure that any commitments with respect to such \nsubsidies are enforceable under appropriate trade laws. This \nnegotiating objective will apply to any trade agreement that includes \nany negotiations relating to the elimination or reduction of government \nfisheries subsidies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3518\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Trade in Seafood Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of \n     the United Nations, 85 percent of the world's fisheries are \n     overexploited, fully exploited, significantly depleted, or \n     recovering from overexploitation, the highest percentage ever \n     on record.\n       (2) A primary reason for the global fisheries crisis is \n     government subsidies that create perverse incentives for \n     continued fishing in the face of declining catches.\n       (3) Despite the dire conditions of the world's marine \n     resources, some of the countries that engage in the most \n     fishing continue to provide significant subsidies to their \n     fishing fleets.\n       (4) Fisheries subsidies are estimated to be approximately \n     20 percent of the value of the world catch and have helped \n     create a global fishing fleet that is up to 250 percent \n     larger than that needed to fish sustainably.\n       (5) Many long-range foreign fleets are supported by \n     government subsidies for fuel, other operational expenses, \n     and vessel construction that allow their fleets to fish \n     longer, at greater distances, and more intensively than is \n     commercially or environmentally warranted. Those fleets would \n     not be viable without the support of government subsidies.\n       (6) Many developing countries are particularly affected by \n     fisheries subsidies provided by other governments because the \n     developing countries are unable to compete against subsidized \n     industrial fleets.\n       (7) Fisheries subsidies offered by the governments of other \n     countries give the fleets of those countries an unfair \n     advantage over United States fishermen by reducing the costs \n     of operations and increasing the number, size, and power of \n     vessels competing for fish. Foreign fisheries subsidies also \n     undermine opportunities for United States fishermen in \n     potential export markets.\n       (8) Without committed global leadership to reduce \n     ``overfishing subsidies'', there is a significant risk that \n     the oceans will become too depleted to fish, resulting in a \n     catastrophic blow to the world economy and environment.\n       (9) As one of the world's largest importers of seafood and \n     one of the top five exporters of seafood, the United States \n     has a particular responsibility to lead trade negotiations to \n     address fisheries subsidies and make the establishment of \n     strong new rules on fisheries subsidies a core priority in \n     United States trade negotiations.\n       (10) Paragraphs 28 and 31 of the Ministerial Declaration of \n     the World Trade Organization adopted at Doha November 14, \n     2001, which launched the Doha Development Agenda, called for \n     negotiations to clarify and improve disciplines on trade-\n     distorting government fisheries subsidies.\n       (11) Paragraphs 9 through 11 of Annex D of the Ministerial \n     Declaration of the World Trade Organization adopted at Hong \n     Kong December 18, 2005, reinforced the Doha fisheries \n     subsidies mandate, noting that ``there is broad agreement \n     that the Group should strengthen disciplines on subsidies in \n     the fisheries sector, including through the prohibition of \n     certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to \n     overcapacity and over-fishing'' and calling on ``Participants \n     promptly to undertake further detailed work to, inter alia, \n     establish the nature and extent of those disciplines, \n     including transparency and enforceability''.\n       (12) The negotiations on fisheries subsidies in the World \n     Trade Organization and negotiations for the Trans-Pacific \n     Partnership Agreement are two of the most important, and \n     promising, international efforts to stop global overfishing \n     and represent meaningful efforts to directly address a key \n     environmental issue that directly impacts international \n     trade.\n       (13) On November 12, 2011, the leaders of the 9 countries \n     in negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement--\n     Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, \n     Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, and the United States--announced \n     the achievement of the broad outlines of an ambitious, 21st-\n     century agreement. According to a statement released by those \n     leaders, the agreed outline calls for ``[a] meaningful \n     outcome on environment [that] will ensure that the agreement \n     appropriately addresses important trade and environment \n     challenges and enhances the mutual supportiveness of trade \n     and environment. The TPP countries share the view that the \n     environment text should include effective provisions on \n     trade-related issues that would help to reinforce \n     environmental protection and are discussing an effective \n     institutional arrangement to oversee implementation and a \n     specific cooperation framework for addressing capacity \n     building needs.''. Various proposals, including a proposal by \n     the United States, to bring disciplines to government-\n     subsidized fishing are under active discussion as part of the \n     negotiations on the environment chapter of the Trans-Pacific \n     Partnership Agreement.\n       (14) The United States continues to make achievement of an \n     agreement on disciplines on government fisheries subsidies a \n     priority in negotiations in the World Trade Organization and \n     for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. On December 16, \n     2011, at the Eighth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade \n     Organization in Geneva, the United States Trade \n     Representative issued a statement urging ``continued work \n     toward an ambitious outcome on fisheries subsidies under the \n     WTO''. Noting the acute impact of declining catches on \n     developing countries, the Trade Representative further \n     stated, ``We stand ready to explore new negotiating \n     approaches that can move us towards the elimination of \n     harmful subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and \n     overfishing. . . . WTO Members have a duty to address one of \n     the root causes of overfishing and overcapacity--the \n     fisheries subsidies that encourage fishing enterprises to \n     fish longer, harder, and farther than would otherwise be \n     sustainable without subsidy aid. . . . The United States is \n     ready to continue this work in the WTO and in other \n     appropriate fora--including free trade agreements such as the \n     Trans-Pacific Partnership and other bilateral, regional and \n     multilateral initiatives.''.\n       (15) A strong fisheries subsidies agreement by the World \n     Trade Organization and in the Trans-Pacific Partnership \n     Agreement would set an historic precedent by showing that \n     international trade can directly benefit the environment \n     while promoting exports and open markets.\n\n     SEC. 3. TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES OF THE UNITED STATES \n                   WITH RESPECT TO GOVERNMENT FISHERIES SUBSIDIES.\n\n       It shall be a principal negotiating objective of the United \n     States in negotiations for a trade agreement--\n       (1) to eliminate fisheries subsidies provided by \n     governments that unfairly distort markets to the detriment of \n     United States commercial fishing interests and that \n     perpetuate unsustainable fishing practices; and\n       (2) to ensure that any commitments with respect to such \n     subsidies are enforceable under appropriate trade laws.\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act takes effect on the date of the enactment of this \n     Act and applies with respect to negotiations for a trade \n     agreement that--\n       (1) include any negotiations relating to the elimination or \n     reduction of government fisheries subsidies; and\n       (2) are entered into--\n       (A) on or after such date of enactment; or\n       (B) before such date of enactment if the negotiations \n     continue on or after such date of enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5989-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5989-S5990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 541--CONDEMNING THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM FOR HUMAN \n                           RIGHTS VIOLATIONS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Boozman, and Mr. Durbin) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 541\n\n       Whereas Vietnam is an authoritarian state ruled by the \n     Communist Party of Vietnam, which continues to deny the right \n     of the people of Vietnam to participate in free and fair \n     elections;\n       Whereas, according to the 2012 annual report of the United \n     States Commission on International Religious Freedom, \n     ``Vietnam's overall human rights record remains poor, and has \n     deteriorated since Vietnam was removed from the CPC \n     [countries of particular concern] list and joined the World \n     Trade Organization in 2007.'';\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State's most recent \n     Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, published on May \n     24, 2012 (in this resolution, the ``DOS Human Rights \n     Report''), the most significant human rights issues in \n     Vietnam ``were severe government restrictions on citizens' \n     political rights, particularly their right to change their \n     government; increased measures to limit citizens' civil \n     liberties; and corruption in the judicial system and \n     police'';\n       Whereas, according to the DOS Human Rights Report, the \n     Government of Vietnam ``reportedly held more than 100 \n     political detainees at year's end, although some \n     international observers claimed there were more. . . \n     Diplomatic sources reported the existence of four reeducation \n     centers in the country holding approximately 4,000 \n     prisoners'';\n       Whereas, according to the DOS Human Rights Report, \n     Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security ``maintains a system of \n     household registration and block wardens to monitor the \n     population,'' while ``credible reports suggested that local \n     police used `contract thugs' and `citizen brigades' to harass \n     and beat political activists and others, including religious \n     worshippers, perceived as undesirable or a threat to public \n     security'';\n       Whereas, on April 8, 2006, the pro-democracy movement Bloc \n     8406 was founded in Vietnam, and it has since attracted \n     thousands of supporters calling for respect for basic human \n     rights, the establishment of a multiparty political system, \n     and guarantees of freedom of religion and political \n     association;\n       Whereas, according to the DOS Human Rights Report, the \n     Government of Vietnam ``continued to restrict public debate \n     and criticism severely. No public challenge to the legitimacy \n     of the one-party state was permitted,'' and ``the government \n     continued to crack down on the small, opposition political \n     groups established in 2006, and group members faced arrests \n     and arbitrary detentions'';\n\n[[Page S5990]]\n\n       Whereas, according to the DOS Human Rights Report, \n     ``[t]here continued to be credible reports that authorities \n     pressured defense lawyers not to take as clients any \n     religious or democracy activists facing trial. Human rights \n     lawyers were restricted, harassed, arrested, disbarred, and \n     in some cases detained for representing political \n     activists,'' while ``given their previous convictions, \n     lawyers Le Tran Luat, Le Thi Cong Nhan, and Le Quoc Quan were \n     not permitted to practice law'';\n       Whereas, on April 4, 2011, the Hanoi People's Court \n     sentenced attorney Cu Huy Ha Vu to seven years in prison for \n     defending victims of land confiscation and abuse of power, \n     including the Catholic villagers of Con Dau who refused to \n     sell or vacate land, including a 135-year-old religious \n     burial site, and in August and November 2011, Vu's appeals \n     were unsuccessful;\n       Whereas, although the constitution of Vietnam provides for \n     freedom of religion, Vietnamese law requires official \n     recognition or registration for religious groups, which has \n     been used to monitor and restrict the operations of religious \n     organizations;\n       Whereas the 2012 Annual Report of the United States \n     Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) lists \n     Vietnam as one of the ``world's worst religious freedom \n     violators,'' recommending that the Secretary of State name \n     Vietnam a ``country of particular concern'' with respect to \n     religious freedom, noting that ``the Government of Vietnam \n     continues to control all religious communities, restrict and \n     penalize independent religious practice severely, and repress \n     individuals and groups viewed as challenging its authority'' \n     and that ``individuals continue to be imprisoned or detained \n     for reasons relating to their religious activity or religious \n     freedom advocacy'' while ``independent religious activity \n     remains illegal'';\n       Whereas, according to the USCIRF report, between April 2011 \n     and February 2012, ``as many as 27 individuals were arrested \n     or disappeared in Vietnam for their religious affiliations, \n     religious activities, or peaceful protest of religious \n     freedom restrictions, among them Hoa Hao Buddhists, \n     Catholics, Protestants, and Falun Gong practitioners'';\n       Whereas hundreds of Montagnard Protestants arrested after \n     2001 and 2004 demonstrations for religious freedom and land \n     rights remain in detention in Vietnam's Central Highlands, \n     while, according to Human Rights Watch, in 2010, as many as \n     70 additional people were detained in the Central Highlands \n     for conducting ``illegal'' religious services;\n       Whereas the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam is the \n     country's largest religious organization, yet according to \n     the USCIRF, it ``has faced decades of harassment and \n     repression for seeking independent status and for appealing \n     to the government to respect religious freedom and related \n     human rights'';\n       Whereas, in July 2011, Father Nguyen Van Ly, who has been \n     imprisoned numerous times for his religious freedom and human \n     rights advocacy, but had been granted medical parole in March \n     2010 after suffering several strokes in prison that left him \n     partially paralyzed, was returned to prison to serve the \n     remainder of his eight-year sentence;\n       Whereas on January 6, 2011, Christian Marchant, a United \n     States diplomat at the United States Embassy in Hanoi, was \n     beaten by Vietnamese police when he went to visit Father Ly, \n     who was then under house arrest;\n       Whereas, according to the USCIRF report, over a dozen \n     religious leaders are being held under long-term house arrest \n     orders, including Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV) \n     leader Thich Quang Do and other UBCV leaders, Catholic Father \n     Phan Van Loi, Hoa Hao leader Le Quang Liem, Protestants \n     Nguyen Van Dai and Le Thi Cong Nhan, and Mennonite Leader \n     Nguyen Thi Hong;\n       Whereas Reporters Without Borders' 2011-2012 Press Freedom \n     Index ranks Vietnam last in Southeast Asia with regard to \n     freedom of the press, and 172 out of 179 countries overall;\n       Whereas, in September 2007, Vietnamese bloggers established \n     the Club of Free Journalists to promote freedom of expression \n     and independent journalism and were quickly faced with \n     harassment, intimidation, and detention by authorities in \n     Vietnam, beginning with the arrest of Nguyen Van Hai in April \n     2008;\n       Whereas, on October 30, 2010, while in Hanoi, Vietnam, \n     Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, ``[T]he United \n     States remains concerned about the arrest and conviction of \n     people for peaceful dissent, the attacks on religious groups, \n     the curbs on Internet freedom, including of bloggers.

Res. 542\n\n       Whereas, for many years, Taiwan has been a strong and \n     cooperative partner of the United States;\n       Whereas the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3301 et \n     seq.), the cornerstone of United States-Taiwan relations, \n     declares that ``the preservation and enhancement of the human \n     rights of all the people of Taiwan are hereby reaffirmed as \n     objectives of the United States'';\n       Whereas, since the lifting of martial law in 1987, the \n     people of Taiwan have amply demonstrated their desire for \n     democratic governance, as well as their commitment to human \n     rights, civil liberties, and the rule of law;\n       Whereas, since their first democratic presidential election \n     in 1996, the people of Taiwan have conducted four more \n     presidential elections, as well as successive elections for \n     members of their national legislature, numerous local \n     elections, and two national referendums;\n       Whereas Taiwan conducted its latest presidential and \n     legislative elections on January 14, 2012;\n       Whereas, on January 14, 2012, Mr. Ma Ying-jeou, the \n     incumbent and the nominee of the Chinese Nationalist Party \n     (KMT), was re-elected as the President of Taiwan with 51.6 \n     percent of the vote, while in the 113-member legislature the \n     KMT won 64 seats, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) won \n     40 seats, and the People's First Party (PFP), the Taiwan \n     Solidarity Union (TSU), and other non-partisan independent \n     candidates each won 3 seats;\n       Whereas an international election observation mission made \n     up of 19 observers from 8 countries, invited by the \n     International Committee for Fair Elections in Taiwan (ICFET), \n     observed the January 14, 2012, elections in Taiwan;\n       Whereas the final report of the mission, made up of \n     observers from Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Japan, \n     Sweden, the Netherlands, and the United States, was recently \n     presented in Taiwan;\n       Whereas the final report of the mission included--\n       (1) a finding that the elections were mostly free but only \n     partly fair;\n       (2) a finding that the date selected for the election made \n     it more convenient for Taiwan businessmen in China to return \n     for the vote, but made it more difficult for students to \n     return to their home towns to vote, and a recommendation that \n     the household registration system should be changed to allow \n     people to vote where they actually work or study in Taiwan, \n     ending the need to travel long distances to vote;\n       (3) a finding that vote buying and vote betting remains an \n     issue of concern, and recommendations that stiffer penalties \n     be put in place for candidates who buy votes, such as \n     disqualification from running in future\n\n[[Page S5991]]\n\n     elections, and that the political parties do more to prevent \n     individual candidates from engaging in vote buying;\n       (4) a finding that major violations of principles of \n     administrative neutrality during the elections by government \n     officials occurred, and a recommendation that civil service \n     and non-elected offices need to be further de-politicized;\n       (5) a finding that verified data does not exist on campaign \n     financial resources and expenditures and it seemed likely \n     that campaign spending exceeded campaign finance limits, and \n     recommendations that enforcement and public promotion of \n     campaign spending laws be strengthened and loopholes closed \n     and that the longstanding issue of KMT party assets, \n     including their source, use, and investments be resolved;\n       (6) a finding that the Government of the People's Republic \n     of China attempted to influence the elections by sending \n     agricultural purchasing missions to southern Taiwan as a sign \n     of support for the sitting President, reducing the number of \n     tourist groups allowed to travel to Taiwan to signal the \n     ability to reduce tourism if the ``wrong candidate'' won, and \n     by discounting flights from China to Taiwan to make it easier \n     for Taiwanese businessmen living in China to return to Taiwan \n     to vote;\n       (7) a finding that actions and statements by the United \n     States Government and its officials might have influenced the \n     elections, noting that in the three months preceding the \n     election, there were more visits by high-level United States \n     officials to Taipei than during any calendar year in recent \n     history; less than one month before the elections, the \n     Department of State announced Taiwan's candidacy for \n     participation in the visa waiver program; and a senior United \n     States official stated anonymously through the Financial \n     Times that the DPP's presidential candidate Tsai ``left us \n     with distinct doubts about whether she is both willing and \n     able to continue the stability in cross-Strait relations the \n     region has enjoyed in recent years''; and\n       (8) a finding that media outlets gave preferential \n     treatment to a particular party or candidate based on the \n     outlet's political affiliation;\n       Whereas Taiwan's native-grown democratic experience serves \n     as a model for countries in the region and around the world \n     aspiring to establish democratic rule;\n       Whereas Taiwan's free and open society plays a stabilizing \n     role in the Asia Pacific region and is thus conducive to the \n     interests of states of the region, including the United \n     States, in furthering peace, prosperity and stability; and\n       Whereas the United States remains committed to the \n     continued strengthening and development of democratic \n     institutions in Taiwan, and to ensuring the ability of the \n     people of Taiwan to determine their own future free from \n     outside interference or coercion: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) applauds the progress made by the people of Taiwan \n     toward the consolidation of democracy over the past two \n     decades, and commends their enduring commitment to the values \n     of democracy, rule of law, and the protection of human \n     rights;\n       (2) encourages the people and the Government of Taiwan to \n     take steps to continue to strengthen the protection of \n     democratic values and human rights in their country, \n     including freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom \n     of the press;\n       (3) encourages the people and the Government of Taiwan to \n     take into consideration the conclusions and recommendations \n     of international election monitoring missions, including the \n     final International Election Observation Mission (IEOM) \n     report, as they seek to strengthen their democratic practices \n     and human rights protections;\n       (4) urges the President and Government of the United States \n     to continue to support democracy and human rights in Taiwan;\n       (5) encourages all outside parties to remain neutral in \n     Taiwan's elections; and\n       (6) affirms that the future of Taiwan should be resolved \n     peacefully, in accordance with democratic principles, and \n     with the assent of the people of Taiwan.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution relating \nto the January 2012, presidential and legislative elections held in \nTaiwan. On January 14, 2012, Mr. Ma Ying-jeou, the nominee of the \nChinese Nationalist Party, KMT, was re-elected as President of Taiwan \nwith 51.6 percent of the vote. The KMT also won 64 seats of the 113-\nmember Legislative Yuan, while the Democratic Progressive Party, DPP, \nwon 40 seats.\n  Former United States Senator Frank Murkowski participated in an \ninternational election observation mission made up of 19 observers from \n8 countries. Recently, the mission submitted its final report on the \nelections, concluding that they were mostly free but only partly fair.\n  The resolution I am submitting takes note of the mission's final \nreport, and urges the people and government of Taiwan to take the \nreport's findings and recommendations into consideration as they \ncontinue their commitment to the values of democracy, the rule of law, \nand human rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5991-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5991-S5992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 543--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON \n                 INTERNATIONAL PARENTAL CHILD ABDUCTION\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lugar, Mr. \nInhofe, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Gillibrand, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Kirk) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 543\n\n       Whereas international parental child abduction is a tragic \n     and common occurrence;\n       Whereas the abduction of a child by one parent is a \n     heartbreaking loss for the left-behind parent and deprives \n     the child of a relationship with 2 loving parents;\n       Whereas, according to the Report on Compliance with the \n     Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child \n     Abduction of the United States Department of State from April \n     2010, research shows that abducted children are at risk of \n     significant short- and long-term problems, including \n     ``anxiety, eating problems, nightmares, mood swings, sleep \n     disturbances, [and] aggressive behavior'';\n       Whereas, according to that report, left-behind parents may \n     also experience substantial psychological and emotional \n     issues, including feelings of ``betrayal, sadness over the \n     loss of their children or the end of their marriage, anger \n     toward the other parent, anxiety, sleeplessness, and severe \n     depression'', as well as financial strain while fighting for \n     the return of a child;\n       Whereas, since 1988, the United States, which has a treaty \n     relationship under the Convention on the Civil Aspects of \n     International Child Abduction, done at The Hague October 25, \n     1980 (TIAS 11670) (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``Hague Abduction Convention'') with 69 other countries, has \n     agreed with its treaty partners to follow the terms of the \n     Hague Abduction Convention;\n       Whereas the Hague Abduction Convention provides a legal \n     framework for securing the prompt return of wrongfully \n     removed or retained children to the countries of their \n     habitual residence where competent courts can make decisions \n     on issues of custody and the best interests of the children;\n       Whereas, according to the United States Department of \n     State, the number of new cases of international child \n     abduction from the United States increased from 579 in 2006 \n     to 941 in 2011;\n       Whereas, in 2011, those 941 cases involved 1,367 children \n     who were reported abducted from the United States by a parent \n     and taken to a foreign country;\n       Whereas, in 2011, more than 660 children who were abducted \n     from the United States and taken to a foreign country were \n     returned to the United States;\n       Whereas 7 of the top 10 countries to which children from \n     the United States were most frequently abducted in 2011 are \n     parties to the Hague Abduction Convention, including Mexico, \n     Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Ecuador, Brazil, and \n     Colombia;\n       Whereas Japan, India, and Egypt are not parties to the \n     Hague Abduction Convention and were also among the top 10 \n     countries to which children in the United States were most \n     frequently abducted in 2011;\n       Whereas, in many countries, such as Japan and India, \n     international parental child abduction is not considered a \n     crime, and custody rulings made by courts in the United \n     States are not typically recognized by courts in those \n     countries; and\n       Whereas Japan is the only member of the Group of 7 major \n     industrialized countries that has not ratified the Hague \n     Abduction Convention: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) condemns the unlawful international abduction of all \n     children;\n       (B) urges countries identified by the United States \n     Department of State as noncompliant or demonstrating patterns \n     of noncompliance with the Convention on the Civil Aspects of \n     International Child Abduction, done at The Hague October 25, \n     1980 (TIAS 11670) (referred to in this resolution as the \n     ``Hague Abduction Convention'') to fulfill their commitment \n     under international law to expeditiously implement the \n     provisions of the Hague Abduction Convention;\n       (C) calls on all countries to accede to or ratify the Hague \n     Abduction Convention and to promptly institute measures to \n     equitably and transparently address cases of international \n     parental child abduction;

and\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that the United States \n     should--\n       (A) aggressively pursue the return of each child abducted \n     by a parent from the United\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\n     States to another country through all appropriate means, \n     consistent with the Hague Abduction Convention, and through \n     extradition, when appropriate, and facilitate access by the \n     left-behind parent if the child is not returned;\n       (B) take all appropriate measures to ensure that a child \n     abducted to a country that is a party to the Hague Abduction \n     Convention is returned to the country of habitual residence \n     of the child in compliance with the provisions of the Hague \n     Abduction Convention;\n       (C) continue to use diplomacy to encourage other countries \n     to accede to or ratify the Hague Abduction Convention and to \n     take the necessary steps to effectively fulfill their \n     responsibilities under the Hague Abduction Convention;\n       (D) use diplomacy to encourage countries that have not \n     acceded to or ratified the Hague Abduction Convention to \n     develop an institutionalized mechanism to transparently and \n     expeditiously resolve current and future cases of \n     international child abduction that occur before those \n     countries accede to or ratify the Hague Abduction Convention; \n     and\n       (E) review the advisory services made available to United \n     States citizens by the United States Department of State, the \n     United States Department of Justice, and other United States \n     Government agencies--\n       (i) to improve the prevention of international parental \n     child abduction from the United States;

Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a \nresolution on the importance of quality data from the Census Bureau, \nincluding the American Community Survey. I am proud to introduce this \nresolution as a companion to the similar House legislation by my \ndistinguished colleague, Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney. The \nCongresswoman has shown real leadership on this issue and I am eager to \nwork with her to highlight the importance and significance of quality \ndata for good government oversight and management, as well as helping \nAmerican businesses.\n  Each year, more than $400 billion Federal dollars are distributed to \nlocal communities based on the data from the American Community Survey. \nThis survey is the largest data set of its kind, and helps \nstrategically target federal funding for a broad range of programs for \nhealth care, transportation and education. The American Community \nSurvey has improves data for the Child Health Insurance Program, CHIP, \nthat means so much to vulnerable children. Another specific and \ncompelling example is how law enforcement uses the data to predict \ncriminal activities like methamphetamine production. Local communities \nuse the survey to choose locations for new schools, hospitals, and fire \nstations.\n  The survey is also important to American business. The U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, the National Retail Federation, and the National \nAssociation of Home Builders support investments in this survey. It is \nthe only source of small area estimates on social and demographic \ncharacteristics. Manufacturers and service sector firms use the survey \nto identify the income, education, and occupational skills of local \nlabor markets they serve. Retail businesses use the survey to \nunderstand the characteristics of the neighborhoods in which they \nlocate their stores. Homebuilders and realtors understand the housing \ncharacteristics and the markets in their communities, thanks to the \nAmerican Community Survey.\n  Such a survey of American households has existed in some form since \n1850, either as a longer version of or richer supplement to the basic \ndecennial census. The newer American Community Survey provides more \ntimely data. The Census Bureau estimates the ACS is sent to 2.5 percent \nof homes each year, requiring an average of 38 minutes per household to \nreview instructions and answer questions. At this rate, the typical \nAmerican would respond to the survey about twice in their lifetime. \nCensus workers are sworn to protect confidentiality, facing prison \nsentences up to five years for disclosing any personal information and \nthere has no employees are known to have violated the provisions so the \nprivacy questions are unfounded.\n  In closing, I would like to share a statement by Mr. Lawrence Yun, \nthe Chief Economist of the National Association of Realtors: ``Without \nthe data, the nation would essentially be flying blind in relation to \nimportant housing market conditions and business decisions. Accurate \neconomic and demographic data inspire business confidence that is so \ncritical to the free enterprise system. We would not be able to provide \nan accurate estimate of many housing metrics if they cannot be \nbenchmarked against the America Community Survey data.''\n\n[[Page S5994]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5994-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 56--PROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL \nADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE AND AN ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE OF \n                            REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. McConnell) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

In order to know the various interests of the \n     United States, it was necessary that the description of the \n     several classes into which the community was divided, should \n     be accurately known;

but this kind \n     of information had never been obtained in any country''; that \n     he wished, therefore, ``to avail himself of the present \n     opportunity of accomplishing so valuable a purpose''; and \n     ``[i]f the plan was pursued in taking every future census, it \n     would give [Congress] an opportunity of marking the progress \n     of the society, and distinguishing the growth of every \n     interest.'';\n       Whereas Vice President Thomas Jefferson, the ``Father of \n     the Declaration of Independence'', wrote Congress as \n     president of the American Philosophical Society that the \n     consideration by Congress of the Act entitled ``An Act \n     providing for the second Census or enumeration of the \n     Inhabitants of the United States'' (commonly known as the \n     ``Census Act of 1800''; 2 Stat. 11, chapter 12) offered ``an \n     occasion of great value, and not otherwise to be obtained, of \n     ascertaining sundry facts highly important to society . . . \n     [and] presenting a more detailed view of the inhabitants of \n     the United States, under several different aspects,'' \n     including age (so as to be able to measure life expectancy), \n     citizenship (so as to be able to determine the relative \n     contributions of births and immigration to population \n     growth), and the occupation of free males (so as to be able \n     ``to ascertain more completely the causes which influence \n     life and health, and furnish a curious and useful document of \n     the distribution of society in these States, and of the \n     conditions and vocations of our fellow-citizens . . .'');\n       Whereas diverse presidents throughout the 19th and 20th \n     centuries, such as John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren, \n     William McKinley, Herbert Hoover, and Franklin Roosevelt, \n     asked for and received from Congress permission to expand the \n     scope of census questions unrelated to enumeration;\n       Whereas the Economic Census is required by law to be \n     conducted every 5 years, provides the most authoritative and \n     comprehensive data about United States businesses, and \n     provides the foundation for key economic indicators, such as \n     the gross domestic product;\n       Whereas, in response to the recommendations of the \n     Intensive Review Committee (also known as the ``Watkins \n     Commission''), Congress enacted the recommendations into law \n     in 1954, thereby providing for quinquennial censuses of \n     manufacturing, mineral industries, and other businesses;\n       Whereas the finding of the Watkins Commission that \n     ``[w]ithout these census records, it would not be possible to \n     construct or interpret this system of economic indicators. \n     Business executives, farmers, labor leaders, professional \n     men, scholars, scientists, government officials, and \n     administrators in all phases of our society are dependent on \n     census records or on economic indicators based on census \n     records.'' is as true today as it was in 1954;\n       Whereas the Economic Census--\n       (1) provides the foundation for key annual, quarterly, and \n     monthly Federal economic indicators, including the gross \n     domestic product, industrial production, labor productivity, \n     manufacturing and services industry activity, producer price \n     indices, research and development expenditures, commodity \n     flows, and employer-sponsored health insurance coverage;\n       (2) provides the basis for Federal macroeconomic and budget \n     projections; and\n       (3) informs Federal trade, competitiveness, and \n     entrepreneurship policies;\n       Whereas single firms rely on the Economic Census to compare \n     their operations to industry averages, identify markets, and \n     inform decisions on business location, capital investment, \n     product research and development, and marketing strategies;\n       Whereas the information collected through the Economic \n     Census affords the private and public sectors the ability to \n     make good decisions and use resources in a way such that the \n     entire country is more efficient and better able to compete \n     in the world economy, thereby allowing the United States to \n     maintain a high standard of living;\n       Whereas what is today called the Economic Census began as \n     the ``census of manufactures'' in 1810;\n       Whereas the census of manufactures (as well as the census \n     of agriculture) became a regular feature of census taking in \n     1840 and has remained such ever since;\n       Whereas household and business responses to census surveys \n     allow national, State, and local officials to make informed \n     decisions, just as James Madison envisioned, providing timely \n     and accurate statistics even for small localities;\n       Whereas, historically, Congress has followed the precedent \n     set by all previous Congresses in supporting and directing \n     the collection of a range of information in the ACS and the \n     Economic Census to guide its own deliberations and \n     consideration of policies;\n\n[[Page S5995]]\n\n       Whereas Federal courts have consistently upheld the \n     constitutionality of including questions unrelated to \n     enumeration in the decennial census and requiring answers to \n     such questions; and\n       Whereas Congress has mandated and the Department of \n     Commerce has successfully implemented strict protection of \n     the confidentiality of responses: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) encourages the people of the United States to fulfill \n     their civic duty and follow the law by responding to all \n     census surveys conducted by the Bureau of the Census; and\n       (2) strongly encourages the Bureau of the Census--\n       (A) to provide United States households and businesses with \n     information regarding the community, economic, and fiscal \n     benefits to be gained from participation in the American \n     Community Survey and the Economic Census;\n       (B) to use the most current methodologies and technologies \n     to reduce any burden of responding to the American Community \n     Survey and the Economic Census; and\n       (C) to continue, as the Bureau of the Census has done \n     throughout its history, to innovate its methods, processes, \n     and products, and thus maintain the world-class standards \n     that have made the Bureau of the Census an international \n     leader among statistical agencies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S5995-1", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 58--DIRECTING THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE OF \n  REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE A CORRECTION IN THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 4240\n\n  Mr. KERRY submitted the following concurrent resolution;

Mr. REID (for Mr. Webb (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lugar, \nMr. Inhofe, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Levin)) proposed an \namendment to the resolution S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 3245 and that \nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3245) to permanently reauthorize the EB-5 \n     Regional Center Program, the E-Verify Program, the Special \n     Immigrant Nonminister Religious Worker Program, and the \n     Conrad State 30 J-1 Visa Waiver Program.\n\n  Without objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate worked together to \nadvance bipartisan legislation that Senator Grassley and I introduced, \nand I thank all Senators for their support. I am very pleased that the \nSenate has agreed to pass this important legislation as it has been \namended. I especially commend Senator Grassley, Senator Hatch, Senator \nConrad, and Senator Schumer for their collaboration. And I thank \nSenator Menendez for working with us to get this done in the Senate.\n  This legislation contains extensions for four long-standing \nimmigration programs for another 3 years. These programs, last \nauthorized in the fiscal year 2010 Homeland Security Appropriations \nlaw, are set to expire on September 30, 2012. Today's actions are a \nstep toward avoiding that result, and maintaining the progress and \nbenefits that these programs provide to many American communities and \nconstituencies.\n  A program that I have long supported with Senators on both sides of \naisle, the EB-5 Regional Center Program, has brought tens of thousands \nof jobs and billions in capital investment to communities across the \nUnited States at no cost to the taxpayer. This program represents one \nsmall corner of our overall immigration system, yet it results in \nenormous benefits for so many communities, including Vermont, where our \nGovernors across administrations and business leaders have put it to \nuse to make Vermont a better place for its citizens. The economic \ntransformation we have seen in some Vermont communities as the direct \nresult of this program is profound. Over the last several years, \nVermonters who might have been out of work in a struggling economy \nfound themselves working to build up Vermont companies, building \nVermont products, and supporting economic activity in their \ncommunities. And so today, business leaders and entrepreneurs in \nVermont, along with Vermont's Governor Peter Shumlin and his economic \ndevelopment team will continue to have this tool to help raise the \ncapital Vermont needs to continue its innovation and economic growth.\n  Job creation and capital investment in America is something I know we \ncan all support, and today I am proud to say we have done just that. I \nwant to give my thanks to the Association to Invest in the U.S.A., the \nAmerican Immigration Lawyers Association, and all of the entrepreneurs \nand businesses large and small across the United States that have \nrealized the economic benefits of this program and that have so \nstrongly supported my efforts.\n  The bill we pass today also continues programs important to Senator \nHatch and Senator Conrad. Today we take a step toward carrying on \nSenator Conrad's program to encourage foreign doctors trained in the \nUnited States to practice medicine in medically underserved rural \nareas. And today we move to continue Senator Hatch's program to give \nUnited States religious institutions the ability to invite foreign \ncitizens of shared faith to their communities to carry out good works \nand to help others.\n  And this legislation reauthorizes the E-Verify work authorization \nprogram, which I know is very important to the Judiciary Committee's \nranking member and other Senators. This program gives American \nemployers a tool to ensure that those they hire are legally authorized \nto work in the United States. Yet it maintains its status as a \nvoluntary program for employers, and maintains that choice for our \nbusinesses large and small to participate if they choose.\n  I regret that it has been such a long road for us to get to this \npoint today. These measures should be the easy ones. The politics of \nimmigration continue to make our progress difficult not only on the \nbroader measures that America needs, but on the smaller ones that \nCongress has supported for many years. So I am pleased the Senate has\n\n[[Page S6007]]\n\nacted in support of all of these programs today. I would have liked to \nsee these programs made permanent after the many years they have been \nin existence they should be. But I also understand that with \npermanence, the Senate should look at ways to improve them where \npossible so that they are more secure and more effective. I am prepared \nto do that.\n  Though we take a small step forward today with these \nreauthorizations, I remain as committed today to tackle comprehensive \nimmigration reform as I was when I supported President Bush in 2006 and \n2007 in his efforts to make real change in our laws. I expect we will \nbe there again soon and I look forward to the day we will once again \nbegin the effort to strengthen and protect our entire immigration \nsystem.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Leahy-\nGrassley substitute amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; that a Leahy-\nGrassley amendment to the title, which is also at the desk, be agreed \nto; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table with no \nintervening action or debate; and any statements related to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 402\n\n       Whereas the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) wreaked havoc in \n     northern Uganda for two decades, during which time the World \n     Bank estimates that they abducted some 66,000 youth and \n     forced them to serve as child soldiers and sex slaves and \n     commit terrible acts;\n       Whereas, under increasing pressure, Joseph Kony ordered the \n     Lord's Resistance Army in 2005 and 2006 to withdraw from \n     Uganda and to move west into the border region of the \n     Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African \n     Republic, and what would become the Republic of South Sudan;\n       Whereas, since September 2008, Joseph Kony has directed the \n     Lord's Resistance Army to commit systematic, large-scale \n     attacks against innocent civilians in the Democratic Republic \n     of Congo, the Central African Republic, and the Republic of \n     South Sudan that have destabilized the region and resulted in \n     the deliberate killing of at least 2,400 civilians, many of \n     whom were targeted in schools and churches; the rape and \n     brutal mutilation of an unknown number of men, women, and \n     children; the abduction of over 3,400 civilians, including at \n     least 1,500 children, many of them forced to become child \n     soldiers or sex slaves; and the reported displacement of more \n     than 465,000 civilians from their homes, many of whom do not \n     have access to essential humanitarian assistance;\n       Whereas insecurity caused by the Lord's Resistance Army has \n     undermined efforts by the governments in the region, which \n     have been supported by the assistance of the United States \n     and the international community, to consolidate peace and \n     stability in each of the countries affected by the Lord's \n     Resistance Army;\n       Whereas, since December 2001, the Department of State has \n     included the Lord's Resistance Army on its ``Terrorist \n     Exclusion List'' and in August 2008, Lord's Resistance Army \n     leader Joseph Kony was designated a ``Specially Designated \n     Global Terrorist'' by President George W. Bush pursuant to \n     Executive Order 13224;\n       Whereas, on October 6, 2005, the International Criminal \n     Court issued arrest warrants against Joseph Kony and four of \n     his top commanders for war crimes and crimes against \n     humanity, yet they remain at large;\n       Whereas, in May 2010, Congress passed and President Barack \n     Obama signed into law the\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\n     Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda \n     Recovery Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-172), which made it the \n     policy of the United States to work with regional governments \n     toward a comprehensive and lasting resolution to the conflict \n     in northern Uganda and other affected areas by providing \n     political, economic, military, and intelligence support for \n     viable multilateral efforts to protect civilians from the \n     Lord's Resistance Army, to apprehend or remove Joseph Kony \n     and his top commanders from the battlefield, and to disarm \n     and demobilize the remaining Lord's Resistance Army fighters;\n       Whereas, on November 24, 2010, as mandated by the Lord's \n     Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act \n     of 2009, President Obama issued the Strategy to Support the \n     Disarmament of the Lord's Resistance Army, which provides a \n     comprehensive strategy for supporting regional efforts to \n     mitigate and eliminate the threat to civilians and regional \n     stability posed by the Lord's Resistance Army;\n       Whereas, on October 14, 2011, President Obama notified \n     Congress that he had authorized approximately 100 combat-\n     equipped members of the Armed Forces to deploy to central \n     Africa to provide assistance to regional forces that are \n     working toward the removal of Joseph Kony and senior \n     leadership of the Lord's Resistance Army from the \n     battlefield;\n       Whereas section 1206 of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81;

and\n       Whereas targeted United States assistance and leadership \n     can help prevent further mass atrocities and curtail \n     humanitarian suffering in central Africa: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns Joseph Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army for \n     committing crimes against humanity and mass atrocities, and \n     supports ongoing efforts by the United States and countries \n     in central Africa to remove Joseph Kony and Lord's Resistance \n     Army commanders from the battlefield;\n       (2) commends continued efforts by the Governments of \n     Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of \n     South Sudan, the Central African Republic, and other \n     countries in the region, as well as the African Union and \n     United Nations, to end the threat posed by the Lord's \n     Resistance Army;\n       (3) welcomes the ongoing efforts of the United States \n     Government to assist regional governments to bring Joseph \n     Kony to justice and end atrocities perpetuated by the Lord's \n     Resistance Army, pursuant to the comprehensive strategy \n     required by the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and \n     Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009;\n       (4) calls on the President to keep Congress fully informed \n     of the efforts of the United States Government and to work \n     closely with Congress to identify and address critical gaps \n     in the United States Government's strategy to support the \n     efforts of the regional governments to counter the Lord's \n     Resistance Army;\n       (5) commends the Department of Defense, United States \n     Africa Command (U.S. AFRICOM), and members of the United \n     States Armed Forces currently deployed to serve as advisors \n     to the national militaries in the region seeking to protect \n     local communities and pursuing Joseph Kony and top Lord's \n     Resistance Army commanders;\n       (6) commends the African Union for committing to enhance \n     troop deployments in order to fortify the military response \n     to the Lord's Resistance Army, in coordination with the \n     Governments of Uganda, the Central African Republic, the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Republic of South \n     Sudan, and in order to strengthen ongoing efforts to \n     apprehend Joseph Kony and senior commanders of the Lord's \n     Resistance Army or remove them from the battlefield;\n       (7) supports increased collaboration and coordination \n     between the African Union and the Governments of Uganda, the \n     Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, \n     and the Republic of South Sudan in order to apprehend Joseph \n     Kony or remove him from the battlefield;\n       (8) supports continued efforts by the Secretary of State \n     and representatives of the United States to work with partner \n     nations and the international community--\n       (A) to strengthen the capabilities of regional military \n     forces deployed to protect civilians and pursue commanders of \n     the Lord's Resistance Army;\n       (B) to enhance cooperation and cross-border coordination \n     among regional governments;\n       (C) to promote increased contributions from donor nations \n     for regional efforts to address the Lord's Resistance Army; \n     and\n       (D) to enhance overall efforts to increase civilian \n     protection to populations affected by the Lord's Resistance \n     Army;\n       (9) calls on the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \n     Defense, the Administrator of the United States Agency for \n     International Development, and the heads of other relevant \n     government agencies to utilize existing funds for ongoing \n     programs--\n       (A) to enhance mobility, intelligence, and logistical \n     capabilities for regional partner forces engaged in efforts \n     to protect civilians and apprehend or remove Joseph Kony and \n     his top commanders from the battlefield;\n       (B) to expand physical access and telecommunications \n     infrastructure to facilitate the timely flow of information \n     and access for humanitarian and protection actors;\n       (C) to support programs to encourage and help non-indicted \n     Lord's Resistance Army commanders, fighters, abductees, and \n     associated noncombatants to safely defect from the group, \n     including through radio and community programs; and\n       (D) to support regionally-led rehabilitation programs for \n     children and youth affected by war that are tailored to \n     address the specific trauma and physical and mental abuse \n     these children and youth may have experienced as a result of \n     indoctrination by the Lord's Resistance Army and to serve to \n     reconnect them with their families and communities;\n       (10) calls on the President to place restrictions on any \n     individuals or governments found to be providing training, \n     supplies, financing, or support of any kind to Joseph Kony or \n     the Lord's Resistance Army;\n       (11) urges that civilian protection and early-warning \n     programs led by regional militaries and the United States \n     Agency for International Development continue to be \n     prioritized in areas affected by the Lord's Resistance Army \n     and that steps be taken to inform potentially vulnerable \n     communities about known Lord's Resistance Army movements and \n     threats;\n       (12) welcomes the recent defections of men, women, and \n     children from the ranks of the Lord's Resistance Army, and \n     calls on governments in the region and the international \n     community to continue to support safe return, demobilization, \n     rehabilitation, and reintegration efforts;

Honestly, it seems she \njust came yesterday. I really mean that. She has added a lot of \nvibrancy to this body, she is always pleasant, and she has always been \navailable to me, even though she sits on the Republican side, and to \neveryone else.\n  So I am happy for her in one way: She is leaving because she fell in \nlove and is getting married, and I am very happy for her. But we are \nreally a small group of people at this front desk who do so much to \nmake this place run properly. And even though she has been here 7 \nyears, this is something I am confident will be with her the rest of \nher life. I am grateful to her for her attitude and her \nprofessionalism, and I wish her the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/08/02/senate-section/article/S6014-6", "month": "08", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ACKNOWLEDGING THE SENATE PAGES\n\n  Mr. REID.
