Mr. President, today we resume consideration of the most \nimportant piece of jobs legislation we have had here in a long time; \nthat is, the highway bill. But it is more than a highway bill, it is a \nsurface transportation bill that deals with all aspects of helping our \nfailing bridges, and there are 70,000 of those. Twenty percent of our \nhighways are in nonsafe conditions. We have problems with our mass \ntransportation system, rails, and other such things, so we have to move \nforward.\n  Building this Nation's infrastructure with this legislation alone \nwill save or create 2.8 million jobs. This is an effort to build a \nworld-class transportation system that was started during the \nPresidency of Dwight Eisenhower. Every President since then has \nrecognized the need to go forward with the vision General Eisenhower \nhad. We must renew that commitment. The Presidents in recent years have \ngone out of their way to do that. President Reagan gave a number of \nspeeches about how important it was that we begin to renew the \ncommitment we should have to infrastructure in this country. President \nClinton did the same.\n  The legislation is very important, and a commitment to the renewal of \na vision of General Eisenhower is the essence of this bipartisan bill. \nIt has the endorsement of one of the most conservative Members of the \nSenate and one of the most liberal Members of the Senate. I was \ndisappointed that it took as long as it did to get where we are, but we \nare here. We invoked cloture quite a long time ago, and it has taken\n\n[[Page S1584]]\n\nmore than a month to come within sight of the completion of this bill. \nI am pleased that we are on track to dispense with the remaining \namendments and vote on final passage during today's business.\n  I am hopeful the House will act immediately to pass this bipartisan \ncompromise rather than pursue what we have all read about--an extreme, \nideological bill they were considering last month. It failed every \ntest, including the test of their own caucus. The Republican caucus \nsaid: No, we cannot do this.\n  The highway bill is important to the Democratic Members and \nRepublican Members of the House, as it is to Democratic and Republican \nMembers of the Senate. I would hope the Speaker understands it is not \ngood for this country to have a situation where he tries to pass \neverything with a majority of the majority. What that means is the \nRepublicans have a majority in the House--and I served in the House, \nand that is not how things were done with Bob Michel, who was the \nRepublican leader at the time, Tip O'Neill, who was the Democratic \nleader at the time, and Jim Wright thereafter. Bob Michel worked with \nboth of them to get legislation done. What they tried to do was get to \nthe magic number of 218--that is the majority in the House--and they \ngot those votes from Democrats and Republicans. So I hope my friend the \nSpeaker won't just try to get this surface transportation bill done \nwith Republicans. Let the Democrats voice their opinion as to what \nshould happen. That is the way we should do it. Passing a bipartisan \ntransportation bill the President can sign would be a victory for both \nparties and our country.\n\n  The Senate's pressing business doesn't end with completion of this \nbill. We have a small business jobs bill that was passed overwhelmingly \nby the House and is supported by President Obama. Last night I had a \nconversation on the floor publicly with the Republican whip, Senator \nKyl of Arizona, and we talked about the need to get this done. We are \ngoing to move forward on this expeditiously. There are always bumps in \nthe road. I hope there will be very few bumps in the road.\n  I have not had an opportunity to talk to my friend the Republican \nleader, but I was told this morning that the ranking member of the \nBanking Committee, my friend from Alabama, Senator Shelby, has \nindicated he wants to make some improvements in the bill we received \nfrom the House. I suggest he work with Senator Johnson. If they can do \nsomething on a bipartisan basis and do it quickly, I will be happy to \ntake a look at it, but we need to move forward. I think you kind of get \nthe message when there are about 390 votes for a bill and 20 against \nit, so I think we have to move forward.\n  The one thing I am going to do is have a perfecting amendment \nprepared that will allow us to move forward on reauthorizing the Ex-Im \nBank. I hope we can do that. It is something that is broadly supported, \nand the business community thinks it is extremely important. As I \nmentioned last night, Mr. McNerney, the head of Boeing, said it is a \ntremendously important bill for the airline industry, which is so \nimportant to the economy of our country. It is not only important to \nthe airline industry, it is important to other segments of our \nindustrial base. It is an important piece of legislation, and I hope we \ncan add that to the small business jobs bill. If we can't, I \nunderstand, but it would be a shame to miss the opportunity to do that.\n  We are interested in this IPO bill that has been supported by the \nHouse and the President of the United States. I am convinced it will \nspur small business growth. It will not create the jobs we have on the \nhighway bill, but it is good for job growth. It will bring more capital \ninto the business world, and we have needed that for several years now. \nIt would streamline the way companies sell stock. I look forward to \nworking with my friend the Republican leader to finalize a path forward \non this bipartisan legislation.\n  In the coming days, the Senate must also consider postal reform \nlegislation, reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, \ncybersecurity, and additional measures to create jobs and improve our \neconomy. The only thing preventing the Senate from moving quickly to \ntackle these items, including the bipartisan small business jobs bill, \nis what we have had this whole Congress: obstructionism by my friends \nthe Republicans. They have forced the Senate to wait weeks on unrelated \namendments to this bill, this bipartisan surface transportation bill. I \nhope they are not going to hold up progress on the small business jobs \nbill. I am confident they will not. I really hope that is the case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/13/senate-section/article/S1584-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday I filed cloture on 17 consensus \njudicial nominations. I have worked with the Republicans for months to \nfind a way forward for a timely confirmation for many of these \nnominees, including some who have been waiting for up-or-down votes \nsince October. Yesterday I had a visual aid--and I will show it during \nthe caucus today--to show what happened in the Clinton years, the Bush \nyears, and the Obama years. It is so clear what has happened. And it \nreally doesn't fully represent what happened because in the Clinton \nyears we had dozens and dozens of nominees who were what we called \npocket-vetoed--they just wouldn't hold hearings on them. But with the \nlength of time the judges were reported out of committee--Clinton, a \nfew days; Bush, a few days; and, of course, now we are talking about \nmany months with the Obama nominations--that is not fair. They should \nall be entitled to an up-or-down vote, especially when they came out of \nthe committee so overwhelmingly, with rare exception. There is no \nreason we should eat up even 1 day of precious time the Senate has to \npass these commonsense measures when we can do it so quickly.\n  President Obama's judicial nominees have waited five or six times \nlonger than President Bush's nominations for confirmation, and that \ntime has increased and is not going down. The Senate once confirmed 18 \nof President Bush's nominations in a single day. There is no \njustification for obstruction on matters that ought to be routine. \nThere is too much to do. The Senate simply doesn't have the luxury to \nwaste any more time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/13/senate-section/article/S1584-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, later today the Senate is likely to \nfinish the highway bill, and once we do--I listened carefully to the \nmajority leader's remarks--once we finish the highway bill, we ought to \nimmediately turn to the bipartisan jobs bill that passed the House last \nThursday. The vote was 390 to 23. Let me say that again. The vote in \nthe House was 390 to 23. The President also indicated that he would \nsign the House bill. So it strikes me that with the jobs emergency we \nhave in this country with 8.3 percent unemployment--many more millions \nof Americans having given up trying to get in the workforce--the thing \nto do is to pocket this broad bipartisan bill and try to create jobs \nimmediately.\n  I heard my friend the majority leader indicate that he wants to have \na different version of it, to kind of recraft it. All that will do is \nslow down the process and make it more difficult to get this important \njobs legislation to the President's desk rapidly. So I hope the \nmajority leader will reconsider whether we need to kind of reinvent the \nwheel here. This is already a broadly supported bipartisan bill that \nthe President has said he will sign as soon as we send it to him. I \ndon't know why in the Senate we would want to make something that ought \nto be pretty simple extraordinarily complicated.\n  The Democratic-controlled Senate turns to something contentious \ninstead of doing something that almost all of us agree on--certainly in \nthe House--and the President agrees on that would focus on jobs and \nactually do some good. The American people think we have spent a lot of \ntime spinning our wheels around here. Rather than trying to sort of \nmanufacture gridlock and create the illusion of conflict where none \nshould exist, why don't we demonstrate that we can actually get \nsomething done together? In a moment when millions of Americans are \nlooking for work and millions more are\n\n[[Page S1585]]\n\nstruggling with the high price of gas, we have the opportunity to \nreally do something together right now. As soon as we finish this \nhighway bill, we can take up this jobs bill and send a small but \nimportant signal to job creators and innovators that we want to help \nmake it easier for them to hire.\n  Later today we will have another chance to move forward on the \nKeystone Pipeline. Despite the President's continued stubborn \nopposition to it, we will have another vote offered by Senator Pat \nRoberts.\n  The House-passed jobs bill isn't just important for what it does but \nfor what it also represents. It is a rare and welcomed signal that \nlawmakers in Washington still value the risk-takers and the \nentrepreneurs who have always been so vital to our Nation's greatness. \nAfter 3 years of policies that undermine free enterprise through the \npicking of winners and losers, this legislation sends an entirely \ndifferent signal. It is a welcome step back in the right direction.\n  By clearing away redtape, it should encourage the kind of \nentrepreneurship that not only leads to new pockets of industry and the \njobs that come with them but which also helps people fulfill their \ndreams--and without adding to the deficit. This bill doesn't add \nanything to the Federal deficit.\n  This is precisely what we should be doing right here in Washington. \nIt is the message we should send. We don't need fewer Apples or \nMicrosofts or Facebooks; we need more of them. We need them for the \nvalue they add to our lives, the edge they give us in the world \neconomy, the jobs they provide to hundreds of thousands of American \nworkers, and for the satisfaction they bring to those who help turn \nthem from an idea into a reality.\n  So let's send this important signal that we still believe in \nopportunity, we still believe in innovation, and that when a common \ngood is in sight--when we can see a common good right before us--we can \nstill work together to actually achieve it.\n  This is so crucial that I want to renew what my colleague Jon Kyl did \nlast night, which is to offer a unanimous consent request--I have told \nthe majority leader I am going to do this--to turn to this important \npiece of bipartisan legislation, passed overwhelmingly in the House and \nsupported by the President of the United States, immediately after we \nfinish the highway bill.\n  Let me say again, there is no purpose served by manufacturing \ncontroversy here in the Senate--manufacturing controversy when none \nshould exist. We have an important piece of jobs legislation passed \noverwhelmingly in the House, supported by the President. The highway \nbill will clear here later this afternoon or tomorrow. I think most \nSenators would rather be working on that which the American people \nbelieve would actually help create jobs than to see the Senate \nembroiled in another controversy which I fear my good friend the \nmajority leader is seeking to precipitate as soon as the highway bill \nis concluded.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3606\n\n  I ask unanimous consent, notwithstanding any other rule of the \nSenate, that immediately following the disposition of the pending \ntransportation bill, the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. \n3606, a bill received from the House, which would increase American job \ncreation and economic growth by improving access to public capital \nmarkets for emerging growth companies; I further ask unanimous consent \nthat the bill remain the pending business to the exclusion of all other \nbusiness until disposed of.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I know when \npeople talk, they are always afraid people aren't listening. Maybe my \nfriend the Republican leader's intention was diverted from my \npresentation this morning.\n  There is nothing to fight about. I just said we are going to move to \nthis bill as quickly as we can. I said I have heard that the ranking \nmember of the Banking Committee wants to take a look at this. I \nencourage him to do so and to talk to Senator Johnson. I said we are \ngoing to have an opportunity to vote on a perfecting amendment--\nsomething I thought everyone wanted; Republicans want it, Democrats \nwant it, the business community wants it, the workers of this country \nneed it--to reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank which goes out of business at \nthe end of May. That will slow this bill up maybe a half an hour--one-\nhalf hour.\n  I have said many times, if we are going to have a fight, make it over \nsomething worthwhile. There is nothing to fight about here. We are \ngoing to move to this as quickly as we can. We know that under the \nrules of the Senate, we have to vote on 17 judges who have been held \nup, one of those back to October of last year. So I would be happy to \nget rid of all of those judges, to have them approved, and move to this \nbill. We are going to move this bill as quickly as possible.\n  My friend the Republican leader spoke volumes when he said this is a \nsmall but important bill. We realize that. Those are his words. This is \nan IPO bill dealing with initial public offerings. We have heard for \nmonths and months that small businesses can't find capital to do the \nthings they need to do. This bill is a step in that direction. I \nsupport it. My caucus will support it. So I tell everyone within the \nsound of my voice: We are going to move to this bill as quickly as we \ncan.\n  I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, not to continue the debate \ninterminably, but it is a question of priorities. We can agree that we \nought to pass this jobs bill. Certainly if it were called up, it would \nbe open for amendment and the majority leader could offer the Ex-Im \nBank amendment if he chose, and other Senators could as well. But it is \na question of priorities: Do we want to have a big fight in the Senate \nover procedure--and we have had some procedural differences which I \nwill address not right now but later--relating to the confirmation of \njudges, which is the responsibility of the Senate under the \nConstitution of the United States, or do we want to turn immediately to \na jobs bill that we overwhelmingly agree to, as the majority leader has \nconceded in his remarks?\n  It is a question of priorities. Do we want to have the Senate in a \nbig fight over procedure after we finish the highway bill or do we want \nto turn to an overwhelmingly bipartisan jobs bill supported by the \nPresident and passed by the House? It is a question of priorities. What \ndo we want to do next for the American people?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am stunned by a controversy over nothing. \nUnder the rules of the Senate, we filed cloture, because there has been \nstalling and obstruction on the lives of 17 people. I didn't file on \nthe appellate judges, only trial judges. Each one of these men and \nwomen's lives has been brought to a standstill. They have the \nopportunity of a lifetime to be able to become a Federal trial court \njudge. They shouldn't have to wait until October. I say to my friend: \nWe can approve these judges in 1 minute. Let's do that. It is not fair \nto say the lives of these 17 men and women are unimportant and put it \nover until some later time.\n\n  We have no problem with the IPO bill we got from the House. How could \nwe? It got 390 votes in the House. The President of the United States \nsupports it. We support it. We want to get this done and we will do it \nas quickly as we can. It may not be 10 minutes from now or 24 hours \nfrom now, but we are going to move to it as quickly as we can, and we \ncan move to it very quickly. As soon as we finish this highway bill, we \ncould move to those judges, get that issue disposed of, and then move \nto this. It might take an hour after the highway bill, but that is \nabout all.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield to me on that point?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when we talk about what the American people \nwant, I am sure the majority leader--and I ask him this as a question--\nis aware that there are 160 million Americans who are in judicial \ndistricts where there are vacancies, because even though they have gone \nthrough the Senate Judiciary Committee, the majority leader has been \nblocked from bringing them to the floor, so that 160 million Americans \nwere denied a chance for justice, denied a chance to go to court? I ask \nthe leader, was that\n\n[[Page S1586]]\n\nalso one of the considerations he had on moving forward with these \njudges?\n  Mr. REID. I say to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee--and I \nmentioned this yesterday at some length and I believe the Presiding \nOfficer was here when I did that--more than half of the people in \nAmerica today are living in areas where there has been declared a \njudicial emergency. Nevada is one of them. We have courts where these \njudges are overwhelmed with work. I said yesterday I don't want these \njudges to act as if they were night court judges dealing with traffic \ncases. As I said yesterday, these judges deal with what we used to \nrefer to when I practiced law as: ``What are you trying to do, make a \nFederal case out of it?'' They said that because there is no finer law \ndispensing anyplace in the world than in our Federal court system. And \nwe can't do that when these men and women are overwhelmed with work.\n  The circuit court level is one thing. It is too bad they are \noverwhelmed with work. But on the trial court level, they are dealing \nwith everyday problems that people have, including accidents, antitrust \ncases, businesses having gone bankrupt, and all the other things the \nFederal court has jurisdiction over.\n  My friend is absolutely right. We should not only be concerned about \nthe 17 people who have been selected by the President of the United \nStates to be a judge after having gotten a signoff from the Republican \nSenator in their State. I should have talked not only about them \nindividually but what they represent, and that is trying to do \nsomething about the emergencies that exist for more than half of \nAmericans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I think that colloquy underscores my \npoint. My friends on the other side are concerned that the jobs of 17 \nindividuals may be delayed for a few months. I doubt if any of them is \nunemployed at the moment. It is highly unlikely that any of these \nindividuals will not be confirmed in an orderly process as we have been \nengaged in this year.\n  The issue is a question of priorities. What is more important, \ngetting these 17 individuals into a job a little bit quicker than the \nmajority has experienced so far or turning to a measure overwhelmingly \nsupported by Republicans and Democrats in the House and supported by \nthe President of the United States and that might create, in the very \nnear future, hundreds of thousands of jobs? So it is a question of \npriorities. That is why I say this is a manufactured dispute.\n  I will have much more to say, in great detail, about the judges \nissue. But for the moment, the point is this, quite simply: What are \nour priorities? Do we want to pass an overwhelmingly bipartisan jobs \nbill the President supports as soon as possible--certainly open for any \namendment the majority leader might seek to offer--or do we want to \ncreate a controversy over judges who are almost never denied \nconfirmation when we have been confirming judges all along?\n  I don't know that there is much point to continuing this discussion \nany longer this morning. I will have a lot more to say about how we \nended up in a situation where the majority leader is seeking to \nmanufacture a crisis that shouldn't--a conflict or a crisis that \ndoesn't exist.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Here is my idea. I have a great idea. My friend the \nRepublican leader said these judges are all going to be approved \nanyway, so I have an idea. Let's go to this IPO bill immediately after \nwe finish the highway bill, with the agreement that we will dispose of \nthese judges immediately after that. That sounds good to me. I am happy \nto do that. How about that? Before my friend leaves, how about a deal \non that? As soon as we finish this highway bill, we will move to the \nIPO bill, and as soon as we finish that and get it out of the Senate, \nwe will then have up-or-down votes on those 17 judges. This does not \ninclude an agreement on the appellate judges. We will deal with those \nat a subsequent time. How about that?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I am sorry.\n  Mr. REID. I will say again to my friend, I would hope that what we \ncould do is when we finish the highway bill, go to the IPO bill, and \nthen as soon as we finish that have an up-or-down vote on these judges. \nI would be happy to work in any reasonable fashion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We have been discussing--this is not the best time for \nthe debate on the judges, but the point is this: We have been \nprocessing judges. It is highly unlikely any of these district judges \nare not going to be confirmed. We have done a number of them this year. \nWe have done seven this year. District judges are almost never \ndefeated.\n  This is a very transparent attempt to try to slam-dunk the minority \nand make them look as though they are obstructing things they aren't \nobstructing. We object to that. We don't think that meets the standard \nof civility that should be expected in the Senate. So any effort to \nmake the minority look bad or to slam-dunk them that is sort of \nmanufactured, as this is, is going to, of course, be greeted with \nresistance. It could be that that is precisely what my friend the \nmajority leader has in mind, to try to make the Senate look as though \nit is embroiled in controversy where no controversy exists.\n  So my suggestion is why don't we do first things first. First things \nfirst. And it strikes me that an overwhelming bipartisan jobs bill \nclearing the House would be something the American people would \napplaud. It is supported by the President. Why don't we take that up? \nThe majority leader or any of us can offer any amendments we think are \nappropriate and move it toward passage, because that is the kind of \nthing people expect of us.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. It is obvious that the jobs bill has nothing to do with the \nholding up of these judges as has been articulated by my friend. It is \na question of stalling things, as has happened all this Congress. As \nindicated, more than half the American people are in areas where there \nare judicial emergencies. It is important we get this dispensation of \njustice done, and do it quickly.\n\n  The controversy on the IPO bill does not exist. There is not any. I \nwould suggest to my friend, though, we have very many things left to \ndo. The postal service; we do not want it to go broke. We have the \nViolence Against Women Act we need to get done. We have all these \njudges, of course. We have cybersecurity. So if we move--and I am going \nto move quickly--to this IPO bill, I cannot imagine why we would need \nany amendments.\n  I indicated that out of my right as majority leader, I can offer a \nperfecting amendment, and that would be to find out if the body feels \nstrongly about what they have said publicly: that the Ex-Im Bank should \nbe part of the bill. That would hold the bill up for one vote, about 15 \nminutes.\n  But in addition to that, we are not going to have a knockdown, drag-\nout on the IPO. If everybody loves the House bill so much, that is what \nwe will vote on.\n  You have heard the expression: fill the tree. We will fill the tree \nand go to the IPO bill. If everybody loves it so much, we should get it \nto the President's desk as fast as we can.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/13/senate-section/article/S1586-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1586-S1589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the colloquy \nbetween my two friends, the distinguished majority and minority \nleaders. It is almost--and I think the American people see it as \nalmost--a kabuki dance because the fact is, the majority leader is \nright to seek votes on these district court nominees. He seeks to \nsecure Senate votes for 17 highly qualified Federal district court \nnominations favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee. They are \nbeing blocked by Senate Republicans.\n  I wish we could find a way to stop these damaging filibusters. They \nare totally unprecedented. It is greatly damaging the most respected \ncourt system in the world: our Federal court system. That means \nAmericans are not getting the justice without delay they are entitled \nto. We must work together to ensure that the Federal courts have the \njudges they need to provide justice for all Americans without needless \ndelay.\n\n[[Page S1587]]\n\n  Federal district court judges are the trial court judges who hear \ncases from litigants across the country and preside over Federal \ncriminal trials, applying the law to facts and helping settle legal \ndisputes. They handle the vast majority of the caseload of the Federal \ncourts and are critical to making sure our Federal courts remain \navailable to provide a fair hearing for all Americans. Nominations to \nfill these critical positions, whether made by a Democratic or \nRepublican President, have always been considered with deference to the \nhome state Senators who know the nominees and their states best, and \nhave always been confirmed quickly with that support.\n  I have been here 37 years, with Republican Presidents, Democratic \nPresidents, Republican majorities, Democratic majorities. Never in \nthose 37 years have we seen district court nominees blocked for months \nas we have seen since President Obama was elected.\n  These kinds of consensus nominees are normally taken up within a few \ndays or a week after being nominated and voted out of our Judiciary \nCommittee, whether nominated by a Democratic or a Republican President. \nIt was certainly the approach taken by Senate Democrats when President \nBush sent us consensus nominees. As a result, we were able to reduce \nvacancies in the Presidential election years of 2004 and 2008 to the \nlowest levels in decades. That was also how we confirmed 205 of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees in his first term.\n  For those who want to understand where the partisanship is, here is a \nlittle bit of history. For 31 months of the first 48 months of \nPresident Bush's first term, Republicans controlled the Senate, and for \n17 months, Democrats controlled the Senate. To show that we wanted to \nset aside partisanship, in our 17 months that we were in control, \nSenate Democrats helped confirm 100 of President Bush's nominees. In \nthe 31 months Republicans were in charge, they did 105, which was \nslightly more nominees. But the fact is, we actually moved a lot faster \non President Bush's nominees than the Republicans did.\n  I was chairman of the committee, and I tried to do that to get us \naway from what we had seen where Republicans had pocket-filibustered 60 \nof President Clinton's nominees. I wanted to get back to where we took \npolitics out of the Federal courts.\n  But we have seen now a complete reversal of this. Senate Republicans \nhave ensured that nominees who in the past would have been confirmed \npromptly by the Senate are now blocked for months. An unprecedented \nnumber of President Obama's highly qualified men and women to district \ncourts has been targeted for opposition and obstruction while extreme \noutside groups tar their records and reputations with invented \ncontroversies. It is unprecedented and it hurts our system of justice \nin this country.\n  Two weeks ago, at a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the \nSenator from Utah conceded that a ``new standard'' is being applied to \nPresident Obama's nominations. He was saying out loud what has been \napparent from the start of President Obama's term--that Republican \nSenators have applied a different and unfair standard to President \nObama's judicial nominees.\n  I was here with President Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, \nPresident George H.W. Bush, President Clinton, President George W. \nBush, and now President Obama. I can attest that Republicans have set a \ndifferent standard for President Obama than has been applied to any of \nthe other Presidents I have known since I have been here. I have to ask \nmyself, what is so different about this President that he is treated to \na different, tougher standard than any of the Presidents before him? I \njust ask. President Obama's district court nominees have been forced to \nwait more than four times as long to be confirmed by the Senate as \nPresident Bush's district court nominees at this point in his first \nterm, taking an average of 93 days after being voted on by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee.\n  When I hear Republican Senators claim there is no obstruction and \nthere is no reason for the majority leader to push for votes on these \nnominations, I wonder if they have looked at our recent history.\n  I spoke of President Bush's first term. Mr. President, 57 of his \ndistrict court nominations were confirmed within 1 week of being \nfavorably reported by the Judiciary Committee--1 week. In stark \ncontrast to those 57, only 2 of President Obama's district court \nnominations have been confirmed within 1 week of being reported--less \nthan one twenty fifth the number of President Bush's. More than half of \nthe nominations for which the leader has now filed cloture have been \npending since last year--many months, not days. This must be the new \nstandard the Senator from Utah has said Senate Republicans are using \nfor President Obama's nominations--a different standard than all the \nPresidents before him. I will at least praise the Senator from Utah for \nhis honesty.\n  Indeed, 10 of the nominations on which the Majority Leader has been \nrequired to file cloture in order to end the Republican filibuster and \nget a vote have been awaiting a vote since last year. Nine of them had \nthe support of every Republican as well as every Democratic Senator \nserving on the Judiciary Committee. They all should have been \nconsidered and confirmed last year.\n  I understand and share the Majority Leader's frustration. He has been \nunable to obtain the usual cooperation from the minority to schedule \ndebates and votes on these widely supported, consensus nominees. I \nregret that the Majority Leader has been forced to take this action but \nthe millions of Americans seeking justice in their courts should not be \nforced to wait any longer.\n\n  To understand how unusual and wrongheaded this is, consider the \nfollowing: Republicans are opposing judicial nominees they support. \nThey are stalling Senate action for weeks and months on judicial \nnominees who they do not oppose and who they vote to confirm once their \nfilibuster can be ended and the vote scheduled. That is what happened \nafter a four-month filibuster when the Senate finally voted on the \nnomination of Judge Barbara Keenan. That is what happened when after a \nfive-month filibuster, the Senate finally voted on the nomination of \nJudge Denny Chin. Once the Republican filibusters were ended, they were \nconfirmed unanimously. That is what happened after an eleven-month \ndelay before confirmation of Judge Albert Diaz of North Carolina. That \nis what happened after seven-month delays before confirmations of Judge \nKimberly Mueller of California, Judge Catherine Eagles of North \nCarolina, Judge John Gibney, Jr. of Virginia, and Judge Ray Lohier of \nNew York. That is what happened after six-month delays before the \nconfirmations of Judge James Bredar and Judge Ellen Hollander of \nMaryland; Judge Susan Nelson of Minnesota, Judge Scott Matheson of Utah \nand Judge James Wynn, Jr. of North Carolina. That is what happened \nafter five-month delays before confirmations of Judge Nannette Brown of \nLouisiana, Judge Nancy Torresen of Maine, Judge William Kuntz of New \nYork, and Judge Henry Floyd of South Carolina. This is what happened \nafter four-month delays before the confirmations of Judge Edmond Chang \nof Illinois, Judge Leslie Kobayashi of Hawaii, Judge Denise Casper of \nMassachusetts, Judge Carlton Reeves of Mississippi, Judge John Ross of \nMissouri, Judge Timothy Cain of South Carolina, Judge Marina Marmolejo \nof Texas, Judge Beverly Martin of Georgia, Judge Joseph Greenaway of \nNew Jersey, Judge Mary Murguia of Arizona, and Judge Chris Droney of \nConnecticut.\n  So, too, I expect the district court nominee to fill a judicial \nemergency vacancy in Utah, supported by Senator Hatch, will not be \ncontroversial once the vote takes place. The district court nominees to \nfill judicial emergency vacancies in Texas, supported by Senator \nHutchison and Senator Cornyn, should easily be confirmed. The nominees \nto judicial emergency vacancies in Illinois supported by Senator Kirk, \nshould not be controversial. The district court nominee in Louisiana \nsupported by Senator Vitter, should not be controversial. The district \ncourt nominee in Missouri supported by Senator Blunt, should not be \ncontroversial. The district court nominee in Arkansas supported by \nSenator Boozman, should not be controversial. The district court \nnominee in Massachusetts supported by Senator Brown, should not be \ncontroversial. The district court nominee\n\n[[Page S1588]]\n\nin South Carolina supported by Senator Graham, should not be \ncontroversial. The district court nominee in Ohio supported by Senator \nPortman, should not be controversial.\n  Senate Democrats never applied this standard to President Bush's \ndistrict court nominees, whether we were in the majority or the \nminority. During his eight years in office, President Bush saw only \nfive of his district court nominees have any opposition on the floor \nand that opposition had to do with doubts about those nominees' \nsuitability to be Federal judges. After only three years, 19 of \nPresident Obama's district court nominees have already received \nopposition. Even though President Obama has worked with Republican and \nDemocratic home state Senators to identify highly-qualified, consensus \nnominees, his district court nominees have already received more than \nfive times as many ``no'' votes in three years as President Bush's \ndistrict court nominees did in his eight years over his two terms. This \nis further proof of the Republicans' new standard.\n  I find that reprehensible. It means President Obama's nominees are \nbeing treated differently than any Presidents, Democratic or \nRepublican, before him. It is no accident that 1 out of every 10 \nFederal judgeships remains vacant in the fourth year of President \nObama's first term. It is not happenstance that judicial vacancies are \nnearly double what they were at this point in President Bush's first \nterm. The extended crisis in judicial vacancies is the result of \ndeliberate obstruction and delays by Senate Republicans.\n  A few years after Republican Senators insisted that filibusters of \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees were unconstitutional, they reversed \ncourse and filibustered President Obama's very first judicial \nnomination, that of Judge David Hamilton of Indiana, a widely-respected \n15-year veteran of the Federal bench who had the support of the most \nsenior and longest-serving Republican in the Senate, Senator Lugar. The \nSenate rejected that filibuster and Judge Hamilton was confirmed, but \nthe pattern of partisan obstruction of President Obama's judicial \nnominees was set from the very start.\n  That is wrong--that is wrong--and that is turning your back on a \nmajority of Americans who voted for President Obama in the last \nelection, Americans from all across the country, of all backgrounds, of \nall races, of all religions--to turn your back on them by saying: You \nmay have elected him, but we are going to hold him to a different \nstandard. It is wrong.\n  At the end of each of the last two years, the Senate Republican \nleadership continued this obstruction by ignoring long-established \nprecedent and refusing to agree to schedule votes on dozens of \nconsensus judicial nominees before the December recess. Last year it \ntook us until June to confirm nominees who should have been confirmed \nin 2010. This year we have had to end two more of the nine Republican \nfilibusters of President Obama's judicial nominations to confirm \nnominees who should have been confirmed the year before and fully a \ndozen judicial nominees from last year remain to be considered. And \nhere we are in the middle of March, having to fight to hold votes on 10 \ndistrict court nominees who should have been confirmed last year.\n  This obstruction is purposeful and it is damaging. The people who \nbear the brunt of this Republican obstruction are the American people. \nThe result of the Senate Republicans' obstruction is that the ability \nof our Federal courts to provide justice to Americans around the \ncountry is compromised. Millions of Americans, who are in overburdened \ndistricts and circuits, experience unnecessary delays in having their \ncases resolved. Nearly one hundred and sixty million Americans live in \ndistricts or circuits that have a judicial vacancy that could be filled \ntoday if Senate Republicans would just agree to vote on the nominations \nnow pending on the Senate calendar. It is wrong to delay votes on \nqualified, consensus judicial nominees.\n\n  Our courts need qualified Federal judges, not vacancies, if they are \nto reduce the excessive wait times that burden litigants seeking their \nday in court. It is unacceptable for hardworking Americans who turn to \ntheir courts for justice to suffer unnecessary delays. When an injured \nplaintiff sues to help cover the cost of his or her medical expenses, \nthat plaintiff should not have to wait three years before a judge hears \nthe case. When two small business owners disagree over a contract, they \nshould not have to wait years for a court to resolve their dispute.\n  When Senate Democrats opposed some of President Bush's most \nideological nominees, we did so openly, saying why we opposed them. At \nthe same time, we continued to move consensus nominees quickly so they \ncould begin serving the American people. That is what I did as Chairman \nfor 17 months during the first two years of the Bush administration and \nhow we were able to lower judicial vacancies by confirming 100 of his \ncircuit and district court nominees. That is how we reduced vacancies \nin the presidential election years of 2004 and 2008 to the lowest \nlevels in decades, half of what they are now. That is how we had \nalready confirmed 172 of President Bush's circuit and district nominees \nby this point in his first term, as compared to only 131 of President \nObama's and being 40 confirmations and nine months behind the pace we \nset then. We did so because we put the needs of the American people \nbefore partisanship and obstruction.\n  We had another discussion of these matters in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee two weeks ago. Senator Coburn said that this is ``exactly \nwhat makes Americans sick of what we are doing.'' I agree. I have been \nsaying for some time that this needless obstruction is what has driven \napproval ratings of Congress down to single digits. The Senator from \nOklahoma observed that it would behoove us all to get back to the days \nwhen these lower court judicial nominations were not areas of partisan \nconflict. I agree. I have tried to do my part in that regard by \ntreating Republican Senators fairly and protecting their rights. \nPresident Obama has done his part by consulting with Republican home \nstate Senators and selecting moderate, well-qualified nominees. It is \ntime for Senate Republicans to do their part and not abuse their rights \nunder our Senate rules and procedures. It is time for them to end the \npartisan stalling. It is time for Senate Republicans to agree to \nschedule votes on these long-delayed and much-needed judges.\n  Once we have overcome these unprecedented filibusters of President \nObama's district court nominations, I hope that it will not take more \ndelays and more cloture petitions to end the filibusters against the \nfive outstanding nominees by President Obama to fill vacancies on our \nFederal circuit courts. Two delayed from last year are outstanding \nwomen: Stephanie Dawn Thacker of West Virginia, nominated to the Fourth \nCircuit, and Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of California, nominated to fill \none of the many judicial emergency vacancies on the Ninth Circuit. Ms. \nThacker, an experienced litigator and prosecutor, has the strong \nsupport of her home state Senators, Senators Rockefeller and Manchin. \nJudge Nguyen, whose family fled to the United States in 1975 after the \nfall of South Vietnam, was confirmed unanimously to the district court \nin 2009 and would become the first Asian Pacific American woman to \nserve on a U.S. Court of Appeals. Last week, The Sacramento Bee ran an \neditorial about Judge Nguyen's nomination that noted that ``for those \nof us in the real world particularly those seeking justice in the \nfederal courts--it would be far, far better if these qualified jurists \ncould get to work.'' I will ask unanimous consent that the article be \nprinted in the Record. Both Ms. Thacker and Judge Nguyen were reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee last year and both should be \nconsidered and confirmed by the Senate without additional damaging \ndelays.\n  I hope Republicans and Democrats can join together to put an end to \nthis damaging pattern of obstruction and filibusters. It hurts our \nFederal courts. It is a disrespect to the President of the United \nStates. It goes way beyond partisanship. But it is wrong, and it \ndemeans this great body we are all privileged to serve in. This is the \nsort of thing I never thought I would see in the Senate of the United \nStates. I say that based on 37 years of experience with Senators I have \nadmired and have publicly stated I have admired in both\n\n[[Page S1589]]\n\nparties. This is wrong. Let's go back and let the Senate be the \nconscience of the Nation, not a body that reflects some of the worst \ninstincts of our Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I refereed be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sacramento Bee, Mar. 6, 2012]\n\n                 Justice Delayed as Judge Nominees Wait\n\n       Republicans in the U.S. Senate are once again using \n     President Barack Obama's judicial nominations as pawns in \n     their political chess match.\n       There's even loose talk of putting off votes as long as \n     possible, in hopes that Obama loses in November and the seats \n     can be filled by a Republican president.\n       That's absurd.\n       There are too many vacancies on federal courts in \n     California and other states, where there aren't enough judges \n     to handle the caseloads. Too often, justice delayed really is \n     justice denied.\n       Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada is apparently so fed \n     up that he's willing to go to war to get confirmation votes \n     on the Senate floor, Politico reports.\n       Good for him. The Republicans deserve to be called out on \n     their obstructionism--and their hypocrisy, since they often \n     complain about how slow the federal courts are.\n       The focus is on 14 qualified nominees who won bipartisan \n     support in the Senate Judiciary Committee, including two from \n     California who were unanimously approved but have been on \n     hold for months.\n       One is Jacqueline Nguyen of Los Angeles, who was nominated \n     by Obama last September for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals and endorsed by the judiciary panel on Dec. 1. The \n     first Vietnamese-American woman to serve as a federal judge, \n     she was 10 when her family fled Vietnam at the end of the \n     war. They started as refugees in Camp Pendleton and made \n     their own version of the American Dream.\n       The second is Michael Fitzgerald, who was nominated last \n     July for a judgeship in the Central District of California \n     and received committee approval on Nov. 3. A Los Angeles \n     attorney and former federal prosecutor, he would become the \n     first openly gay federal judge in the state and the fourth \n     nationwide.\n       Both those courts are in an official ``judicial emergency'' \n     because cases are so backed up.\n       There are two more recent nominations for 9th Circuit seats \n     that have gone through the Judiciary Committee. Paul Watford, \n     a Los Angeles attorney and former prosecutor, was approved on \n     a 10 6 vote on Feb. 2. Andrew Hurwitz, an Arizona Supreme \n     Court justice, was approved on a 13 5 vote Thursday.\n       The San Francisco-based 9th Circuit is a particular target \n     for Republicans, who like to rail against what they call its \n     liberal, activist bent. Their delaying tactics succeeded in \n     forcing Goodwin Liu, a highly regarded UC Berkeley law \n     professor who grew up in Sacramento, to withdraw his \n     nomination last July. (Gov. Jerry Brown then nominated him to \n     the California Supreme Court, where Liu now serves.)\n       It must be said that there are also political advantages \n     for Obama if the delays continue. It would give him more \n     ammunition to campaign against a ``do-nothing Congress.'' \n     Given the ways of Washington, that may be the most likely \n     scenario.\n       But for those of us in the real world--particularly those \n     seeking justice in the federal courts--it would be far, far \n     better if these qualified jurists could get to work.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Then we have a series \nof votes on amendments, beginning at about noon. So at 11:30 or so, we \nwill be back on the bill.\n  I want to say to my friends on the other side of the aisle and to my \nfriends on this side of the aisle that we are making great progress. \nThis is a jobs bill. This is a major jobs bill. This is the biggest \njobs bill.\n  They passed an IPO bill over there in the House. Eric Cantor is \nsaying it is a jobs bill. I do not know how many jobs it will create. \nIt is an investor bill. It is good; I am for it. But it does not come \nanywhere close to the bill we are working on today. Because on March \n31, if we do not act on this transportation bill, everything will come \nto a screeching halt, if I might use that analogy. Because there will \nnot be a gas tax anymore going into the Federal highway trust fund, \nthere will not be any funds going from the Federal Government to the \nvarious planning organizations in all of our States and communities.\n  All of us know that since the days of President Eisenhower we have \nhad a national system for roads, bridges, highways, and so on. So we \nhave a lot of work to do here. I want to say, we are very close to the \nday when everything will stop. So I think we are making great progress.\n  I know the majority leader and the minority leader talked about \nfinishing this bill today. That means a lot of cooperation because we \nhave to get through about 20 amendments plus a managers' package. I \nthink we can do it. I know we can do it.\n  Then, frankly, we can actually go home and tell our people we voted \non a huge jobs bill. How huge? We are going to protect 1.8 million \njobs, and a lot of construction jobs. I have often told people that the \nunemployment rate among construction workers is way higher than the \ngeneral population. Our unemployment rate is about 8.3 percent. We have \na 15-, 16-, 17-percent unemployment rate among construction workers.\n  And God bless this President. He has worked so hard on making sure we \nhave set the table for job growth. We have had terrific job growth, but \neven with those 200,000-plus jobs created last month, construction jobs \nactually went down.\n  So we are looking at an industry that is in a great deal of trouble. \nIt is because of the housing market. It is still not stabilized. Until \nwe solve our housing crisis--and, again, the administration and the \nCongress are trying to do everything to allow people to stay in their \nhomes so we don't keep having defaults, houses on the market, short \nsales, and all the rest. Once that is behind us, we will see a whole \nnew day for construction. But that day isn't here.\n  It would be a dereliction of our duty if we fail to pass this bill \nbecause we will save 1.8 million jobs. That is how many people are \nworking as a result of our ongoing transportation action. We have to \nsave that. Then because of some very good work done in my home State, \nparticularly in Los Angeles, we have come up with a new way to create \nan additional 1 million jobs by leveraging a program called the TIFIA \nProgram, transportation infrastructure financing. It means as our State \nand our local areas pass, say, a sales tax to build transit or roads or \nhighways, we, the Federal Government, can front that money at virtually \nzero risk and leverage these funds threefold.\n  In this bill we would be protecting 1.8 million jobs and creating up \nto 1 million new jobs because of the TIFIA Program. I want to say this \nbill is a bipartisan effort--hugely bipartisan.\n  I just talked to Senator Inhofe late last evening. We talked about \nthe fact that we don't want to have it held up anymore. We want to move \nit through, and we are going to move it through. We are very pleased.\n  Anyone who follows politics knows Senator Inhofe is one of the most \nconservative Members of the Senate, and I am one of the most liberal \nMembers of\n\n[[Page S1590]]\n\nthe Senate. We are both very proud of who we are and comfortable with \nwho we are. We know when it comes to some things we don't see eye to \neye. There will be many more opportunities to see how we disagree on \nissues, such as clean air, clean water, safe drinking water, superfund, \nclimate change, and all that. But we are on the highway bill. We hope \nthis will become a template for us in the Senate and the House to find \na sweet spot where we can work together. We are right there. A little \nbit more work and we know we have done our jobs. It could come today--I \nhope it will come today--but it will come late today because there are \nmany amendments to get through.\n  I want to make my last comment about what is happening in the House. \nThe House passed an IPO bill, initial public offering. I support that \napproach. I think it would be a great way to get more capital into the \nhands of businesses and enable them to hire people. It is a good bill. \nWe are going to work on it. But the House has done nothing about the \nTransportation bill. Speaker Boehner has tried. He has had many efforts \nto bring people to the table. But the trouble is he has only brought to \nthe table one political party. We have to work together. Senator Inhofe \nand I could never have gotten this bill to where it is if we stood in \nour corners and concentrated on the areas where we had disagreement. \nThere were plenty of those, but we set those aside.\n  I say to the Members of the House, there is a secret to success, \nwhich is taking your hand and reaching it across the aisle and finding \ncommon ground with your colleagues. If you lose a bunch of Republicans \nand Democrats, you still have enough to get a bill through.\n  Our bill, though not perfect, does what we have to do. We protect 1.8 \nmillion jobs, mostly in construction. We create up to 1 million jobs. \nWe took a bill that had 90 different programs and brought it down to 30 \nprograms. We have a managers' package of very bipartisan issues that we \nhave resolved.\n  I will probably be back on the floor within an hour to debate the two \namendments that will be pending, the Bingaman amendment and the DeMint \namendment. I will speak out on those amendments.\n  I thank the occupant of the chair for his support. He has been a real \ngood friend and has helped us move this bill forward. I know this bill \nis important to his home State of Delaware, as it is important to \nTennessee and to California. I have a list of jobs by State that we \nwould lose if we fail to act. That is the bad news. The good news is we \nare going to act. I will be back in short order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, is it appropriate for me to speak as in \nmorning business for a few minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/13/senate-section/article/S1590-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1590-S1591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to the \nSenator from California. I thank her for her hard work on the \nTransportation bill and her work with Senator Inhofe. I listened \nespecially to her comments that it would be good for us to work well \ntogether. It reminds me of our new Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives in Tennessee, Beth Harwell. She does a pretty good job, \nand she often reminds her colleagues in the Tennessee Legislature that \nthe first lesson they all learned in kindergarten is to work well \ntogether. That is a good lesson for us as well.\n  I will take 4 or 5 minutes to simply talk about a development I think \ninterferes with that. I came to the Senate floor with a group of \nRepublicans and Democrats not long ago. We praised the majority leader, \nSenator Reid, and the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, for their \nworking together to try to bring the appropriations bills to the floor. \nWe said we are going to work together to help them do that because a \nmajority leader cannot lead if we don't follow. We complimented them \nfor the work on the Transportation bill, which hasn't been easy, but we \nare having a lot of votes today. We will offer our ideas and make \nvotes.\n  It was disappointing to me yesterday to see the majority leader \nannounce that he had filed 17 cloture motions on district judges. I am \nhere simply as one Senator to say respectfully to the majority leader \nthat I hope he will reconsider and not do that. That is an \nunprecedented action. It has never happened like that before. In the \nhistory of the Senate, before 2011, a majority leader had filed cloture \nmotions on district judges only three times.\n  What has happened with district judges in the history of the Senate? \nThey come up, get a vote, and there has never been a successful \nfilibuster of a district judge because of a cloture vote. Let me \nemphasize that. There has never been a successful attempt to deny an \nup-or-down vote to a district judge by opposing cloture in the history \nof the Senate.\n  That was proven again last year with a judge from Rhode Island, Judge \nMcConnell, who many believed should not be a judge. There were enough \nRepublicans did not take the opportunity to deny an up-or-down vote \nthat he was confirmed even though many on this side didn't think he \nought to be a judge. So we don't have a problem with filibustering \ndistrict judges, and we have never had one with filibusters of district \njudges, at least given the present composition of the Senate.\n  What is the issue? Senator Reid, the majority leader, said quite \nproperly in his remarks yesterday that we have important work to do. We \nhave a jobs bill coming from the House, a Postal Service that is in \ndebt, and we have cybersecurity--we are having long briefings on that \nbecause of the threat.\n  The leaders are working to bring the appropriations bills to the \nfloor. We have only done that twice since 2000--all 12 of them. So this \nis a little disagreement we have between the majority leader and the \nRepublican leader on the scheduling of votes on district judges. It is \nnot a high constitutional matter. It is not even a high principle. It \nis not even a big disagreement. It is a little one. What has always \nhappened is in the back and forth of scheduling, and they work it out. \nThey have been working it out.\n\n  In the first 2 years of the Obama administration, he nominated 78 \ndistrict judges, and 76 of those were confirmed--76 of 78 nominated in \nthe first 2 years. He withdrew two. Last year, 61 more district judges \nwere confirmed. What about 2012? The President has made a few \nnominations, but they haven't been considered yet by the Judiciary \nCommittee. We do have 17 district court judgeships reported by the \nJudiciary Committee. They could be brought up by the majority leader. \nHe has the right to do that. But of those 17, 6 of them have been \nreported by the Judiciary Committee for less than 30 days. They just \ngot here. That leaves 11. How long have they been there? They came in \nOctober, November, and December of last year. Normally, they would have \nbeen included in the year-end clearing.\n  Everybody knows what happened. The year-end clearing was thrown off \ntrack because the President threatened to make controversial recess \nappointments. Ultimately, the President decided to violate the Reid \nrule, which used pro-forma sessions every three days to break the \nSenate's recesses and block recess appointments. That was invented by \nthe majority leader, Senator Reid. President Bush didn't like it, but \nhe respected it. President Obama violated it, and it blew up the year-\nend clearing of a number of nominees, including district judges.\n  We have some district judges waiting to be confirmed, but we don't \nhave many. We have a history of confirming 76 out of 78 nominated \nduring the first 2 years of this President, and last year, confirming \n61. This year, of the 17 the majority leader filed the cloture motions \non, 6 of them just got here. So that leaves 11. What do we do about \nthat?\n  The right thing to do is that the majority leader and the Republican \nleader should listen to what the Senator from California just said, \nlisten to the Speaker of the House from Tennessee; that is, work well \ntogether rather than escalating this into a highly principled, big \ndisagreement, and retire to one of their offices and sit down quietly, \ntake a timeout and work this out. That is the way it has always been \ndone.\n  We are only talking about 11 judges. They have not been around that \nlong--\n\n[[Page S1591]]\n\nless than 5 months. We all know why they were delayed a little bit. The \nPresident can take just as much responsibility as anybody. In testimony \nthis week, the Attorney General acknowledged the issue of the recess \nappointments made on January 4 is a serious constitutional issue that \nneeds to be decided by the courts. While that is being done, we have \nnot tried to stop the action of the Senate, even though we regard it as \na great offense to the checks and balances and the separation of \npowers.\n  I respectfully suggest it is not a good time for the majority leader \nto take a small disagreement and escalate it into a big one, \njeopardizing our ability to deal with big issues on jobs, \ncybersecurity, the Postal Service, and others. It would not reflect \nwell on the 23 candidates running for the Democratic Senate seats this \nyear or on the 11 Republicans running for Senate seats this year, and \nit would not reflect well on the President.\n  The American people want to see us get results. Why should we give \nthem one more reason to suspect that just because we can't agree on \nlittle issues, we are unable to agree on the big issues? I know the job \nof the majority leader is a tough job, and there is a good deal of back \nand forth every day. The majority leader has been on both sides of this \nissue. I suspect if he and the Republican leader were to sit down and \nlook over the actual numbers and realize it is just 11 judges--we \nconfirmed 2 last week--they could schedule the others and we could \nspend our time, starting tomorrow, not picking a fight with one another \non the small disagreements, but on jobs, debt, the Postal Service, \ncybersecurity, and the big issues the American people would like us to \ndeal with.\n  I ask unanimous consent that some documentation about the progress of \ndistrict judge nominations of the 111th and 112th Congress be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n The Progress of District Court Nominations Submitted to the Senate in \n                     the 111th and 112th Congresses\n\n\n                             111th Congress\n\n       Of the 78 District Court Nominees made by President Obama \n     during 2009 and 2010, 76 were eventually confirmed.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor to talk about \nan amendment I will offer later today--the NAT GAS Act.\n  What if I were to tell the Chair there was a transportation fuel that \nis over $1.50 cheaper than gasoline and roughly $2 cheaper than diesel? \nWhat if I were to tell the Chair this fuel is also cleaner and has \nfewer smog-causing pollutants than diesel and, if wisely used, could \nreduce the cases of asthma and lung cancer?\n  What if I were to tell the Chair this fuel is abundant right here in \nAmerica, so much so that we may soon become one of the world's largest \nexporters of this fuel? I think I might hear him say: Sign me up. What \nis the name of this wonderful fuel? The name of this fuel is natural \ngas.\n  We can see in this chart that as gasoline prices are already \nskyrocketing toward $4 per gallon, the price of compressed natural gas \nis barely above $2 equivalent. Natural gas prices used to follow oil \nprices, but now they are on their own stable, inexpensive price levels. \nThe same holds true for liquefied natural gas. As we can see, gas \nprices here, liquefied natural gas down here. Diesel prices now exceed \n$4, and LNG is still hovering around a $2 equivalent\n  Why aren't we all driving around in natural gas vehicles, paying a \nlittle over $2 per gallon equivalent? The reason this inexpensive fuel \nis not widely used is because there are not many natural gas vehicles \nin the United States, and there are also very few places to refuel. \nCurrently, there are nearly 14 million natural gas vehicles in the \nworld but only about 117,000 in the United States. The car and truck \nmanufacturers want to see that the natural gas utilities will invest in \nrefueling infrastructure, and the natural gas utilities want to see \nmore natural gas vehicles on the road. It is a classic chicken-or-the-\negg problem.\n  What both the manufacturers and the utilities need to see is a strong \nstance by the Federal Government to jump-start this market.\n  The NAT GAS Act will do that by jump-starting the industry and, in 10 \nyears, add over 700,000 natural gas vehicles to our roads and help \nincentivize the installation of refueling stations around the Nation. \nIn addition, it is estimated the bill will displace over 20 billion \ngallons of petroleum fuel and create over 1 million direct and indirect \njobs.\n  I know what some of my colleagues are thinking: Isn't this just \nanother handout to energy companies? The answer to that question is a \nresounding no. This legislation is fully paid for with a small fee on \nnatural gas used as a vehicle fuel. As I mentioned earlier, natural gas \nis over $1.50 cheaper than gasoline or diesel. This amendment would use \nsome of those savings to help overcome the market barriers for natural \ngas vehicles and supporting infrastructure. The fee starts at 2.5 cents \nper gallon equivalent in 2014 and grows to be 12.5 cents in 2020 and \n2021. In 2022, the fee is eliminated. In this way, we can still keep \nnatural gas less expensive than other fuel options, while investing in \ninfrastructure to help grow the market, make natural gas vehicles \ncheaper, and put the industry on a path to flourish on its own.\n  While the legislation itself is designed to provide a temporary \nboost, it is important to note that the natural gas supplies we are \nsitting on are enormous. North America's natural gas resource \ndiscoveries have more than doubled over the past 4 years, meaning that \nat the current rate of consumption, this resource could supply current \nconsumption for over 100 years. If we do not use our natural gas here \nin America, it will be exported abroad, benefiting consumers in other \ncountries, while American families will continue to pay higher prices \nat the pump. Already, one U.S. facility has received a permit to export \nnatural gas and four more are following suit. We can use that natural \ngas in the United States to displace oil. We are sending trillions of \ndollars abroad to countries that are despotic and wish us ill or we can \nexport it so other countries can gain the benefits. I say we use it \nhere.\n  The NAT GAS Act will also increase our Nation's energy independence \nand make us less dependent on regimes that do not have America's \ninterests at heart. This is especially important at a time when Iran is \nattempting to develop a nuclear weapon and is threatening to block oil \nsupplies. Natural gas is not the only solution, but it can be an \nimportant part of a solution that will allow us to ignore future OPEC \nthreats because we have alternatives to\n\n[[Page S1592]]\n\noil. But until we get to that point, we need to do all we can to \nsupplant oil.\n  It is also important to note that natural gas vehicles are an \nimportant way to improve air quality. According to the EPA, natural gas \nas a vehicle fuel has very low emissions of ozone-forming hydrocarbons, \ntoxins, and carbon monoxide. By producing less of these harmful \nemissions, natural gas vehicles can reduce smog in our cities and lower \nincidents of asthma and lung cancer. These health benefits are one \nreason why Los Angeles County has made almost its entire fleet of 2,200 \nbuses run on compressed natural gas.\n  Let me talk about one issue some are concerned about. While natural \ngas vehicles can have important environmental and health benefits, we \nmust also keep in mind that natural gas is still a fossil fuel and \nthere are serious risks that need to be weighed when it is extracted. \nFor that reason, I think we need to do better to regulate a practice \ncalled fracking. I also believe these risks mean that certain \nenvironmentally sensitive areas remain off-limits for fracking, and I \nwill continue to work with my colleagues, such as Senator Casey, to \nbetter formulate Federal rules to protect our drinking water from \npossible contamination. At the same time, we should not kid ourselves. \nThis amendment will not cause natural gas vehicles to be the main \ndriver of natural gas demand, and fracking is used to extract oil as \nwell. So voting against this amendment will not reduce the amount of \nfracking.\n  We cannot let this opportunity to use this cheaper fuel to increase \nour energy security, improve our air quality, and relieve the pain at \nthe pump slip by. It is time to put in place the temporary, fully paid \nfor incentives of the NAT GAS Act to allow the natural gas vehicle \nindustry to flourish. Remember, if one votes against this amendment, \nthey cannot go home and tell their constituents that they have done \neverything they can to reduce gas prices.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us when the time comes to offer the \namendment on the floor and to support it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to speak for a moment about an \nimportant issue that is going to be addressed on the highway bill. I \nhave an amendment that would basically say you cannot toll a Federal \nhighway unless it is for the production of another free lane. This is \nan effort to curb a State from tolling every lane of a highway that has \nbeen built with Federal dollars by Federal taxpayers.\n  When President Eisenhower established the National Highway System, it \nwas on behalf of national security that he made this monumental policy \ndecision which has taken us years, tens of years to complete. It has \nhad the added advantage of commerce--having a National Highway System \nwhere all of our States are connected with good quality Federal \nhighways has been a huge boon for our country. That has been funded \nthrough highway user fees. The gasoline tax that everyone pays at the \npump in our country has funded our Federal highway system.\n  However, the Federal highway system has now been completed. For a \nState to come in and toll every lane of an existing Federal highway is \nnot only disingenuous, but it breaks faith with the Federal taxpayers \nwho, for over 50 years, have paid into the highway trust fund so we \nwould have a Federal highway system for all Americans and for the \ncommerce among our States for them to use. Now, we have three States \nthat have been approved by the Department of Transportation to do \nexactly what I wish to prohibit--toll lanes of an existing Federal \nhighway. That would prohibit the free use of that whole highway that \nhas been built with Federal dollars. My amendment would keep us from \ngoing beyond the three. The amendment is two. I would extend it to \nthree because there are three that the Department of Transportation has \napproved, but I want to stop this practice from going further. It is \nwrong for the Federal Government to allow it, it is wrong for the \nStates to ask for it. Instead, we need to allow the opposite, the opt-\nout ability for a State to say we want to spend our highway dollars on \nour priorities. That is what we ought to be doing.\n  I do not disagree with tolls that are going to create a new free \nlane. That would keep the faith with the people. It would expand the \nsystem and the people would be paying to expand the system. That can be \ndone in an effective and, frankly, a responsible way. On the issue of \nallowing States to opt-out--Senator Portman has put in an amendment \nthat I would support, except that he goes a little bit too far. Senator \nPortman and Senator Coburn have amendments that would allow an opt-out \nfrom the whole Federal highway fund, which includes transit. I think \nthat goes too far.\n  I have a bill that would allow the opt-out of States that would be \nable to spend their highway funds the way they believe their priorities \nare set, but the 20 percent of the highway trust fund that goes for \ntransit I think should be kept for the urban areas that need that kind \nof bus transportation, as well as intra-city and commuter rail. I think \nwe ought to be able to keep that at the Federal level to determine what \nare the worthy grants. That is what the highway trust fund now does.\n  The Portman amendment would take that away and put it into the State \nhighway department. That sounds good on the surface, but highway \ndepartments have, in general--certainly I can speak from the experience \nof my State--not focused on or prioritized mass transit. This is one of \nthe reasons why our cities in Texas are clogged--and in Houston and \nDallas and San Antonio and Austin it is getting worse.\n  I wish to see those cities be assured that transit funding would go \nforward as it is envisioned or I would be happy to amend my bill to say \nthe 20 percent of transit funding could be opted out but it would have \nto go for transit funding in the States and the States could then set \nthe priorities. But transit should not be shortchanged by the highway \ndepartments that have not prioritized mass transit.\n  I think we need to work a little more. I could not support the \nPortman amendment the way it is written, but I want to gather the \npeople who believe that we should have an opt-out of our highway funds \nand get a stronger mass--which I think Senator Coburn and Senator \nPortman would do, if they would take the transit out of their \namendment.\n  I think we have some work to do. I wish to support the Portman \namendment but not in the form it is at present. I hope down the road \nother States will want to be able to opt out as well. But for now, I \nhope we will be able to stop the tolling of our Federal highways as a \nfirst step to keep faith with the American taxpayers who, for 50 years, \nhave built the Federal highway system and deserve to be able to drive \nto any State on a Federal highway without being shut out by States that \ndecide to put a toll on it for their own purposes. These are Federal \nhighways built with Federal tax dollars and they should be open to \nevery taxpayer in America to use those freeways for commerce. I hope my \namendment will be considered.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Amendment 1759\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I believe the second amendment that we \nwill be voting on here right after lunch or right after noon is the \namendment that Senator Durbin and I are proposing related to privatized \ntoll roads. When a State privatizes an existing toll road, it shifts to \na private company all responsibility for operations and maintenance in \nexchange for a cash payment, essentially. Under existing law, \nprivatized toll roads are still included in the calculation of how much \neach State receives in Federal highway funds.\n  In my view, it does not make good sense for a State to be credited \nwith Federal highway funding needed to maintain that road once it has \nbeen shifted out of the public sphere to a private entity and the \nprivate entity has taken on the legal responsibility to operate and \nmaintain the road. The amendment would simply remove these privatized \ntoll roads from consideration when we allocate highway funds.\n  The amendment is very narrow. It applies only when a State sells off \nan existing toll road. It does not apply at all to any new \nconstruction. When I say it sells off an existing toll road, I mean \nthat it enters into a lease--in most cases a lease of 75 years or \nmore--with a private entity to operate a toll road and collect the \ntolls and maintain the road.\n  The amendment has the support of the American Automobile Association \nand the American Trucking Association. I think it is good legislation. \nIt also has the support of the Owner-Operators Independent Drivers \nAssociation and American Highway Users Alliance. This is a modest \nchange in the law governing the allocation of Federal funds for \nhighways, but I think it is a commonsense proposal that should be \nsupported by the Members of the Senate.\n  I hope very much we can adopt this amendment when it comes to a vote. \nAs I say, it is not the first amendment that we are going to consider \nfor this bill; it is the second of the two votes prior to the recess \nfor the weekly caucuses.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up the amendment I \nhave just been speaking about, amendment No. 1759, and ask that the \nclerk report the amendment by number.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1759.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To remove privatized highways from consideration in \n               apportioning highway funding among States)\n\n       On page 51, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       ``(C) Further adjustment for privatized highways.--\n       ``(i) Definition of privatized highway.--In this \n     subparagraph:\n\n       ``(I) In general.--The term `privatized highway' means a \n     highway that was formerly a publically operated toll road \n     that is subject to an agreement giving a private entity--\n\n       ``(aa) control over the operation of the highway; and\n       ``(bb) ownership over the toll revenues collected from the \n     operation of the highway.\n\n       ``(II) Exclusion.--The term `privatized highway' does not \n     include any highway or toll road that was originally--\n\n       ``(aa) financed and constructed using private funds; and\n       ``(bb) operated by a private entity.\n       ``(ii) Adjustment.--After making the adjustments to the \n     apportionment of a State under subparagraphs (A) and (B), the \n     Secretary shall further adjust the amount to be apportioned \n     to the State by reducing the apportionment by an amount equal \n     to the product obtained by multiplying--\n\n       ``(I) the amount to be apportioned to the State, as so \n     adjusted under those subparagraphs; and\n       ``(II) the percentage described in clause (iii).\n\n       ``(iii) Percentage.--The percentage referred to in clause \n     (ii) is the percentage equal to the sum obtained by adding--\n\n       ``(I) the product obtained by multiplying--\n\n       ``(aa) \\1/2\\; and\n       ``(bb) the proportion that--\n       ``(AA) the total number of lane miles on privatized highway \n     lanes on National Highway System routes in a State; bears to\n       ``(BB) the total number of all lane miles on National \n     Highway System routes in the State; and\n\n       ``(II) the product obtained by multiplying--\n\n       ``(aa) \\1/2\\; and\n       ``(bb) the proportion that--\n       ``(AA) the total number of vehicle miles traveled on \n     privatized highway lanes on National Highway System routes in \n     the State; bears to\n       ``(BB) the total number of vehicle miles traveled on all \n     lanes on National Highway System routes in the State.\n       ``(iv) Reapportionment.--An amount withheld from \n     apportionment to a State under clause (ii) shall be \n     reapportioned among all other States based on the proportions \n     calculated under subparagraph (A).\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senate will vote today on the Bingaman-Durbin \namendment to the Transportation bill. This amendment will help protect \ntaxpayers when local governments sell or lease public roads and \nbridges.\n  The Federal Government provides States and local governments billions \nof dollars to build, maintain, and improve transportation projects \nacross the country. Federal funding has helped build and maintain roads \nwhen local and State governments couldn't afford construction or upkeep \non their own. Federal taxpayers have picked up the tab for millions of \ntransportation projects across the country.\n  The Senate Transportation bill provides States with an average of $40 \nbillion per year to help them upgrade their roads and bridges. These \nFederal investments have created thousands of jobs and helped our \neconomy. But the temptation to cash in on these projects is great, \nparticularly as States and cities are looking under every rock to find \nnew sources of revenue. Some local governments and States are \ninterested in selling or leasing their highways.\n  Private hedge funds, banks and investment groups offer States and \nlocal governments large, lump sum payments in exchange for the complete \ncontrol of critical transportation assets. Local governments receive \nmassive, upfront payments to help them fund other local priorities. The \nprivate financiers get complete control of a highway for decades--\nsometimes for as long as 99 years. Sometimes those private entities are \nable to provide responsible upkeep of the asset over the\n\n[[Page S1594]]\n\nlong run. But too often, the services are reduced, prices go up, and \nmaintenance isn't all it should be. The Federal taxpayer is left \nholding the bag.\n  Privatization deals like this set up a turn-key operation where the \nFederal taxpayer pays for critical infrastructure improvements, only to \nhave local governments turn around and sell or lease this \ninfrastructure for a one-time payment they keep themselves. All levels \nof governments are facing serious budget shortfalls. The Federal \nGovernment shouldn't incentivize local and State governments to make \nrash, short-term decisions that lease transportation projects for \ngenerations just to solve temporary budget shortfalls.\n  The Bingaman-Durbin amendment will ensure taxpayers are not paying \nStates twice for highways that are sold or leased to private operators. \nHighway funding has historically been distributed through complex \nformulas that include the number of lane miles of major roads in each \nState and the amount of traffic on those roads.\n  The FHWA formulas are meant to help States pay for the maintenance \nand upkeep of those roads. However, when States sell or lease their \nhighways, they are paid massive lump sums in exchange for transferring \nresponsibility for maintenance to the private operators. But the road \nmiles and traffic counts on the privatized highway still contribute to \neach State's formula funding.\n  The current highway formulas do not take into account how many roads \nare privatized in each State so the Federal Government continues to pay \nStates for maintaining roads they have handed off to private operators. \nIt doesn't make sense for States to be credited with and given Federal \nhighway funding for privatized toll roads, which it no longer operates \nor maintains. The private operators of leased roads also get a generous \ntax benefit from depreciating the road as an asset.\n  The CBO has found this depreciation reduces Federal revenues and has \na negative impact on our deficit. These deals set up a double whammy \nfor the taxpayer--the private operator gets generous tax benefits and \nthe State continues to receive Federal funding for roads they no longer \nmaintain. Taxpayers are literally paying for privatized roads twice by \nsubsidizing tax breaks for private operators who buy public roads and \ncontinuing to pay the States for upkeep on roads they are no longer \nresponsible for.\n  The Bingaman-Durbin amendment will end this practice by removing \nfactors associated with privatized roads from the formulas used to \ncalculate a State's annual highway funding amount. Three States, \nincluding Illinois, have privatized some of their highways in exchange \nfor a lump sum payment. In 2006, the city of Chicago leased the 7.8 \nmile Chicago Skyway for 99 years in exchange for a lump sum payment of \n$1.8 billion.\n  The private operator has since raised the tolls on the Skyway and has \ntaken over sole responsibility for maintenance of the roadway. However, \nthose 7.8 miles are still included in the formula calculations that add \nto a State's share of Federal highway funds. Illinois continues to \nreceive roughly $1.2 million each year because the Chicago Skyway is \nstill included in the Federal highway formulas. Motorists are also \npaying more to use the road. Under public control, the tolls for the \nskyway decreased by about 25 percent when adjusted for inflation \nbetween 1989 and 2004. But Chicago Skyway tolls have risen 60 percent \nsince the road was privatized in 2005.\n  The Bingaman-Durbin amendment will stop paying States to maintain \nroads they have been paid to no longer maintain. The amendment will \ntake those funds and distribute them to other States to help pay for \nthe maintenance of public roads and bridges across the country.\n  In 2006, I requested a GAO study of highway public-private \npartnerships along with Senator Inhofe and Representative Peter \nDeFazio. The GAO study found ``there is no `free' money in public-\nprivate partnerships, and it is likely that tolls on a privately \noperated highway will increase to a greater extent than they would on a \npublicly operated toll road.'' The GAO called for Congress to require \nmore upfront analysis of these privatization deals to ensure they \nprotect the public interest.\n  I introduced legislation earlier this year that would provide for a \nrigorous examination of privatization deals of all transportation \nassets--highways, airports, bridges and mass transit systems. The \nProtecting Taxpayers in Transportation Asset Transfers Act would ensure \nthe Federal taxpayer has a seat at the table when State and local \ngovernments sell publicly owned transportation assets.\n  This amendment does not go far enough to protect the public interest \nin transportation privatization deals, but it does take away an \nunnecessary incentive for States and local governments to sell publicly \nfunded roads and highways. This amendment will not stop States from \nprivatizing roads, but it will stop the Federal taxpayer from paying \ntwice for privatized roads.\n  The amendment is supported by AAA, the American Trucking Association, \nthe American Highway Users Alliance, the American Federation of State, \nCounty and Municipal Employees, UPS, and the U.S. Public Interest \nResearch Group. CBO has indicated the amendment does not score and will \nnot increase the deficit in anyway.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Amendment 1756\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to talk \nabout the amendment that we call the Transportation Empowerment Act. \nThis is actually legislation that has been worked on for over 10 years. \nOur ranking member, Senator Inhofe, helped to develop this legislation, \nand it is essentially the same as when he introduced it 10 years ago. \nHe pointed out that he had long believed that the best decisions are \nthose made at the local level. Unfortunately, many of the \ntransportation choices made by cities and States are governed by \nFederal rules and regulations.\n  This bill returns to the States the responsibility and resources to \nmake their own transportation decisions--those were Senator Inhofe's \nwords. I think we all know, as a Nation, that we are not going to solve \nour spending and debt problems unless we are willing to begin to move \nsome public services from Washington back to the States where they can \nbe done more effectively and less expensively, and one of those public \nservices is transportation.\n  I would point out that the Transportation Department at the Federal \nlevel was formed almost 60 years ago to build our Interstate Highway \nSystem and this system is essentially complete. The States maintain \nmost of the interstate highways now with some Federal support. The \nproblem we have now is that 18 cents out of every gallon of gasoline \ncomes to Washington and a majority of States get back less than they \nsend.\n  We have what I think could be called an infrastructure crisis in \nAmerica. Roads and bridges are decaying everywhere and we are behind on \nour maintenance in the building of new roads, so it is obvious that \nwhat we are doing is not working. Instead of solving the problems with \nreal reforms, the underlying bill is adding to what we are spending \nabove the trust fund--above the 18 cents--without any real reforms to \nmake the system work better. So I think I can conclude that the current \nFederal transportation finance system is broken.\n  Since 2007, rather than evaluate true infrastructure priorities and \nattempt to live within our means by eliminating special interest \nprograms, Congress has bailed out the highway trust fund to the tune of \n$35 billion. With the pending reauthorization, the trust fund will \nrequire a bailout of another $13 billion.\n  At the end of this big-spending 2-year reauthorization, Congress will \nbe back at the drawing board scrambling for additional budgetary \ngimmicks and offsets to keep this charade from imploding. If this were \na traditional 6-\n\n[[Page S1595]]\n\nyear highway bill, at this rate of runaway spending it would require a \nbailout of $39 billion from the general fund.\n  There is a better way. It is time to get the Washington bureaucracy \nand costly regulations out of the way and empower States to be the \nprimary decisionmakers for their own local and State infrastructure. My \namendment allows for States to keep their gas taxes and set their own \npriorities while avoiding an additional layer of Washington \nbureaucracy.\n  We should devolve the Federal highway program from Washington to the \nStates. We can dramatically cut the Federal gas tax to a few pennies, \nwhich would be enough to fund the limited number of highway programs \nthat serve a clear national purpose. In turn, States could adjust their \nown gas taxes to make their own construction and repair decisions \nwithout costly rules such as Davis-Bacon regulations and without having \nto funnel the money through Washington's wasteful bureaucracy and some \nself-serving politicians.\n  My amendment would free States from the wasteful and corrupt Davis-\nBacon Act, which needlessly focuses or forces the government to pay \nlabor union wages for construction projects. Davis-Bacon harms workers \nwho choose not to join unions, and it raised the costs to taxpayers \nlast year by nearly $11 billion.\n  Our Nation's fiscal situation is perilous, with a $15 trillion debt \nset to double to $30 trillion in the next decade. Bipartisan \ncompromises on spending like this bill got us into this mess and we \nwill never get out of it if we don't embrace bold commonsense reforms.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and empower the States \nby giving them the flexibility they need to maintain their \ninfrastructures.\n  If I could take a second to summarize, I know some Members have \nstepped into this legislation that has been under development for many \nyears. It is one that has been talked about by the States, with over \nhalf of our States what we consider donor States. If we were able to \nnot only remove the Federal bureaucracy but also the regulations that \nforce States to spend money in ways they don't like, the overwhelming \nmajority of States would have a lot more money to spend on roads and \nbridges than they do now.\n  We are not talking about cutting spending on transportation. What we \nare talking about is actually increasing it by moving this service back \nto the States where it can be guided with a lot more on-the-ground \nknowledge of what needs to be done, without all of the political \nmaneuvering in Washington to send money to one State versus another. \nThis is a way to maintain our Federal priority with a small part of the \ngas tax and allow the States to basically keep the rest of the gas tax \nto serve their own needs.\n  If we cannot do this, I don't see any way that we are going to be \nable to deal with our national debt. If we can recognize there is an \nobvious service here that can be done better and less expensively and \nquicker at the State and local level and we can move that bureaucracy \nout of Washington, we can make the highway trust fund solvent.\n  If we can't do something that makes this much common sense and saves \nthe taxpayers money and actually delivers a better service, it is \ndifficult for me to understand how we are ever going to deal with the \nhuge debt and spending problem we have now in Washington.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry: Did \nSenator DeMint use his 1 minute he had before the vote?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask to have an additional 15 seconds, since he went \nover by that much.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 minute of debate in opposition prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 1756 offered by the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am asking for that. Fine.\n  I think this is so critical. The DeMint amendment is the end of the \nFederal highway and transportation system. It is a system that has been \nin place since Republican President Dwight Eisenhower told us how \ncritical it was. He said in the 1950s: The Transportation bill's impact \non the American economy--the jobs it would produce in manufacturing, \nconstruction, the rural areas it would open--are beyond calculation.\n  Ronald Reagan said: It has enabled our commerce to thrive, our \ncountry to grow, and our people to roam freely.\n  Senator DeMint is taking on two icons in the Republican Party, \nPresident Eisenhower and President Reagan.\n  Today, the National Association of Manufacturers said they oppose \nthis amendment. They oppose it. It would reduce future revenues, they \nsaid.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said they are against it, and without \nthis Transportation bill there is no guarantee that States would \nprioritize transportation investments that support national interests.\n  The American Road and Transportation Builders Association said they \nare against this amendment, and it would force your State to raise its \nown taxes or force cuts elsewhere to offset massive cuts in Federal \nhighway and transit investments.\n  I respect my friend, but this is a disaster if it were to pass. I \nurge a ``no'' vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 1756.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

When any of our States privatize an existing toll road, \nit, of course, shifts the responsibility to operate and maintain that \ntoll road to a private entity and gets a cash payment in return.\n  Under existing law, these privatized toll roads continue to be \nincluded in the calculation for receipt of Federal highway funds. I do \nnot think that makes any sense. This is a commonsense amendment to \ncorrect that. This amendment simply ensures that privatized toll roads \nare removed from consideration when we allocate Federal highway funds.\n\n[[Page S1596]]\n\n  As I say, I think it makes a lot of sense and should apply equally to \nall States. I urge support for the Bingaman-Durbin amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, what this amendment does is it ultimately \neliminates a State's right to leverage its assets over an amortization \nschedule that would allow it to expand its highway system. What we are \ndoing is we are taking money we have taken from the States, sending it \nup here, and saying: If you have an asset in your State--unless you are \nbuilding a brandnew road--you cannot use that asset to leverage your \ncapital to build more roads in your State. It is against the 10th \namendment. It is morally wrong to take away a State's right to enhance \nits capital assets.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 1759.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. \nLautenberg) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Utah (Mr. Hatch) and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) \nwould have voted ``nay.''\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I would like to ask support for my \namendment that would approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. It would expand \noil and gas exploration on Federal lands and would extend certain tax \nprovisions that are utilized by a number of individuals and businesses \nthroughout the country.\n  The base of my amendment includes most but not all of the expired \nenergy tax incentives addressed in the amendment that will be offered \nby my friends on the other side of the aisle. But there is a clear \ndifference in that my amendment addresses the supply side of the \nequation and avoids extending some of the costly energy provisions that \nwere created under the failed American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of \n2009; i.e., the stimulus.\n  While I support many of the tax provisions included in the Democrats' \ncounterproposal, the majority amendment fails to address the No. 1 \nissue facing Americans of every walk of life, from farmers to \nmanufacturers, to teachers, which is the rising cost of gasoline. My \namendment does just that, and it implements the important first steps \ntoward increasing domestic supplies of conventional energy that our \ncountry will rely on for decades to come.\n  My amendment would cut redtape, open more Federal land for oil and \ngas exploration and drilling; it would approve the Keystone XL \nPipeline, while also extending renewable tax provisions that benefit \ndomestic energy production, businesses, and individuals alike. It also \nrestores expired individual and business tax relief provisions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. It also restores expired individual and business tax \nrelief provisions and, most of all, it promotes economic growth.\n  Lastly, my amendment does all this without adding to the deficit, \nwhich, considering our more than $15 trillion debt, is something our \nfuture generations certainly can appreciate.\n  I thank my colleagues if they would support this very commonsense, \nprogrowth amendment.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to discuss the \nRoberts side-by-side amendment. I support several provisions in Senator \nRoberts' amendment, but, crucially, others miss the mark.\n  One provision that gives me particular concern relates to the \ndevelopment of oil shale resources in the Rocky Mountain West. I \nbelieve we need to take a more cautious approach to oil shale \ndevelopment.\n  This type of energy development could have enormous implications for \nColorado's scarce water supplies and our farming and ranching heritage.\n  That is why, over the years, a great diversity of voices--from the \nRocky Mountain Farmers Union to the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel \nEditorial Board--have raised concerns over plans to accelerate oil \nshale development on public land. Yet this amendment would do exactly \nthat.\n  Mr. President, there are other provisions in the Roberts amendment \nthat are certainly worthy of support. I hope to work with the Senator \nfrom Kansas as we continue the discussion about where to make wise \ninvestments in our Tax Code and elsewhere.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I wish to raise my concerns about the \nRoberts amendment.\n  This amendment is a disappointing attempt to play politics with what \nshould be a bipartisan issue: extending the State and local sales tax \ndeduction and other key tax policies. We need to move forward on a \nserious bipartisan proposal to extend the State sales tax deduction. It \nis a matter of tax fairness for Washington residents.\n  But we cannot afford to threaten Washington's coastal economy by \nopening the West Coast and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for \ndrilling.\n  Therefore, I will not support the Roberts Amendment and I look \nforward to serious legislation to extend the State sales tax deduction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Roberts amendment \nNo. 1826.\n  My friend from Kansas and I work together in the Agriculture \nCommittee, and I appreciate the great bipartisan work we have been able \nto do. But I stand to strongly oppose this amendment. I believe that \nwhen it comes to energy, we should do it all. We need more domestic \nproduction of wind, solar, electric vehicles, advanced batteries. We \nabsolutely need to stop our addiction to foreign oil and create jobs \nhere in America at the same time.\n  Unfortunately, that is not what this amendment does. It includes the\n\n[[Page S1597]]\n\nHoeven language that we defeated earlier last week. We shouldn't be \nbuilding a pipeline from Canada to China. If we build a pipeline, we \nshould use the oil to lower gas prices for American families. It also \nincludes dangerous requirements for drilling in the Arctic and in \noffshore locations without any safeguards. Worst of all, it ends tax \ncuts for wind and clean energy manufacturing at a time when families \nare paying so much at the pump. It doesn't make sense to raise taxes on \nthe businesses that are trying to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, \nand it pays for all these changes by adding redtape to working families \nwhen they file their taxes, adding more burdens to middle-class \nfamilies.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Maryland \nis recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me concur in everything Senator \nStabenow said in opposition to this amendment.\n  There are many reasons to oppose it, but let me add one additional \nreason, in that it violates the agreement we reached on the debt \nceiling on the budget caps for this year and does it on the backs of \nour Federal workers. Once again, the Republicans are coming forward \nwith another attack on the Federal workforce. Enough is enough. Every \namendment, they are picking on the Federal workforce.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1826, as modified.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of this amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to explain the reasons I voted for \nRoberts amendment No. 1826.\n  First, the amendment would increase America's energy supply by \napproving the Keystone XL pipeline, opening lands in the Outer \nContinental Shelf and the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge for drilling, \nand implementing a commercial leasing program for oil shale.\n  The amendment would also extend a number of important temporary tax \nprovisions that expired at the end of 2011. Significantly, it would not \nextend a number of provisions that are unsound policy or no longer \nnecessary.\n  However, the amendment did extend some provisions that I believe \nshould be ended because they are unwarranted subsidies that distort \nmarkets. These include tax credits for energy-efficient homes, \nalternative fuel vehicle refueling property, biodiesel, energy-\nefficient appliances, and alternative fuels.\n  While I supported the Roberts amendment, I do not want this vote to \nbe interpreted as support for each and every provision that was \nincluded. I hope that as the tax extenders package continues to be \nconsidered by Congress, a number of unnecessary and harmful provisions \nwill be eliminated. Ideally, Congress will consider comprehensive tax \nreform that lowers rates, eliminates special subsidies, and makes sound \ntax policy permanent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment to stop the tax increase on American businesses that are \ncreating clean-energy jobs. Especially now when gas prices are going up \nand families are struggling more than ever to fill the tank, we \nshouldn't be raising taxes on innovators and job creators who are \nhelping to lower America's energy bills. My amendment extends 19 \ndifferent tax cuts for innovative businesses that account for 2.7 \nmillion jobs.\n  Let me also say that the oil industry has benefited from special tax \nbenefits for almost 100 years. The cost of this is not offset, it is \npart of the Tax Code. Yet the tax cuts that will create American jobs \nto get us off foreign oil have been extended only a year at a time, and \nthey have been subject to different budget rules. This makes no sense.\n  If we want to see ``Made in America'' again, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. RISCH.

Mr. President, we have all complained about the big \ncorporations that don't pay any taxes, only to find that many times \nthat is because we offer some tax subsidy that allows them to get out \nof taxes. We have complained about subsidies for Big Oil, Big Natural \nGas. We have given subsidies to companies that go out of business \nbecause we are trying to pick winners and losers. Temporary tax policy \nfor whatever we are trying to do does not work.\n  This amendment eliminates the tax subsidies, the loopholes we talk \nabout not just for Big Oil but for all of the energy tax credits. \nFolks, if we let the market work, we are going to have wind, we are \ngoing to have solar, but we are going to have it in a way that does not \nwaste the money of hard-working taxpayers.\n  So I encourage my colleagues' support. I know a lot of my colleagues \nhave new subsidies they are proposing, but it is no way to run a free \nmarket economy, to try to run it from this room. Let's get rid of \nsubsidies, lower the corporate tax rate, and let our country work.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment does two things. First, it \nincreases taxes on business men and women trying to provide some \nalternative energy for this country. It increases taxes on those men \nand women.\n  Second, it eases out revenue by increasing taxes on individuals and \nuses it to lower the corporate tax rate. That is one of the main things \nthis does.\n  Third, it repeals credits and deductions on one section of our energy \nindustry--the renewables, the alternatives--but it doesn't for \nconventional oil and gas.\n  So, No. 1, this raises taxes on individuals and uses it to lower the \ncorporate rate; and, No. 2, it is unbalanced because it reduces credits \nand deductions in the alternative area but not on the conventional \nenergy area. It is unbalanced and wrong. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Mr. President, I ask to set aside the pending amendment \nand offer Menendez-Burr amendment No. 1782, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Menendez], for himself, \n     Mr. Burr, and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 1782.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Monday, March 5, 2012, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, gas prices are skyrocketing. Meanwhile, \nnatural gas is $1.50 cheaper than gasoline. We have a 100-plus-year \nsupply of natural gas we can draw from. The only thing that is in our \nway is we have so few natural gas vehicles and refueling stations on \nthe road.\n  The NAT GAS Act gives manufacturers and utilities the assurance that \nthe Federal Government will help jump-start this market, adding over \n700,000 natural gas vehicles to our roads and displacing over 20 \nbillion gallons of petroleum fuel, mostly from our bus and truck \nfleets. It does all this while being paid for by a surcharge on the \nusers who will benefit from the amendment.\n  We know there are some industries that have concern. Instead of \nexporting natural gas, which we are about to do in this country, let's \nuse it in America so we can give our drivers an option. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this bipartisan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, let me say to my colleagues, what this \nsimply does is to take something that is happening naturally--a \ntransition from diesel, in most cases, over to natural gas--and it \naccelerates it. It gives it a 5-hour energy drink. We should take this \nopportunity to accelerate it as fast as we can. It is paid for, as \nSenator Menendez said.\n  This is essential if we want natural gas prices to stay down--\nincrease demand. If not, we are going to shut in wells, we are going to \nfind ways to sell it offshore.\n  If we want to keep historically low natural gas prices, then let's \nincrease demand so production increases and we can take advantage of \nall these finds we have all over the United States of America.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to express \nconcerns about the Menendez/Burr amendment, to include the NAT GAS Act \nin the transportation bill.\n  This legislation would provide tax credits to promote natural gas \nvehicles and refueling infrastructure by imposing a user fee on natural \ngas fuel used as vehicle fuel. Although the tax credits are detailed in \nthe legislation, it is less certain whether the imposition of a new tax \napplied to Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) \nused for transportation will cover the costs of the subsidies.\n  Instead of providing more directives from Washington to the \nmarketplace, Congress should be concerned with the overall access to \nenergy, and the President should work to alleviate the pain caused by \nhis policies which raise energy prices. Companies and consumers can \nmake their own choices about what fuel to use, and what kind of car to \ndrive. We should be out of the game of favoring one choice over \nanother, and ensure that fuel supplies are not unnecessarily \nrestricted.\n  Consumer choice should be the driver of technology in the \nmarketplace, not securing favor in Washington. In fact today consumers \ncan evaluate a myriad of vehicles that fit their needs, from hybrids to \ntraditional gasoline-powered vehicles. In addition, the high cost of \ngasoline and lower cost of natural gas has already led General Motors \nand Chrysler/Dodge to announce plans to build natural gas fueled pick-\nup trucks.\n  While the market is already seeing some transition toward natural gas \nvehicles, President Obama's policies to limit supplies of fossil fuels \ncould cause economic pain for natural gas users in the future. \nPresident Obama's support of duplicative, unnecessary regulations at \nthe federal level, raising taxes on producers, and restricting access \nto federal lands by keeping them off-limits or by slow-walking permits, \nwill result in raising natural gas prices by reducing supply.\n  Unfortunately, the Obama administration continues to enact policies \nthat harm oil and natural gas production. Consider the rising cost of \ngasoline and the Obama administration's failure to take concrete \nactions to alleviate the pain Americans are feeling at the pump. The \naverage U.S. price of a gallon of regular gasoline has more than \ndoubled since the week of his inauguration in January 2009, from $1.84 \nto $3.82.\n  I have great pride for my home state of Texas, and the countless \nproducers and operators who have made Texas the leading U.S. producer \nof oil and natural gas, and we know that America has only just begun to \ntap its vast resources. Unfortunately, the Obama administration's \nproposed offshore oil and natural gas leasing plan for 2012 to 2017 \neliminates 50 percent of lease sales provided for in the previous plan, \nand imposes a moratorium on developing energy from 14 billion barrels \nof oil and 55 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Atlantic and \nPacific oceans.\n  Expanding access to federal onshore and offshore lands, and \neliminating permit delays for leases, could help reduce prices and \nstrengthen our energy security while creating jobs and boosting tax \nrevenues. The moratorium on exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, and \npersistent delays for permits in shallow and deep water leases, could \nresult in a 19 percent decrease in production in 2012 compared to 2010, \naccording to the Energy Information Administration.\n  At the same time the President highlights our Nation's vast natural \ngas resources, his administration through the Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA) is considering burdensome new regulations on which would \nmake securing that fuel much more difficult. The U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce reports that the EPA alone ``is moving forward with 31 major \neconomic rules and 172 major policy rules'' that affect our energy \nsupply. The Chamber rightly calls this ``an unprecedented level of \nregulatory action.''\n  Given the Administration's track record with gasoline prices, it is \neasy to see a similar direction for natural gas prices in the future--\nparticularly as the EPA continues to propose devastating regulations \nthat lead to the retirement of coal-fired electricity generation and \nensure greater demand for natural gas in power generation. American \nenergy producers are also deeply worried about the EPA's proposed \ngreenhouse gas regulations, which will serve as an energy tax on all \nconsumers.\n  I know there are natural gas producers and transit authorities in my \nState who favor this legislation, however, instead of directing demand \nfor a product, I believe we should concern ourselves with ensuring \nample supplies of the fuels we need. We should promote access to our \nNation's natural gas, and discourage duplicative regulations, and stay \nout of the business of manipulating demand for its use and leave that \nto the marketplace.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nMenendez-Burr amendment, No. 1782, dealing with natural gas vehicles. \nWe have an opportunity today to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by \ndiversifying our vehicle fleet to run on a fuel that is not made from \ncrude oil.\n  The Menendez-Burr amendment--which I cosponsor-- would make smart \ninvestments designed to spur greater production of vehicles that run on \nnatural gas. Advances in technology have unlocked new reserves of \nnatural gas in this country. And we ought to be using this resource--\nwhich burns cleaner than any other fossil fuel--to power a greater \nshare of our economy.\n  Natural gas is a domestic resource that we now have in relative \nabundance. Its development has driven economic growth in Colorado and \nacross the Nation. Passage of the Menendez-Burr amendment would create \neven\n\n[[Page S1601]]\n\nmore economic opportunities by building and retrofitting vehicles to \nrun on natural gas.\n  To be sure, natural gas alone is not going to solve our problems. We \nneed to focus on continued increases in vehicle efficiency. We have \nrecently made great strides in that arena.\n  We also need to be sure we are developing natural gas in an \nenvironmentally responsible way. Colorado has been a leader on this \npoint--with the strongest rules in the Nation--in ensuring that natural \ngas development protects communities and drinking water. Nationally \nmore needs to be done to protect those living adjacent to development. \nI think all States should look to our rules in Colorado as a national \nmodel.\n  In short, this amendment will diversify our vehicle fleet, drive \ncontinued economic growth in the energy sector, and clean up our air--\nall while reducing our dependence on foreign oil. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Menendez-Burr amendment when it comes for a vote later \ntoday.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes \nfor the adoption of the amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1517\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided, prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 1517, offered by \nthe Senator from Indiana Mr. Coats.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It is a \nmatter of equity and fairness.\n  The reality is that a majority of States, such as Indiana, my State, \nand many others do not receive their fair share of the distribution of \nhighway funds. This bill unfairly rewards a minority of States that \nhave collected earmarks in the past that go to establishing the \nhistorical benchmark from which the distributions are made. This \namendment creates a new system by which everyone is treated equally and \ntreated fairly.\n  A system of winners and losers is not the way we should go forward \nwith distributing funds that are paid by our taxpayers for the building \nof roads and bridges. So let's address the current inequity in this \nbill and give each State its rightful share. I ask my colleagues for \ntheir support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a killer amendment. Our committee \nvoted 18 to 0 on a bipartisan bill that set out the formulas in a very \nfair way. What did we do? We didn't want to jolt the States in the \nmiddle of a tough economic time, so we kept that funding in place. \nAgain, the distribution is very fair.\n  In contrast, we have a lot of drafting problems with my friend's \namendment. The Department of Transportation says it doesn't even \nspecify that the gas taxes will not be factored in as Federal gas \ntaxes. It just has a flaw in it. It is also very biased because \ntraditionally we have always distributed these funds to States based on \nnumerous factors, need-based factors: lane miles in a State, the cost \nto repair or replace deficient bridges, the vehicle miles traveled.\n  So I would say to my friend, I appreciate the spirit with which he \noffers this amendment. I understand the spirit is one that he can be \nproud of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. But this, in fact, at the end of the day, ruins the bill, \nand I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I urge my colleagues to take a look at getting fairness in \nthe distribution of funds. A majority of States are not treated fairly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1517.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 1819 offered by \nthe Senator from Ohio, Mr. Brown.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, our amendment requires DOT to \nreport annually on waivers, including analysis of taxpayer dollars that \nare spent on foreign materials and infrastructure. It closes a loophole \nthat currently exists that allows the project to be split into several \npieces, thus evading ``Buy American'' requirements.\n  The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge is the most outrageous example \nof that. The $6 billion project was divided into 20 separate \nconstruction contracts, resulting in a Chinese-owned company building a \n520-foot steel tower and 28 steel bridge decks. That was not what this \nwas meant to do.\n  It is modeled on language House Republicans passed. It is consistent \nwith our international trade obligations.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Merkley, a cosponsor.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, transportation projects financed by \nAmerican taxpayers should, to the maximum extent possible, be built \nusing American materials and American workers. But all too often \nloopholes have crept in that have resulted in American transportation \nprojects paid for with American taxpayer money being built by Chinese \nfirms with Chinese workers and Chinese steel. It is wrong. Please \nsupport this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. REID. I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on amendment No. 1540, offered by the Senator from Missouri, \nMr. Blunt.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, this amendment would continue the current \npractice in which 15 percent of the bridge money that goes to States \ngoes to local governments. If you have talked to a county commissioner \nanywhere in the country about the highway bill, my guess is they \nmentioned continuing the current policy on sharing some of this bridge \nmoney with local governments. It doesn't increase the amount of money; \nwhat it does is continue current policy. I think every county \ncommissioner in America would be relieved if they were going to \ncontinue to maintain their bridges.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who will yields time in opposition?\n  Mrs. BOXER. We yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I first defer to my colleague across \nthe aisle to speak to the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on amendment No. 1814, offered by the Senator \nfrom Oregon.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I thank the Senator for yielding. I am pleased to join him \non this amendment. This would allow family farmers to use their \nvehicles within 150 miles of their farm without having to have a \ncommercial driver's license. It is a requirement that wouldn't make \nsense for those businesses. I urge its passage.\n  I yield to Mr. Toomey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. I thank the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from \nOregon for working together on this amendment.\n  Under current regulations, the States are essentially required to \nadopt rules that would force a family farmer who is driving a tractor \nacross the street to follow the same kinds of rules and regulations \nthat a cross-country long-haul truckdriver has to comply with in terms \nof hours of service and regulations and logbooks. It is a solution in \nsearch of a problem. It is costly. It is unnecessary.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back to the Senator \nfrom Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, this is simple common sense, that you \ncan drive across your State, but if the place you drop off your food is \nacross the border, you have to put it into an interstate truck to go 1 \nmile down the road. That makes no sense for farmers, it makes no sense \nfor safety.\n  This is a sort of commonsense solution along borders, allowing \nfarmers to get their food from the farm to the depot, be that an \nairplane depot, or put it on a barge, put it on a ship, be that put it \nin an interstate truck. It is common sense. Let's do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any time to be used in opposition?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1814, as modified) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1617\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 1617, the Klobuchar-Roberts Agriculture Hours of Service \namendment and ask the clerk to report the amendment by number.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Ms. Klobuchar], for herself and \n     Mr. Roberts, proposes an amendment numbered 1617.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999 to \n    provide clarification regarding the applicability of exemptions \n  relating to the transportation of agricultural commodities and farm \n                   supplies, and for other purposes)\n\n       In section 32101, add at the end the following:\n       (d) Transportation of Agricultural Commodities and Farm \n     Supplies.--Section 229(a)(1) of the Motor Carrier Safety \n     Improvement Act of 1999 (49 U.S.C. 31136 note) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(1) Transportation of agricultural commodities and farm \n     supplies.--Regulations prescribed by the Secretary under \n     sections 31136 and 31502 regarding maximum driving and on-\n     duty time for drivers used by motor carriers shall not apply \n     during planting and harvest periods, as determined by each \n     State, to--\n       ``(A) drivers transporting agricultural commodities in the \n     State from the source of the agricultural commodities to a \n     location within a 100 air-mile radius from the source;\n       ``(B) drivers transporting farm supplies for agricultural \n     purposes in the State from a wholesale or retail distribution \n     point of the farm supplies to a farm or other location where \n     the farm supplies are intended to be used within a 100 air-\n     mile radius from the distribution point; or\n       ``(C) drivers transporting farm supplies for agricultural \n     purposes in the State from a wholesale distribution point of \n     the farm supplies to a retail distribution point of the farm \n     supplies within a 100 air-mile radius from the wholesale \n     distribution point.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, the Klobuchar-Roberts amendment would \nclarify the way the Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration \ncurrently implements and enforces an exemption to hours of service \nrules as they apply to the agriculture industry during spring planting \nand fall harvesting. Our amendment reinforces existing law and brings \nthe exemption back to the way it was implemented from 1995 to 2009.\n  This is a commonsense change with broad support. It has the backing \nof\n\n[[Page S1604]]\n\nthe American Trucking Association as well as 50 agricultural \norganizations which includes the American Farm Bureau Federation and \nthe National Farmers Union.\n  I thank Senator Roberts for his leadership on this important issue, \nas well as Senators Nelson, McCaskill, Johanns, and Lugar for their \nstrong support and cosponsorship.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I would like to associate myself with \nthe comments made by my colleague from Minnesota and urge my colleagues \nto vote in favor of Amendment No. 1617, the Klobuchar, Roberts, Ben \nNelson, McCaskill, Johanns, and Lugar amendment to clarify Hours of \nService--HOS--exemption for Ag transportation.\n  The Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act expressly states:\n\n       Regulations prescribed by the Secretary regarding maximum \n     driving and on-duty time for drivers used by motor carriers \n     shall not apply during planting and harvest periods, as \n     determined by each State, to drivers transporting \n     agricultural commodities or farm supplies for agricultural \n     purposes in a State if such transportation is limited to an \n     area within a 100 air mile radius from the source of the \n     commodities or the distribution point for the farm supplies.\n\n  We believe this statute alone, not to mention clear Congressional \nintent demonstrated in previous sessions, clearly allows the \ntransportation of all farm supplies from any distribution point to a \nlocal farm retailer or to the ultimate consumer--in other words, from \nsource to retail, source to farm, and retail to farm.\n  Unfortunately, in 2009 the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration--FMCSA--began to misinterpret both the statute and \nCongressional intent.\n  Currently, FMCSA only allows for the transportation of a single farm \nsupply--anhydrous ammonia--from any distribution point to a local farm \nretailer or to the ultimate consumer. While anhydrous ammonia is \nperhaps the most widely used farm supply to be transported under the \nAgHOS regulations, many other critical farm supplies have been excluded \nbecause of the agency's interpretation. This severely hinders the \nflexibility our farmers need during planting and harvesting seasons.\n  FMCSA, through several waivers granted over the past two years, has \nrecognized the need for an exemption to their motor carrier \nregulations.\n  Therefore, our amendment will reinforce what we believe is existing \nlaw by clarifying that a driver transporting farm supplies from source \nto retail, source to farm, and retail to farm is included in the Ag \nHours of Service exemption.\n  This amendment is a commonsense approach to simply clarify what is \nalready existing law and will provide our Nation's farmers with the \nflexibility they need to feed an ever-growing Nation and world.\n  I yield the floor and, again, strongly encourage my friends to vote \nin favor of this commonsense amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there debate in opposition?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1617) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1736\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote on amendment No. 1736, offered by the Senator \nfrom Ohio, Mr. Portman.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment. This is similar to an amendment we voted on earlier today. \nThis is simply a State opt-out, giving States the discretion to be able \nto opt out should they choose to. The highway trust fund has been \nbailed out three times from the general fund to the tune of about $35 \nbillion. This would enable us to put more money directly into roads and \nbridges. The highway trust fund spent about $78 billion on projects not \nrelated to that over the period 2004 to 2008.\n  Again, I encourage my colleagues to support this opportunity for us \nto get back on a fiscally sustainable path, eliminate waste, allow the \nStates the flexibility they need to maintain our roads and bridges back \nhome.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, could we have order?\n  First, thank you to all colleagues for your amazing cooperation. I \nhope we vote this down because we already did vote down a similar \namendment.\n  This is another amendment that would devolve the Federal Aid Highway \nProgram back to the States. In closing, let me quote from the American \nRoad and Transportation Builders. This is what they say:\n\n       Allowing States to opt out of the Federal highway program \n     ignores the role of the U.S. highway network in supporting \n     the national economy and the reliance of each State's economy \n     on the ability to ship products efficiently across borders.\n\n  This is not good for our economy. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Sure.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am also told this would exempt States from having to \nmeet their obligation under the Americans With Disabilities Act to \nprovide equal access to people with disabilities.\n  Mrs. BOXER. This would essentially devolve the whole program, go \nagainst what Dwight Eisenhower had in mind when he started the National \nHighway System.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 14 seconds. Does he \nwish to use them?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. This is simply an opt-out, it is not a mandate. It gives \nthe States the discretion to do it. The States would be required to \nsupport the highway system. It is a different vote from the previous \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense approach to make \nsure we get more money into our roads and bridges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is now 2 minutes of debate, equally \ndivided, prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 1785, as \nmodified, offered by the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Corker.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, the whole Nation watched last August as\n\n[[Page S1605]]\n\nour Nation almost shut down over a debt ceiling vote and a very good \nlaw was put in place. Senator Reid has called it stronger than any \nbudget resolution we have ever had. We agreed during that vote that \nwhat we would do is raise the debt ceiling but lower discretionary caps \nover the next 10 years in order to lower the deficit. We had language \nregarding a budget resolution. Unfortunately, last week we overrode \nthat, but the fact is this bill violates the Budget Control Act we put \nin place just last August, 7 months ago. For this bill to be truly \nbudget neutral, as was outlined in the spirit of this bill as it was--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CORKER. We have to offset discretionary spending by $11 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, this amendment would lower the \nnondefense discretionary cap established by the Budget Control Act by \n$11 billion to offset transfers from the general fund necessary to \nreplenish the highway trust fund. This amendment is in clear violation \nof the Budget Control Act we just agreed to 6 months ago. In the \nsimplest terms, the amendment would impose a 2-percent cut to \nnondefense discretionary spending in order to pay for a shortfall in \nmandatory spending. I would suggest if you want an offset for mandatory \nspending, find a mandatory offset.\n  However, the pending amendment deals with matters within the Budget \nCommittee's jurisdiction; therefore, I raise a point of order that the \npending amendment violates section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. This is the amendment, as modified; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The amendment (No. 1785), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of division D, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DISCRETIONARY SPENDING CAP ADJUSTMENT FOR FISCAL \n                   YEAR 2013.\n\n       Paragraph (2)(A)(ii) of section 251A of the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 901a) is \n     amended by striking ``$501,000,000,000'' and inserting \n     ``$490,000,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and 4G3 of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go \nAct of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of those acts and \napplicable budget resolutions for purposes of my amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment fails.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Shaheen \namendment No. 1678 be considered following Paul amendment No. 1556.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1742\n\n  There is now 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in \nrelation to amendment No. 1742, offered by the Senator from Ohio, Mr. \nPortman.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is about States being able \nto control what happens at their rest areas. It is a very important \namendment. It is supported by a number of different groups: the \nNational Governors Association, the American Association of State \nHighway and Transportation Officials, Citizens Against Government \nWaste, a lot of private sector entities, as well as other \norganizations.\n  It goes to a mandate that was put in place back in 1956 that is a \ntypical one-size-fits-all Federal mandate--unfunded--that does not \nallow States the flexibility to decide what they do at their rest \nareas. This amendment would lift that mandate from 1956. Incidentally, \n26 of us represent States that already allow some commercial activity \nat rest areas because those rest areas were grandfathered in before the \n1956 mandate.\n  It makes a lot of sense, and it will save States hundreds of millions \nof dollars a year. It takes that money and provides for the needs of \nthe State in the transportation areas, including putting more money \ninto roads and bridges.\n  This amendment does not direct or mandate States to do anything. They \ndo not have to commercialize a single rest area. They do not have to \nchange the way they are doing anything, but they would have the \nopportunity to do so. It gives States the much needed flexibility they \nwant.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope we will oppose this amendment. It \nis very controversial. It is opposed by a very broad and diverse group \nof business and labor organizations.\n  It would overturn a 60-year prohibition on allowing commercial \nservices at interstate rest areas. The ban was enacted because Congress \nrecognized the importance of supporting businesses and commercial \nactivity along interstates. That decision has resulted in the \ndevelopment of 97,000 businesses that employ over 2 million Americans \nwho provide services to travelers on our Nation's highways.\n  This amendment would allow commercial activities at existing \ninterstate rest areas, which would lead to devastating losses to those \nbusinesses that are located near interstate interchanges.\n  So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and support the \nsmall businesses that exist across our country near highway exits. So I \nurge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Utah (Mr. Hatch) and the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Kirk).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) \nwould have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I think we are \nshowing bipartisan spirit here and bipartisan cooperation. It is \nimportant to note that 2.8 million jobs hang in the balance.\n  So we will see everyone tomorrow.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to talk about judicial \nnominations. I come to the floor many days to talk about judicial \nnominations. Most of my remarks at those times as well as this time are \nto respond to some of the claims made by my colleagues from the other \nside of the aisle. If you listened to some of my colleagues over the \nlast couple of days, you would think the sky is falling on the issue of \njudicial nominees. They act as if the Senate is treating President \nObama's judicial nominees differently than nominees have been treated \nin the past. This is simply not true.\n  A fair and impartial look at the numbers tells a far different story. \nThe fact of the matter is that President Obama's nominees are being \ntreated just as well, and in many cases much more fairly, than the \nDemocrats treated President Bush's nominees. I want to take a few \nminutes to set the record straight.\n  Let me start by taking a brief look at 17 cloture motions that the \nmajority has filed. Seven of those nominees were reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee within the last month and three of them were \nreported just last week. That is without precedent. To our knowledge \nthe majority, Republican or Democrat, has never filed cloture on \ndistrict court nominees within a month of them being reported out of \nthe Judiciary Committee. That accounts for 7 of the 17.\n  What about the other 10 nominees? What our colleagues fail to mention \nis that they could have gotten a majority of those nominees confirmed \nat the end of the last session, just before recessing at Christmastime. \nOur side cleared quite a few nominees and we offered to confirm them as \na package the end of last session. However, the President refused to \noffer assurances that he would not bypass the Senate and make so-called \nrecess appointments.\n  I made a mistake when I said when the Senate adjourned just prior to \nChristmas, or recessed just prior to the session. We did neither. We \nstayed in session during the period of time from December 18 until \nJanuary 24. In other words, the President was not in a position to make \nrecess appointments because we were not in recess.\n  And of course, the President does not have the power, under our \nConstitution, to determine whether or not the\n\n[[Page S1607]]\n\nSenate is in session. Only the Senate can make a determination of when \nwe adjourn. The President of the United States cannot do that. But he \npresumed that he could and he went ahead and made what he called \n``recess appointments.'' So he shredded the Constitution once again.\n  In regard to what we are talking about here, it was the President who \nchose not to confirm those nominees at the end of last session because \nhe refused to give us assurances that he would not make recess \nappointments. The bottom line is this, if the President believes we \nshould have confirmed more nominees last fall, he should look to his \nown administration for that explanation.\n  That is the background of the 17 cloture motions before the Senate. \nLet me comment on something I read in one of our daily newspapers that \ncovers the Congress. A famous reporter said, in the second paragraph of \na report I read today, that the Republicans are filibustering \nnominations. I told the writer of that article that you can't \nfilibuster anything that is not before the Senate and these nominees \nwere not before the Senate until the leader of the majority filed these \ncloture motions.\n  Wouldn't you think, if you believed you needed to stop debate, that \nyou would at least let debate start in the first place? But no. The \ngame that is played around here is that, in order to build up the \nnumbers, you claim the minority is filibustering, when in fact they are \nnot filibustering.\n  I wish to take a step back and address some of the claims I've heard \nfrom the other side. I cannot believe some of the comments I am \nhearing, so I believe it is important to set the record straight. First \nof all, everyone around here understands that it takes a tremendous \namount of time and resources for the Senate to consider Supreme Court \nnominees. For that reason, when a Supreme Court nomination is pending \nbefore the Senate, the Judiciary Committee considers little else. \nDuring President Obama's first 3 years in office, the Senate considered \nnot one but two nominations to the Supreme Court. Those nominations \noccupied the Judiciary Committee for approximately 6 months. The last \ntime the Senate handled two Supreme Court nominations was during \nPresident George W. Bush's second term. During President Bush's entire \nsecond term we confirmed only 120 lower court nominees. Under President \nObama, as you can see from the chart we have here, we have already \nconfirmed 129 lower court nominees. I think that is a pretty explicit \npicture of how the other side's arguments do not hold water.\n  For repetitive purposes, but to drive a point home, we have confirmed \n129 of President Obama's judicial nominees in just over 3 years. That \nis more than were confirmed under George W. Bush's entire second term \nof 4 years. Again, the comparison between President Obama's first 3 \nyears to President George W. Bush's second term of 4 years is the \nappropriate comparison. These were the only two time periods in recent \nmemory when the Senate handled two Supreme Court nominations during \nsuch a short period of time--obviously consuming a great deal of time \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Even if you compared the number of President Obama's nominees \nconfirmed to President Bush's first term, it is clear that President \nObama has fared very well. More specifically, even though the Senate \ndid not consider any Supreme Court nomination during President Bush's \nfirst term, we have confirmed approximately the same number of \nPresident Obama's lower court nominees as we did President Bush's, \nrelative to the nominations President Obama has made.\n  In other words, although fewer lower court nominees have been \nconfirmed under President Obama, the President made approximately 20 \npercent fewer judicial nominations during his first 3 years than \nPresident Bush did during his first term of 4 years. I think it is \npretty simple, isn't it? You cannot complain that we have not confirmed \nenough judges, if they have not been sent up here in the first place.\n  As a practical matter, if the President believes he has not gotten \nenough confirmations, then he should look no farther than the pace at \nwhich he has been making nominations. Maybe he should have spent less \ntime on the 100 or so fundraisers he has been holding all over the \ncountry recently and more time making judicial nominations. Or, at \nleast he should have his political party in the Senate give us a little \nleniency, and quit complaining about nominations not being approved. \nThe fact of the matter is this: If a backlog exists, then it is clear \nthat it originates with the President. The Senate cannot confirm \nanybody the President has not sent up here in the first place.\n  If you need even more evidence that the President has been slow to \nsend judicial nominees to the Senate, all you need to do is examine the \ncurrent vacancies. My colleagues have been on the floor talking about \nthe so-called vacancy crisis. What my colleagues fail to mention is \nthat the White House has not even made nominations for over half of the \nvacancies. To be specific, of the 83 current vacancies, the White House \nhas not submitted nominations for 44 of those vacancies. Once again, \nthe Senate cannot confirm anybody who is not sent up here. How can my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle complain about a vacancy crisis \nwhen the President has not sent up a nominee for over half of the \nvacancies?\n  As a result, it is clear if there is a vacancy crisis, once again the \nproblem rests with the White House. If the President believes there are \ntoo many vacancies in the Federal courts, he should look no further \nthan his own administration for an answer.\n  What about the other side's claim that nominees are waiting longer to \nget confirmed than they have in the past? Once again, this is not true. \nThe average time from nomination to confirmation of judges during the \nObama administration is nearly identical to what it was under President \nBush. During President Bush's Presidency, it took on average \napproximately 211 days for judicial nominees to be confirmed. You can \nsee from the chart that, during the first 3 years of President Obama's \nPresidency, it has taken 218 days for his judicial nominees to be \nconfirmed. I am sure this will be news to many of my colleagues. If you \nhad listened to the other side you would think that we have somehow \nbroken new ground. We have not, obviously. We are treating President \nObama's nominees virtually the same as President Bush's nominees.\n  It is not our primary concern to worry about whether one President is \nbeing treated differently than the other. We just proceed with our \nwork. But the numbers you see here are the result of our work. And the \nfact of the matter is that the numbers are not much different than for \nother Presidents. To suggest we are treating President Obama's nominees \na whole lot differently is intellectually dishonest. The fact of the \nmatter is that the Senate has been working its will and regularly \nprocessing the President's judicial nominees in much the same way it \nhas in the past.\n  Given that the President's nominees have received such fair \ntreatment, why would the majority leader then choose to take the \nunprecedented step of filing 17 cloture motions on district court \nnominees? Why would the majority leader choose to manufacture \ncontroversy that does not exist--because there is no doubt in my \ncaucus, even if there are a few votes against some of these nominees, \nthere is very little doubt that most if not all of these 17 nominees \nare going to be approved by the Senate. These votes are a stunt. They \nare a smokescreen. They are designed to accomplish two goals. First, as \neven Democrats concede, the President cannot run for reelection on his \nown record so these votes are designed to help the President's \nreelection strategy by somehow portraying Republicans as \nobstructionists. But how can you obstruct when there are 83 vacancies, \nand the White House has failed to nominate someone for over half of \nthose slots? How can you be considered as obstructionist when these \njudges will be approved just as we have already approved seven?\n\n  Second, the other side simply does not want to talk about the \nextremely important things and very real problems facing this Nation. \nLook at any poll, go to any town meeting, and what people in this \ncountry and my State of Iowa are concerned about is the economy and \njobs. With 8.3 percent unemployment, why wouldn't they be expecting us \nto work on jobs? There is a small business tax bill that passed the \nother body. How come we are not\n\n[[Page S1608]]\n\ntaking that up? It is ready to take up. It would probably pass here \nwithout much dissent.\n  Why aren't we taking up a budget this year? It has been 4 years \nwithout taking up a budget. This is budget week for most years in the \nSenate. We are spending more time on deciding judicial nominees who are \nnot going to be filibustered to stop a filibuster that doesn't even \nexist when we ought to be taking up and spending about the same amount \nof time on a budget, but no budget for 1,040-some days.\n  The American people are sitting at home listening to the debate. They \nwant to know how we are going to get the unemployment rate down. They \nare not concerned about whether the Senate will confirm one of the \nPresident's district court nominees this week rather than next week. \nThey are not concerned about this debate we are going to have over the \nnext couple of days. They want to know what we are doing to help their \nfather, mother, brother, and sister get back into the workforce. Given \nthe millions of Americans who remain out of work, why aren't we \nconsidering and debating the jobs bill the House just passed?\n  Why aren't we tackling the energy crisis? With $4 gas in this \ncountry, we ought to be talking about drilling here and drilling now. \nWe ought to be talking about building a pipeline. We ought to be \ntalking about, how can we stop sending $833 million every day overseas \nto buy oil? We ought to be talking about extending the energy tax \nextenders that have sunset as of December 23.\n  Unlike the so-called vacancy crisis, the energy crisis is not \nmanufactured. It is real. The rising cost of gasoline matters to \nmillions and millions of Americans. If they are fortunate enough to \nhave a job in this economy, millions of Americans are trying to figure \nout how they can afford to get to work with the rising cost of \ngasoline. Rather than spend time working on the energy crisis, which is \nall too real for millions of Americans, we are spending time on this \nmanufactured controversy of somehow a vacancy crisis, somehow a \nfilibuster against judges. And not one of these judges has had one \nspeech given on the floor of this Senate against them, and probably \nwon't.\n  What is even worse, this is the week we are supposed to be debating a \nbudget, but you'd need a high-powered microscope to find any budget the \nmajority has put together. The majority has failed to produce a budget, \nso they manufactured a so-called crisis on nominations to throw up a \nsmokescreen to hide their failure.\n  I will have more to say on this subject when we move forward on this \ndebate, but for now I conclude that a fair and impartial examination of \nhow the Senate has treated President Obama's nominees reveals that, \ncontrary to what you hear from the other side, the President's nominees \nare being treated more fairly. Rather than waste time on the so-called \ncrisis that everyone realizes is entirely manufactured, we should be \nfocusing on those issues that matter deeply to the American people. And \naccording to what I hear at my town meetings, what I hear and read in \nthe papers about what polls show, what candidates for Presidents are \ntalking about--even the President of the United States--is about jobs, \nabout the economy, and tackling our energy crisis.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject these cloture petitions that have no \nlegitimacy for existing in the first place so we can get back to the \nbusiness of the American people--the economy and jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in morning business.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues today \nfor supporting an amendment by voice vote showing overwhelming support \nto the Transportation bill that improves ``Buy American'' provisions by \nmaking the waiver process more transparent, giving U.S. manufacturers \nfair and clear notice when a waiver is sought. It tells the Department \nof Transportation to report annually on waivers, analyzing what \ntaxpayer dollars are spent on foreign materials and infrastructure \nprojects. While some Members of the Senate may oppose it, it passed in \na voice vote, so, in some sense, unanimous almost. But while some \nMembers may oppose it, I hardly ever met anybody in the American public \nwho thinks taxpayer dollars should not go for any infrastructure \nprojects. That is the way you want to do it, and this legislation will \nmove us closer to it. The San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge was the most \noutrageous example, where much of that steel was made in China when \nU.S. steelworkers weren't all back at work the way they should be.\n  I thank Senator Boxer and Senator Durbin. I thank Senator Graham from \nSouth Carolina and Senator Merkley for their help on this legislation.\n  Today President Obama signed into law a trade enforcement measure \nthat last week passed this Chamber by unanimous consent. It is \nbipartisan legislation--which I cosponsored with Senators Baucus and \nThune, primarily--which gives the Commerce Department authority to \nimpose what are called countervailing duties on imports from countries \nthat are nonmarket economies, and that means countries with sort of \ncommand-and-control economies, such as the People's Republic of China.\n  Last year the Federal appeals court issued a ruling that hamstrings \nour Nation's ability to fight back against illegal Chinese trade \npractices. Here is why Congress passing this bill is so important. We \nknow China doesn't play by the rules, from direct export subsidies, to \ncurrency manipulation, to providing below-market loans to exporters. \nChina does things our country doesn't and many other countries don't. \nIt gives its exporters an unfair advantage.\n  American industries fight back by petitioning the Commerce Department \nto investigate these subsidies. Sixteen Ohio companies have petitioned \nfor this relief, including steel pipe companies in Youngstown, paper \ncompanies in Miamisburg, aluminum companies in Sidney, and tire \nmanufacturers in Bryan, which is in northwest Ohio near the Indiana-\nMichigan border. These are good companies. They are not looking for \nhandouts or an unfair edge; they want a level playing field. This \nlegislation does this. When countries such as China don't play by the \nrules, they suffer. This helps to fix that.\n\n  Also today, President Obama announced that his administration would \npursue a case at the World Trade Organization against China's hoarding \nof rare earth materials. Rare earth hoarding is one of the many illegal \ntrade practices China employs to tilt the playing field in its favor. \nU.S. Manufacturers rely--as they do around the world--on rare earth \nmaterials for the production of a number of products, including wind \nturbines and electronics.\n  China currently accounts for 97 percent of the world's materials. \nThey impose quotas and heavy tariffs on their export, putting American \nmanufacturers at a severe disadvantage. This almost forces companies to \ngo to China to do the manufacturing because of subsidies the Chinese \ngive to themselves, their own companies, and because of the tariffs \nthey can extract from these companies for export, these raw-material \nmakers for export, our companies are at a severe disadvantage.\n  Today the administration said that enough is enough. One Ohio CEO \ntold me when I visited his company in northeast Ohio:\n\n       As an Ohio-based manufacturing company with roughly 80 \n     percent of our sales outside of the United States, GrafTech \n     has a keen interest in protecting our ability to compete \n     aggressively in the global marketplace. Obtaining key raw \n     materials at a reasonable cost is critical to our mission.\n\n  They are not asking for handouts; they are not asking for subsidies; \nthey are just asking others to quit cheating.\n  Senator Portman and I have repeatedly urged the Obama administration \nto take this case. Senator Portman, who was a former Bush Trade \nRepresentative, who almost always is on the other side of major trade \nissues from where I am--we came together on this, as we have on other \ntrade issues that matter for our country.\n  In 2001 the United States had an $83 billion trade deficit with \nChina. Ten years later, last year, there was a $295 billion trade \ndeficit with China. President Bush once said that $1 billion in\n\n[[Page S1609]]\n\ntrade surplus or trade deficit translates to 13,000 jobs. So if our \ntrade deficit grew from $83 billion to $295 billion just with that one \ncountry, think of what it does to manufacturing in Springfield and \nAkron and Cleveland and what it means to a State such as Colorado, what \nit means to any States that make things in this country. Jobs are at \nstake, and addressing our trade imbalance with China is essential. To \ndo that, we must make China play fair with the United States.\n  Not too long ago, the Senate passed the largest bipartisan jobs bill. \nIn 2011 we passed my legislation on currency. The bill would curtail \nChina's ability to illegally manipulate its currency so they could \nflood our markets with cheap goods, undermining our workers and making \nit much more difficult for our companies to sell there. After years of \nChina gaining the benefits of WTL membership without adhering to the \nrules, it is time for the House of Representatives to again pass--as \nthey did when Speaker Pelosi was Speaker--they passed it with an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote. It is time for Speaker Boehner to bring \nup that legislation so we can vote for it. It will mean more companies \naround my State and around the country will be able to manufacture, \nwill be able to be competitive, will be able to export, will be able to \nplay in the global economy in a fair and balanced way.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Baucus \namendment No. 1825. Although I wholeheartedly support full funding for \nthe Payment in Lieu of Taxes, PILT, Program, I have to oppose this \namendment because it also includes a reauthorization for what is known \nas the Secure Rural Schools, SES Program. The SES Program was created \nin 2000 as a 5-year temporary funding measure to assist rural \ncommunities suffering from the loss of timber sale revenue caused by \npolicies that decimated the timber industry in the 1990s. Because it \nhas operated for more than a decade, communities have now come to rely \non it, turning it into a ``would-be'' entitlement program. Though, the \nprogram expired last year, and, as painful as it is, we must let it \nsunset for good. The Federal Government can ill afford to continue to \nforever finance what was supposed to be a short-term safety net.\n  I support extending full funding of PILT payments. These payments to \nlocal governments help offset losses in property taxes due to \nnontaxable Federal lands within their boundaries. I recognize that the \ninability of local governments to collect property taxes on federally \nowned land can create a negative financial impact, particularly in \nStates like mine that are dominated by Federal land. In Arizona, more \nthan 85 percent of the State is under Federal control. PILT payments \nare one of the ways the Federal Government can fulfill its role of \nbeing a good neighbor to local communities. Had this amendment been \nlimited to full funding for PILT, I would have voted in favor of the \namendment.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Keystone \nXL Pipeline project.\n  I support moving forward with the Keystone Pipeline. TransCanada \nneeds to resubmit an application with a route that resolves Nebraska's \nlocal concerns before we make the decision to approve this project. The \ncompany has said they will submit the application soon. I have voted to \nexpedite the approval process, and once the new application that \nresolves the Nebraska issues is submitted, the approval should be \ngranted.\n\n\n                  UNITED STATES RECOGNITION OF CROATIA\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to \ncommemorate the 20th anniversary of the recognition of Croatia by the \nUnited States. On April 7, 1992, the United States recognized the \nRepublic of Croatia, setting the stage for our two nations to build \nlasting U.S. Republic of Croatia bilateral relations.\n  Today, we remember all of the people who are responsible for creating \na democratic and free Croatian state and celebrate the enormous \nachievements since independence.\n  Twenty years ago, the people of Croatia had the willpower and \nendurance to fight for a democratic nation. Filled with the hopes and \ndreams of a prosperous, new sovereign state, the struggle was not an \neasy one. Independence never comes easily. Each country can attest in \ntheir own history to the enormous sacrifices and the period of \nunstable, unclear direction their nation was headed. However, we must \nnot forget those who persisted with their self-determination dreams. We \ncan now look back with immense pride in the founding of a country that \nhas accomplished so much in so little time.\n  After years of war and occupation, Croatia has made remarkable \npolitical progress since the end of the war more than 15 years ago. \nCroatia is a welcomed member of NATO and will soon become the 28th \nmember of the European Union, EU. At the end of 2011, Croatia completed \nthe negotiation process of EU accession, another milestone \naccomplished. Both of these landmarks came with enormous challenge, and \nI salute your achievement. There will be challenges on the road to this \nnew future as there have been in the past, but I am confidant Croatia \nwill face and overcome them.\n  Croatia is in a position to play a positive and leading role in \nassisting countries in the region in their efforts at Euro-Atlantic \nintegration. With the ambitious goal in mind of implementing \nobjectives, which are in line with the highest standards of good \ngovernance and partnership, I am optimistic Croatia will lend her \nexpertise to her neighbors. Joining the EU and NATO, with their shared \nvalues of democracy, human rights, and rule of law, is perhaps the best \nway to ensure security and prosperity in the region.\n  I use this opportunity to state how proud I am of my heritage. As the \nonly Member of the Senate of Croatian decent, I am deeply honored to \ncommemorate and celebrate the remarkable successes of Croatia. I am \nequally grateful to be witnessing such a pivotal moment in the many \nadvances of our two nations and to highlight the extraordinary \ncooperation between the United States and Croatia. Our relationship is \none to be admired.\n  Fifteen years ago, Croatia was a security consumer, with United \nNations peacekeeping troops deployed throughout the country. It is now \na security provider, with 481 troops deployed across the globe, \nincluding in Kosovo, the Golan Heights, Afghanistan, Western Sahara, \nIndia-Pakistan, Haiti, Lebanon, East Timor, and in counterpiracy \noperations in the Gulf of Aden. They even had staff officers assigned \nto NATO operations in Libya, a major accomplishment as we have seen \nhistory unfold in Libya just this past year. Croatia contributed to our \nefforts, and together, we have accomplished much.\n  Croatia's troop commitment in Afghanistan--350 is one of the highest \nper capita contributions in the International Security and Assistance \nForce there. Croatia has taken the lead in establishing a military \npolice training center in Afghanistan, to which other members in the \nregion also contribute trainers. This cooperation alone, in far away \nAfghanistan, involving countries that not long ago were embroiled in a \nvicious war, brings a certain stability to the region of the former \nYugoslavia and creates a unique opportunity. In our joint efforts to \ncombat global terrorism, the United States and Croatia have important \ntasks left ahead.\n  We are continuously working with Croatia today to create a great, \nlasting partnership. Cooperating with our southeastern ally has proved \nto be positive, with enormous payoffs for both countries. Together, our \nnations continue to work on all issues, including security, trade, \nbusiness, development, and diplomacy.\n  I want to reiterate my highest commemoration of Croatia's \naccomplishments in recent years of our history and express my sincerest \nappreciation for Croatia's determination in achieving the highest \nstandard of diplomacy with our Nation. It is my hope to see even more \nincrease in our exchanges, dialog, and joint bipartisan efforts between \nour two countries, with many more opportunities for cooperation in the \nfuture.\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GIRL SCOUTS OF THE USA\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. A century ago, Juliette Gordon Low proclaimed, ``I've got \nsomething for the girls of Savannah, and all of America, and all the \nworld, and we're going to start it tonight!'' This was the phone call \nto her cousin that started it all. Ms. Low believed in the power and \nspirit of young women and was determined to make a difference. And Ms. \nLow's dream of creating an organization to develop young\n\n[[Page S1610]]\n\nwoman for pursuits out of the house began with a simple call.\n  A century later in Congress and across our Nation we celebrate this \nwonderful organization that has built a significant and undeniable \nlegacy of empowerment. The Girl Scouts of the USA is one of the largest \neducational organizations for girls in the world and seeks to foster \nself-reliance and resourcefulness through outdoors activities and \nvolunteerism. The leadership skills and sense of civic awareness \nnurtured through an array of Girl Scouting activities has touched many \nlives, helping to mold strong, confident women.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of S. Res. 310 that designates 2012 as the \n``Year of the Girl'' and congratulates the Girl Scouts of the USA on \nits 100th anniversary. In addition, I supported legislation authorizing \nthe minting of a commemorative silver dollar coin in 2013 recognizing \nthis centennial celebration. These honors are richly deserved and a \nfitting tribute to the Girl Scouts. In Michigan, where more than 53,000 \nactive Girl Scouts reside, there are a number of celebrations planned.\n  Since its inception, more than 50 million women have taken part in \nGirl Scout activities. These young women have made a difference in the \nlives of others and in communities across the nation. From a group of \n18 in 1912 to an organization of 3.7 million today, the Girl Scouts has \nconsistently sought to shape the lives of young women through fun and \ndiverse scouting activities. The Girls Scouts of the USA has stayed \ntrue to its mission to ``build girls of courage, confidence, and \ncharacter, who make the world a better place.'' And we don't have to \nlook very far to see results. Impressively, near 60 percent of women in \nthe U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives are former Girl \nScouts. Indeed, successful women from all walks of life can surely \npoint to their Girl Scout experience as a valuable part of their \nformative years.\n  As we celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Girl Scouts of the USA, \nI am delighted to offer my sincerest gratitude for the difference the \nGirl Scouts has made in the lives of young women. From their humble \nbeginnings in Savannah, GA, to the impressive service organization we \nhonor today, the Girl Scouts has had a positive impact on our nation. I \nlook forward to the next 100 years of this remarkable organization and \nits members.\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO BISHOP TIMOTHY CLARKE\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Bishop Timothy \nClarke of Columbus, OH for his 30 years of dedicated leadership and \nservice to First Church of God. This past Sunday, March 11, 2012, \nmarked both Bishop Clarke's 30th year as Pastor and First Church of \nGod's 75th Anniversary.\n  Bishop Clarke began his work in January 1974, serving as Associate \nMinister at First Church of God in his hometown of Far Rockaway, NY. In \nNovember 1977, Bishop Clarke began his pastorate at York Avenue Church \nof God in Warren, OH, where he served for 4 years.\n  In February, 1982, he became the Senior Pastorate of First Church of \nGod in Columbus, OH. He was later consecrated to the office of Bishop \nin September 2001.\n  Bishop Clarke is a respected community leader in central Ohio and is \nthe recipient of many honors and degrees for his service. He has served \non the boards of various community organizations, and he has authored \nseven books.\n  Having worshipped with him and his congregation, I can attest to his \nsignificant impact on the community, and I am honored to call him a \nfriend.\n  Mr. President, I would like to recognize Bishop Clarke for his \ndedicated service as he and his congregation celebrate this joyous \noccasion of his 30th year as Pastor and the First Church of God's 75th \nanniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/13/senate-section/article/S1610-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                RECOGNIZING ARKANSAS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL\n\n Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, in 1912, the Arkansas Children's \nHome Society provided a safe haven for orphaned, neglected and abused \nchildren and opened the door to what is known today as the Arkansas \nChildren's Hospital.\n  Children's welfare has always been the focus but over the decades, \nits approach evolved. What first started as an orphanage transformed \ninto a hospital with the mission to help children most in need.\n  The facility has grown and thrived. The vision of the early hospital \nadministrators has been realized and the dreams continue to get even \nbigger.\n  Today the Arkansas Children's Hospital is a destination for children \nfrom all over the country to receive the best medical care available. \nJust as important, it is a place that Arkansas children can go, in \nState and close to home, for treatment for their illnesses.\n  This is a state of the art facility that is using the newest \ntechnology and developing cutting edge treatments and cures for \ndiseases affecting children. The scientists and doctors are advancing \nthe world of medicine to help children lead a healthy and happy life.\n  Arkansas Children's Hospital consistently ranks as one of the leading \nemployers in Arkansas. It is the only pediatric Level I trauma center \nin the State, and it is the sixth largest in the United States. \nThousands of Americans have experienced the renowned care offered by \nthe staff and facilities at ACH--many owe their lives to these world-\nclass doctors and nurses that work here.\n  This hospital is something the people of Arkansas can be proud of, \nboth its history and its vision for the future. I wish to congratulate \nDr. Jonathan Bates, president and CEO, as well as the administration, \nphysicians, residents, and support staff on the 100th anniversary of \nArkansas Children's Hospital and I hope for its continued success for \nanother 100 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/13/senate-section/article/S1610-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1610-S1613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING CASEY RIBICOFF\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, last year we were all saddened \nto learn of the passing of Casey Ribicoff, a remarkable woman and the \nwife of former Connecticut Senator Abe Ribicoff. In honor of Mrs. \nRibicoff, I would like to have printed in the Record the moving \ntributes that were given at her funeral by some of those who knew her \nbest.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Senator Chris Dodd--Casey Ribicoff Eulogy\n\n                       (Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2011)\n\n       Thirteen years ago, I stood in this same spot to say \n     goodbye and pay tribute to my friend and political mentor, \n     Senator Abe Ribicoff.\n       Peter, I am deeply honored that you asked me to share some \n     brief comments this morning to celebrate the life of one of \n     the smartest, most generous, elegant, funny, and downright \n     fascinating people any of us ever met--Abe's beloved partner, \n     Casey.\n       I first met Casey Ribicoff in 1974, during my first run for \n     Congress in Connecticut.\n       Senator Abe Ribicoff was himself up for re-election that \n     year and he invited me to campaign with him in New London. I \n     was excited. The former Judge, Congressman, Governor, Cabinet \n     Member, and Senator, was a larger-than-life figure in \n     Connecticut, and had been an influential force in American \n     politics for the previous 30 years.\n       My parents, who were deceased by 1974, had been friends and \n     colleagues of Abe Ribicoff's for many, many years, and I had \n     been in his presence on numerous occasions.\n       Now, there were many appropriate adjectives to describe the \n     Senator--able, thoughtful, perceptive, conscientious, \n     courageous, and eloquent, to name a few. Funny, fun-loving, \n     joyous--how shall I say this--were not exactly the words that \n     jumped out to you when you thought of the Senator. Abe \n     Ribicoff was a very serious guy.\n       So, on that fall day in 1974 when I first met Casey, right \n     away, I knew this woman was different--a vibrant, vital force \n     in any room. But on that day in 1974, something else was \n     different--Abe Ribicoff was different. Different than I had \n     ever seen him before. On that day, so many years ago, it was \n     wonderful to see the effect this striking vivacious woman had \n     on Abe Ribicoff.\n       I remember how much he laughed that day. In all the years I \n     had known him, I had never seen Abe Ribicoff have as much fun \n     as he was having with his lively Casey. What a difference she \n     made in his life.\n       That year, 1974, Abe Ribicoff was running for what he and \n     Casey knew would be his last term in the United States \n     Senate. I would wager that those last six years were among \n     the most enjoyable in their lives together. Casey and Abe \n     traveled widely, while deepening friendships with people \n     Casey brought into Abe's life and people with whom Abe had \n     developed a strong relationship in his public life.\n       When that last term was up in 1980, Abe was so gracious to \n     give the nominating speech for me to succeed him in the \n     United States Senate.\n\n[[Page S1611]]\n\n       Standing there with Casey, in the Bushnell Auditorium in \n     Hartford, Connecticut, listening to Abe's speech, I felt her \n     warm hand reach down to hold mine. Without uttering a word, \n     Casey instinctively knew how much I missed my own parents on \n     that very special day.\n       Now, as touching and sensitive as Casey was, she also had a \n     glorious sense of humor.\n       Several weeks after that nominating convention, I was with \n     the Senator and Casey. I remember the Senator saying to me, \n     ``Chris, I'll do anything I can to help you win election to \n     the Senate.''\n       Excitedly, I replied, ``Well, Senator, Monday morning at 6 \n     am, I'm shaking hands at the Greenwich railroad station--\n     would you care to join me greeting commuters?''\n       To which Casey, in a nanosecond, interjected, ``If Abe was \n     willing to do that, young man, he would have run again \n     himself.'' Abe roared with laughter. More than thirty years \n     later, I still start smiling when I recall that moment.\n       And, by the way, having just recently retired from \n     electoral politics, I now fully understand her comment.\n       But that was Casey: warm, funny and feisty.\n       After Abe retired, as so many of you gathered here this \n     morning will recall, he and Casey lived in Manhattan and \n     their cherished retreat in Cornwall Bridge, where they \n     enjoyed so many wonderful friends and times.\n       But they weren't strangers to Washington either. Abe and \n     Casey would come down every now and then--not to lobby, but \n     to see old friends.\n       Abe never once walked onto the Senate floor after he \n     retired in 1980.\n       Instead, he and Casey would have lunch in the Senate dining \n     room, where a stream of his former colleagues, Democrats and \n     Republicans, would gather to reminisce, and spend time.\n       Casey Ribicoff was as loyal and supportive a friend as you \n     could ever have. And if you were her friend, as so many of \n     you were, everything about your life was ``the best.'' Every \n     new job you got was ``the best.'' Every accomplishment you \n     achieved was ``the best.'' There is nothing quite like having \n     such an enthusiastic friend.\n       Now, I don't want to say that Casey was a gossip. So I'll \n     just say that Casey Ribicoff liked to know what was going \n     on--never in a cruel way, but always with a sense of fun and \n     curiosity.\n       She knew someone in every room, and always found a moment \n     to sidle up and say, in that low, melodious voice of hers, \n     ``Sooooooo?''\n       For those few here who may not have known Casey, let me \n     translate that word: ``tell me everything that's going on.''\n       For those of us who have faith in life beyond this one, I \n     can easily imagine her deeply engaged in conversation, not \n     just with the bright lights of her own time, but with the \n     great personalities of centuries past. I keep imagining Casey \n     and Oscar Wilde getting along famously.\n       I called Casey a week or two before she passed away. I \n     wanted to speak with her in my new capacity as chairman of \n     the Motion Picture Association of America to get some advice.\n       I had this idea. With this year being the 100th anniversary \n     of Ronald Reagan's birth, there were political tributes to \n     his life and career, but it struck me that more than half of \n     the President's adult life was spent in the movie business, \n     at Warner Brothers--and the Motion Picture business might \n     want to recognize the President's years in the movies.\n       I wanted to write Mrs. Reagan to see how she'd feel about \n     such an event to be held at the Motion Picture Association \n     offices in Washington. But I was smart enough to call Casey \n     first.\n       I knew that Casey and Nancy Reagan had developed a great \n     friendship due to the fact that both of their husbands had \n     suffered from Alzheimer's. I knew that if Casey thought that \n     such an event honoring President Reagan was a good idea, she \n     would share that with Mrs. Reagan.\n       And Casey, in that unforgettable voice, immediately and \n     enthusiastically said, ``I'll talk to Nancy.'' And she did. \n     On November 14th, we are going to have an evening of \n     recognition for President Reagan, and how I wish that Casey \n     Ribicoff were going to be there.\n       Allow me to conclude these remarks on this note: it is a \n     common refrain these days that we don't have enough leaders \n     like Abe Ribicoff in Washington. I think part of the reason \n     for that is that we don't have enough people like Casey \n     Ribicoff in Washington these days either.\n       Our politics has lost a lot of its civility, because our \n     political community has lost so much of its humanity. Casey \n     Ribicoff had an abundance of both.\n       She brought intelligence, laughter, warmth and enthusiasm, \n     not just to Abe's life, but to his and her world. And she did \n     it with a natural grace and timeless elegance.\n       To her sister June and nephew, son Peter, her daughter-in-\n     law, Angela, and her grandchildren--my former Senate Page \n     Andrew, Jake, and Jessica--I offer my deepest condolences and \n     my deepest appreciation for the many gifts Casey Ribicoff \n     gave to so many others in her life.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Remarks by Peter Mathes\n\n       Every son likes to think of his mother as special . . . but \n     in my case, as you all know, it's absolutely true. She was \n     one of a kind, and as everyone has said, trying to capture \n     who she was and what she meant to us is simply impossible.\n       But if you were lucky enough to have known her . . . to be \n     someone that she loved, you know just how special that was \n     and how it can never be replaced.\n       You all know she had a strong sense of what was right . . . \n     and what was wrong. She seemed to always do just the right \n     thing and she had a perfect sense of style that defined her \n     life. . . . You can only imagine how stress free it was to be \n     her son!\n       I've heard some of you say that she could be ``tough'' on \n     you if she thought you were doing something she thought was \n     wrong . . . really? Welcome to MY world!\n       But she was only tough on the ones she loved, and her love \n     for me was unconditional . . . but she was always clear about \n     what she thought . . . from the color of a tie to what I \n     should do in any situation. She had strong opinions . . . and \n     the most annoying thing of all, and something that I would \n     probably never admit to her, was that she was usually right!\n       But It was this sense of ethics . . . integrity, character \n     and honesty that she instilled in me from an early age that I \n     am most grateful for.\n       As many of you know, my mother was a great listener . . . \n     she had the ability to understand and simplify everything.\n       How many times did you tell her a long, complex story only \n     to hear her say: ``listen, the bottom line is . . .''? And in \n     two sentences she was able to cut to the heart of the matter.\n       As I look out at all of you I see friends from every part \n     of her life. From Chicago to Miami Beach . . . Connecticut, \n     Washington and New York.\n       The fact that you have been in each other's lives for so \n     long is a testament to the kind of person she was . . . In \n     order to have friends like this, you have to know how to be a \n     friend . . . and no one knew that more than Mom.\n       She was loyal and devoted, and seemed to have an endless \n     capacity to love . . . and she cherished each friendship. . . \n     .\n       One of the great gifts that I received from my mother is \n     each one of you sitting here today . . . You became her \n     family you became my family . . . you became our family.\n       There was a recent piece in the Sunday Times about how the \n     word ``authentic'' is suddenly back in fashion. As I read it, \n     I thought about my mother and how, perhaps, this is the word \n     that actually best describes her.\n       But perhaps the biggest miracle that happened for my \n     mother, and for me, was when Abe came into our lives.\n       They had a love for each other that is rarely seen, and my \n     mother kept the memory of Abe and that love alive until the \n     day she died.\n       She never traveled without a photo of her Abe on the \n     nightstand . . . in fact she continued to celebrate their \n     anniversary even after he died.\n       And this year was no different. Even though she was so sick \n     she told us all about the day they married and we celebrated \n     together with a bottle of champagne just as they always did.\n       Abe was the love of her life and a second father to me . . \n     . And of all the things I learned from them, nothing was more \n     important than how they loved each other and how they \n     cherished and protected that love.\n       She showed me that when you are with the right person it \n     brings out the best in you, which is why she was so happy \n     when I married Angela. She saw in us that rare love that \n     she'd found with Abe and she talked about how this is the \n     greatest gift of all.\n       I'll never forget when I first told my mother about Angela. \n     Of course one of the first questions she asked was: ``What \n     does she do?'' I told her she was the head of ABC Daytime, so \n     she immediately hung up on me and hit speed dial for Barbara \n     Walters to check her out.\n       Barbara simply said: ``Yes, I do know her. She's my boss.'' \n     So you know how happy THAT made her. Over the years she and \n     Angela were more like mother and daughter . . . in fact I \n     tell everyone that Angela became the daughter and I became \n     the son-in-law she always wanted! But the truth is seeing how \n     much they loved each other was a gift to me.\n       Like you, when I think of my mother I think of her spirit \n     and how she lived life to the fullest. . . .\n       The very first thing she said to the doctor when she was \n     diagnosed was: ``I've had almost 90 great years. . . . NO ONE \n     has had a better life than I''. . . . She was in control of \n     her life from the very beginning until the very end.\n       I've always been impressed with the way she lived her life, \n     but nothing was more impressive than watching the way she \n     chose to leave it.\n       Never once did she feel sorry for herself or question ``why \n     me''. She took the news as part of life . . . she couldn't \n     fix it so she simply dealt with it and moved on.\n       She spoke or emailed with many of you until the end, but in \n     the last months and especially in the last weeks, Angela and \n     I got to see this unbelievable strength of character first \n     hand.\n       She never complained . . . she wanted her life to be as \n     normal as possible. She continued to read 3 or 4 newspapers a \n     day and still had strong opinions on what was happening in \n     the world and what was happening in the world of fashion!\n\n[[Page S1612]]\n\n       Angela and I were with her in her final hours. . . . Each \n     tightly holding her hand, telling her how loved and how \n     special she was until she took her last breath. It was an \n     indescribable gift for each of us.\n       My mother was the first person I saw when I came into this \n     world and I was the last person she saw when she left it.\n       And have no doubt . . . she was Casey until the very end!\n       She still looked beautiful and was as intellectually \n     curious as ever. . . .\n       And of course, she still wanted to hear the gossip from all \n     of you!\n       We gave her an iPad for Mother's Day and in many ways it \n     became her life line. She was emailing and reading on it \n     until the end. . . . But . . . her confessed addiction on it \n     was playing solitaire!\n       In fact, when I opened her iPad after she'd gone, the first \n     screen that popped up was the score from her last game of \n     solitaire. She'd had a high score . . . and it read: ``YOU \n     WON! Congratulations you aced the game!''\n       And that you did Mom . . . you aced the game of life and \n     made us all better because of it. I miss you and I love you.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Remarks of Angela Mathes\n\n       First of all Jessye, I have to say thank you. I remember \n     when Casey spoke with Rabbi Sobel and told him that she \n     thought it would be ``Divine'' if you were to sing ``a little \n     Duke Ellington'' . . . and I have to say that you took divine \n     to a whole new level!\n       Chris, Barbara . . . I can't tell you what it feels like \n     listening to you talk about Casey.\n       And now, what it feels like standing here and seeing how \n     many people have come to celebrate my mother-in-law's \n     incredible life . . . Thinking of how many lives she's \n     touched.\n       But as many of her close friends will understand, the first \n     thing I thought of was calling her to tell her what she \n     missed . . .\n       Although I'm sure, as usual, she already knows all about \n     it!\n       And if there's anyone here who doubts that she still has \n     that power, I'd like to remind you that she's been sending \n     small signs that prove you're wrong: like the earthquake in \n     New York the day after she died . . . and the hurricane 3 \n     days after her burial!\n       As I was preparing for this tribute, I struggled trying to \n     find the words that best describe Casey . . . I had the same \n     problems I do when I try to describe her to people she's \n     never met.\n       One problem is trying to use ordinary words to describe an \n     extraordinary person.\n       Although for me, the biggest problem is that the first word \n     anyone hears is: ``mother-in-law''. . . . And it immediately \n     sends a chill down their spine. . . .\n       It's like hearing the words: ``teenage daughter'' . . .\n       Honestly, you can't imagine wanting to spend a lot of time \n     with either one of them!\n       But as many of you know, that wasn't the case with us . . . \n     Casey and I were very close . . . We spoke 3 or 4 times a day \n     for years.\n       I never felt like a ``daughter-in-law'' . . . Peter and I \n     were just ``the kids'', and as I used to tell her: ``you \n     can't get any better than that.''\n       We often talked about our mothers. About how much we loved \n     them and how much we missed them . . . and I remember asking \n     her one day to tell me what her mom was like.\n       She just smiled and said: ``she was DEE-lish!'' . . .\n       That when she walked into a room, everything seemed to \n     change . . . she made everyone in the room smile.\n       And I told Casey that THAT was actually the perfect \n     description of HER! Because it wasn't only about who she was, \n     but it was more about how knowing her enhanced YOUR life!\n       She was generous with her love to a lot of people, but with \n     me, she was generous in every way. And over the years she's \n     given me many very special gifts. . . .\n       Most of them came with a story, of how Abe had found it for \n     her, and now she wanted to share it with me.\n       She told me just how he gave her the gift . . . where she \n     wore it . . . why she loved it. Each thing represented part \n     of her life's story and for me it was a remarkable \n     experience!\n       But of course, this was Casey. . . . So each thing also \n     came with a set of explicit ``suggestions'': ``I always wear \n     these 2 things together . . . of course, YOU can choose to \n     wear it anyway you wish, it's up to you, but they do look \n     best together.''\n       Now for those of you who don't speak ``Casey'', let me \n     assure you, that it was NEVER EVER ``up to me''!\n       She taught me more, about the things in life I thought I \n     already knew all about, like the importance of friendship, \n     loyalty, and discretion. . . .\n       And she also taught me some very important things that I \n     never knew, like: Never wear a watch to a formal affair; \n     always wear your pins high not low; and never put moisturizer \n     on your nose . . . it clogs the pores.\n       Over the past 10 years, and especially over the last 5 \n     months, she shared a lot of stories with Peter and me . . .\n       She said that over her many years, she ``collected'' a lot \n     of things, but what she treasured most was her collection of \n     wonderful friends.\n       You know how much she loved you . . . you were her family, \n     and I know that she'd be angry with me if I didn't remind you \n     of that.\n       But you also need to know that the way you supported her, \n     and supported Peter and me over these last difficult months, \n     has meant more to us than we will ever be able to tell you.\n       I'm sure that everyone here has some GREAT Casey stories . \n     . . and so you can imagine how hard it was to try to narrow \n     it down to just one or two.\n       She was beautiful on the inside and the outside . . . had \n     that great sense of humor, was so smart, so confident . . . \n     she didn't suffer fools, and you can only imagine that, \n     coming from an Italian Mother, how in awe I was at something \n     I'd never experienced before: someone with no-guilt and no \n     regrets!\n       Casey taught by example.\n       She showed us all how to live, and in the end, she showed \n     us how to leave this world with that same grace, dignity, \n     sense of humor and style.\n       And make no mistake . . . she NEVER stopped living life on \n     her terms.\n       One minute she was telling Rabbi Sobel exactly what she \n     wanted done at her memorial service . . . dictating her death \n     notice to Peter, and the next, she and I were in Akris buying \n     a few little jackets for her to wear in the summer!\n       One day about a month or so after she was diagnosed, she \n     called me at home about 9:00 in the morning to tell me she \n     had an idea . . . she was thinking of selling a few things on \n     eBay . . . eBay?!\n       She was 89 years old with lung cancer . . . ONLY Casey!\n       But Casey told Peter and me 2 things to remember for this \n     memorial:\n       First: try to hold it together.\n       And second: keep it short. Two things, might I mention, she \n     knew would be impossible for me to do!\n       She'd say: ``it's called: get real!''\n       So, for her, I'll try my best to ``get real'' and tell her \n     what's on my mind:\n       My Dear Casey,\n       Thank you . . . thank you for taking me into your life, and \n     into your heart. . . .\n       For always listening and giving me the best advice in \n     difficult times, and being there to make the good times even \n     better. . . .\n       For confiding in me, and sharing with me all the wonderful \n     moments of your life.\n       And for encouraging me, and showing me how to enjoy every \n     moment of mine.\n       I love you.\n       And I will think of you, and miss you every day for the \n     rest of my life.\n       Peter and I will always be your ``kids'' . . . and we will \n     keep you alive in our hearts forever.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                       Remarks of Barbara Walters\n\n       I am Barbara Walters and I am here to represent all of you, \n     her dear friends. She was something else, wasn't she? All the \n     things most people strive to be, she just was. Can't you see \n     her? Elegant. Smart. (She took computer lessons at 80). Fun. \n     Stunning: Black hair, red lips, big smile. Mmm, maybe too \n     thin, but that was part of her look . . . Tom Brokaw \n     described her as ``a great dame.''\n       She was the most loving mother to son, Peter and Angela, \n     the daughter-in-law whom she considered to be her daughter. \n     And grandmother to Andrew whom she called the perfect \n     grandson and also so proud of Angela's daughter, Jessica. And \n     then there was Abe . . ., the love of her life.\n       On her tombstone Casey has asked to have engraved, ``She \n     was his wife.'' Of her own life she said, ``I loved every bit \n     of it.'' When Abe was alive, he and Casey were probably the \n     most popular and delightful couple in New York. Casey herself \n     was very active. She was on the board of the Kennedy Center \n     and PBS/WNET. She entertained, enjoyed the theatre-dinner \n     parties and people. She was a great friend to women. How I \n     miss our morning phone calls. She brightened my day and she \n     would love to have heard about this morning. And who came--\n     and who didn't come!\n       But I want to talk now not of Casey's manner of living but \n     of her manner of death. It was last March when on one of our \n     frequent phone calls I asked routinely, ``What's new''? And \n     Casey answered, ``I'm pregnant.'' At age 88, that was a good \n     trick. I laughed and said, ``name the baby after me, \n     please.'' Then she went on, in the same tone, ``No I have \n     lung cancer.'' For a second, I thought she was still kidding. \n     But then, I realized, she wasn't. Said so matter of factly, \n     ``I have lung cancer.'' I couldn't believe it. There were no \n     tears in her voice. No ``why me? Just that . . . ``I have \n     lung cancer.'' It had not been diagnosed until recently. It \n     was inoperable. She was not going to have any treatment.\n       ``Just please'' she said, ``continue to call. Send the \n     emails. Let me know what's going on with all the pals.'' And \n     pals she had. She was the best friend when you were well and \n     a tireless miracle worker when you were not. Doctor's \n     appointments . . . she was there for you. She went with Bill \n     Blass for his every doctor's appointment. She was counselor, \n     friend and comfort to Jerry Zipkin, Glenn Birnbaum and Nick \n     Dunn. Thanksgiving: she took a table every year for all the \n     single guys who might be alone. The dinners became tradition. \n     She was their Auntie Mame. Now those four words, ``I have \n     lung cancer.''\n       Peter and Angela began to come in from California almost \n     every week. They wanted to share as many of Casey's good \n     days, as well as the bad that were to come. At first, she \n     could go out a bit . . . maybe to lunch. Then she might allow \n     a friend to pop over. That soon got to be too much for her. \n     But the phone calls were fine . . . she took them all . . . \n     until they also became too much. Exhaustion took over.\n\n[[Page S1613]]\n\n       Still the emails back and forth continued . . . Less than a \n     week before she died, she was answering emails. ``How are \n     you?'' she would ask. ``How was the party?'' ``What do you \n     think of Michele Bachmann?'' From March to her death on \n     August I never once heard her sob. I never once heard her \n     complain. Or question her fate. When her son, asked in a \n     moment of intimacy, if she was afraid, she said ``no'' and \n     repeated what a wonderful life she'd had. Peter and Angela \n     were with her until the end. Thank heaven, she was never in \n     pain. As she lay in bed, looking frail but beautiful, Peter \n     held one of her hands, Angela the other. She knew they were \n     with her.\n       I am telling you all this because Casey not only taught us \n     how to live. She taught us how to die.\n       After her death, they found a secret stash of cigarettes. \n     Those damn cigarettes.\n       Oh my darling Casey, there isn't one of us in this sacred \n     room whose life you haven't touched, not one who didn't love \n     you. How could we not?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/13/senate-section/article/S1613-1", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO NORA WALSH HUSSEY\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I would like to take this \nopportunity to honor Nora Walsh Hussey of Sturgis, SD.\n  Nora has spent countless hours serving her community through a \nvariety of organizations and activities. Nora has been an active \nparticipant in Promoting Educational Opportunities, PEO, an \norganization where women celebrate advancement through achievements in \neducational opportunities. She has also spent a significant amount of \ntime volunteering as a Court Appointed Special Advocate, CASA, which \nsupports abused and neglected children. While Nora spends the majority \nof her time volunteering for various organizations in the community, \nshe also enjoys participating in bridge clubs, golfing, and cruising.\n  Nora's achievements are not limited to her work on behalf of South \nDakotans. In 1981, Nora was confirmed by the U.S. Senate to become the \nfirst non-Coloradan to supervise the Denver Mint. While supervising the \nmint, Nora was acknowledged by many employees for her exemplary \nservice.\n  I want to join Nora's family and friends in recognizing her more than \n50 years of community service and celebrating her 97th birthday on \nMarch 26, 2012. I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Nora for \nall she has done for her fellow South Dakotans and wish her continued \nsuccess in years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/13/senate-section/article/S1613-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bills were read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 2186.

Despite Mr. \nGross's stellar work record, the company brazenly demoted him and other \nemployees over the age of 50 and gave his job to a younger employee.\n  Expressly to prevent this kind of discrimination, over 40 years ago \nCongress passed the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, ADEA. Modeled \nfrom and using the same language as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964--which prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of \nrace, sex, national origin and religion--the ADEA makes it unlawful to \ndiscriminate on the basis of age.\n  When Mr. Gross sought to enforce his rights under this law, a jury of \nIowans heard the facts and found that his employer discriminated \nagainst him because of his age. That jury awarded him almost $47,000 in \nlost compensation.\n  The case was ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court. In June 2009, \nin Gross v. FBL Financial, Inc., five justices effectively rewrote the \nlaw and ruled against Mr. Gross. In doing so, the Court made it harder \nfor those with legitimate age discrimination claims to prevail under \nthe ADEA. In fact, on remand, despite the fact Mr. Gross had \nestablished that age discrimination was a factor in his demotion, he \nlost his retrial.\n  For decades, the law was clear. In 1989, in Price Waterhouse v. \nHopkins, the Court ruled that if a plaintiff seeking relief under Title \nVII of the Civil Rights Act demonstrated that discrimination was a \n``motivating'' or ``substantial'' factor behind the employer's action, \nthe burden shifted to the employer to show it would have taken the same \naction regardless of the plaintiff's membership in a protected class. \nAs part of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress codified the \n``motivating factor'' standard with respect to Title VII discrimination \nclaims.\n  Since the ADEA uses the same language as Title VII, was modeled from \nit, and had been interpreted consistent with the Civil Rights Act, \ncourts rightly and consistently held that, like a plaintiff claiming \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion and national origin, \na victim bringing suit under the ADEA need only show that membership in \na protected class was a ``motivating factor'' in an employer's action. \nIf an employee showed that age was one factor in an employment \ndecision, the burden was on the employer to show it had acted for a \nlegitimate reason other than age.\n  In Gross, the Court, addressing a question on which it did not grant \ncertiorari, tore up this decades' old standard. In its place, the Court \nimposed a standard that makes it prohibitively difficult for a victim \nto prove age discrimination. According to the Court, a plaintiff bears \nthe full burden of proving that age was not only a ``motivating'' \nfactor but the ``but for'' factor, or decisive factor. And, \nunfortunately, lower courts have applied Gross to other civil rights \nclaims, including cases arising under the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, the Rehabilitation Act and retaliation cases under Title VII of \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  The extremely high burden Gross imposes radically undermines workers' \nability to hold employers accountable. Bear in mind, unlawful \ndiscrimination is often difficult to detect. Obviously, those who \ndiscriminate do not often admit they are acting for discriminatory \nreasons. Employers rarely post signs saying, for example, ``older \nworkers need not apply.'' To the contrary, they go out of their way to \nconceal their true intent. And, only the employer is in a position to \nknow his own mind and offer an explanation of why a decision that \ninvolves discrimination or retaliation was actually motivated by \nlegitimate reasons. By putting the entire burden on the worker to \ndemonstrate the absence or insignificance of other factors, the Court \nin effect has freed employers to discriminate or retaliate.\n  Unfortunately, as Mr. Gross and his colleagues know all too well, age \ndiscrimination does indeed occur. Countless thousands of American \nworkers who are not yet ready to voluntarily retire find themselves \njobless or passed over for promotions because of age discrimination. \nOlder workers often face stereotypes: That they are not as productive \nas younger workers; that they cannot learn new skills; that they \nsomehow have a lesser need for income to provide for their families.\n  Indeed, according to an AARP study, 60 percent of older workers have \nreported that they or someone they know has faced age discrimination in \nthe workplace. According to the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, in fiscal year 2011, over 23,000 age discrimination claims \nwere filed, a more than 20 percent increase from just four years ago. \nAnd, given the stereotypes that older workers face, it is no surprise \nthat on average they remain unemployed for more than twice as long as \nall unemployed workers.\n  The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act reiterates \nthe principle that Congress established when it passed the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, the \nRehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act--when making \nemployment decisions it is illegal for race, sex, national origin, \nreligion, age or disability to be a factor.\n  The bill repudiates the Supreme Court's Gross v. FBL Financial \ndecision and will restore the law to what it was for decades. It makes \nclear that when an employee shows discrimination was a ``motivating \nfactor'' behind a decision, the burden is properly on the employer to \nshow the same decision would have been made regardless of \ndiscrimination or retaliation. And, like the Civil Rights Act of 1991 \nwith respect to discrimination cases under Title VII, if the employer \nmeets that burden, the employer remains liable, but remedies are \nlimited.\n  This is a common sense, bipartisan bill. In fact, the Civil Rights \nAct of 1991, key provisions of which served as a model for this \nlegislation, passed the Senate on a bipartisan basis 93 5. Further, we \nare introducing this bill only after countless hours of consultation \nwith civil rights stakeholders and representatives of the business \ncommunity. Moreover, this bill addresses many of the concerns that were \nraised about an earlier version of the bill at a hearing held before \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in March 2010.\n  In fact, I want to comment on two changes from that earlier version \nof this bill introduced in the last Congress. Since October 2009, when \nSenator Leahy and I first introduced the Protecting Older Workers \nAgainst Discrimination Act, we have had the benefit of nearly two and a \nhalf years of lower court application of the Gross decision.\n  The 2009 bill would have expressly amended the ADEA to make clear \nthat the analytical framework set out in McDonnell Douglas v. Green \napplied to that statute. Even though, before Gross, every Court of \nAppeals had held that McDonnell Douglas had applied to age claims, this \nclarification was meant to address a footnote in Gross in which the \nCourt arguably questioned the applicability of McDonnell Douglas to the \nADEA. Since the bill was first introduced, however, every lower court\n\n[[Page S1616]]\n\nthat has examined the issue has continued to apply McDonnell Douglas to \nthe ADEA. As a result, because McDonnell Douglas applies to the ADEA \nalready, we deem it unnecessary to amend the statute.\n  Second, the initial bill expressly amended only the ADEA. Since \nGross, however, lower courts have applied the Court's reasoning in that \ndecision to other statutes. Because the most notable application has \nbeen to the ADA, Rehabilitation Act and Title VII retaliation claims, \nthose statutes are expressly amended here too.\n  Finally, in Gross, the Court defended the Court's departure from \nwell-established law by noting that it ``cannot ignore Congress' \ndecision to amend Title VII's relevant provisions but not make similar \nchanges to the ADEA.'' In other words, the Court found that because \nCongress, in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, codified the ``motivating \nfactor'' framework for Title VII, but not for the ADEA, Congress \nsomehow must have intended Price Waterhouse not to apply to any statute \nbut Title VII.\n  Because of the Court's reasoning, I want to emphasize that this bill \nin no way questions the motivating factor framework for other anti-\ndiscrimination and anti-retaliation statutes that are not expressly \ncovered by the legislation. As the bill's findings make clear, not only \ndoes this bill repudiate the Gross decision itself, but it expressly \nrepudiates the reasoning underlying the decision, including the \nargument that Congress's failure to amend any statute other than Title \nVII means that Congress intended to disallow mixed motive claims under \nother statutes. It would be an error for a court to apply similar \nreasoning following passage of this bill to other statutes. The fact \nthat other statutes are not expressly amended does not mean that \nCongress endorses Gross's application to any other statute.\n  In conclusion, this bill is very straightforward. It reiterates what \nCongress said 40 years ago when it passed the ADEA--when making \nemployment decisions it is illegal for age to be a factor. A person \nshould not be judged arbitrarily because he or she was born in a \ncertain year or earlier when he or she still has the ability to \ncontribute as much, or more, as the next person. This bill will help \nensure that all our citizens will have an equal opportunity, \ncommensurate with their abilities, for productive employment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2189\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Older Workers \n     Against Discrimination Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In enacting the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of \n     1967 (referred to in this section as the ``ADEA''), Congress \n     intended to eliminate workplace discrimination against \n     individuals 40 and older based on age.\n       (2) In enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress \n     reaffirmed its understanding that unlawful discrimination is \n     often difficult to detect and prove because discriminators do \n     not usually admit their discrimination and often try to \n     conceal their true motives.\n       (3) Congress intended that courts would interpret Federal \n     statutes, such as the ADEA, that are similar in their text or \n     purpose to title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in ways \n     that were consistent with the ways in which courts had \n     interpreted similar provisions in that title VII. The Supreme \n     Court's decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., \n     129 S. Ct. 2343 (2009), departed from this intent and \n     circumvented well-established precedents.\n       (4) Congress disagrees with the Supreme Court's \n     interpretation, in Gross, of the ADEA and with the reasoning \n     underlying the decision, specifically language in which the \n     Supreme Court--\n       (A) interpreted Congress' failure to amend any statute \n     other than title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in \n     enacting section 107 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (adding \n     section 703(m) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964), to mean that \n     Congress intended to disallow mixed motive claims under other \n     statutes;\n       (B) declined to apply the Supreme Court's ruling in Price \n     Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989), a part of which \n     was subsequently approved by Congress, and enacted into law \n     by section 107 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, as section \n     703(m) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which provides that \n     an unlawful employment practice is established when a \n     protected characteristic was a motivating factor for any \n     employment practice, even though other factors also motivated \n     the practice;\n       (C) interpreted causation language and standards, including \n     the words ``because of'' that are similar in their text or \n     purpose to title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in a \n     manner that departed from established precedent;\n       (D) held that mixed motive claims were unavailable under \n     the ADEA; and\n       (E) indicated that other established causation standards \n     and methods of proof, including the use of any type or form \n     of admissible circumstantial or direct evidence as recognized \n     in Desert Palace Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. 90 (2003), or the \n     availability of the analytical framework set out in McDonnell \n     Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), might not apply \n     to the ADEA.\n       (5) Lower courts have applied Gross to a wide range of \n     Federal statutes, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.).\n       (6) The Gross decision has significantly narrowed the scope \n     of protections intended to be afforded by the ADEA.\n       (7) Congress must restore and reaffirm established \n     causation standards and methods of proof to ensure victims of \n     unlawful discrimination and retaliation are able to enforce \n     their rights.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act include--\n       (1) to restore the availability of mixed motive claims and \n     to reject the requirements the Supreme Court enunciated in \n     Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., 129 S. Ct. 2343 \n     (2009), that a complaining party always bears the burden of \n     proving that a protected characteristic or protected activity \n     was the ``but for'' cause of an unlawful employment practice;\n       (2) to reject the Supreme Court's reasoning in Gross that \n     Congress' failure to amend any statute other than title VII \n     of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in enacting section 107 of \n     the Civil Rights Act of 1991, suggests that Congress intended \n     to disallow mixed motive claims under other statutes; and\n       (3) to establish that under the Age Discrimination in \n     Employment Act of 1967 (29 U.S.C. 621 et seq.), title VII of \n     the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.), the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et \n     seq.), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 et \n     seq.), complaining parties--\n       (A) may rely on any type or form of admissible evidence to \n     establish their claims;\n       (B) are not required to demonstrate that the protected \n     characteristic or activity was the sole cause of the \n     employment practice; and\n       (C) may demonstrate an unlawful practice through any \n     available method of proof, including the analytical framework \n     set out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 \n     (1973).\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join Senators Harkin \nand Grassley in introducing the Protecting Older Workers Against \nDiscrimination Act. This bipartisan bill seeks to restore crucial \nworker protections that have been cast aside by a narrow, 5 4 Supreme \nCourt decision. The bill also reaffirms the contributions made by older \nAmericans in the workforce and ensures that employees will be evaluated \nbased on their performance and not by arbitrary criteria such as age.\n  Congress has long worked to enact civil rights laws to eliminate \ndiscrimination in the workplace. In 1967, Congress passed the Age \nDiscrimination and Employment Act, ADEA, with the intent to extend \nprotections against workplace discrimination to older workers. We \nstrengthened these protections in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which \npassed in the Senate 93 to five. These statutes established a clear \nlegal standard and Congressional intent: an employer's decision to fire \nor demote an employee may not be motivated in whole or in part by the \nemployee's age.\n  However, the 2009 Supreme Court decision in Gross v. FBL unilaterally \nerased that clear legal standard. A slim 5 4 majority threw out a jury \nverdict in favor Jack Gross, a 32-year employee of a major financial \ncompany, who sued under the ADEA. The jury had concluded that age was a \nmotivating factor in the company's decision to demote Gross and \nreassign his duties to a younger, significantly less qualified worker. \nBut a divisive Supreme Court ignored its own precedent and \ncongressional intent.\n  Five justices decided that workers like Mr. Gross must now prove that \nage was the only motivating factor in a demotion or termination. The \nCourt also required workers to essentially introduce a ``smoking gun'' \nin order to prove discrimination. By imposing such high standards, the \nCourt sided with big business and made it easier for employers to \ndiscriminate on the basis of age with impunity so long as they could \ncloak it with another reason. As Mr. Gross stated during a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing that I held shortly after this controversial decision \nwas handed down, ``I feel like my case has been hijacked by the high \ncourt for the sole purpose of rewriting both the letter and the spirit \nof the ADEA.''\n  The Supreme Court's divisive holding has created much uncertainty in \nour civil rights laws and it is incumbent on Congress to clarify our \nintent and the statutory protections that all hardworking Americans \ndeserve. The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act \nrestores the original intent of the ADEA and three other Federal anti-\ndiscrimination statutes. It makes clear that employers cannot get away \nwith age discrimination by simply coming up with a reason to terminate \nan employee that sounds less controversial. The bill re-establishes \nCongress' intent that age discrimination is unlawful even if it is only \npart of the reason to demote a worker. Under the bill, a worker would \nalso be able to introduce any relevant admissible form of evidence to \nshow discrimination, whether the evidence is direct or circumstantial.\n  To avoid future misreading of congressional intent, I encourage \nFederal courts to take particular note of the carefully negotiated \n``Findings and Purposes'' section in this bipartisan bill. The bill \nunequivocally rejects the Supreme Court's reasoning in Gross not only \nin age discrimination cases but in all cases where courts have applied \nthis case as binding precedent. In other words, Gross is not the proper \nlegal standard for anti-discrimination statutes, whether or not a \nparticular statute is directly amended by this bill.\n  I commend Senator Harkin for his efforts over the past three years to \nnegotiate a bipartisan bill to restore the civil rights protections \nthat all Americans deserve in the workplace. I also thank Senator \nGrassley, the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, for his \ncommitment to this issue. I urge my fellow Senators to join this \nbipartisan effort and show their commitment to ending age \ndiscrimination in the workplace. In these difficult economic times, \nhardworking Americans deserve our help.

Res. 395\n\n       Whereas the North Atlantic Treaty, signed April 4, 1949, in \n     Washington, District of Columbia, which created the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization (referred to in this preamble as \n     ``NATO''), proclaims: ``[Members] are determined to safeguard \n     the freedom, common heritage and civilisation of their \n     peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual \n     liberty and the rule of law. They seek to promote stability \n     and well-being in the North Atlantic area. They are resolved \n     to unite their efforts for collective defence and for the \n     preservation of peace and security.'';\n       Whereas NATO has been the cornerstone of transatlantic \n     security cooperation and an enduring instrument for promoting \n     stability in Europe and throughout the world for over 60 \n     years;\n       Whereas the NATO summit in Chicago, Illinois is an \n     opportunity to enhance and more deeply entrench those \n     principles, which continue to bind the alliance together and \n     guide our efforts today;\n       Whereas the new Strategic Concept, approved in Lisbon, \n     Spain in November 2010, affirms that all NATO members ``are \n     determined that NATO will continue to play its unique and \n     essential role in ensuring our common defence and security'' \n     and that NATO ``continues to be effective in a changing \n     world, against new threats, with new capabilities and new \n     partners'';\n       Whereas the Chicago Summit will mark a critical turning \n     point for NATO and a chance to focus on current operations, \n     future capabilities, and the relationship between NATO and \n     partners around the world;\n       Whereas the Chicago Summit will be the first NATO summit \n     held in the United States since the 50th anniversary summit \n     was held in Washington, District of Columbia in 1999 and the \n     first NATO summit held outside of Washington, District of \n     Columbia;\n       Whereas NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said, \n     ``Chicago is a city built upon diversity, and on \n     determination. Those are values that underpin NATO too.'';\n       Whereas the Chicago Summit presents an opportunity to show \n     to the world the Heartland of the United States--the site of \n     the first elevated railway, the first skyscraper in the \n     world, the busiest futures exchange in the world, and the \n     starting point for historic Route 66;\n       Whereas the thousands of visitors to the Chicago Summit \n     will have the opportunity to enjoy the hospitality of the \n     city of Chicago, the 77 distinct neighborhoods in Chicago, \n     and the State of Illinois; and\n       Whereas the contributions of generations of immigrants have \n     made the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois what they \n     are today and the ancestral homelands of the immigrants now \n     contribute to making NATO the organization it is today: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the service of the brave men and women who \n     have served to safeguard the freedom and security of the \n     United States and the whole of the transatlantic alliance;\n       (2) honors the sacrifices of United States personnel, \n     allies of the North American Treaty Organization (referred to \n     in this resolution as ``NATO''), and partners in Afghanistan;\n       (3) remembers the 63 years NATO has served to ensure peace, \n     security, and stability in Europe and throughout the world;\n       (4) reaffirms that NATO, through the new Strategic Concept, \n     is oriented for the changing international security \n     environment and the challenges of the future;\n       (5) urges all NATO members to take concrete steps to \n     implement the Strategic Concept and to utilize the NATO \n     summit in Chicago, Illinois to address current NATO \n     operations, future capabilities and burden-sharing issues, \n     and the relationship between NATO and partners around the \n     world;\n       (6) conveys appreciation for the steadfast partnership \n     between NATO and the United States; and\n       (7) expresses support for the 2012 NATO summit in Chicago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/03/13/senate-section/article/S1618-2", "month": "03", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1830.
