It is a great \nsuccess story that the United States has had an awful lot to do with \npromoting.\n  The South Korean Free Trade Agreement we passed overwhelmingly last \nnight on a bipartisan basis will only make our two economies stronger. \nOur already strong alliance will be even stronger.\n  These agreements should serve as an example of the kind of bipartisan \nlegislation Congress should be focused on right now.\n  Many of us have been amazed to witness, as I indicated earlier, the \nrapid growth and evolution of South Korea--truly a remarkable \naccomplishment.\n  So we welcome this great friend of the United States to our shores. \nWe hope he and his wife have a memorable trip.\n  As we face together the threat of North Korea and the rapid changes \noccurring in the strategic balance in Northeast Asia, we look forward \nto an even stronger alliance with South Korea in the years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6474]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Even though, as my friend, the \ndistinguished Republican leader, knows, I did not agree with the trade \nbills--what they did--I think it is a good sign of our working \ntogether. In spite of strong feelings on both sides, people put that \naside. There were no dilatory efforts made to hold them up, and we \nmoved forward. I think that is commendable. That should be the pattern \nfor the rest of this Congress.\n  I also want the Record to be spread with the fact that as far as \ncongressional action, this legislation would not have happened but for \nthe Republican leader.

Mr. President, we also need to focus on jobs. It is one of \nthe most important things we can do--I believe the most important we \ncan do. I am sorry that this week my Republican colleagues proved once \nagain that the only jobs they care about are their own. They voted \nagainst a plan to create 2 million Americans jobs because they believed \nit was good Republican politics.\n  Meanwhile, 14 million unemployed Americans are worried about how they \nare going to make their rent, put food on the table, and fill their gas \ntank or how they are going to get another job interview.\n  These 14 million Americans could care less who proposed the plan or \nwho gets credit to get them back to work. What they care about is that \nCongress gets to work putting them back to work.\n  Asked whether they support a plan to ask millionaires to pay their \nfair share to pay for tax cuts for middle-class families and small \nbusinesses, construction of roads and schools, and an extension of \nunemployment benefits, Americans have overwhelmingly said, yes, they \nsupport it.\n  The reason they do that is because, as we see in the newspaper \narticles around the country, the news stories: ``A quarter of U.S. \nmillionaires pay taxes at a lower rate than some in middle class.'' It \nis about a 17-percent average. That is untoward.\n  Two-thirds of Americans support both the plan the Republicans blocked \nthis week and the way it is paid for. Yet still, Republicans \nunanimously voted against these tax cuts, infrastructure investments, \nand jobs for teachers, police officers, and veterans. They voted, I \nrepeat, against 2 million jobs for American workers.\n  My Republican colleagues pay lip service to the unemployment crisis \nin the country, but in the end actions speak louder than words.\n  As Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, the first African-American woman to \nbe elected from the Deep South to Congress, once said:\n\n       The citizens of America expect more. They deserve and they \n     want more than a recital of problems.\n\n  The American people demand action. They deserve it. I hope my \nRepublican colleagues would have a plan to create jobs, other than the \nconstant talk about let's get rid of regulations, let's lower taxes.\n  Let's work together to create jobs. If my friends do not like what \nthe President put forward, come forward with something that is \nconstructive in nature. As Barbara Jordan said:\n\n       The citizens of America expect more. They deserve and they \n     want more than a recital of problems.\n\n  We can all recite the problems. There are lots of them. But let's \nwork together to create some jobs.\n  I was happy to hear from some of my Republican colleagues that they \nwant to work together to create jobs. I told one of the Senators: \nWonderful. Grab any one of the Democrats; they will work with you to \nhelp create these jobs. We need to do something. We do not need to \ncontinue to recite the problems. Please get off of this, I say to my \nRepublican friends, about lowering taxes as a way to create jobs. If \nthat, in fact, were the case, the Bush tax cuts would have put this \ncountry on an economic machine that could never have been driven so \nfast. But it did not help.\n  Eight million jobs were lost during the Bush years with these tax \ncuts. During the Clinton years, 23 million jobs were created. Let's \nstop the constant cry: We need to lower taxes. None of us are in favor \nof raising taxes. But certainly we need a fair tax distribution, and \nthat is why the American people are agreeing with us.\n  We are willing to work on regulations. There are too many of them. We \nall agree with that. But let's look specifically at what creates jobs.\n  One of the big issues we fought about last week was farm dust. OK. \nFarm dust. EPA does not regulate farm dust. They do not want to \nregulate farm dust. These are all just, as in the grocery business, \nloss leaders. It is only a way to confuse the American people. I \nrepeat, EPA does not regulate farm dust. They do not want to regulate \nfarm dust. Let's start talking about that which creates jobs, that \nwhich puts people back to work.\n  We are going to continue to do everything we can not to let the \nAmerican people down. We will not stop working to pass the proposals \ncontained in the American Jobs Act just because Republicans have used \nevery obstructionist trick in the book to stop it from moving forward. \nWe will continue to ask the richest Americans to share the burden of \ngetting our economy back on track, and we will never give up in the \nfight to create jobs for the 14 million people in this country who are \nout of work.\n  Remember, the American Jobs Act reduces taxes for everybody, except \nthose who make more than $1 million a year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/13/senate-section/article/S6474-3", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6474]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to, first of all, kind of tag on \nto the remarks of the leader for just a second. One of the things I \nwish we would do in this body is get out of the business of demonizing \ncertain segments of our population. Both sides are guilty of it, from \ntime to time. But I wish to particularly talk about the major employer \nof the United States--small business--and the leader's reference to the \n5.6-percent surtax.\n  Documents show that 392,000 American small businesses would be \nimpacted by a 5.6-percent surtax in order to pay for the President's \njobs bill. Records show that 72 percent of the American people are \nemployed by small business.\n  We have to ask ourselves this question: If we are interested in \ncreating jobs, why would we target the job creator that creates three-\nfourths of the jobs in America and put a surtax on them? It does not \nmake any sense. If there were sincerity in that offer, those people \nwould first and foremost be carved out on any punitive surtax and we \nprobably would have more employment.\n  I wanted to make that point. I will join anytime, anyplace, anywhere \nwith the leader to work on creating jobs because that is job one for \nthe United States of America.\n  I was a small businessman for 33 years, ran a small business for 22 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S6475]]\n\nI understand the heart and soul of small business. Today I come to the \nfloor to talk about two small businesses in Georgia and the effect of \nregulation on those small businesses and the decisions they have made \nthis year that impact employment and the economy.\n  One is a lovely lady named Susan Kolowich. Susan is a dear friend of \nmy wife's. My wife worked for her for 13 years, has not worked for her \nin the last 5 or 6 years. She opened a shop in East Cobb County, in \nMarietta, GA, 23 years ago called C'est Moi--``It is I.'' She loves \nFrance. She would go to France every year and buy, and she would bring \nback gifts which she sold in her gift shop.\n  It was a successful small business for 23 years, so successful that \nher husband Jim, who had been a Subway sandwich shop owner, decided to \nopen a restaurant called Cafe de Paris and join it with her C'est Moi \nshop so people could come and shop and eat and get a flavor of France. \nFor 10 years he ran the restaurant and for 23 years she ran the store \nsuccessfully. It was difficult in the last 3 or 4 years because of the \neconomy, but they stayed in business. But finally she threw in the \ntowel and sold the company. She sold her shop, and Jim, her husband, \nsold his restaurant. They sold them because they were up to here with \nthe oppressive regulation of our government and the continued threat of \nthings exactly like the surtax on their small business at a time in \nwhich sales are very difficult. That is not an abstract story, that is \nthe truth. I am sure it is happening in Mississippi, and I am sure it \nis happening in Wyoming.\n  Let me talk about a little bit larger small business, Hennessy Jaguar \nand Hennessy Land Rover over in Atlanta, GA. One of the principals in \nit is a guy named Steve Hennessy. Steve is a good friend of mine.\n  On January 3 of this year, I went to the OK Cafe in Atlanta to join a \ncouple for a meeting about some legislation. It is kind of the watering \nhole for breakfast in Atlanta. Everybody who is anybody kind of goes \nthere. It is a great place to eat. When I walked in the door and walked \npast the cash register, where you can see out into the cafe, to see if \nmy guests I was going to meet with were there, Steve spotted me. I was \nnot going to meet with him. He jumped up and said: Johnny, I need to \ntalk to you now. He ran across the restaurant. I thought he was going \nto give me a bear hug, he looked so excited. He got up close, and he \nput his index finger right on my chin. He said: I just fired a salesman \nand hired two compliance officers to comply with the credit \nrequirements of Dodd-Frank.\n  So regulation did create two jobs. It created two compliance \nofficers, but it cost a salesman. Well, if you are punishing the \nsalesman and rewarding the compliance officer, the economy is going to \ngo straight down because you are punishing productivity, you are \npunishing job creation for the sake of regulatory compliance.\n  Now, some regulation is good. I believe our job as legislators is to \nsee to it that we mitigate risks for the American people. But this \nadministration appears to think its job is to eliminate risk. Well, if \nyou eliminate risk, you stay in bed--when you wake up in the morning, \nyou stay there until night, you do not do anything because you do not \ntake a risk. Capitalism is about risk. Risk and reward are about our \neconomy.\n  So when people talk about regulatory oppression, those are two \nstories in Atlanta, GA, where regulation has actually caused two \nbusinesses to be sold and jobs to be lost and another business to hire \ntwo people to comply with government regulation and fire someone who \nwas in sales. It is backward at best, and it is wrong.\n  So I say to the leader, who did make an acknowledgement that he \nwanted to mitigate regulation, let's sit down and let's find out what \nwe need to do. Let's call a timeout. Let's do what Senator Collins from \nMaine said. Let's take a timeout for a year. Let's try to digest and \nabsorb the regulations we have passed without continuing to put more \nthreatening regulations on top of businesses at a time when we have 9.1 \npercent unemployment in America, and in my State we have 10.2. It is \ntime for us to be proactive on taking the shackles off American small \nbusinesses, not threaten them with surtaxes and not oppress them with \nregulation. Instead, let's work to empower small businesses to help us \ncome out of this recession.\n  I think my dear friend Senator Barrasso, the physician from the great \nState of Wyoming, wants to address precisely the same subject I am.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I am delighted to be joining my colleagues, Senator \nIsakson from Georgia, and Senator Wicker is here also from Mississippi. \nWe think this is very important.\n  The leader started talking about today and said we need to focus on \njobs. That is what we wanted to focus on for all of the time of the \nObama administration. But, no, the President ignored jobs--ignored jobs \nhis first year in office, ignored jobs his second year in office. Here \nwe are more than halfway through his third year in office, and finally \nthe President has noticed what has been on the minds of the American \npeople.\n  This is a President and a majority leader who forced through this \nbody a health care law that is bad for patients; bad for providers, the \nnurses and doctors who take care of those patients; and bad for \ntaxpayers, ignoring what the American people said they wanted to focus \non, which was jobs, the economy, the debt, the spending. We see a \nmajority leader who led this body to adding more to the debt--now $14 \ntrillion in debt--more debt, more spending, more money that is owed to \nChina.\n  We need to put Americans to work. We need to get Americans back to \nwork. The majority leader talked about 14 million Americans looking for \njobs. There are over 4 million who have not worked for over a year. In \nthat kind of a situation, it is going to be a lot harder for those \nfolks to ever get a job again--ever get a job again.\n  And the regulations just keep on coming. A month ago, the President \ncame to the Hill, visited, and had a joint session of Congress. He \nsaid: I want to get rid of some of these regulations. He said: I can \nidentify regulations--he came out with a list of about $4 billion worth \nof regulations--to lower the cost of business over the next 5 years. \nBut in the month of September alone, this administration came out with \n230 proposed rules and 338 final rules. And if you go to what this \nadministration says that those rules are going to cost the people of \nthis country, cost the job creators of this country, even the \nadministration, using their own numbers, that cost is going to be $10 \nbillion.\n  I heard our colleague from Georgia talk about the paperwork, the \ncompliance officers. Just yesterday, this administration came out, \nunder Dodd-Frank, with new rules and regulations--proposed rules. They \ntook only 11 pages of this massive bill, but only 11 pages, and when \nyou look at the 298 pages of proposed rules that have come out, what do \nthe government regulators, the Obama administration regulators, say it \nis going to cost the businesses of this country in terms of manhours \nhaving to be spent to comply with the paperwork? These aren't my \nnumbers, these aren't Senators Isakson's numbers, these aren't Senator \nWicker's numbers. Mr. President, 6,283,000 hours of paperwork. That is \nwhat the government experts say is going to have to be spent on \npaperwork to comply with one component of the Dodd-Frank law. How is \nthat going to help? How is that kind of a drag on a society going to \nhelp create jobs?\n  You know, the President says: If the Republicans have ideas, we want \nto hear them. The majority leader stood here and said: If the \nRepublicans have ideas, we want to hear them. Well, a month ago, a \nmonth ago to this day, when the President came to the Hill, earlier \nthat morning a number of colleagues, House and Senate Members, came to \ntalk about a Western Caucus Jobs Frontier bill, a number of bills \nRepublicans have proposed breaking down Washington's barriers to \nAmerica's red, white, and blue jobs.\n\n  The majority leader said we ought to spend more money. The President \nsaid we ought to spend more money. The President talked about his so-\ncalled stimulus plan, and he said it was going to save or create 3.5 \nmillion jobs. We have lost millions of jobs since this President came \ninto office.\n  The President talked about green jobs. He said his clean-energy \npolicies\n\n[[Page S6476]]\n\nwould create 5 million new jobs. We have just seen the Solyndra \nsituation--1,100 people fired because of bad bets by this \nadministration. This is an administration that should not be betting \nwith the taxpayers' money. It is not the administration's money. It is \nnot the President's money. That is why the American people are so up in \narms. They see what all of this spending is doing, and it is not \nhelping jobs.\n  I see my colleague from Mississippi is here. We can go back and forth \nand talk about this. I know he has examples and situations in \nMississippi. I see them in Wyoming all of the time, people having to \ndeal with the redtape coming out of Washington. The President talks a \npretty good game, but when you look at what is happening out there, the \nAmerican people are very disappointed. The American people deserve \nbetter than what they are getting from this administration.\n  So I would ask my colleague from Mississippi whether there are things \nhe sees happening to his friends and neighbors at home that we need to \nshare with the rest of the country?\n  Mr. WICKER. Well, there is no question about it. I appreciate my two \nfriends coming down and helping with this colloquy today.\n  There are two companies I want to talk about in a moment, but let me \nsay at the outset that we all want to create jobs for Americans, there \nis no question about it. The President came into office wanting to \ncreate jobs. The problem is, he has not let history be a guide.\n  If we go ahead with this second stimulus bill, we will be following \nthe same failed programs that not only have not created jobs for \nAmericans, but, as a matter of fact, the policies have made things \nworse for Americans and for job creation. The President's proposal and \nthe proposal the majority leader just embraced is a ``spend now, pay \nlater'' approach. It is one that has been proven not to work. Three \nyears after we tried this at the beginning of the President's term, we \nhave not put more Americans back to work.\n  This should be a glaring reminder of the failures of the first \nstimulus package and the probability and likelihood that this second \nstimulus package would be met with the same result. What we have seen \nsince the first stimulus is that the Federal debt has skyrocketed, \nthere are nearly 2 million fewer jobs, and the economic growth is \nlimping along at a meager 1 percent. So many other countries have a \nhigher GDP growth than that. It is tragic that our country has not kept \nup. The unemployment rate has hovered at 9 percent for 30 months in a \nrow. If you add in those who have given up looking for work or settled \nfor part-time work, that number skyrockets from around 9 percent \nunemployment, which is an unspeakable number, to some 16 percent. In \nfact, some 6 million people have been without a job for more than 6 \nmonths.\n  We know the President's policies are not working. We have seen very \nslow movement and, frankly, in many instances, that movement has been \nbackward. The big-government approach of spend now and pay later has \nsimply been a wet blanket for America's job creators.\n  The fact is there are some things on which we can agree. In this time \nof divided government, we must approach the idea of job creation in a \nbipartisan manner. The House of Representatives is controlled by \nRepublicans. This body is controlled by Democrats. The executive \nbranch, including the regulatory regime in this country, is strictly \ncontrolled by the Democratic Party. So we need to work together in a \nstep-by-step approach.\n  A comprehensive package of ``pass this bill, pass this bill \nimmediately without amendments'' has been rejected by both Democrats \nand Republicans in this city, and we now need to embark on a step-by-\nstep approach, and we can be quick about it. One example was yesterday. \nWhen we finally got around to it, the House of Representatives passed \nthe trade bills, once the President sent them to us. That was done \nyesterday afternoon. By 7 or 8 last evening, the Senate passed all of \nthese trade agreements on a huge bipartisan basis. So this is a step in \nthe right direction. There are other things we can do. But I wish to \ncommend the President for finally sending the trade bills to the \nCongress and for getting that done and opening the new markets. So that \nis a step.\n  The Senator from Georgia mentioned some companies and some potential \njob creators in his State. My friend from Wyoming asked me to talk \nabout examples in Mississippi.\n  Actually, my wife Gail and I had an opportunity to participate in a \nchristening of some boats in Gulfport, MS, just the day before \nyesterday. This was at the construction area of Trinity Yachts. I know \nwhat the initial reaction is: Why should we be concerned with yachts? I \ntell you why we should be concerned with yachts. Because we employ \nthousands upon thousands of Americans building those yachts.\n\n  I will never own a yacht. I don't aspire to even travel on a yacht. \nBut I am glad there are a bunch of people around the world who want to \nbuy them, because we employ a thousand people at Trinity Yachts, and we \nwant to increase that.\n  As a matter of fact, what we helped christen the day before yesterday \nwas not a yacht at all, it was two tugboats. Trinity Yacht makes \ntugboats, and they will be helping bring liquefied natural gas into the \nport of Pascagoula. So this shipyard built the tugs, Signet Maritime \nbought the tugs, and they will be creating jobs in Gulfport, and will \nbe creating jobs at the Port of Pascagoula, and they want to create a \nlot more jobs.\n  I was told by the management and ownership of Trinity Yachts that \nbusiness is a little soft in the shipyard. But if the President would \nsimply go back to what we used to have in terms of oil and gas \npermitting, if we would lift this de facto ban on oil wells in the Gulf \nof Mexico and get back to the business we had year before last, then \nbusiness could be great guns at Trinity Yachts.\n  We are not talking about yachts being constructed by Trinity, we are \ntalking about oil and gas drilling platforms. The quicker permits and \ndrilling projects in the Gulf of Mexico could bring about more than \n200,000 new jobs in the next year. That is a job creator proposal that \nis simple. All we need to do is enforce the law that is currently on \nthe books and get back to permitting so we can get back to producing \nour own energy.\n  The oil and natural gas sector is responsible for 9 million jobs, \naccording to the Congressional Research Service, and we have in America \nthe largest recoverable stores of natural gas, oil, and coal on Earth. \nSo if you want to know another Republican proposal--which is a \nbipartisan proposal when you get down to it, because our gulf coast \ndelegation consists of Republicans and Democrats--then here is a \nconcrete proposal: Let's get back to producing our own energy resources \nin the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere in the United States. Nine million \njobs, and it could be more.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. The Senator from Mississippi jogged my memory, and I \nwant to jog his. He was in the House of Representatives in 1994, if I \nam not mistaken. I got here in 1999. But I remember the first year of \nthe Clinton administration, when they put a luxury tax on yachts, yacht \nconstruction went out of business and thousands of jobs were lost. I \ndon't know if Trinity is a sub S, an LLC, or a sole proprietorship, but \nit is probably one of those three types of corporations, and I am sure \nit is a small business. They are going to have a 5.6-percent surtax on \ntheir income because of what is in the proposal of the President, which \nis, allegedly, to pay for a jobs bill. So this is deja vu all over \nagain. The administration is imposing more taxes to pay for government \njobs that take money out of the pockets of small business that creates \nthe jobs in America.\n  Trinity Yachts--and I will do some research to find out if that is \ntrue, because I don't know the company--I will bet is one of the ones \nthat pays their taxes as if they were an individual, and they would be \naffected by the tax the President is proposing, just like the yacht \nindustry that was put out of business in 1993 because of the Clinton \ntax. So the Republicans took over in 1994 and reformed the Tax Code and \ncut Federal spending.\n  Mr. WICKER. The point is, they are a bunch of average, hard-working \nMississippians, average, hard-working Americans, who are glad to come \nto work each day, working hard to build these boats, and we ought to \nencourage them.\n\n[[Page S6477]]\n\n  I don't know the corporate structure of that particular job creator, \nbut I know the larger point is that many of the job creators do pay \ntaxes at the individual level. We know from research that four out of \nfive of the taxpayers who would pay the higher taxes being proposed by \nthe President are business owners--the very people we are hoping will \ncreate jobs, and create them soon for Americans.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his stories, \nwhich are true and to the point. My story was about two small \nbusinesses. And I thank the Senator physician from the great State of \nWyoming, and I would ask if he has any additional remarks.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, I know you see this in Georgia and in \nMississippi. We know what doesn't work. We know what doesn't work is \nmore borrowing and more spending and overregulation and the threat of \nraising taxes on people and the job creators of this country. So there \nis much to be done, and that is why we actually came out with this Jobs \nFrontier--the western caucus did--because we want to increase \naffordable American energy.\n  The President, when he was running for office, said under his \nproposals electricity costs would necessarily skyrocket. If you want a \nproductive, vibrant economy, you need low-cost energy, and if you want \na secure nation, you need American energy to do that. So when my \ncolleague from the Gulf State of Mississippi talks about energy in the \ngulf, there is a lot there. I can talk about Wyoming from the \nstandpoint of energy being available on Federal land, which is being \nblocked by regulations. We ought to be exploring for that energy as \nwell as in Alaska. So there is much we can do to make our country \nstronger, safer, more secure, better, and more vibrant, but the \nproposal put forth by the President--and here I agree with my colleague \nfrom Mississippi--is another spending bill--just spending--as the first \nstimulus was. It is a bill that is not going to do what we need to do \nto get this economy going in a vibrant sense. From my perspective, the \nNo. 1 thing we should do is stop doing what we know doesn't work.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Well, I want to conclude, unless the Senator from \nMississippi has anything to add.\n  Mr. WICKER. Well, just to say this, and I will take a minute to say \nit and then I will thank my friend from Georgia for taking the lead on \nthis colloquy.\n  We also need to show job creators that we are actually serious about \nfixing our fiscal house. You know, we have had the Gang of 6, we have \nhad the Simpson-Bowles Commission, we have had Dr. Coburn and Senator \nLieberman with a proposal, and we have had Alice Rivlin's proposal--an \nexpert on budgetary matters. We know the solutions that are out there, \nand they are hard to do politically. They would subject us all to \nintense political criticism and a firestorm. But if we do it on a \nbipartisan basis for the good of this country now, for the good of not \nonly job creators today and people out there who are dying to come back \nto work but also for future generations, then we can do the right \nthing.\n  I will simply say this: I call on the President of the United States \nto give us some leadership on working together on a bipartisan basis to \nmake these tough decisions. If we do it together, as Ronald Reagan and \nTip O'Neill did in the 1980s, we can make the case to the American \npeople that sometimes you have to do hard things, but we do things on a \nbipartisan basis to create jobs and to make a better future for future \ngenerations. It will not be done unless the Chief Executive of the \nUnited States of America comes forward and signals a willingness to \nhold hands with us and do the right thing for the future.\n  I desperately hope in these final months of 2011 we can get that \nsignal sent to the committee of 12, and that we can work together to \nmake major, significant structural changes that will save our fiscal \nfuture.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Mississippi, and \nI will close by simply saying you have heard three Republicans this \nmorning talking about differences we might have on regulation and on \ntax policy, but you have also heard the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi, the physician Senator from Wyoming, and myself, from the \nState of Georgia, say we are ready, we are willing, and we are hopeful \nthat we can sit down together as a Congress--not as a partisan Congress \nbut as a bipartisan Congress--and find solutions to the regulatory \nproblems, find incentives for businesses to invest, and find ways we \ncan create jobs in the private sector, because in the end that is where \njob creation takes place.\n\n  I will end with where Senator Reid started in his remarks. Yesterday \nwas a landmark day. Republicans and Democrats came together and passed \nthree free-trade agreements which will create jobs in the United States \nof America. Our problem is we waited almost a thousand days to do it. \nLet's start accelerating those decisions that must be made to bring us \ntogether. Let's find ways to cut our spending, empower our businesses, \nand find ways to regulate in a positive way, not in a suppressive and \noppressive way on American small businesses.\n  Senator Wicker, Senator Isakson, and Senator Barrasso are three who \nstand ready to join in doing that, anytime, anyplace, anywhere.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/13/senate-section/article/S6477-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6477-S6479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am here to speak about what is \ncurrently an unpopular topic in this town. It has become no longer \npolitically correct in certain circles in Washington to speak about \nclimate change or carbon pollution or how carbon pollution is causing \nour climate to change.\n  This is a peculiar condition of Washington. If you go out into, say, \nour military and intelligence communities, they understand and are \nplanning for the effects of carbon pollution on climate change. They \nsee it as a national security risk. If you go out into our nonpolluting \nbusiness and financial communities, they see this as a real and \nimportant problem. And, of course, it goes without saying our \nscientific community is all over this concern. But as I said, \nWashington is a peculiar place, and here it is getting very little \ntraction.\n  Here in Washington we feel the dark hand of the polluters tapping so \nmany shoulders. And where there is power and money behind that dark \nhand, therefore, a lot of attention is paid to that little tap on the \nshoulder. What we overlook is that nature--God's Earth--is also tapping \nus all on the shoulder, with messages we ignore at our peril. We ignore \nthe messages of nature--of God's Earth--and we ignore the laws of \nnature--of God's Earth--at our very grave peril.\n  There is a wave of very justifiable economic frustration that has \nswept through our Capitol. The problem is that some of the special \ninterests--the polluters--have insinuated themselves into that wave, \nsort of like parasites that creep into the body of a host animal, and \nfrom there they are working terrible mischief. They are propagating two \nbig lies. One is that environmental regulations are a burden to the \neconomy and we need to lift those burdens to spur our economic \nrecovery. The second is the jury is still out on climate changes caused \nby carbon pollution, so we don't need to worry about it or even take \nprecautions. Both are, frankly, outright false.\n\n  Environmental regulation is well established to be good for the \neconomy. It may add costs to you if you are a polluter, but polluters \nusually exaggerate about that.\n  For instance, before the 1990 acid rain rules went into effect, \nPeabody Coal estimated that compliance would cost $3.9 billion. The \nEdison Electric Institute chimed in and estimated that compliance would \ncost $4 to $5 billion. Well, in fact, the Energy Information\n\n[[Page S6478]]\n\nAdministration calculated the program actually cost $836 million, about \none-sixth of the Edison Electric Institute estimate.\n  When polluters were required to phase out the chemicals they were \nemitting that were literally burning a hole through our Earth's \natmosphere, they warned that it would create ``severe economic and \nsocial disruption'' due to ``shutdowns of refrigeration equipment in \nsupermarkets, office buildings, hotels, and hospitals.'' Well, in fact, \nthe phaseout happened 4 years to 6 years faster than predicted; it cost \n30 percent less than predicted; and the American refrigeration industry \ninnovated and created new export markets for its environmentally \nfriendly products.\n  Anyway, the real point is we are not just in this Chamber to \nrepresent the polluters. We are supposed to be here to represent all \nAmericans, and Americans benefit from environmental regulation big \ntime.\n  Over the lifetime of the Clean Air Act, for instance, for every $1 it \ncosts to add pollution controls, Americans have received about $30 in \nhealth and other benefits. By the way, installing those pollution \ncontrols created jobs because they went to manufacturers to build the \ncontrols and to Americans to install them. But setting that aside, a \n30-to-1 benefit ratio to keep our air clean sounds like a mighty wise \ninvestment to me. That 30-to-1 ratio doesn't even count the intangible \nbenefits--intangible but very real benefits--of clear air and clean \nwater, the benefits of the heart and the soul, the benefits to a \ngrandfather of taking his granddaughter to the fishing hole and still \nfinding fish there or of the city kid being able to go to a beach and \nhave it clean enough to swim there or the benefit to a mom who is \nspared the burden of worry, of sitting next to her asthmatic baby on \nthe emergency room albuterol inhaler waiting for his infant lungs to \nclear.\n  Well, unfortunately, polluters rule in certain circles in Washington, \nand they emit propaganda as well as pollution, and they have been \nemitting too much of both lately.\n  Their other big lie the jury is still out on is whether human-made \ncarbon pollution causes dangerous climate change and oceanic change. \nVirtually all of our most prestigious scientific and academic \ninstitutions have stated that climate change is happening and that \nhuman activities are the driving cause of this change. Many of us in \nCongress received a letter from those institutions in October 2009. Let \nme quote from that letter.\n\n       Observations throughout the world make it clear that \n     climate change is occurring, and rigorous scientific research \n     demonstrates that the greenhouse gases emitted by human \n     activities are the primary driver. These conclusions are \n     based on multiple independent lines of evidence, and contrary \n     assertions are inconsistent with an objective assessment of \n     the vast body of peer-reviewed science.\n\n  Let me repeat that last quote.\n\n       Contrary assertions are inconsistent with an objective \n     assessment of the vast body of peer-reviewed science.\n\n  This letter was signed by the heads of the following organizations: \nthe American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American \nChemical Society, the American Geophysical Union, the American \nInstitute of Biological Sciences, the American Meteorological Society, \nthe American Society of Agronomy, the American Society of Plant \nBiologists, the American Statistical Association, the Association of \nEcosystem Research Centers, the Botanical Society of America, the Crop \nScience Society of America, the Ecological Society of America, the \nNatural Science Collections Alliance, the Organization of Biological \nField Stations, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, the \nSociety of Systematic Biologists, the Soil Science Society of America, \nand the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research.\n  These are highly esteemed scientific organizations. They are the real \ndeal. They don't think the jury is still out. They recognize that, in \nfact, the verdict is in, and it is time to act.\n  More than 97 percent of the climate scientists most actively \npublishing accept that the verdict is actually in on carbon pollution \ncausing climate and oceanic changes--97 percent. Think of that.\n  Imagine if your child were sick and the doctor said she needed \ntreatment, and out of prudence you went and got a second opinion. Then \nyou went around and you actually got 99 second opinions. When you were \ndone, you found that 97 out of 100 expert doctors agreed your child was \nsick and needed treatment. Imagine further that of the three who \ndisagreed, some took money from the insurance company that would have \nto pay for your child's treatment. Imagine further that none of those \nthree could say they were sure your child was OK, just that they \nweren't sure what her illness was or that she needed treatment, that \nthere was some doubt.\n  On those facts, name one decent father or mother who wouldn't start \ntreatment for their child. No decent parent would turn away from the \nconsidered judgment of 97 percent of 100 doctors just because they \nweren't all absolutely certain.\n  How solid is the science behind this? Rock solid. The fact that \ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere absorbs heat from the Sun was \ndiscovered at the time of the Civil War. This is not new stuff. In 1863 \nthe Irish scientist John Tyndall determined that carbon dioxide and \nwater vapor trapped more heat in the atmosphere as their concentrations \nincreased. A 1955 textbook, ``Our Astonishing Atmosphere,'' notes that \nnearly a century ago the scientist, John Tyndall, suggested that a fall \nin the atmospheric carbon dioxide could allow the Earth to cool, \nwhereas a rise in carbon dioxide would make it warmer.\n  In the early 1900s, a century ago, it became clear that changes in \nthe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere might account for \nsignificant increases and decreases in the Earth's average annual \ntemperatures and that carbon dioxide released from manmade sources, \nanthropogenic sources--primarily by the burning of coal--would \ncontribute to those atmospheric changes. This is not new stuff. These \nare well-established scientific principles.\n  Let me look for a moment at the book I talked about, ``Our \nAstonishing Atmosphere,'' published in 1955--the year I was born, more \nthan half a century ago--for the ``Science for Every Man Series.'' Let \nme read:\n\n       Although the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere remains at a \n     concentration of 0.03 percent all over the world, the amount \n     in the air has not always been the same. There have been \n     periods in the world's history when the air became charged \n     with more carbon dioxide than it now carries. There have also \n     been periods when the concentration has fallen unusually low. \n     The effects of these changes have been profound. They are \n     believed to have influenced the climate of the earth by \n     controlling the amount of energy that is lost by the earth \n     into space. Nearly a century ago, the British scientist John \n     Tyndall suggested that a fall in the atmospheric carbon \n     dioxide could allow the earth to cool whereas a rise in the \n     carbon dioxide would make it warmer. With the help of its \n     carbon dioxide, the atmosphere acts like a greenhouse that \n     traps the heat of the sun. Radiations reaching the atmosphere \n     as sunshine can penetrate to the surface of the earth. Here, \n     they are absorbed, providing the world with warmth. But the \n     earth itself radiating energy outwards in the form of long-\n     wave heat rays. If these could penetrate the air as the \n     sunshine does, they could carry off much of the heat provided \n     by the sun. Carbon dioxide in the air helps to stop the \n     escape of heat radiations. It acts like a blanket to keep the \n     world warm. And the more carbon dioxide the air contains, the \n     more efficiently does it smother the escape of the earth's \n     heat. Fluctuation in the carbon dioxide of the air has helped \n     to bring about major climate changes experienced by the \n     world in the past.\n\n  This is 1955. This is ``Our Astonishing Atmosphere,'' out of the \n``Science for Every Man Series.'' This is not something that was just \ninvented.\n  Let's look at the facts that we actually observe in our changing \nplanet. Over the last 800,000 years--8,000 centuries--until very \nrecently the atmosphere has stayed within a bandwidth of between 170 \nparts per million and 300 parts per million of carbon dioxide. That is \nnot theory, that is measurement. Scientists measure historic carbon \ndioxide concentrations by, for example, locating trapped bubbles in the \nice of ancient glaciers. So we know, over time--and over long periods \nof time--what the range has been.\n  What else do we know? We know since the industrial revolution, we--\nhumankind--have been burning carbon-rich fuels in measurable and ever-\nincreasing amounts. We know we release up to 7 to 8 gigatons of carbon \ndioxide each year. A gigaton, by the way, is 1 billion metric tons. So \nif you are going to release 7 to 8 billion metric tons a\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\nyear into the atmosphere, predictably that increases carbon \nconcentration in our atmosphere. ``Put more in and find more there'' is \nnot a complex scientific theory. It is not a difficult proposition. And \n7 to 8 billion metric tons a year into the atmosphere is a very big \nthing in the historical sweep.\n  So we now measure carbon concentrations climbing in the Earth's \natmosphere. Again, this is a measurement, not a theory. The present \nconcentration exceeds 390 parts per million.\n  So 800,000 years and a bandwidth of 170 to 300 parts per million, and \nnow we are over 390.\n  This increase has a trajectory. Plotting trajectories is nothing new \neither. It is something scientists, businesspeople, and our military \nservice people do every day. The trajectory for our carbon pollution \npredicts that 688 parts per million will be in the atmosphere in the \nyear 2095 and 1,097 parts per million in the year 2195. These are \ncarbon concentrations not outside of the bounds of 800,000 years but \noutside of the bounds of millions of years. As Tyndall determined at \nthe time of the Civil War, increasing carbon concentrations will absorb \nmore of the Sun's heat and raise global temperatures.\n  Let me end by reviewing the scale of the peril that we are facing if \nwe fail to act. Over the last 800,000 years, as I said, it has been 170 \nto 300 parts per million of carbon dioxide. Since the start of the \nindustrial revolution, that concentration is now up to 390 parts per \nmillion. If we continue on the trajectory that we find ourselves, our \ngrandchildren will see carbon concentrations in the atmosphere top 700 \nparts per million by the end of the century, twice the bandwidth top \nthat we have lived in for 8,000 centuries.\n  To put that in perspective, mankind has engaged in agriculture for \nabout 10,000 years. It is not clear we had yet mastered fire 800,000 \nyears ago. The entire development of human civilization has taken place \nin that 800,000 years, and within that 170 to 300 parts per million \nbandwidth. If we go back, we are back into geologic time.\n  In April of this year, a group of scientific experts came together at \nthe University of Oxford to discuss the current state of our oceans. \nThe workshop report stated:\n\n       Human actions have resulted in warming and acidification of \n     the oceans and are now causing increasing hypoxia.\n\n  Acidification is obvious--the ocean is becoming more acid; hypoxia \nmeans low oxygen levels.\n\n       Studies of the Earth's past indicate that these are the \n     three symptoms . . . associated with each of the previous \n     five mass extinctions on Earth.\n\n  We experienced two mass ocean extinctions 55 and 251 million years \nago. The rates of carbon entering the atmosphere in the lead-up to \nthese extinctions are estimated to have been 2.2 and 1 to 2 gigatons of \ncarbon per year respectively, over several thousand years. As the group \nof Oxford scientists noted:\n\n       Both these estimates are dwarfed in comparison to today's \n     emissions.\n\n  As I said earlier, those are 7 to 8 gigatons per year. The workshop \nparticipants concluded with this quote:\n\n       Unless action is taken now, the consequences of our \n     activities are at a high risk of causing, through the \n     combined effects of climate change, overexploitation, \n     pollution and habitat loss, the next globally significant \n     extinction event in the ocean.\n\n  The laws of physics and the laws of chemistry and the laws of science \nthese are laws of nature. These are laws of God's Earth. We can repeal \nsome laws around here but we can't repeal those. Senators are used to \nour opinions mattering a lot around here, but these laws are not \naffected by our opinions. These laws do not care who peddles influence, \nhow many lobbyists you have or how big your corporate bankroll is. \nThose considerations, so important in this town, do not matter at all \nto the laws of nature.\n  As regards these laws of nature, because we can neither repeal nor \ninfluence them, we bear a duty, a duty of stewardship to see and \nrespond to the facts that are before our faces according to nature's \nlaws. We bear a duty to shun the siren song of well-paying polluters. \nWe bear a duty to make the right decisions for our children and \ngrandchildren and for our God-given Earth.\n  Right now I must come before the Chamber and remind this body that we \nare failing in that duty. The men and women in this Chamber are indeed \ncatastrophically failing in that duty. We are earning the scorn and \ncondemnation of history--not this week, perhaps, and not next week. The \nspin doctors can see to that. But ultimately and assuredly, the harsh \njudgment that it is history's power to inflict on wrong will fall upon \nus. The Supreme Being who gave us this Earth and its abundance created \na world not just of abundance but of consequence and that Supreme Being \ngave us reason to allow us to plan for and foresee the various \nconsequences that those laws of nature impose.\n  It is magical thinking to imagine that somehow we will be spared the \nplain and foreseeable consequences of our failure of duty. There is no \nwizard's hat and wand with which to wish this away. These laws of \nnature are known; the Earth's message to us is clear; our failure is \nblameworthy; its consequences are profound; and the costs will be very \nhigh.\n  I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his indulgence for the extra \ntime, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.

Mr. President, I take this time to comment on a vote that \ntook place earlier this week that the people of this Nation are having \na hard time understanding--why the Republicans are filibustering \nlegislation that will allow us to consider job growth in America. It is \na filibuster, and that happens so frequently in this body that it seems \nto be standard operating procedure for the Republicans. But in this \ncase I think the American public realizes they have gone too far.\n  We have to create more jobs. We have to create more jobs so our \neconomy can grow. There are millions of Americans who are seeking work \nand cannot find jobs and they need work in order to support their \nfamilies. We need more jobs for our economy to grow.\n  We got into a debate in August about what we were going to do about \nraising the debt ceiling and we were all concerned about the deficits \nthis country has. Yes, we are concerned that our current deficits are \nnot sustainable, but we will not have a budget that is sustainable \nunless we have more jobs. You can look at all of the programs to reduce \ngovernment spending or to try to bring in more revenues, but if we do \nnot create more jobs we are not going to be able to get our budget into \na semblance of order.\n  The reason for that is simple. The more people out of work, the more \nreliant they are on government services and the less taxes paid in to \npay our bills. So for the sake of those who are seeking employment, for \nthe sake of our economy, for the sake of our budget, we have to create \nmore jobs.\n  We had a vote this week on moving forward on S. 1660, the President's \njobs initiative. It was a motion to proceed. It was a motion to bring \nthe bill to the floor so we could get into a debate about the best way \nto create jobs. Many of us thought we would have amendments that would \nenhance and improve the President's package. The President's package \nwas a starting point for our debate. But the Republicans said no, we \nare going to filibuster even the opportunity for us to consider jobs \nlegislation. They wouldn't even allow us to move forward.\n  We had a majority of the Senate. We had enough votes to pass it or at \nleast proceed if it were a simple majority, which is what most \ndemocracies believe is the right standard. But, no, we had a filibuster \nthat did not even allow us to consider the jobs bill on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  I find that most surprising. When you look at the President's \nproposal, the individual provisions have bipartisan support. This is \nnot a Democratic proposal. Every one of the provisions that\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\nthe President included in his package had bipartisan support. The \nCongressional Budget Office said the President's proposal would \nactually reduce the deficit and would create jobs. It has been \nvalidated by the outside experts. Marc Zandi, the chief economist at \nMoody's--he was also, by the way, the economic adviser to Senator \nMcCain during the 2008 Presidential campaign--said, talking about the \nPresident's plan, ``The plan would add 2 percentage points to GDP \ngrowth next year, add 1.9 million jobs, and cut the unemployment rate \nby a full percentage point.''\n  There are many others. Macroeconomic Advisers said that the \nPresident's package would:\n\n       Boost the level of GDP by 1.3 percent by the end of 2012, \n     and by 0.2 percent by the end of 2013--\n\n  In other words, we are moving in the right way; and then went on to \nsay:\n\n       Raise nonfarm establishment employment by 1.3 million by \n     the end of 2012 and 0.8 million by the end of 2013. . . .\n\n  The Economic Policy Institute estimates that the President's job bill \nwould create 2.6 million jobs over 2 years and protect an existing 1.6 \nmillion jobs.\n  Republicans say we cannot even talk about this on the floor, the \nmajority shouldn't at least be able to bring forward this issue so we \ncan have a full debate in the Senate.\n  The President's proposals included areas in which I think there is \nstrong bipartisan support--to help small businesses. We all know small \nbusinesses are the growth engine of America. That is where jobs are \ncreated. That is where most innovation will take place. The proposal \nwould help small businesses with new hires on their payroll and \nexpensing of investments so they have an incentive to invest in job \ngrowth. That is what was in the President's proposal to help small \nbusinesses.\n  In the President's proposal was help for our veterans. We all talk \nabout our warriors, our soldiers, out there every day protecting our \nvalues. They have represented America so brilliantly in international \ncombat. Now they are coming home to America. They are coming home and \nthey cannot find work, cannot find a job. The President is saying let's \nhelp them. We all talk about doing what we can to help our warriors. \nThis bill did something tangible about it.\n  What did the Republicans do? They filibustered an opportunity to even \ntalk about a bill that could help create more jobs.\n  The proposal also provides for infrastructure. Infrastructure is \nbuilding. It is rebuilding America. Democrats and Republicans agree on \nthat. We have to rebuild our bridges and our roads. The bridges are \nfalling down. Roads are in desperate need of repair. Roads help provide \neconomic growth for our country. It would help us rebuild America, \ncreate jobs through those who construct these new roads and bridges and \nelectric grids, et cetera, but then also make America more competitive.\n  It would help those who are unemployed in several ways. First, it \nwould provide not just unemployment benefits, which are important \nbecause they help families keep their homes and keep their family \ntogether and help our economy because that money is spent, it also \nreforms the unemployment system, so we train those who are out of work \nfor jobs that are available. In many cases, as the Presiding Officer \nfrom Ohio knows, those who have lost their jobs are going to have to \nfind employment in a different area. Well, the unemployment system \nshould be reformed so that they could be trained for those types of \njobs. That was in the proposal the Republicans would not even allow us \nto bring up. They filibustered rather than allow the majority to bring \nforward a bill to help create jobs.\n  The bill was paid for. As I have indicated before, it didn't increase \nthe deficit. The Congressional Budget Office said it would actually \nreduce the deficit.\n  I want to make the point I made earlier and underscore this: The \nmotion to proceed was the starting point for the debate--the starting \npoint. I had three amendments I wanted to bring forward--I am going to \ntalk very briefly about those three amendments--that I think would have \nimproved the President's bill.\n  One would allow the Small Business Administration surety bond \nprogram--this is a program that gives small construction companies the \nability to move forward with construction work. It would increase the \nsurety bond program from $2 million to $5 million. It was an amendment \nI offered to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Let me tell \nyou about the success of that program. As a result of increasing the \nsurety bonds from $2 million to $5 million, we saw a jump of 36 percent \nin 1 year, 2010, in construction work for small businesses. That is \nquite a success story. Guess how much money that cost the taxpayers of \nthis country in direct costs. Zero, no cost to the taxpayer. Well, my \namendment would make that extension permanent. And it is bipartisan--\nDemocrats and Republicans support it.\n  I have another amendment that would expand the infrastructure work to \ninclude water projects. Water projects are in desperate need. We have a \nhuge need to deal with the way we treat wastewater and our safe \ndrinking water. My amendment would add $30 billion for infrastructure \nin our water projects. It would provide $20 billion to the Clean Water \nState Revolving Fund and $10 billion to the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  I would like to talk about one more amendment, which is the cool roof \nbill I filed with Senator Crapo which would change the depreciation \nschedule for those businesses that put on modern roofs that are energy \nefficient and would create 40,000 jobs and help our energy policy. This \nis another amendment I cannot bring forward because the Republicans \nfilibustered the motion to proceed, so we can't bring up the jobs bill.\n  Well, Americans want us to consider jobs legislation. I hope we find \na way to do it. I can tell you that I am going to continue the fight to \ncreate more jobs for America because that is America's future. Our \neconomy depends upon it, and we need to continue to focus on how we can \ncreate more jobs for the American economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to remember a fallen hero, \nU.S. Army National Guard Master Sergeant Christian Riege. He and two \nfellow officers were killed when a gunman opened fire at a Carson City \nInternational House of Pancakes on September 6, 2011. This was a tragic \nevent. It ultimately took the lives of four people and left hollow \nhearts from Nevada to Nebraska, where his father and mother and several \nrelatives live.\n  Master Sergeant Riege enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1992. As a career \nnoncommissioned officer, Chris spent much of his time in uniform \ntraining young soldiers. He entered the Nebraska National Guard after \nhis service in the Navy. Like many National Guard NCOs, he held more \nthan one military occupational specialty. With experience as an \ninfantry soldier and knowledge of mechanics and supply logistics, Chris \nset the standard high for the soldiers he trained. He excelled in \nphysical fitness, and he was a natural teacher. He served a 22-month \ndeployment in Fort Irwin, California with the task of training units \ndeploying for overseas contingency missions.\n  Chris most recently served with the 1st of the 221st Cavalry in \nAfghanistan, earning his combat spurs during this tour. The decorations \nand badges earned over his distinguished career include the Combat \nAction Badge, the Meritorious Unit Commendation with oak leaf cluster, \nthe Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal with oak leaf \ncluster, the Army Commendation Medal, the Army Achievement Medal with \nfour oak leaf clusters, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, the \nSouthwest Asia Service Medal, and the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with \none campaign star.\n  Chris is remembered as a soft-spoken warrior with a love for fixing \nthings.\n  A fellow soldier and friend, Master Sergeant Paul Kinsey, made \nreference to his demeanor:\n\n       You can't just label him with one word or one phrase. Still \n     waters run deep.\n\n  The Riege family laid their soldier to rest in Page, Nebraska, on \nSeptember 17, 2011. Today, I join the family and\n\n[[Page S6481]]\n\nfriends of Master Sergeant Riege in mourning the death of their son, \nfather, fiance, friend, and fellow soldier. Nebraska is honored to call \nhim one of our own, and I know both Nebraskans and Nevadans will \nsurround his family during this very difficult time. As we honor this \nhero, may his children--Serrah, Erica, Synde, and Michael--always know \nthe bravery with which their father served and the love he had for \nthem.\n  May God bless the Riege family and all of our service men and women, \nboth here and abroad.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week I introduced legislation in the \nSenate that would prohibit the use of racial profiling by Federal, \nState, or local law enforcement agencies. The End Racial Profiling Act, \nS. 1670, had been introduced in previous Congresses by our former \ncolleague, Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, and I am proud to follow \nhis leadership. I thank my colleagues, Senator Blumenthal, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Kerry, Senator Lautenberg, Senator \nLevin, Senator Menendez, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Stabenow, for \njoining me as original cosponsors of this legislation.\n  Racial profiling is ineffective. The more resources that are spent \ninvestigating individuals solely because of their race or religion, the \nfewer resources that are being directed at suspects actually \ndemonstrating illegal behavior.\n  In response to a question about the December 2001 bomb attempt by \nRichard Reid, Former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael \nChertoff stated:\n\n       The problem is that the profile many people think they have \n     of what a terrorist is doesn't fit the reality . . . and, in \n     fact, one of the things that the enemy does is to \n     deliberately recruit people who are Western in background or \n     in appearance, so that they can slip by people who might be \n     stereotyping.\n\n  Racial profiling diverts scarce resources from real law enforcement. \nIn my own State of Maryland in the 1990s, the ACLU brought a class \naction suit against the Maryland State Police for illegally targeting \nAfrican-American motorists for stops and searches along Maryland's \nhighways. The parties ultimately entered into a Federal court consent \ndecree in 2003 in which they made a joint statement that emphasized in \npart:\n\n       The need to treat motorists of all races with respect, \n     dignity, and fairness under law is fundamental to good police \n     work and a just society. The parties agree that racial \n     profiling is unlawful and undermines public safety by \n     alienating communities.\n\n  Racial profiling demonizes entire communities and perpetuates \nnegative stereotypes based on an individual's race, ethnicity, or \nreligion.\n  I agree with Attorney General Holder's remark to the American-Arab \nAnti-Discrimination Committee where he stated:\n\n       In this Nation, security and liberty are--at their best--\n     partners, not enemies, in ensuring safety and opportunity for \n     all . . . In this Nation, the document that sets forth the \n     supreme law of the land--the Constitution--is meant to \n     empower, not exclude . . . Racial profiling is wrong. It can \n     leave a lasting scar on communities and individuals. And it \n     is, quite simply, bad policing--whatever city, whatever \n     state.\n\n  Using racial profiling makes it less likely that certain affected \ncommunities will voluntary cooperate with law enforcement and community \npolicing efforts. Minorities living and working in these communities \nmay also feel discouraged from traveling freely, and it corrodes the \npublic trust in government.\n\n  I wish to thank the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights \nfor their endorsement of this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe endorsement letter of September 14, 2011, from over 50 different \norganizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         The Leadership Conference\n\n\n                                    on Civil and Human Rights,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Sept. 14, 2011\n\n             Cosponsor the End Racial Profiling Act of 2011\n\n       Dear Senator: on behalf of The Leadership Conference on \n     Civil and Human Rights, and the undersigned groups, we urge \n     you to be an original cosponsor of the End Racial Profiling \n     Act of 2011 (ERPA). Passage of this bill is needed to put an \n     end to racial profiling by law enforcement officials and to \n     ensure that individuals are not prejudicially stopped, \n     investigated, arrested, or detained based on their race, \n     ethnicity, national origin, or religion. Policies primarily \n     designed to impact certain groups are ineffective and often \n     result in the destruction of civil liberties for everyone.\n       ERPA would establish a prohibition on racial profiling, \n     enforceable by declaratory or injunctive relief. The \n     legislation would mandate training for federal law \n     enforcement officials on racial profiling issues.As a \n     condition of receiving federal funding, state, local, and \n     Indian tribal law enforcement agencies would be required to \n     collect data on both routine and spontaneous investigatory \n     activities. The Department of Justice would be authorized to \n     provide grants to state and local law enforcement agencies \n     for the development and implementation of best policing \n     practices, such as early warning systems, technology \n     integration, and other management protocols that discourage \n     profiling. Lastly, this important legislation would require \n     the Attorney General to issue periodic reports to Congress \n     assessing the nature of any ongoing racial profiling.\n       Racial profiling involves the unwarranted screening of \n     certain groups of people, assumed by the police and other law \n     enforcement agents to be predisposed to criminal behavior. \n     Multiple studies have proven that racial profiling results in \n     the misallocation of law enforcement resources and therefore \n     a failure to identify actual crimes that are planned and \n     committed. By relying on stereotypes rather than proven \n     investigative procedures, the lives of innocent people are \n     needlessly harmed by law enforcement agencies and officials.\n       Racial profiling results in a loss of trust and confidence \n     in local, state, and federal law enforcement. Although most \n     individuals are taught from an early age that the role of law \n     enforcement is to fairly defend and guard communities from \n     people who want to cause harm to others, this fundamental \n     message is often contradicted when these same defenders are \n     seen as unnecessarily and unjustifiably harassing innocent \n     citizens. Criminal investigations are flawed and hindered \n     because people and communities impacted by these stereotypes \n     are less likely to cooperate with law enforcement agencies \n     they have grown to mistrust. We can begin to reestablish \n     trust in law enforcement if we act now.\n       Current federal law enforcement guidance and state laws \n     provide incomplete solutions to the pervasive nationwide \n     problem of racial profiling.\n       Your support for the End Racial Profiling Act of 2011 is \n     critical to its passage. We urge you to become an original \n     co-sponsor of this vital legislation, which will ensure that \n     federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies are \n     prohibited from impermissibly considering race, ethnicity, \n     national origin, or religion in carrying out law enforcement \n     activities.

The bill I introduced last week, the End Racial Profiling \nAct, would build on the Department of Justice's current ``Guidance \nRegarding the Use of Race by Federal Law Enforcement Agencies'' issued \nin 2003. This official Department of Justice guidance certainly was a \nstep forward, but it does not have adequate provisions for data \ncollection and enforcement for State and local agencies. The Department \nof Justice guidance also does not have the force of law.\n  The legislation I introduced would prohibit the use of racial \nprofiling by Federal, State, or local law enforcement agencies. This \nbill clearly defines racial profiling to include race, ethnicity, \nnational origin, or religion as protected classes. It requires training \nof law enforcement officers to ensure they understand the law and its \nprohibitions. It creates procedures for receiving, investigating, and \nresolving complaints about racial profiling. It would apply equally to \nFederal, State, and local law enforcement, which creates consistent \nstandards at all levels of government.\n  The vast majority of our law enforcement officers who put their lives \non the line every day handle their jobs with professionalism, \ndiligence, and fidelity to the rule of law. However, Congress and the \nJustice Department can still take steps to prohibit racial profiling \nand root out its use. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nenact this very important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to address the economy as it \naffects my home State of Nevada.\n  This recession has hit my home State of Nevada harder than it has hit \nany other State in the country. My State has the unfortunate \ndistinction of leading the Nation in unemployment, foreclosure, and \nbankruptcy.\n  As we discuss yet another stimulus this week, I hear from my friends \non the other side of the aisle their claim that their priorities are \njobs, jobs, jobs. I have one question about their economic policies: Is \nthis working?\n  In January 2009 President Obama was inaugurated as President of the \nUnited States. Democrats controlled both Houses--both the House and the \nSenate--and Nevada's unemployment rate at that time was 9.4 percent. \nThe next month the stimulus was passed. Supporters claimed the national \nunemployment level would not rise above 8 percent if we passed the \nstimulus bill. Nevada's unemployment at that time then grew from 9.4 \npercent to 10.1 percent.\n  In June of 2009 Congress passed the Cash for Clunkers legislation and \nNevada's unemployment then grew at that point from 10.1 percent to 12 \npercent. With the success of Cash for Clunkers, we passed Cash for \nClunkers II the following August, and Nevada's unemployment rose from \n12 percent to 13.2 percent.\n  Then in March of 2010, Congress passed the President's health care \nlaw. Nevada's unemployment rose again, from 13.2 percent to 13.4 \npercent.\n  In July of that year, Congress then passed the Dodd-Frank reform of \nthe financial services industry legislation that effectively limited \naccess to capital, both for individuals and small businesses, and \nNevada's unemployment rate went from 13.4 percent to 14.3 percent. In \nfact, if we go back to May of 2010, Nevada overtook Michigan as the \nState with the highest unemployment rate at 14 percent. With the \npassage of Dodd-Frank, it then rose again to 14.3 percent.\n  Then we passed the State bailout in August of 2010, and then stimulus \nNo. 2, and Nevada's unemployment rate rose again to 14.4 percent. So \nwith the unemployment rate at 14.4 percent and due to the lack of \neconomic activity, some people in Nevada have stopped looking for work \nor, worse, some Nevadans have actually left the State for employment \nelsewhere. This has resulted in Nevada's unemployment dipping from 14.4 \npercent to 13.4 percent.\n  I guess I raise the question for the second time: Have these economic \npolicies worked?\n  There is a local paper that had a readers' poll and the question of \nthis readers; poll was: Is Nevada's economy recovering? Of those who \nresponded, 82 percent said no. So regardless of what Washington, DC, is \ntrying to tell them, 82 percent of Nevadans understand that the \neconomic recovery has not yet occurred in the State of Nevada.\n  One of my constituents recently wrote:\n\n       I am writing you today because I am outraged over the \n     stimulus proposal that President Obama is trying to \n     intimidate you into passing. Despite the evidence that the \n     first two stimulus plans have failed, despite the promises \n     that there were shovel ready jobs, despite the other false \n     promises that the first trillion would upgrade our \n     infrastructure and keep unemployment under 8 percent, despite \n     the overwhelming evidence that nearly a TRILLION dollars of \n     taxpayers' dollars were completely wasted in the first \n     stimulus, this President had the audacity to demand that you \n     immediately pass another half a trillion dollars' worth of \n     stimulus. Don't do it!\n\n  So it is that the approach of this administration and its supporters \nhave taken for economic recovery has failed miserably. Another stimulus \nbill is not the solution.\n  We now have a string of economic policies that are big on talking \npoints, light on solutions. People from all over the country are \nstruggling just to get by and are desperate for real solutions. It is \ntime for new ideas and a new direction, not more of the same. Out-of-\ncontrol spending, a health care law that no one can afford, and a \nseemingly endless stream of regulations are crippling employers, \nstifling economic growth, and killing jobs. The American public and \nbusinesses alike are awaiting a plan that can provide the stability and \ncertainty necessary to provide confidence to the American people and \nbolster economic growth.\n  I hear some of my friends on the other side of the aisle claim there \nare no ideas for job creation coming from Republicans. Since coming to \nthe Senate, I have repeatedly filed job-related amendments when given \nthe opportunity but have yet to see an open debate on any of these \namendments. So if it is true there are no ideas coming from \nRepublicans, then there is nothing to fear from an honest, real debate \non jobs. Instead of symbolic votes and political grandstanding, let's \nactually do the difficult work and address this problem.\n  As I suggested to President Obama, Nevada needs a proposal that \nreforms the Tax Code, stops excessive government spending, and provides \nthe certainty businesses need to hire. Instead, the administration and \nthe Senate majority have recycled the same failed policies, but this \ntime they increase taxes on the same businesses we need to create jobs.\n\n  There are a number of actions Congress can take immediately to \nbolster our Nation's economy such as opening our country to energy \nexploration, streamlining the permitting process for responsible \ndevelopment of our domestic resources, and reforming our Tax Code, \nmaking it simpler for individuals and businesses alike, and cutting out \nthe special-interest loopholes while reducing the overall tax burden \nfor all Americans. Instead of looking for new ways to tax the American \npublic and our job creators, we should make our Tax Code more \ncompetitive and provide businesses the stability they need to grow and \ncreate jobs.\n  As I have stated before, this continual threat of tax increases feeds \nthe uncertainty that serves as an impediment to economic growth. These \nare all things that both this administration and Congress can do \nimmediately to boost economic recovery.\n  I came to Washington to make a difference. Let's start doing the hard \nwork we were sent here to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am here on the floor today to share a few \nthoughts on a topic that has a daily impact upon the lives of \nAmericans. It is the topic we have had front and center now for a long \ntime--job creation. Whether a mom or dad can find a job directly \nimpacts their ability to put food on their family's table, pay their \nmortgage, save for their children's education, and prepare for their \nown retirement.\n  In August our economy failed to create any jobs. In September our \neconomy created about 100,000 jobs, but that is not fast enough to get \nus out of our economic slump. The fact is that 14 million Americans are \nstill out of work, and about 42 percent of those unemployed have been \nlooking for a job for more than 6 months. We know those facts.\n  Over the last few weeks, I have asked Kansans what their thoughts are \nabout this circumstance, and we find many Kansans, as are others in \nAmerica, discouraged, looking for work, unable to find a job. They want \nto know why our businesses are not creating those jobs and making them \navailable for them.\n\n  I recently had the opportunity to sit down with Kansans who own \nbusinesses in Overland Park--a suburb of Kansas City--and in \nHutchinson--a community just outside Wichita--to talk about the economy \nand their outlook for our economic future.\n  Throughout our conversations, it became clear the main reason \nbusinesses are not hiring is because of economic uncertainty. In fact, \na survey conducted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce indicated more than \nhalf of small business executives cited economic uncertainty as the \ngreatest obstacle to hiring more employees.\n  From a business owner's perspective, I can understand why they are \nreluctant; if they do not know how much they will have to pay in taxes \nor to comply with additional regulations a year from now or how much \nhealth care costs will be for any new employee, why would they hire a \nnew employee now or invest in their business? Any successful business \nowner will tell us they have to take risks to get ahead, but they will \nalso tell us they have to balance those risks against their expected \ncosts or they will run their business into the ground.\n  One chief executive put it this way:\n\n       What are the rules of the game going to be in the long \n     term? What our retailers would like to have is consistency \n     and predictability. We can handle decisions we don't agree \n     with, but that's easier than not knowing what the decision is \n     going to be.\n\n  Another executive of a small business put it very plainly:\n\n       Among the other presidents and CEOs I interact with, the \n     only consensus of opinion is none of us has any idea where \n     things are going. In my observation, the uncertainty we are \n     experiencing is caused almost entirely out of Washington and \n     other governments around the world.\n\n  The reality is the private sector has been the engine of job creation \nin our country throughout history. So we should do everything we can to \nencourage business to create jobs. In fact, small businesses represent \n99.7 percent of all employer firms and employ half of all private \nsector employees, according to the Small Business Administration. In \nthe last two decades, they have generated 65 percent of the new jobs \ncreated in our country.\n  One of the greatest opportunities we have to improve someone's life \nis to create an environment where jobs can be created, so employers can \nfeel confident about investing in their companies, and they can put \npeople to work.\n  Today, I wish to outline a new approach, one that is based on a \nproven track record of success--the success of the American \nentrepreneur. Soon I will be introducing legislation called the Startup \nAct to help jump-start our economy through the creation and growth of \nnew businesses.\n  The American dream is based on the principle that anyone can achieve \nsuccess, given the freedom and opportunity to make a better life for \nthemselves and their families. America has long been known as the land \nof opportunity, where individuals risk all they have to live out their \ndreams. Many Fortune 500 companies, such as Ford, Apple, and General \nElectric, got their start with a handful of folks, an individual, a \ngreat idea, and a lot of hard work. Many of our businesses started in \ngarages across our country. So we should continue to encourage this \nspirit of entrepreneurship in our Nation.\n  In Kansas City, there is a foundation dedicated to the promotion of \nentrepreneurship called the Kauffman Foundation. Their research shows \nthat between 1980 and 2005, companies less than 5 years old accounted \nfor nearly all the new job growth in the United States. In fact, new \nfirms create about 3 million jobs each year. For 45 years, the Kauffman \nFoundation has worked to strengthen opportunities for entrepreneurs in \nthis country, so when a person comes up with a good idea, they can \npursue it and turn it into reality.\n  Many of their good ideas are reflected in the legislation I will soon \nbe introducing and are based upon Kauffman's extensive research and \nanalysis.\n  The foundation of the Startup Act is based on five progrowth \nprinciples: removing barriers to growth, attracting business \ninvestment, bringing more research from the laboratory to the \nmarketplace, attracting and retaining entrepreneurial talent, and \nencouraging progrowth State and local policies.\n  First, the Startup Act will remove barriers to growth by streamlining \nFederal regulations. Rather than hiring new employees, businesses are \nspending money on complying with unreasonable regulations, sometimes \nregulations not based upon sound science. New businesses face an \nespecially heavy burden in complying with the multitude of local, \nState, and Federal rules governing their business.\n  According to the SBA, firms with fewer than 20 employees spend 36 \npercent more per employee than larger firms to comply with Federal \nregulations. Very small firms spend 4\\1/2\\ times as much per employee \nto comply with environmental regulations and 3 times more per employee \non tax compliance than the largest corporations.\n  When I met with those business leaders in Kansas City recently, one \nof them told me he was required to replace all the light bulbs in his \nfactory because of an EPA regulation. But his factory has skylights and \nwas already well lit. He did not need new lighting, but the government \ntold him he did, and this unnecessary regulation cost him tens of \nthousands of dollars. This is just one example of how cumbersome and \nhow costly regulations have become. That money could have and should \nhave been, in my view, better spent on helping that business grow.\n  The Startup Act will overhaul the Federal regulatory process for all \nregulations that have an impact on the economy of $100 million or more. \nBy requiring these rules to undergo a cost-benefit analysis every 10 \nyears, the benefit and burden on businesses and consumers will become \nmuch more clear. This will ease the burden on businesses so they can \nfocus on growing their business and hiring more workers.\n  Second, the Startup Act will help companies attract investment so \nthey can get off the ground and grow more quickly. One of the greatest \nchallenges for startups is having access to the necessary capital to \ngrow their business.\n  Investors' capital gains are currently taxed at 15 percent. Last \nyear, the Small Business Jobs Act passed by Congress temporarily \nexempted taxes on capital gains from the sale of certain small business \nstock held for at least 5 years. The Startup Act will make this \nexemption permanent so investors have an incentive to partner with \nentrepreneurs and help provide financial stability for the first few \nyears of that business's beginning.\n\n  Third, the Startup Act will make it easier to take research from the \nlaboratory and apply it in the marketplace. Some of our brightest and \nmost creative individuals study at American universities. Each day, \nfaculty members and graduate students make new discoveries and develop \nnew ideas. The possibilities of research are endless. In\n\n[[Page S6484]]\n\nfact, university research led to groundbreaking discoveries such as the \npolio vaccine, antibiotics, black-and-white television, barcodes, and, \nmore recently, e-mail and Google.\n  To help bring more cutting-edge research to the marketplace, my bill \ncreates an incentive for universities to reform their technology \npolicies and practices. The Startup Act requires the top Federal R \ngrant-making agencies to give preference to universities that have a \nproven track record of success in discovering commercial applications \nfor their research.\n  Fourth, this legislation will enable new businesses to attract and \nretain highly trained workers, including those who immigrate to our \ncountry.\n  Our country was founded on immigrants who have long contributed to \nthe strength of our economy by starting businesses and creating jobs. \nIn fact, a 2007 study found that more than one-quarter of technology \nand engineering companies started in our country, from 1995 to 2002, \nhad at least one key founder who was born overseas. These companies \nproduced $52 billion in sales and employed 450,000 workers in 2005 \nalone.\n  Research shows that 53 percent of immigrant founders of U.S.-based \ntechnology and engineering companies completed their highest degree at \nan American, a U.S. university. Unfortunately, many foreign-born \nimmigrants leave the States after they complete their studies and \nreturn to their home countries to start businesses because they have a \nhard time securing a visa to stay in the United States.\n  It does not make much sense to make such an investment in these \nstudents and then not give them the opportunity to apply what they have \nlearned by starting a company in the United States that will generate \njobs for other Americans. We should be doing all we can to attract and \nretain highly skilled and entrepreneurial folks so they can work in the \nfield where they have studied and contribute to our economy.\n  The Startup Act will help retain this talent in two ways.\n  First, it creates a new visa, called a STEM visa, for any immigrant \nwho graduates with a master's or Ph.D. in science, technology, \nengineering or math. This will give those graduates the opportunity to \nstay for up to 1 year beyond their graduation date to find a job and \nput to work the high-tech skills they learned and that our economy so \ndesperately needs.\n  Second, the bill creates another visa, called an entrepreneur's visa, \nfor immigrants who register a business and employ at least one \nnonfamily member within 1 year of obtaining that visa. Once they have \nsatisfied those requirements, the entrepreneur would be allowed to \nremain here for an additional 3 years if they employ additional \nemployees and further grow their business.\n  The goal of both these visas is to encourage innovation among highly \nskilled entrepreneurs and to help grow our country.\n  Finally, the Startup Act would encourage progrowth State and local \npolicies.\n  While Federal policies certainly impact the formation and growth of \nnew businesses, State and local policies also play an important role in \ntheir creation and growth. In order to identify the States which are \nthe most entrepreneur-friendly, this legislation will create the \n``State Startup Business Report'' to analyze State laws and policies. \nThe report will encourage healthy competition and lead to the \ndevelopment and expansion of progrowth policies.\n  In conclusion, our first priority in Congress should be to create an \nenvironment that encourages companies to grow and create jobs. We know \nour economy cannot continue on the path it is on. In a recent Chamber \nof Commerce study, 64 percent of small business executives said they do \nnot expect to add to their payroll in the next year, and another 12 \npercent said they plan to cut jobs.\n  The Startup Act would encourage American entrepreneurs to do what \nthey do best: dream big and pursue their dreams. The American economy \ncan and will recover when we give American entrepreneurs the tools they \nneed to succeed.\n  By removing those barriers to growth for new companies, attracting \nbusiness investment, bringing more research from the laboratory to the \nmarketplace, retaining talented entrepreneurs and skilled employees, \nand encouraging progrowth policies, we will spur growth in the \nmarketplace and assist in putting people back to work.\n  The ongoing debate about how to create jobs needs to turn from \nrhetoric to reality. Nothing in this legislation is designed to be \nhighly partisan. It is designed to make certain Republicans and \nDemocrats can come together with a plan that will make a difference.\n  It is time for Congress to put policies in place that give job \ncreators more confidence and certainty in the marketplace. If we fail \nto act as we should, if we continue to ignore the economic problems \nfacing our country, if we let partisanship and bickering get in our \nway, we will reduce the opportunities the next generation of Americans \nhave to pursue the American dream. It is our greatest responsibility as \ncitizens of our country to make sure the next generation of Americans \ncan live in a country with freedom and liberty and have the opportunity \nto dream their dreams and see them fulfilled.\n  I yield back and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

With votes today on 3 of the 30 judicial nominations \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee, the Senate will complete \naction on the nominations that were part of the unanimous consent \nagreement reached 3 weeks ago, prior to the last recess.\n  I want to thank the majority leader for pressing at that time for \nSenate votes on all 27 of the judicial nominations then on the \nExecutive Calendar. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership would \nconsent to vote on only 10 of those long-stalled nominations. So even \nafter today's vote, we are back where we started with 27 judicial \nnominations on the calendar awaiting final action by the Senate.\n  Like the nominations we considered last week and earlier this week, \nall three of the district court nominations the Senate considers today \nwere reported favorably by the committee months ago with strong \nbipartisan support. They have all been fully considered by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. They have all been through a thorough vetting \nprocess. They were all ready for a final Senate vote well before the \nAugust recess, but we are only considering them now, halfway through \nOctober.\n  As I said when the Senate returned from the September recess with \nvotes on six long-pending nominations, I hope that these votes are an \nend to the unnecessary stalling by Senate Republicans on nominations. I \nhope that the Senate will build on these votes and make real progress \nin addressing the crisis in judicial vacancies that has gone on for far \ntoo long, to the detriment of our courts and the American people. Votes \non four to six judicial nominees a week cannot be the exception if we \nare going to bring down a judicial vacancy rate that remains above 10 \npercent, with 92 vacancies on Federal courts across the country. Votes \non four to six nominations would be required throughout the year to \nmake a real difference. I hope my friends on the other side of the \naisle will join together with us to end their insistence on harmful \ndelay for delay's sake.\n  We need a return to regular order where the timely consideration of \nconsensus, qualified nominees is not the exception but the rule. With \nRepublican agreement, we could vote today on all 30 of the nominations \nreported by the Committee. Of the 27 judicial nominations that will \nremain on the Executive Calendar tomorrow, 24 of them were reported \nwith unanimous support of every single Democrat and every single \nRepublican serving on the Judiciary Committee. All of them have the \nsupport of their home State Senators, including 13 who have the support \nof Republican home State Senators.\n  I have served in the Senate for years, with both Republican \nleadership and Democratic leadership, Republican Presidents and \nDemocratic Presidents. Especially for district courts, when nominees \nwere voted out of the committee with a bipartisan majority or voted out \nunanimously, they were voice-voted within a matter of weeks. That has \nchanged: under President Obama, Republicans are delaying judges who \nwere voted on unanimously by every Republican and Democrat in the \nJudiciary Committee. I do not think that is right.\n  The path followed by the Senate in considering the nomination of \nJudge Jennifer Guerin Zipps is the path that should be followed with \nall consensus nominations. Judge Zipps was nominated to fill the \nemergency judicial vacancy created by the tragic death of Judge Roll in \nthe Tucson, Arizona shootings. I was pleased that, with cooperation \nfrom Republican Senators, the time from when the Judiciary Committee \nreported Judge Zipps' nomination to full Senate consideration was less \nthan 1 month, even including a recess period. It should not take a \ntragedy to spur us to action to fill a judicial emergency vacancy. \nIndeed, the time it took the Senate to consider Judge Zipps' nomination \nwas in line with the average time it took for the Senate to consider \nPresident Bush's unanimously reported judicial nominations--28 days. It \nis regrettable that her nomination has become the exception for \nPresident Obama's consensus nominations. Those nominations which have \nbeen reported with the unanimous support of every Republican and \nDemocrat on the Judiciary Committee have waited an average of 76 days \non the Executive Calendar before consideration by the Senate.\n  Senator Grassley and I have worked together to ensure that the \nJudiciary Committee makes progress on nominations. Earlier today, the \ncommittee reported another five judicial nominations, four of which \nhave Republican home state Senators in strong support. Two of those \nnominations will fill judicial emergency vacancies in Florida and Utah. \nThere is no need for the Senate to wait weeks and months before voting \non these nominations. There is no need for the Senate Republican \nleadership to continue the unnecessary delays in our consideration of \njudicial nominations that have contributed to the longest period of \nhistorically high vacancy rates in the last 35 years. The number of \njudicial vacancies rose above 90 in August 2009, and it has stayed near \nor above that level ever since. We must bring an end to these needless \ndelays in the Senate so that we can ease the burden on our Federal \ncourts so that they can better serve the American people.\n  More than half of all Americans--almost 170 million--live in \ndistricts or circuits that have a judicial vacancy that could be filled \ntoday if Senate Republicans just agreed to vote on those nominations \nthat were reported favorably by Republicans and Democrats on the \nJudiciary Committee. As many as 25 States are served by Federal courts \nwith vacancies that would be filled by these nominations. Millions of \nAmericans across the country are harmed by delays in overburdened \ncourts. When most people go to court they do not consider themselves \nRepublicans or Democrats; they just know they have a reason to go to \ncourt. But they now find many vacant judgeships. They cannot get their \ncases heard, and justice delayed is, as we know, justice denied.\n  As I have said, we have 27 judicial nominations remaining on the \ncalendar--24 of them voted for unanimously. I ask the Republican \nleadership to explain to the American people why they will not consent \nto vote on the qualified consensus candidates nominated to fill these \nextended judicial vacancies.\n  The delays which have led to the damaging backlog in judicial \nnominations is compounded by the unprecedented attempt by some on the \nother side of the aisle to create what I consider misplaced \ncontroversies about the records of what should be consensus district \ncourt nominees. This approach has threatened to undermine the long-\nstanding deference given to home State Senators who know the nominees \nand the needs of their states best. I am glad we are finally going to \nvote today on the nominations of Alison Nathan to the Southern District \nof New York and Susan Hickey to the Western District of Arkansas, but I \nhope Senators will not raise the kind of selective and unfair questions \nabout the qualifications of these two fine nominees which were never \nraised about President Bush's judicial nominees.\n  Alison Nathan is currently Special Counsel to the Solicitor General \nof New York, having earned the Louis J. Lefkowitz Memorial Achievement \nAward for her work there last year. Ms. Nathan previously had a \nsuccessful career in private practice at a national law firm, as a \nprofessor at two New York law schools, and as an Associate White House \nCounsel. She clerked for Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens and \nJudge Betty Fletcher of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Ms. Nathan's nomination has the strong support of both her home State \nSenators. Senator Schumer rightfully praised her intellect and her \naccomplishments when he introduced her to the Judiciary Committee. Half \nof the Republicans on the Judiciary Committee joined all of the \nDemocrats in voting to report her nomination favorably. However, some \nin committee raised concerns about Ms. Nathan's qualifications, citing \nher rating by a minority of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary as ``not qualified.'' I note that a majority of the ABA \nStanding Committee rated her ``qualified'' to serve. I also note that \nMs. Nathan's ABA rating is equal to or better than the rating received \nby 33 percent of President Bush's confirmed judicial nominees, who were\n\n[[Page S6486]]\n\nsupported by nearly every Republican Senator. Her rating is better than \nthe four of President Bush's nominees who were confirmed despite a \n``not qualified'' rating by the majority of the ABA's Standing \nCommittee, including two nominees to the Eastern District of Kentucky, \nDavid L. Bunning and Gregory F. Van Tatenhove, who were supported by \nthe Republican leader. The Senate deferred to the recommendations of \nthe home State Senators in considering President Bush's nominations and \nconfirmed nominees from Alabama, Utah, Arizona and Oklahoma, among \nother States, who had received a partial rating of ``not qualified.''\n  There is no question that the Senate should confirm Ms. Nathan. As \nher resume shows, she is an accomplished nominee with significant \nexperience in private practice, academia and government service. \nTwenty-seven former Supreme Court clerks have written to the Judiciary \nCommittee in support of her qualifications, including clerks who worked \nfor the conservative Justices. They write:\n\n       Although we hold a wide range of political and \n     jurisprudential views, all of us believe Ns. Nathan has the \n     ability, character, and temperament to be an excellent \n     Federal district court judge. We recommend her for this \n     position without hesitation and without reservation.\n\n  I support Ms. Nathan's nomination without reservation, and hope that \nSenators from both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting this \nworthy nominee.\n  The Senate will also vote today to confirm the nomination of Judge \nSusan Hickey to the Western District of Arkansas. Judge Hickey has the \nbipartisan support of her home State Senators, Democratic Senator Mark \nPryor and Republican Senator John Boozman, both of whom have praised \nher background and qualifications in introducing her to the Committee. \nA majority of Republicans joined every Democratic Senator on the \nJudiciary Committee in voting to report her nomination. Yet because she \nspent a significant part of her career as a law clerk and took a hiatus \nfrom law practice while on family leave, some have questioned whether \nshe is qualified to serve on the Federal bench. In my view, and the \nview of her home State Senators--one Democratic and one Republican--\nthose concerns are misplaced.\n  Currently a State court judge serving in the Thirteenth Judicial \nCircuit in Arkansas, Judge Hickey was previously a career law clerk for \nthe Honorable Judge Barnes, whom she is nominated to replace. During \nher confirmation hearing, Judge Hickey testified about the experience \nshe gained as a career law clerk to Judge Barnes, saying that she \n``[took] part in all matters that were before the court from the time \nthat the case was filed till the final disposition.'' She testified \nabout the cases she has managed as a State Court Judge, and her \nexperience litigating bench trials and jury trials. The ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Judge Hickey \n``qualified'' to serve on the Federal bench. I hope that she will be \nconfirmed with bipartisan support.\n  The Senate today will also finally consider the nomination of \nKatherine Forrest to fill another vacancy on the Southern District of \nNew York. Currently a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the \nAntitrust Division of the Department of Justice, she previously spent \nover 20 years as a litigator in private practice at the law firm \nCravath, Swaine & Moore in New York City, where she was named one of \nAmerica's Top 50 litigators under the age of 45. The ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated Ms. Forrest ``well \nqualified'' to serve, its highest possible rating. The Judiciary \nCommittee favorably reported Ms. Forrest's nomination without dissent \nthree months ago.\n\n  In the weeks ahead, I hope that we continue to consider more of the \n27 judicial nominees, nearly all of whom are the kind of consensus \nnominees we could consider within days. We have an enormous amount of \nground to recover. At this point in George W. Bush's presidency, the \nSenate had confirmed 162 of his nominees for the Federal circuit and \ndistrict courts, including 100 during the 17 months that I was chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee during his first term. By this date in \nPresident Clinton's first term, the Senate had confirmed 163 of his \nnominations to circuit and district courts. In stark contrast, after \ntoday's vote, the Senate will have confirmed only 108 of President \nObama's nominees to Federal circuit and district courts. As a result, \nvacancies are twice as high as they were at this point in President \nBush's first term when the Senate was expeditiously voting on consensus \njudicial nominations. In the next year, we need to confirm nearly 100 \nmore of President Obama's circuit and district court nominations to \nbring the vacancies down to match the 205 confirmed during President \nBush's first term.\n  We can and must do better to address the serious judicial vacancies \ncrisis on Federal courts around the country that has persisted for over \n2 years. We can and must do better for the nearly 170 million Americans \nbeing made to suffer by these unnecessary delays.\n  Again, I apologize for my voice, I thank the ranking member for his \nhelp, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we continue in our cooperation \nwith the majority as we vote on three more judicial nominees. With a \nconfirmation earlier this week, and six judicial confirmations last \nweek, I want to note the progress we have made.\n  After today's votes, we will have confirmed 68 percent of President \nObama's judicial nominees submitted during his presidency. We remain \nahead of the pace set forth in the 108th Congress. We have already held \nhearings for over 84 percent of President Obama's judicial nominees \nthis Congress, while at this point in the 108th Congress, only 77 \npercent of President Bush's judicial nominees had their hearing.\n  This morning, the Judiciary Committee reported five more nominees to \nthe Senate floor, totaling over 77 percent of President Obama's \njudicial nominees receiving favorable votes out of committee. That is \ncompared to only 72 percent of President Bush's judicial nominees \nreceiving favorable outcomes at this point in the 108th Congress. This \nindicates the bipartisan effort taking place to move consensus nominees \nforward, despite what we hear from the other side about obstruction and \ndelay.\n  The advice and consent function of the Senate is a critical step in \nthe process. In the Federalist Papers No. 76, Alexander Hamilton wrote:\n\n       To what purpose then require the co-operation of the \n     Senate? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence \n     would have a powerful, though, in general, a silent \n     operation. It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of \n     favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to \n     prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State \n     prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, \n     or from a view to popularity.\n\n  In other words, the Senate has a role in preventing the appointment \nof judges who are simply political favorites of the President, or of \nthose who are not qualified to serve as Federal judges.\n  Also, let me remind my colleagues of what then-Senator Obama stated \nabout this duty 6 years ago in connection with the attempted filibuster \nof Janice Rogers Brown. Our President, then Senator, said:\n\n       Now, the test for a qualified judicial nominee is not \n     simply whether they are intelligent. Some of us who attended \n     law school or were in business know that there are a lot of \n     real smart people out there whom you would not put in charge \n     of stuff. The test of whether a judge is qualified to be a \n     judge is not their intelligence. It is their judgment.\n\n  A few months later, on January 26, 2006, when debating the Alito \nnomination, then-Senator Obama said:\n\n       There are some who believe that the President, having won \n     the election, should have the complete authority to appoint \n     his nominee, and the Senate should only examine whether or \n     not the Justice is intellectually capable and an all-around \n     nice guy. That once you get beyond intellect and personal \n     character, there should be no further question whether the \n     judge should be confirmed. I disagree with this view. I \n     believe firmly that the Constitution calls for the Senate to \n     advise and consent. I believe that it calls for meaningful \n     advice and consent that includes an examination of a judge's \n     philosophy, ideology, and record.\n\n  You can see some differences between what Senator Obama said on a \ncouple of different occasions on the Senate floor and also how there is \nsome disagreement with what Alexander Hamilton said in the Federalist \nPapers No. 76.\n\n[[Page S6487]]\n\n  Our inquiry of the qualifications of nominees must be more than \nintelligence, a pleasant personality, or a prestigious clerkship. At \nthe beginning of this Congress, I articulated my standards for judicial \nnominees. I want to ensure that the men and women who are appointed to \na lifetime position in the Federal judiciary are qualified to serve. \nFactors I consider important include intellectual ability, respect for \nthe Constitution, fidelity to the law, personal integrity, appropriate \njudicial temperament, and professional competence.\n  In applying these standards, I have demonstrated good faith in \nensuring fair consideration of judicial nominees. I have worked with \nthe majority to confirm consensus nominees. However, as I have stated \nmore than once, the Senate must not place quantity confirmed over \nquality confirmed. These lifetime appointments are too important to the \nFederal judiciary and the American people to simply rubber stamp them.\n  Although we have had a long run of confirming consensus nominees, two \nof the nominees on which we are about to vote come with some \nreservations. Ms. Nathan and Judge Hickey both have had limited \nexperience in the courtroom. They have failed to meet even the minimum \nqualifications that the ABA says it uses in the rating process. The \nguidelines of the Standing Committee of the ABA provide:\n\n       . . . a prospective nominee to the Federal bench ordinarily \n     should have at least 12 years experience in the practice of \n     law.\n\n  They further state:\n\n       Substantial courtroom and trial experience as a lawyer or \n     trial judge are important.\n\n  I want to emphasize the American Bar Association 12-year standard is \nnot an absolute. However, it is a benchmark that we can use to evaluate \nthe experiences of various nominees. As I have said in the past, being \nappointed a Federal district judge should be a capstone of an \nillustrious career. Federal judges should have significant courtroom \nand trial experience as a litigator or a judge. I would note that last \nweek at our hearing, Justice Scalia expressed concern about the decline \nin the quality of Federal judges.\n  With regard to the two non-consensus nominations before us today, I \nvoted to advance them out of the Judiciary Committee so the full Senate \ncould evaluate their qualifications. However, both of these nominees \nreceived votes in opposition in our committee. After they were \nreported, we had our second opportunity to examine their records, and \nunfortunately I am unable to support them on the floor.\n  I am, however, pleased to support the nomination of Katherine B. \nForrest to be United States District Judge for the Southern District of \nNew York.\n  In Ms. Nathan's case, she graduated from law school only 11 years \nago, and has been admitted to the practice of law for only 8 years. Her \nquestionnaire states she served as associate counsel on approximately \nsix trial court litigation matters. Most of the significant litigation \nshe lists is from her current position in the New York Solicitor \nGeneral's Office.\n\n  In addition, I am concerned about her views on second amendment \nrights, on the death penalty, on the use of foreign law, and her \nremarks regarding the Bush administration's war on terror.\n  Judge Hickey has served as a State court judge for about 1 year. Her \nquestionnaire indicates she has presided over two criminal bench \ntrials--a speeding-DWI case and a second speeding case. Prior to that, \nshe spent about 7 years as a senior law clerk in the Western District \nof Arkansas. Early in her career, from 1981 to 1984, she was a staff \nattorney with Murphy Oil Company. Altogether, I am not sure we can get \nto 12 years of legal-judicial experience--the minimum the American Bar \nAssociation committee says a nominee to the courts should have. \nFurthermore, Judge Hickey has no litigation experience. She has tried \nno cases.\n  I want to be very clear here--I am not denigrating the career choices \nof these nominees, nor am I arguing that the experience they have is \nunrelated to service as a Federal judge. What I am saying is they do \nnot have enough experience, and this is not the place for on-the-job \ntraining.\n  Let me say a bit more about the background of the nominees we are \nconsidering today.\n  Two nominees have been nominated to serve as United States District \nJudge for the Southern District of New York--Katherine B. Forrest and \nAlison J. Nathan.\n  Since graduating from New York University School of Law in 1990, Ms. \nForrest has spent the vast majority of her legal career as an attorney \nat Cravath, Swayne, & Moore. She served as an associate at the firm \nfrom 1990 to 1997 and a partner from 1998 to 2010. While at Cravath, \nSwayne, & Moore, Ms. Forrest was a generalist litigator who practiced \nin the areas of antitrust, intellectual property, contracts, employment \nlaw, accounting fraud, and securities litigation.\n  In addition, Ms. Forrest was involved in the management of the firm, \nserving on the Partner Review Committee. She also ran the firm's \nContinuing Legal Education Program from 1998 to 2005.\n  Ms. Forrest has been a deputy assistant attorney general in the \nDepartment of Justice's antitrust division since 2010. She is involved \nin most major matters the division handles, including litigation \nplanning and execution, appellate litigation, and international \ncooperation. She has a unanimous rating of ``Well Qualified'' by the \nABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.\n  Ms. Nathan graduated with a B.A. from Cornell University in 1994 and \nwith a J.D. from Cornell Law School in 2000. Upon graduation, she \nclerked for Judge Betty Fletcher of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nfrom 2000 to 2001. From 2001 to 2002, Ms. Nathan clerked for Justice \nJohn Paul Stevens of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Ms. Nathan entered private practice with Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering \nHale & Don LLP, serving as an Associate in the Washington, DC, office \nas well as the New York office. She practiced within the Litigation \nGroup, the Supreme Court and Appellate Litigation Group, and the \nRegulatory and Government Affairs Group.\n  From 2006 to 2008, Ms. Nathan worked as a visiting assistant \nprofessor of law at Fordham University School of Law. In this role she \ntaught civil and criminal procedure and constitutional law. From 2008 \nto 2009, Ms. Nathan also served as the Fritz Alexander fellow at New \nYork University School of Law, engaged in legal research.\n  In 2009, Ms. Nathan secured a position with the White House Counsel's \nOffice. As an associate White House counsel and Special Assistant to \nthe President, Ms. Nathan reviewed legislation, analyzed and advised \nstaff on legal issues, and assisted in the preparation of judicial and \nexecutive branch nominees for confirmation hearings.\n  In July 2010, Ms. Nathan returned to New York and began to work as a \nSpecial Assistant to the Solicitor General of New York. A majority of \nthe ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Ms. Nathan as \n``Qualified.'' A minority rated her as ``Not Qualified.''\n  And finally, Susan Owens Hickey, who is nominated to be a United \nStates District Judge for the Western District of Arkansas. Ms. Hickey \ngraduated from the University of Arkansas School of Law in 1981. In \nApril of that year, she worked for the law firm of Brown, Compton & \nPrewett, where she worked on the pretrial preparation and trial of a \npersonal injury case that the firm was defending. From 1981 to 1984, \nMs. Hickey worked as a staff attorney for the Murphy Oil Corporation. \nIn that role, she worked primarily on issues involving natural gas, \nsecurities and corporate law.\n  From 1984 to 2003, Ms. Hickey was not employed or actively engaged in \nthe practice of law, with the exception of serving as a temporary law \nclerk. During the summer of 1997 and during the summer of 1998 Ms. \nHickey served as a temporary law clerk for the Honorable Harry F. \nBarnes, United States District Judge for the Western District of \nArkansas.\n  Ms. Hickey returned to work for that same judge in 2003, serving as a \nsenior career law clerk, and she stayed in that position until 2010.\n  In September 2010, Ms. Hickey was appointed circuit judge for the \nThirteenth Judicial Circuit of Arkansas. Ms. Hickey received a \nunanimous ``Qualified'' rating from the ABA Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Terrorist Prosecution\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, my Republican colleagues have frequently \ncome to the Senate floor to criticize President Obama for his handling \nof terrorism cases. They have argued regularly and consistently that \nterrorism suspects should never be interrogated by the FBI and should \nnot be prosecuted in America's criminal courts but, instead, they \nargue, they should only be held in military detention and prosecuted in \nmilitary commissions.\n  Today, I have noticed no one on the Republican side has come to the \nSenate floor to make those arguments. Why not? It may be because \nyesterday Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab pled guilty in Federal court to \ntrying to explode a bomb in his underwear on a flight to Detroit on \nChristmas Day 2009. Mr. Abdulmutallab, who will be sentenced in \nJanuary, is expected to serve a life sentence.\n  I commend the men and women at the Justice Department and the FBI for \ntheir work on this case. America is a safer country today thanks to \nthem.\n  My colleagues on the other side were very critical of the FBI's \ndecision to give Miranda warnings to Abdulmutallab. Let me quote \nSenator McConnell, the minority leader. This is what he said on the \nfloor of the Senate:\n\n       He was given a 50-minute interrogation.\n\n  He was referring to Abdulmutallab.\n  The Senator went on to say:\n\n       Probably Larry King has interrogated people longer and \n     better than that. After which he was assigned a lawyer who \n     told him to shut up.\n\n  That is an interesting statement, but here are the facts. Experienced \ncounterterrorism agents from the FBI interrogated Abdulmutallab when he \narrived in Detroit. According to the Justice Department, during this \ninitial interrogation, the FBI ``obtained intelligence that proved \nuseful in the fight against al Quida.'' After this initial \ninterrogation, Abdulmutallab refused to cooperate further with the FBI. \nOnly then, after Abdulmutallab stopped talking, did the FBI give him a \nMiranda warning.\n  What the FBI did in this case was nothing new. During the Bush \nadministration, the FBI consistently gave Miranda warnings to \nterrorists detained in the United States.\n  Here is what Attorney General Holder said:\n\n       Across many administrations, both before and after 9/11, \n     the consistent, well-known, lawful, and publicly-stated \n     policy of the FBI has been to provide Miranda warnings prior \n     to any custodial interrogation conducted inside the United \n     States.\n\n  In fact, under the Bush administration, they adopted new policies for \nthe FBI that say that ``within the United States, Miranda warnings are \nrequired to be given prior to custodial interviews.''\n  Let's take one example from the Bush administration: Richard Reid, \nalso known as the Shoe Bomber. Reid tried to detonate an explosive in \nhis shoe on a flight from Paris to Miami in December 2001. This was \nvery similar to the attempted attack by Abdulmutallab, another foreign \nterrorist who also tried to detonate a bomb on a plane. So how does the \nBush administration's handling of the Shoe Bomber compare with the \nObama administration's handling of the Underwear Bomber? The Bush \nadministration detained and charged Richard Reid as a criminal. They \ngave Reid a Miranda warning within 5 minutes of being removed from the \nairplane, and they reminded him of his Miranda rights four times within \nthe first 48 hours he was detained.\n  Later, Abdulmutallab began talking again to FBI interrogators and \nproviding valuable intelligence. FBI Director Robert Mueller, for whom \nI have the highest respect, described it this way:\n\n       Over a period of time, we have been successful in obtaining \n     intelligence, not just on day one, but on day two, day three, \n     day four, and day five, down the road.\n\n  Now, how did that happen? How did the FBI get even more information \nfrom the suspect after they gave the Miranda warning? The Obama \nadministration convinced Abdulmutallab's family to come to the United \nStates, and his family persuaded him to start talking to the FBI. That \nis a very different approach than we have heard in previous \nadministrations. Sometimes when a detainee refused to talk, in the Bush \nadministration, in some isolated cases, there were extreme techniques \nused to try to get information from him, such as waterboarding. But \nreal life isn't the TV show ``24.'' On TV, when Jack Bauer tortures \nsomebody, the suspect immediately admits everything he knows. Here is \nwhat we learned during the previous administration: In real life, when \npeople are tortured, they lie. They will lie and say anything to make \nthe pain stop. Oftentimes they provide false information, not valuable \nintelligence.\n  Richard Clarke was the senior counterterrorism adviser to President \nClinton and President George W. Bush. Here is what he said about the \nObama administration's approach:\n\n       The FBI is good at getting people to talk. They have been \n     much more successful than the previous attempts of torturing \n     people and trying to convince them to give information that \n     way.\n\n  Many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue that \nAbdulmutallab should have been held in military detention as an enemy \ncombatant, but terrorists arrested in the United States have always \nbeen held under our criminal laws.\n  Here is what Attorney General Holder said:\n\n       Since the September 11, 2011 attacks, the practice of the \n     U.S. government, followed by prior and current \n     administrations without a single exception, has been to \n     arrest and detain under Federal criminal law all terrorist \n     suspects who are apprehended inside the United States.\n\n  Many of my Republican colleagues also argue that terrorists such as \nUmar Abdulmutallab should be tried in military commissions because \nFederal courts are not well-suited to prosecuting terrorists.\n  That argument is simply wrong. Look at the facts. Since 9/11, more \nthan 200 terrorists have been successfully prosecuted and convicted in \nour Federal courts. Here are just a few of the terrorists who have been \nconvicted in Federal courts and are serving long prison sentences: \nRamzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; \nOmar Abdel Rahman, the so-called Blind Sheik; the 20th 9/11 hijacker, \nZacarias Moussaoui; Richard Reid, the Shoe Bomber; Ted Kaczynski, the \nUnabomber; Terry Nichols, the Oklahoma City coconspirator; and now \nAbdul Abdulmutallab. Compare this with the track record of military \ncommissions. Since 9/11, only 4 individuals have been convicted by \nmilitary commissions--more than 200 in the courts, 4 in military \ncommissions--and 2 of those individuals spent less than 1 year in \nprison, having been found guilty by a military commission, and are now \nliving freely in their home countries of Australia and Yemen.\n  GEN Colin Powell, the former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nSecretary of State under President Bush, supports prosecuting \nterrorists in Federal courts. Here is what he said about military \ncommissions. This is from General Powell:\n\n       The suggestion that somehow a military commission is the \n     way to go isn't borne out by the history of the military \n     commissions.\n\n  Many military commissions, when it comes to terrorism cases, are an \nunproven venue, unlike Federal courts.\n  Former Bush administration Justice Department officials James Comey \nand Jack Goldsmith also support prosecuting terrorists in Federal \ncourt. Here is what they said:\n\n       There is great uncertainty about the commissions' validity. \n     This uncertainty has led to many legal challenges that will \n     continue indefinitely. . . . By contrast, there is no \n     question about the legitimacy of U.S. Federal courts to \n     incapacitate terrorists.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, after a steady parade of speeches on this \nSenate floor by the Senate Republican leader and others about how we \ncannot trust our Federal court system to prosecute terrorists, how we \nshould take care to never let the FBI do this important job, the facts \nspeak otherwise.\n  In Detroit, in the Federal court, we should give credit where it is \ndue. The\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nFBI did its job. Our courts did their job. The Department of Justice \nprosecutors did their job. Abdulmutallab pled guilty. He pled guilty \nbecause the evidence was overwhelmingly against him. He was convicted \nopenly in the courts of America, which is an important message to send \nto the rest of the world, and he will pay a heavy price--a life \nsentence--for his terrible attempt to down an aircraft in the United \nStates. That prosecution and that confession were obtained in our court \nsystem.\n  To argue that military commissions are the only way to go and that \nusing the FBI and Department of Justice and our article III courts as a \nvenue for terrorism is wrong is not proven by the facts, the evidence, \nor the most recent information coming forward. I would hope some of my \ncolleagues who are now holding up the Defense authorization bill on \nthis issue will at least be hesitant to argue their case now that the \nAbdulmutallab prosecution has been successfully completed. Over 200 \nterrorists have been successfully prosecuted in America's courts.\n  My message to them and I think the message of America to every \nPresident is, you use the court, you use the agency you think will be \nmost effective in protecting America. Congress should not tie the hands \nof any President when it comes to this important prosecution. This \nsuccess that we have seen in Detroit is evidence that if we give to a \nPresident--whether it is a Republican or Democratic President--the \ntools to prosecute those accused of terrorism, the President can use \nthem wisely, sometimes in military commissions but more often in our \ncourt system, an open system that says to the world we can bring the \nsuspected terrorist to justice and do it in a fashion consistent with \nAmerican values.\n\n  I hope all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will join me \nin commending the Justice Department and FBI for their success in \nbringing Abdulmutallab to justice, and I sincerely hope this case will \ncause some Members of the body to reconsider their opposition to \nhandling terrorism in the criminal justice system.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the events of this week are an indication \nthat much needs to be done in Washington to deal with the state of our \neconomy. With 14 million Americans out of work, it is high time that \nboth political parties find a way to develop a plan to move this \ncountry forward and to create jobs.\n  When the President spoke to Congress a little over 4 years ago, he \nlaid out at least the foundation of a plan and later provided the \ndetails. But time and again, President Obama has said to the Republican \nleadership: I am open to your ideas. Bring them forward. Let's put them \nin a combined effort to make America a stronger nation and to find our \nway out of this recession.\n  Unfortunately, we have not heard suggestions from the other side. We \nhad an important vote Tuesday night. Sadly, the Republican filibuster \nprevailed. Republicans, because they did not want to move the \nPresident's bill to consideration on the floor of the Senate, voted--\nevery single one of them--against President Obama's efforts to put \nAmerica back to work. I do not think that is going to be a position \nwhich is easily defended back home. Whether one agrees or disagrees \nwith President Obama, the American people expect Democrats and \nRepublicans to enter a dialog to help this country. We have to give on \nthe Democratic side, and they should be prepared to give on the \nRepublican side, and let's try to find some common ground. There are \ntoo many instances where we fight to a face-off and then leave.\n  The suggestion that yesterday's efforts to pass three free-trade \nagreements with South Korea, Panama, and Colombia are going to turn the \neconomy around, I am not sure of being close to accurate. I supported \ntwo of those trade agreements, and I think they will help create jobs \nand business opportunities in America in the longer run but in the near \nterm not likely so.\n  What we need to do is to work on what has been proven to be \nsuccessful to move this economy forward. Let's start with the basics. \nWorking families struggle from paycheck to paycheck. Many families do \nnot have enough money to get by. They are using food pantries and other \nhelp to survive in this very tough economy. So President Obama said the \nfirst thing we need to do is to give a payroll tax cut to working \nfamilies so they have more money to meet their needs. What it boils \ndown to in Illinois, where the average income is about $53,000 a year, \nis the equivalent of about $1,600 a year in tax cuts for working \nfamilies. That is about $130 a month, which many Senators may not \nnotice but people who are struggling to fill the gas tank and put the \nkids in school can use $130 a month.\n  The President thinks that is an important part of getting America \nback on its feet and back to work, and I support it. That was one of \nthe elements that was stopped by the Republican filibuster on Tuesday \nnight.\n  The second proposal of the President is that we give tax breaks to \nbusinesses, particularly small businesses, to create an incentive for \nthem to hire the unemployed, starting with our returning veterans. It \nis an embarrassment to think these men and women went overseas and \nrisked their lives fighting an enemy and now have to come home and \nfight for a job. We ought to be standing by them, helping them to get \nto work, and that is one of the elements in the President's bill that \nwas also defeated by the Republican filibuster on Tuesday night.\n  The President went on to say we ought to be investing our money in \nAmerica. If we put people to work, let's build something that has long-\nterm value. One of those he suggested was school modernization. I \nvisited some schools around my State, and I am sure in the State of \nColorado and other places there are plenty of school districts \nstruggling because the tax base has been eroded by declining real \nestate values and these districts need a helping hand. When I went to \nMartin Grove and visited a middle school there, I found great teachers \ndoing the best they could in classrooms where the tiles were falling \nfrom the ceiling and where the boiler room should be labeled an antique \nshop because it was a 50- or 60-year-old operation that was kept \ntogether with $150,000 of repairs each year. We ought to buy new \nequipment and install it in American schools so they can serve us for \nmany years to come.\n  The same holds true in investing in our infrastructure, whether it is \nhighways, bridges or airports. Make no mistake, our competitors around \nthe world are building their infrastructure to beat the United States, \nand those who want us to retreat in this battle are going to be \nsaddened by the consequences if they have their way. President Obama \nsaid invest this money in putting Americans to work to build our \ninfrastructure, rebuild our schools, build our neighborhoods in a way \nthat serves us for years to come.\n  The President is also sensitive to the fact that in many parts of \nAmerica, including Illinois, there are school districts and towns that \nhave had to lay off teachers and firefighters and policemen. It doesn't \nmake us any safer, and it doesn't make our schools any more effective. \nPart of the President's jobs package is to make sure, for those \nteachers as well as policemen and firefighters, at least some of their \njobs will be saved. In Illinois, over 14,000 of those jobs will be \nsaved by the President's bill.\n  What really brings this bill to a screeching halt in the debate is \nthe fact the President said we should pay for this. Let's come up with \nthe money that is going to pay for the things I just described. And his \nproposal is a simple one. It says those who make over $1 million a year \nwill pay a surtax of 5.6 percent--over $1 million a year in income. \nThat is over $20,000 a week in income. These folks would pay a 5.6-\npercent surtax, and that surtax would pay for the jobs bill.\n\n[[Page S6490]]\n\n  If the jobs bill works, and I believe it will, I guarantee a thriving \nAmerican economy will be to the benefit of those same wealthy people. \nSo asking them to sacrifice a little in this surtax is not too much to \nask.\n  Unfortunately, although some 59 percent of Republicans support this \nmillionaires' surtax, not one of them serves in the Senate. We need to \nhave a bipartisan effort to make sure this is paid for in a reasonable \nway. The alternative we have heard from the other side that mounted \nthis filibuster against President Obama's jobs bill is, we ought to \nreturn to the old way of doing things: tax cuts for wealthy people--not \nnew burdens but tax cuts for wealthy people.\n  They argue the people who make over $1 million a year are the job \ncreators. That is a phrase they use, ``job creators.'' A survey came \nout yesterday from the Government Accountability Office, and what it \nsaid was 1 percent of those making over $1 million a year actually own \nsmall businesses. Most of them are investors. Although there is, I am \nsure, a worthy calling in being an investor, they are not the job \ncreators they are described to be.\n\n  So I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, this notion of \nprotecting those making over $1 million a year at the expense of a jobs \nprogram to move America forward is backwards. We have to come together, \nand I hope we can start as early as next week. We have to find \nprovisions in this jobs bill we can agree on.\n  I hope the Republicans would agree we should modernize our schools \nand build our infrastructure in this country. I hope they agree we \nshould not shortchange our schools and our communities when they need \nteachers and policemen and firefighters. I hope they would agree that \nit is a national priority to put our returning veterans to work. I \ncertainly think that should be a bipartisan issue.\n  But the filibuster this week that stopped the President's jobs bill \nhas stopped the discussion. The trade bills yesterday will not make up \nthe difference. We have to focus on putting Americans to work with \ngood-paying jobs right here in our Nation, creating new consumer demand \nfor goods and services which will help businesses at every single \nlevel. The President has put his proposal forward and has challenged \nour friends on the other side of the aisle to step up and put their \nproposals forward.\n  My suspicion is that most people in America would be delighted to see \na breakthrough in Washington, DC, where Democrats and Republicans \nactually sat down at the same table and tried to work out a plan to put \nAmerica back to work. We can do this. In order to do it we have to give \non both sides. We have to forget about the election that is going to \noccur in November 2012 and focus on the state of America's economy \nright now in October 2011. If we put aside the campaign considerations \nand focus on the economy, I think we can get a lot done. I trust that \nthere are some on the other side of the aisle who feel the same way. I \nhope they will break from their leadership on their filibuster and join \nus in this effort.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few moments on the \nnomination of Alison Nathan to be the United States District Court \nJudge for the Southern District of New York. This is a highly important \nposition. It is one of the more prestigious courts in the country that \nhandles the Nation's most complex cases. It is my observation, having \npracticed for over 15 years full time trying cases before Federal \njudges, that this position is of extreme importance and you need good \njudgment, good experience, good integrity, proven stability before you \ngive a person a lifetime appointment to such a position. It is an \nimportant matter.\n  I overwhelmingly vote for the nominees of the President. I believe in \ngiving the President deference in those nominations. However, I do \nbelieve we need to hold Presidents accountable and to scrutinize the \nnominations in a fair way and not hesitate to push back and say no if a \nnominee does not meet those requirements that are necessary to be a \ngood judge.\n  I believe Ms. Nathan is one of a number of President Obama's nominees \nwho believes that American judges should look to foreign law in \ndeciding cases. She has other indications that suggest she is not \ncommitted in a deep and understanding way to the oath Federal judges \ntake. That oath is that you serve under the Constitution and under the \nlaws of the United States. That is so simple and so basic that it goes \nalmost without saying, but it is a part of the historic oath judges \ntake. I believe that oath and commitment to serving under the U.S. \nConstitution, under the U.S. laws, is critical to the entire foundation \nof the American rule of law. It is so magnificent. We have the greatest \nlegal system in the world. By and large our Federal judges are \nexcellent and it is a strength both for liberty and civil rights and \neconomic prosperity that we maintain a judiciary at a high level.\n  One of the things that causes me concern--there are several, but this \none I will mention--is her belief that American judges should look to \nforeign law in deciding cases. This is not a little bitty matter. It is \na matter of real national import. It offends people. Some people, \nnonlawyers, get offended. They think they should not do that. They are \nright, but just because people are upset about it and get angry about \nit doesn't mean it is not a deep, legitimate concern and can be a \ndisqualifying factor as to whether a person should be on the bench. \nWhat law do they follow? The U.S. law or foreign law?\n  In a book chapter published less than 2 years ago, Ms. Nathan \nsuggested that the cases leading up to the Supreme Court case of Roper \nv. Simmons, which was a death penalty case, showed legal progress. In \nRoper the Court held it is unconstitutional to impose a death penalty \neven for the most heinous crime if the defendant is under the age of 18 \nyears.\n  As a matter of policy, I am not sure we should be executing people \nunder 18, although a lot of people think that certain crimes are so bad \nthey ought to be executed. We can disagree. That is a political \ndecision. The question is, does the Constitution prohibit that? I \nsuggest it does not. But if it does, it ought to be interpreted in \nlight of its own words and the laws of the United States, its own \nimport of the Constitution of the United States. Ms. Nathan seemed to \ncommend the decision, however, on a different basis in her chapter. She \ncommended it for ``elaborating upon relevant international and foreign \nlaw sources and defending the relevance of the Court's consideration of \nthose sources.''\n  When describing Justice Kennedy's change of opinion on the issue--he \nreversed himself--she said it was ``a change that can be attributed to \nthe international human rights advocacy and scholarship that had taken \nplace outside the courtroom walls.''\n  She also praised the Roper attorneys for their ``strategic and savvy \nreference to international norms in litigating the case.''\n  She asserted that the strategy's ``effectiveness holds promise and \nlessons for future advancement of international law.''\n  She went further and suggested the reason the Supreme Court does not \nlook to foreign law more often is because the Justices simply do not \nunderstand international law arguments--she has been practicing law \nabout 10 years, or 9 at the time she wrote this, so she knows more \nabout the issues related to international law than the Justices who \nhave been on the bench for decades, many of them constitutional \nprofessors--rather than demonstrating a knowledge that the judge must \nserve under the U.S. Constitution and U.S. law and recognizing that \nforeign law has no place in deciding what our Constitution means.\n  She stated:\n\n       As these trends [in international law] continue, surely the \n     Court will increase its understanding and \n     `internationalization' of international human rights law \n     arguments.\n\n  She then concluded:\n\n       The presence of the Chinese judicial delegation at the \n     Supreme Court on the day of\n\n[[Page S6491]]\n\n     the Roper arguments wonderfully symbolized the rich dialogue \n     between international and constitutional norms.\n\n  So what she is calling for there is a dialog, presumably between \ninternational law and constitutional norms--pretty plain in her \nwriting--not just an off-the-cuff comment but in a serious book \nexpressing her philosophy and approach to law.\n  I am troubled by that. I believe judges have to be bound by the law \nand the Constitution. They are not free to impose their view. Justice \nScalia and others have criticized--devastated--this international law \nargument. In my view, the debate that has gone forward in circles \nincluding the academy and law schools has clearly been a victory for \nthe people who understand it is our Constitution that governs. We \ndidn't adopt the laws of China, if they were ever enforced, which they \nare not except by the government when it suits them. We didn't adopt \nlaws in France. We didn't adopt laws in Italy or Brazil or Yugoslavia. \nThat is not what binds us. That is not what judges serve under. They \nserve under our law.\n  I think it is a dangerous philosophy. It strikes at the heart of what \nthe Anglo-American rule of law is all about--that law is adopted by the \npeople of the United States and that is the law judges must enforce--\nlaws passed by the people of the United States.\n  Reliance on foreign law, I believe, has been shown to be nothing more \nthan a tool that activist judges who seek to reach outcomes they desire \nutilize. It is a way to get out from under the meaning of U.S. law. Why \nelse would one cite it? If they cannot find a basis for their decisions \nin American law and legal tradition, they look to the laws and norms of \nforeign countries to justify their decisions. As Justice Scalia aptly \ndescribed it--and he has hammered this theory--courts employing foreign \nlaw, including his own court--the U.S. Supreme Court--are merely \n``look[ing] over the heads of the crowd and pick[ing] out its \nfriends.''\n  What did he mean by that? He means the law, the foundation principles \nof deciding cases. If they don't like what they find in the United \nStates, they look out over their heads and they find somebody in Italy \nor Spain or China or wherever, and they say: We need to interpret our \nlaw in light of what they do in Germany. How bogus is that as an \nintellectual legal argument?\n  Judges who engage in this type of activism violate their judicial \noath, I believe. The oath is to serve under our Constitution, our laws. \nIt requires judges to evaluate cases in that fashion--not the laws of \nother countries. Other countries don't have the same legal heritage we \nhave. They don't value the same liberties and the same fundamental \nfreedoms that are enshrined in our Constitution. The decisions of \nforeign courts have absolutely no bearing on a decision of a judge in a \nU.S. court, and nominees who disagree with that fundamentally can \ndisqualify themselves from the bench.\n  It is very hard for me to believe I should vote to confirm a nominee \nwho is not committed to following our law, who believes they have a \nright to scrutinize the world, find some law in some other country and \nbring it home and use that law so they can achieve a result they wanted \nin the case.\n  There are a number of other concerns I have with Ms. Nathan's record, \nnot the least of which are her views on an individual's right to bear \narms. We have a constitutional amendment on the right to keep and bear \narms. The right to keep and bear arms should not be abridged. That is \nan odd thing, compared to France or Germany or Red China. But it is our \nlaw and we expect judges to follow it whether they like it or not. That \nis what our Constitution says.\n  Suffice it to say, I believe her record evidences an activist \nviewpoint. Perhaps if she had more legal experience, she would have a \nbetter understanding of the role of a judge. She only just became a \nlawyer in 2000--11 years ago--and has had limited time in a courtroom.\n  Evidently, the American Bar Association recognizes this. The ABA \ngives ratings to judges, and a minority of the members of that \ncommittee--not the majority but a minority--rate her ``not qualified.'' \nFrankly, they are a pretty liberal group, so I don't know if it is so \nmuch her views on some of these issues, but probably an actual \nevaluation of the kind of experience and background she brings and \nwhether she would be qualified to sit on an important Federal district \ncourt--the Southern District of New York, one of the premier trial \nbenches in the world, and even in America--and I think it is a matter \nwe should consider.\n  This is a very serious shortcoming for a number of reasons. \nLitigating in court is valuable experience. It provides insights to \nsomeone who would be a judge. It helps make them a better judge if they \nhave had that experience. It gives them a strong understanding that \nwords have meaning and consequences. When we see people get prosecuted \nfor perjury or we see million-dollar contracts decided this way or that \nway based on the plain meaning of words, we learn to respect words.\n  Some of these people out of law schools, with their activist \nphilosophy, seem to think a judge has a right to allow their empathy \nand their feelings to intervene and decide cases based on something \nother than the words of the contract or the words of the Constitution. \nIt is a threat to American law. Indeed, it is what President Obama has \nsaid a number of times. He believes judges should allow their empathy \nto help them decide cases.\n  What is empathy? It is their personal views. Whom do we have empathy \nfor? It depends on whom one likes before they come on the bench. So \nthey are deciding cases based on factors other than the objective facts \nof the case. I believe the practice of law is a real legal testing \nground, in which people can prove their judgment integrity over time. \nIt also provides a maturing experience, where a person learns the \nimport of decisions in how cases turn out and how it impacts their \nclients.\n  Let me just say that seasoned lawyers develop reputations. When we \nhave seen them in court many times and they have had experience there, \npeople know if they have good judgment. People know if they are solid. \nWe know they are men and women of integrity. They have that opportunity \nto establish a reputation. Both the short period of time that Ms. \nNathan has spent actually practicing law and some of the troubling \npositions she has taken over the years justifiably raise serious \nquestions about her understanding of the role of a judge in our system.\n  Finally, I would note that Concerned Women For America, the Family \nResearch Council, and the Judicial Action Group oppose this nomination. \nIn a letter sent to all Senators today, Concerned Women For America \nnoted that Ms. Nathan's:\n\n     . . . biases are so ingrained and so much the main thrust of \n     her career that it is not rational to believe that she will \n     suddenly change once confirmed as a judge. Rather it is \n     reasonable to conclude she would use her position to \n     implement her own political ideology.\n\n  I have reached the view that the facts as I have noted--her open \ndefense of the idea that judges can use sources other than our law to \ndecide cases and her lack of experience and proven record of good \njudgment and legal skill, the fact that a minority of the ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary found her not qualified to serve on \nthe bench, justifies a vote in opposition to this nomination. I will \nnot block the nomination. We will have an up-or-down vote. But I do \nthink in my best judgment--and that is all I have, my best judgment--\nafter reviewing her resume, looking at how thin her experience is, and \nher positions on a number of issues, indicates to me that she has the \nreal potential to be an activist judge, not faithful to the law. For \nthat reason, I will vote no.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Alabama. In \nArkansas, it is so important that we get good judges nominated and \nconfirmed, and that is why I rise in support of Susan Hickey's \nnomination as U.S. district judge for the Western District of Arkansas.\n  Judge Hickey's distinguished career interests reflect her pursuit to \nserve the interests of justice. As an attorney and now as a circuit \njudge in my home State of Arkansas, she has earned the respect of the \nArkansas legal community and proven she is devoted to fulfilling this \nimportant role in our judicial system.\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\n  I am confident Judge Hickey's extensive experience with the legal \nsystem will serve her well on the Federal bench. Her confirmation will \nfill the seat of retired Judge Harry Barnes, whom she clerked for \nbefore her appointment as circuit judge in the Thirteenth Judicial \nDistrict. She also worked in a private law firm following her \ngraduation from the University of Arkansas School of Law and also \nserved as an in-house counsel for Murphy Oil.\n  Judge Hickey has strong bipartisan support for good reason: She has \nestablished herself as a dedicated public servant who possesses a \nstrong work ethic and commitment to a fair and impartial legal system. \nHer experience and impartial demeanor and reputation amongst her peers \ngive me faith that Judge Hickey will do a great job as the U.S. \ndistrict judge for the Western District of Arkansas. When she was \nnominated for this position, Arkansans from all across the State \nexpressed their support for her confirmation.\n  I am honored to recommend that the Senate confirm Judge Susan Hickey \nas a U.S. district judge for the Western District of Arkansas. I am \nconfident her experience and judicial temperament make her the right \nperson to serve Arkansas as a district judge.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague for being here \ntoday and expressing his support for Susan Hickey to be a new Federal \ndistrict court judge in the Western District of Arkansas. She has a \nstrong record in our State. She is exactly what we need in a Federal \njudge. The fact that we have both home State Senators, one Democrat and \none Republican, supportive of the nomination begins to speak volumes \nabout the kind of person and the kind of reputation Susan Hickey has.\n  She has been in both the public sector and private sector. She has \nworked inhouse with an oil company, as Senator Boozman said. But she \nhas also law-clerked for a very solid and well-respected Federal judge.\n  She is now a State court judge in Arkansas at the State trial court \nlevel. She has handled 313 felony criminal cases since she has been on \nthe bench. She brings a lot of experience, and she is exactly the kind \nof person we need to be on the Federal bench.\n  When I look at a judge candidate, a judge nominee, I always have \nthree sets of criteria: One, are they qualified? Certainly, she is. She \nbrings very strong qualifications and experience to this position.\n  Second, can she be fair and impartial? I think that is something that \ncomes up with Susan Hickey over and over and over. From her local bar \ndown in south Arkansas, from the people in the community, the folks who \nhave dealt with her, they all say she is an extremely fair person, and \nthey have no doubt she will be impartial as she puts on that Federal \ndistrict court robe.\n  Then, my third criterion, does she have the proper judicial \ntemperament? That, obviously, is subjective because that comes down to \ntheir personality and their style. But we want a Federal judge who has \ngreat demeanor, who is very good with the law, but also very good with \nlawyers because, obviously, in a trial court they have a lot of type A \npersonalities in the court, and they have to give the proper appearance \nto the jury. That is critically important for a district court judge. \nSo I would say, absolutely, yes, she has the right judicial \ntemperament.\n  So I would strongly encourage all of my colleagues to vote favorably \nfor Susan Hickey. Like I said, she has handled 1,690 total matters in \nthe Federal courts since she has been a law clerk there.\n  Mr. President, 313 total felony cases have been disposed of in her \ntrial court in south Arkansas down in El Dorado. She has a lot of very \nsolid legal experience. The bottom line is, she is just a good person, \nand people like her and respect her and they trust her.\n  I think when our Founding Fathers put together the Federal judiciary, \nthis was the kind of person they wanted. She reflects the values and \nthe attitudes of that part of the State. She is smart. She is hard \nworking. She is going to be fair. Really, we could not ask a whole lot \nmore for any Federal judge in any district, and, certainly, she is \ngoing to do a great job down there.\n  So I am proud to be joined by my friend and colleague from Arkansas \nto support this nomination. If we support her, and if we confirm her \ntoday, we will be joining thousands and thousands of people in south \nArkansas who have supported her. We have had hundreds, I know, express \nsupport for her in my office. I am certain Senator Boozman has had many \nsupport her in his office as well.\n  I encourage my colleagues to give her very strong consideration. She \nhas been rated unanimously ``qualified'' by the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  There, again, in that both home State Senators support her, the \nAmerican Bar Association supports her, the Arkansas bar--not the \nassociation because they do not do those types of endorsements--but \nevery lawyer I have talked to who knows Susan Hickey thinks she will do \nan outstanding job, I would like to ask my colleagues to vote for her \nnomination and I appreciate their consideration.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to speak today in support of two \nexcellent nominees for the bench from the Southern District of New \nYork. These two women, Alison Nathan and Katherine Forrest, have \ndifferent backgrounds, but each in her own way represents the best the \nNew York bar has to offer.\n  Katherine Forrest is a young lawyer but an extraordinarily \naccomplished lawyer whose practice has been particularly well suited to \nthe needs of litigants in the Southern District. She was born in New \nYork City, received her BA from Wesleyan University, and her law degree \nfrom NYU Law School, one of the best in the country. She has spent the \nmajority of her career in private practice at the prestigious, top-line \nfirm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore, where she was on the National A List \nof Practitioners. She was named one of the American Lawyer's ``Top 50 \nLitigators Under 45.'' She currently serves as a Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General in the Antitrust Division of the Department of \nJustice, where I know she is very well regarded and has served with \ngreat distinction. I look forward to Ms. Forrest's transition from \nposition of service to our country to the other.\n  I also rise in support of Alison Nathan. I would like to counter some \nof the arguments that have been made against her on the floor here \ntoday.\n  First, Alison Nathan has tremendous legal experience, albeit that she \nis young. She is a gifted young lawyer whom New Yorkers would be \nfortunate to have on the bench, hopefully for a long time. Although she \nis a native of Philadelphia, she has called New York City her home for \nsome time. She graduated at the top of her class from both Cornell \nUniversity and Cornell Law School, where she was editor-in-chief of the \nCornell Law Review. She worked as a litigator for 4 years at the \npreeminent firm of WilmerHale and has also served in two of the three \nbranches of government. Ms. Nathan clerked for Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals Judge Betty Fletcher and then for Supreme Court Justice John \nPaul Stevens. Recently, she served with distinction as a Special \nAssistant to President Obama and an Associate White House Counsel. She \nis currently special counsel to the solicitor general of New York. Now, \nthat is a world of experience. It is hard to find better experience \nfrom somebody being nominated to the bench.\n  Some of my colleagues have said: Well, her rating from the ABA was \nnot as good and that was based on experience. That is what the ABA \ndoes. They claim, these colleagues, that Ms. Nathan lacks the \nexperience to be confirmed as a judge because only a majority of the \nABA rated her qualified, while a minority rated her not qualified.\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n\n  However, Ms. Nathan has the same qualification ratings as Bush \nadministration judges whom this body confirmed. Specifically, the \nSenate confirmed 33 of President Bush's nominees with ratings equal to \nMs. Nathan, including Mark Fuller and Keith Watkins of Alabama, \nVirginia Hopkins of the Northern District of Alabama, Paul Cassell of \nUtah, Frederick Martone of Arizona, and David Bury of Arizona. Are we \ngoing to have a different standard for Ali Nathan than for other \njudges? I sure hope not.\n  Then some have brought up only recently--actually, very recently--the \nthought that Ms. Nathan would apply foreign law to our own laws. It is \npatently false to say that Ms. Nathan has suggested or that she \nbelieves it is appropriate for U.S. judges to rely on foreign law or \nthat she herself would ever consider doing so. To the contrary. In \nresponse to written questions from Senator Grassley, she said \nexplicitly:\n\n       If I were confirmed as a United States District Court \n     Judge, foreign law would have no relevance to my \n     interpretation of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n  Let's go through that quote again. This is in reference to a question \nfrom Senator Grassley:\n\n       If I were confirmed as a United States District Court \n     Judge, foreign law would have no relevance--\n\n  ``No relevance,'' my emphasis--\n\n     to my interpretation of the U.S. Constitution.\n\n  My colleagues are also wrong in their suggestion that Ms. Nathan has \nin the past either relied on foreign law herself or suggested that \ncourts should do so. In the Baze vs. Rees case, she merely described \nthe fact that others, including a law school clinic and Human Rights \nWatch, had argued in their own briefs that international law could be \nconsidered when dealing with questions of pain and suffering. \nSimilarly, in her analysis of the Roper case, Ms. Nathan made an \nobservation about what the Supreme Court had done--specifically, that \nthe Supreme Court had cited foreign law as nondispositive support for \ntheir conclusion about the national consensus in the United States \nabout the death penalty. That my colleagues jumped from these two \ninstances in which Ms. Nathan described other peoples' opinions to \nconclusions about Ms. Nathan's own belief leads me to ask, are judicial \ncandidates not allowed to describe the arguments that others have made? \nThat would be rather absurd. I cannot imagine it is the outcome my \ncolleagues would want, but it is the one to which their arguments \nnaturally lead.\n  Finally, on national security, where again some from the outside who \nhave criticized Ms. Nathan have brought up national security, here is \nwhat she has said:\n\n       I think it is important for a Federal district judge to \n     follow the Supreme Court. It is important to our national \n     security for there to be judges who follow the law in this \n     area--\n\n  National security--\n\n     to the extent questions come before them and that Congress \n     acts as it has in this area.\n\n  That is good reason that she is supported by all of the law clerks \nshe served with, including those of Justices Thomas, Scalia, Kennedy, \nand O'Connor. And obviously those Justices are not Justices who agree \nwith some of the other Justices on the Court, but their law clerks \nuniformly supported Ali Nathan.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to support Ali Nathan. She will be an \noutstanding addition to the bench in the Southern District of New York, \nas well as Katherine Forrest, who will also be an outstanding addition.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Alison J. Nathan, of New York, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Southern District of New York?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

With regard to our policy toward Iran and the recent \nrevelation of a potential attack involving not just foreign embassies \nand ambassadors but Americans, potentially Senators, being killed by a \nplot hatched by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and Quds Force, there \nshould be consequences, not just concerns expressed from the \nadministration. We have witnessed a growing aggressiveness by the \nIranian regime toward the United States and toward their own people.\n  For example, recently, an Iranian actress who appeared uncovered in \nan Australian film was then sentenced to 90 lashes for her so-called \ncrime. With regard to the 330,000 Baha'is, a religious minority in \nIran, first they were excluded from all public contracting, then they \nwere told all their children had to leave Iranian universities, and \nthen all their home addresses were registered in secret by the Iranian \nInterior Ministry.\n  I would suggest we have seen this movie before in a different decade \nwearing different uniforms. But this is the bureaucracy necessary to \ncarry out a Kristallnacht in Farsi.\n  We have seen, for example, the Persian world's first blogger, Hossein \nRonaghi, who was thrown into jail simply for expressing tolerance \ntoward other peoples and other religions. Probably most emblematic, we \nsaw the jailing of Nasrin Sotoudeh, a young mother and a lawyer, whose \nsole crime was to represent Shirin Ebadi, a Noble Prize winner, in the \ncourts of Iran.\n  We hear and have watched unclassified reports of an acceleration of \nuranium enrichment in Iran. We even have the irony, according to the \nInternational Monetary Fund, that despite comprehensive U.N. and U.S. \nsanctions--according to the IMF--Iran had greater economic growth last \nyear than the United States and the Iranian indebtedness is only a \nfraction of U.S. indebtedness. According to the IMF, the United States \nowes about 70 percent of its GDP in debt held by the public. For Iran, \nit is only 5.5 percent.\n  Now the United States has enacted a new round of sanctions against \nIran. President Obama signed it into law last year. There were 410 \nvotes in the House, and it was unanimous in the Senate. I worked for \nmany years on a predecessor to that legislation when I was a Member of \nthe House. The record of the administration, and especially our very \nable Under Secretary of the Treasury David Cohen, has been very good at \nimplementing that bill. He has been very successful in reducing formal \nbanking contacts between American, European and Asian banks and Iran. \nIt is very important, when we look at the situation of how to deal with \nIran, that we not see it from Washington's view, looking toward Iran, \nin which we see an awful lot of banks and an awful lot of transactions \nshut down, but look at it from Tehran's view, looking back from the \nUnited States, and we will see a quickly growing Iranian economy, a \ngrowing record of brazen oppression, actresses sentenced to 90 lashes, \nNoble Prize-winning attorneys thrown in jail, an accelerating nuclear \nprogram, and then a decision by the head of the Iranian Revolutionary \nGuard Corps, Quds Force, to attack the United States.\n  Long ago, I thought it was a mistake to have the Drug Enforcement \nAgency left outside of the U.S. intelligence community. Luckily, we \nreversed that decision and we brought DEA back into the intelligence \ncommunity. It was a lucky strike that the person who was contacted by \nthe Quds Force to carry out an attack on the United States actually \ncontacted a confidential informant working for the DEA. It was on that \nlucky break that we had the ability to break this plot. But if we read \nAttorney General Holder's complaint against the defendant involved, we \nwill see--I believe it is on page 12--a rendition of how, if they could \nnot kill the Ambassador outside the restaurant, it was perfectly OK \nwith the Quds Force operator that a bomb go off involving dozens--if \nnot over 100--of Americans killed. The bonus, he thought, maybe a large \nnumber of Senators would be involved. If that was necessary to kill \nthis Ambassador, all the better.\n  The Treasury Department has designated, finally, the head of the Quds \nForce under our law. But it is ironic that when we look at the \ncomprehensive record of designations, the Europeans, who actually are \nnot known for their strong-willed backbone on many international \nquestions, have a more far-reaching effect on calling it the way they \nsee it in Iran. Both Europe and America now have a regime to bring \nforward sanctions and designations against Iranians who are \n``comprehensive abusers of human rights.''\n  Currently, our government has only designated 11 Iranians, where the \nEuropean Union has designated over 60. One of the people missed by our \nadministration is the President of Iran, Mahmud Ahmadinejad, who often \ntalks about ending the state of Israel. Probably the only head of state \nof a member of the United Nations who regularly talks about erasing \nanother member of the United Nations from the planet. We also have not \ndesignated President Ahmadinejad's chief of staff. We have not \ndesignated dozens of people that even the European Union has designated \nas comprehensive abusers of human rights.\n  So what should we do when we have uncovered a plot to attack the \nUnited States in which the highest levels of the Iranian Revolutionary \nGuard Quds Force was involved? Thank goodness for the DEA and the rest \nof the law enforcement and intelligence community of the United States, \nthe plot was foiled, and so no attack was carried out. In my mind, we \nshould take the toughest action possible, short of military action. Is \nthere consensus in the Congress behind what that action should be? I \nwould argue yes.\n  Senator Schumer and I, this summer, put forward what we feel is one \nof the real, most crippling sanctions the United States could deliver \nagainst Iran; that is, to ensure that any financial institution that \nhas any contact with the Central Bank of Iran be excluded from the U.S. \nmarket. Because the United States is the largest economy on Earth, we \nbelieve nearly every financial institution on the planet will cut its \nties to the Central Bank of Iran. That, most likely, would cripple \nIran's currency and cause chaos within their economy. You know what. \nIran might actually suffer a recession, which it currently is not in, \nand I think that would be an appropriate price to pay.\n  When Senator Schumer and I reached out to the Senate to ask for \nsupport, I was very surprised at the answer because all but eight \nSenators signed our letter. There were 92 Republicans and Democrats who \nsigned the letter stating it should be the policy of the United States \nto collapse the Central Bank of Iran, to cripple its currency. After \nwhat we learned this week of a plot to kill Americans and to carry out \nterrorist attacks on the Capital City of the United States, I think \nthat represents appropriate consequences, not just concerns.\n\n  We heard from the administration this morning--and while I was \nencouraged by the diligent work, especially of the Treasury Department, \nI was concerned about another thing. There are press reports that the \nadministration\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\nlearned about this plot in June and only revealed it to us the day \nbefore yesterday. So the administration has had months to understand \nwhat this plot meant and plan for the consequences. Yet except for \nminor actions against a small airline in Iran called Mahan Air, except \nfor actually finally designating the head of the Iranian Revolutionary \nGuards' Quds Force, we have no comprehensive action by the United \nStates.\n  My recommendation to this House and to the administration is we \nshould take yes for an answer. With 92 Republicans and Democrats all \nstanding behind an effort to collapse the Central Bank of Iran, this is \nthe appropriate sanction. On top of that, we have the Menendez \nbipartisan legislation to close loopholes in the sanctions already \ncosponsored by 76 Senators. This is a tough time of partisanship in \nWashington. We don't get bipartisan issues such as this that often. I \nam surprised, it having known about this plot since June, the \nadministration has not already put forward action, but I would urge \nthem to do so. This was not a multilateral attack by a collection of \ncountries on the United States; therefore, I don't think we should wait \nfor multilateral approval before the United States acts against the \nIranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and the highest levels of the Iranian \nGovernment. We should designate the full list of comprehensive abusers \nof human rights the way the EU has done. We should exclude any \nfinancial institution from the United States that does business with \nthe Central Bank of Iran. We should make sure that in the case of high-\nlevel Iranian officials who have plotted an attack, potentially \ninvolving dozens of American deaths right here in the Capital City of \nthe United States, there should be severe consequences, they should be \nfairly swift, and our inaction should not be mistaken for weakness in \nthe face of what is one of the most brazen international acts we have \nseen in recent times.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor up to 20 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me make one comment to the Senator from Illinois. I \nam glad he said what he did. It is very significant. People don't look \nat Iran as seriously as they should. It is not even classified that \nIran is going to have the capability of a weapon of mass destruction \nand a nuclear warhead and a delivery system by 2015. That was the very \nreason they were going to have a ground-based interceptor in Poland, so \nwe can defend against something coming from that direction, since all \nour ground-based interceptors are on the west coast in Alaska and \nsouthern California.\n  When we see things such as this, and the fact that they are coming \nout and doing things they haven't done before, that just tells me our \nexpectations of their nuclear capability are very true and it is very \nserious\n\n\n                               Jobs Bill\n\n  That is not what I want to talk about. In the wake of the defeat of \nPresident Obama's jobs bill, I wished to give a couple thoughts here \nand then talk about something we better look out for in the future. \nThat jobs bill failed by a large margin, and we heard the President \nsay: Pass the bill, pass the bill, pass the bill. We didn't pass the \nbill. I can see why the President wants to consider passing some kind \nof jobs bill right away, when we stop and remember what he did with the \nlast one. The last stimulus bill was $825 billion. This package was \nrammed through the Congress shortly after he entered office. The \nRecovery Act, as it was called, had only $27 billion out of $825 \nbillion for roads and highways. The occupier of the chair is very well \naware of my concern over infrastructure in America.\n  I remember when that bill was on the floor and Senator Boxer, from \nCalifornia, and I had an amendment to increase that amount. It was only \n3 percent of the total of $825 billion that would go to roads, \nhighways, maintenance, bridges, and this type of thing--only 3 percent. \nWe were trying to raise that to 30 percent. If that had happened, then \nlook where we would be today. We would have the jobs, we would have all \nthe shovel-ready jobs throughout America.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, our portion of that would have been well \nspent just distributed in the way that we had the formula after the \n2005 highway reauthorization bill. Anyway, that actually was only 3 \npercent. It was only $27 billion out of $825 billion. The one we just \ndefeated was a $447 billion stimulus bill. It only had $27 billion in \nroads, highways, construction, maintenance--the things that provide \njobs and the things this country needs.\n\n  I have been ranked as the most conservative Member of the Senate \nseven different times in the past. Yet I readily say I am a big spender \nin two areas: One is national defense and the other is infrastructure. \nI think that is what we are supposed to be doing here. We are in a \ndesperate situation with our infrastructure around the country.\n  So one might say, well, the President had the $825 billion stimulus \npackage and only $27.5 billion went to roads and highways. What \nhappened to the rest of it? Well, the rest of it, in spite of what he \nsaid--I am going to read what he said--right after the passage of the \nbill, when he was signing the bill, the $825 billion stimulus bill, he \nsaid:\n\n       What I'm signing, then, is a balanced plan with a mix of \n     tax cuts and investments. It's a plan that has been put \n     together without earmarks or the usual pork barrel spending. \n     It's a plan that will be implemented with an unprecedented \n     level of transparency and accountability.\n\n  Well, stop and remember as I tell my colleagues what this actually \nwent for. It is clear the most recent example was this loan guarantee \nwith Solyndra. Everyone here is aware of what happened with Solyndra. \nWe know it was a firm that was producing supposedly green energy. We \nknow the people who were behind this loan guarantee of $535 million \nwere big contributors to the administration, and they went ahead and \nwere able to get bailed out--not bailed out, but get their loan \nguarantee--costing the taxpayers $\\1/2\\ billion, and that is part of \nwhat was in this bill. That is where the money was. The genesis of that \nwas the $825 billion stimulus bill.\n  I am reminiscing a little bit about what happened back in the middle \n1990s, back when Bill Clinton was President of the United States, when \nwe had a very similar thing happen at that time. There is a company \ncalled the Loral Corporation. The Loral Corporation is headed up by \nBernard Schwartz. Bernard Schwartz was one of the biggest contributors \nto the Democratic national party and to Bill Clinton. Bernard Schwartz, \nthe company, the Loral Corporation, built a guidance system for a \nmissile so that missile could be more accurate. Even though China \nwanted to have that system so they would be able to guide their \nmissiles more accurately, for obvious reasons we didn't want them to \nhave it. So it took a waiver signed by the President of the United \nStates. President Bill Clinton did it. He signed the waiver and they \ngot the money. I see similarities in here. I think, again, everyone is \nfamiliar with that.\n  How did they get the money? Where did it come from? The $825 billion \nin the stimulus bill.\n  Let's look. Since the President gave that statement, which I will \nread again--he said:\n\n       What I'm signing, then, is a balanced plan with a mix of \n     tax cuts and investments. It's a plan that has been put \n     together without earmarks or the usual pork barrel spending.\n\n  What do we call the Solyndra thing? It is porkbarrel spending.\n  What about the earmarks? This is a confusing thing for most people \nbecause my well-meaning conservative friends in the House of \nRepresentatives a couple of years ago put a 1-year moratorium on \nearmarks, and earmarks would be defined, of course, as appropriations \nor authorizations. By doing that, it totally contradicts what the \nConstitution, article I, section 9, says we are supposed to be doing \nhere. It says we are supposed to be doing the appropriations and the \nauthorizations. That is specifically precluded from the President in \nthe article of the Constitution. So it is one that was very obvious. We \nfind out later that the person who was behind that was none other than \nPresident Obama.\n  There is a reason for this. Because most people don't understand \nthere are two different kinds of earmarks. One is congressional \nearmarks. That is when\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\na Congressman, a lot of times in the dark of night, will try to put \nsomething down that maybe is not in the best interests of the United \nStates but helps his district. That occasionally happens. It shouldn't \nhappen. Under our system, it won't happen if we require all \nappropriations to be authorized. But the other kind, in addition to the \ncongressional earmarks, are bureaucratic earmarks. That is what the \nPresident can do.\n  I will give an example. I am on the Armed Services Committee. The \nPresident's budget comes out. He says what we should spend money on to \ndefend America. A couple of years ago, before this moratorium the \nRepublicans put on in the House, one of the lines he had in his budget \nwas $330 million for a launch system called a bucket of rockets. It was \na good system, and I would like to have that system for defending \nAmerica. But we thought in our committee that the same $330 million \nwould be better spent on buying six new FA-18E/F model strike fighters \nfor our Air Force. Well, we could do that, except that would be called \nan earmark. When we destroy an earmark, we don't save any money, we \njust say, Mr. President, we are not going to do it, so you go ahead and \nyou do it. Consequently, we were able to take the $330 million and put \nit in the FA-18s, but after that would pass, that would be called an \nearmark, and so the President would have all the power.\n  If we look back at the $825 billion stimulus bill, we can look at \nsome of the things that were in there. He said he wasn't going to have \nany earmarks. These are Presidential earmarks: $219,000 to study the \nhookup behavior of female college co-eds in New York; $1.1 million to \npay for the beautification of Los Angeles' Sunset Boulevard; $10,000 to \nstudy whether mice become disoriented when they consume alcohol in \nFlorida; $712,000 to develop machine-generated humor in Illinois; \n$259,000 for foreign bus wheel polishers in California. It goes on and \non.\n  There is $150,000 for a Massachusetts middle school to build a solar \narray system on its roof; $1 million to do research on fossils in \nArgentina. Here is a good one. I will not attribute this to my two good \nfriends who are Senators from Wyoming, but $1.2 million to build an \nunderpass for deer in Wyoming.\n  That is what the President put in. Those are all earmarks. \nConsequently, I think what we are trying to get to here is if he had \nbeen successful in the $447 billion stimulus bill earlier this week, \nthen we could anticipate the same type of thing happening.\n  I want the conservatives of America to wake up to the fact that the \nproblems we have, when they talk about earmarks, are not congressional \nearmarks, they are bureaucratic earmarks.\n\n  It wasn't long ago that Sean Hannity on his show had a feature, I \nthink it took him several nights to do it. It was the 102 most \negregious earmarks. He named all of these earmarks, one after another, \nand went on and on and on. I came down to the Senate floor the morning \nafter that and I read that same list. There were 102 earmarks, very \nsimilar to what I read. The interesting thing about it--and I said this \non the Senate floor at that time--what did these 102 earmarks have in \ncommon? Not one was a congressional earmark. They were all bureaucratic \nearmarks.\n  We are going to be attempting to do something about this, because it \nis something that almost everyone would agree needs to be done. What we \nare going to introduce and the bill I am working on now, and I am \ngathering some cosponsors, is legislation that will bring real \ntransparency and accountability to this process. It would do this by \ninvolving Congress in the grant-making process.\n  Right now, agencies are required to disclose a lot of information \nabout grant awards, but not until after they are already awarded. We \ndon't know about them. Even we here in this Chamber don't know about \nthem until some unelected bureaucrat actually makes these what I would \nrefer to as bureaucratic earmarks. So it is setting up a system very \nsimilar to the Congressional Review Act.\n  The Congressional Review Act lets us look at the regulations and have \na process by which we can stop the bureaucrats from passing regulations \nthat we may think as elected Members, elected by the people, are not \ngood. This will do essentially the same thing the CRA does for \nregulations, it would do for these earmarks. So it is something we will \nbe active in. I think back now, if we had not defeated that $447 \nbillion stimulus bill the first part of this week, we would be looking \nat right now, and I am sure they would be putting together, their list \nof earmarks.\n  I think we have an opportunity now to do two things. No. 1, when the \nPresident--and I say when, and not if--when the President comes up with \nanother jobs bill, let's look at it very carefully to make sure we have \neverything specifically in there if it is going to be deserving of our \nvotes. I say that to each individual, Democrat and Republican, in this \nChamber.\n  The second thing is make sure we don't open the door for him to be \nable to come up with another several hundred billion dollars of \nearmarks as we did in the $825 billion stimulus bill 2 years ago.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Madam President, I heard a report today from Senator \nMurkowski. Apparently, the Energy Committee had a hearing on the 90-day \nshale gas report. I think this is very significant. I am sure she will \ncome down and talk about it in detail. I didn't even know about it \nuntil noon today when she gave her report and I happened to be there, \nbut it is something that is very significant.\n  In this country we talk about energy and the fact that we have enough \nenergy we can produce domestically in the United States of America to \nrun this country for 100 years in terms of gas, with present \nconsumption, and 50 years as far as oil is concerned, and we are \ndependent upon oil, gas, and coal to run this country, and those are \nsomething--a lot of people are saying we have to do away with fossil \nfuels. Every time I hear people say that, it is kind of laughable, when \nthey say we have to do something about our dependence on foreign oil by \ndoing away with our own production in this country.\n  Our problem is not that we do not have the amount of coal, oil, and \ngas that we need to be totally independent from anybody. We do. But, \npolitically, we have obstacles. There is not one other country in the \nworld where the politicians will not let that country develop its own \nresources except for the United States of America.\n  It is kind of interesting. It was not too long ago when President \nObama, who is very much in line with some of the far-left \nenvironmentalists who want to do away with fossil fuels, was realizing \npeople were catching on, and people knew that with all the shale \ndeposits that are out there--and every week that goes by, we find \nanother great big opportunity for shale; this is both oil and gas--and \nthe President said gas is plentiful, and we need to use more gas, and \nall that. But at the end of his speech, he said: We have to do \nsomething about that procedure called hydraulic fracturing.\n  Anyone who understands energy knows that to get at all of these \ndeposits--these shale deposits of gas or oil--you have to use a \nprocedure called hydraulic fracturing. It happens we know something \nabout it in my State of Oklahoma because in 1948 the first well was \ncracked, and we have not had one documented case in 60 years of ground \nwater contamination as a result of hydraulic fracturing. So it is \nsomething that does work.\n  But those individuals who want to make people think they are wanting \nus\n\n[[Page S6497]]\n\nto develop our own resources then turn around and say we are going to \nstop or have the Federal Government regulate hydraulic fracturing. It \nis totally inconsistent, and I think it is a direct effort to misinform \nthe people.\n  So in this meeting today, Senator Murkowski did a handout, and I am \ngoing to read a couple of the quotes from some of the people who had \npreviously testified before the committee. Keep in mind, this is after \na 90-day shale gas report. They talked about hydraulic fracturing and \nall of that.\n  One quote is from Dr. Daniel Yergin, who is chairman of IHS Cambridge \nEnergy Research Associates, and he is a bestselling author. He said:\n\n       There's a gap in perception--this idea that oil and gas is \n     not regulated. We were all impressed by the quality and the \n     focus, the long experience of the states in regulating oil \n     and gas. . . . There's a strong backbone to it and that is \n     not as well recognized in some circles. So I think there is a \n     very strong fabric here.\n\n  Here is a quote. This is from Kathleen McGinty. I remember her from \nwhen she was an aide to Al Gore. She was chair of the Council on \nEnvironmental Quality during the Clinton administration. She said:\n\n       We didn't come up with any conclusion--\n\n  This is the 90-day shale report--\n\n     that the deck chairs need to be shuffled around. . . . There \n     was nothing in the testimony that we heard or in the \n     substance that we focused on or in the ``what'' needed to be \n     done that led to a glaring conclusion that there was an actor \n     missing from the scene.\n\n  Well, this is someone who comes from, completely, the other side. So \nI think it is very important. The more times you look at this thing, \nthe more there is an awareness of the people--that is heightened almost \non a daily basis--that we have all this opportunity, and we are not \ndoing it just because of the political obstacles.\n  Dr. Stephen Holditch is the petroleum engineering department head, \nSamuel Roberts Noble chair, and professor of petroleum engineering at \nTexas A University. He said:\n\n       Local control, local understanding of best practices is \n     really the best way to go. . . . There's nothing broken with \n     the system now.\n\n  My State of Oklahoma is an oil State. A lot of our stuff is pretty \nshallow. On the other hand, in the Anadarko Basin, we have some of the \nmore deep things. But if you look, for 60 years the States have \nregulated hydraulic fracturing, and it has worked very well. It is not \none of these one-size-fits-all because in some States--when you get in \nNew York and Pennsylvania, now, and the Marcellus Shale, the stuff is \npretty deep, but it is abundant. Well, the regulation there would be \ndifferent than it would be in my State of Oklahoma or in Louisiana or \nin New Mexico or any of the other oil States.\n  I was really glad to see this come out, and I am glad Senator \nMurkowski is now letting people become aware of it because we have \nenough oil, gas, and coal to be totally independent, if we can just get \nthe obstacles out of the way. One of the techniques used in being able \nto recover this, of course, is hydraulic fracturing. So that is why a \nlot of the people who are trying to shut down fossil fuels are trying \nto shut down that process.\n  I had an experience--I wish I could remember the name of the company, \nbut it was in Broken Arrow, OK--during the recess, where I was calling \non different people, and there was a young man who started a company. \nHe had been with a larger one. He is making platforms for hydraulic \nfracturing. Now, a platform is about one-fourth of the size of this \nChamber I am speaking in right now. It is a very large thing. On the \nplatform, so they can hydraulically fracture these wells, they have a \nvery large diesel engine. A regulation came through--I was not even \naware of this until I sat down with him; this is less than 1 month \nago--he said the regulation was that you can no longer build platforms \nand use them for hydraulic fracturing unless you have a tier 4 engine.\n  Well, we went to check, and he was right. There is no tier 4 engine. \nIt is on the drawing boards, but it is not available commercially now. \nSo that is just another way through regulation they are trying to do \naway with hydraulic fracturing.\n  So we have to be on our toes, and we have to have a wake-up call for \nthe American people. If we want to have good, clean, abundant, cheap \nenergy, we have it right here in the United States of America, and we \nneed to knock down the political obstacles and develop our own \nresources like everybody else does.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this Chamber considered trade \nmeasures this week for the first time in about 4 years. First, and most \nimportant, the bipartisan currency measure passed by an overwhelming \nmajority, 63 to 35. This action on China's currency is long overdue. \nThis is legislation of which I was the prime sponsor. We had major \ncosponsors in both political parties: Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, \na Republican; Chuck Schumer of New York, a Democrat; Debbie Stabenow \nfrom Michigan, a Democrat; Jeff Sessions from Alabama, a Republican; \nSusan Collins, a Republican from Maine; Kay Hagan, a Democrat from \nNorth Carolina; Bob Casey, Democrat from Pennsylvania. This was a \nstrong bipartisan bill. My junior Senator, Rob Portman from Ohio, \nformer Trade Representative under President Bush, supported the \nlegislation.\n  Basically it works this way. We know the kinds of job losses in \nplaces such as Duluth, MN or Toledo, OH, because China cheats. Pure and \nsimple, they cheat. They depreciate or overappreciate their currency, \nmaking a weaker renminbi. That is the name of their currency term. When \na company in Dayton, OH, or Youngstown, OH, sells a product into the \nChinese market that the people of Xian or Wuan might consider buying, \nthis company is faced with a 25- to 30- to 35-percent currency tax, \ncurrency tariff, making the product more expensive, making it much \nharder for the U.S. company to sell the product to China. At the same \ntime going back the other way, the company in China, or the government \nin some cases, selling into the U.S. market gets a 25-, 30-, 35-percent \nsubsidy, making it so much easier to sell.\n  I will give one perfect example, a regrettable example. There is a \ncompany about 20 miles from where I live in Brunswick, OH, owned by the \nBennett Brothers whom I met fairly recently in Cleveland, 25 miles \noutside of Cleveland, called Automation Tool and Die. The Bennett \nBrothers had a million dollar sale that they thought they were about to \nfill and at the last minute a Chinese company came in and underpriced \nthem by 20 percent. That was the currency subsidy that Chinese company \nhad. What is fair about that?\n  I learned today a paper company in Hamilton, OH, right smack in the \nmiddle of the home county and home district of the Speaker of the \nHouse, announced its closing. One of the main factors was low-cost \nimports from China.\n  When it comes to paper, here is what the Chinese do. They buy their \npulp in Brazil, they ship it from Brazil to Chinese paper mills--in \nsome sense across two oceans. They mill it, they ship it back to the \nUnited States, and yet they underprice us. Even though labor is 10 \npercent of the cost of paper production, they underprice us because \napparently they subsidize water and energy and land and capital, plus \nthey get this 25-percent currency subsidy.\n  Our trade deficit with China, which has more than tripled in the last \ndecade after China was let into the World Trade Organization, pledging \nto follow the rule of law but breaking that pledge every day of the \nyear--our trade deficit with China, now $275 billion for the year, has \nrisen through the economic food chain all the way through advanced \ntechnology products. What used to be made in China 10 years ago was \nsimilar--the Presiding Officer remembers growing up in Minnesota in the \n1950s and 1960s when ``Made in Japan'' always used to mean something \nwas cheap and sort of badly made. ``Made in China'' 10 years ago \nusually meant the cheapest products, the tchotchke kind of products. \nToday, with ``Made in China,'' they have worked their way up the \ntechnology chain so they compete with our wind turbine component \nproduction and they compete on all kinds of high-level kinds of goods.\n  In addition to paper, steel, aluminum, glass, and cement, all the \nthings that have created the middle class in my State for decades, we \nare competing with China for jobs in solar and wind and clean energy \ncomponent manufacturing and in the auto supply chain. We can compete on \nproductivity. We have skilled workers. We have world-class \ninfrastructure--although God knows it needs renovation and \nmodernization. But how do you compete against an automatic across-the-\nboard 25- to 30-percent subsidy?\n  I thank my colleagues this week for voting for that legislation--63, \nincluding the Presiding Officer's support--including the support to \nmanufacturing. We need to pass that bill in the House of \nRepresentatives. The Speaker of the House has so far said he is not \ninclined to bring it up. I think the White House has so far not \nsupported this legislation, but we know the kind of broad bipartisan \nsupport it has and how important it is so we can begin to reenergize \nmanufacturing in this country.\n  At the same time we took a step back this week, after the China trade \ncurrency bill, which was very progressive, important legislation for \nour manufacturing--we took a step back by passing trade deals with \nColombia, South Korea, and Panama that will do more harm than good.\n  It is kind of amazing. Probably the too often used quote from \nEinstein where he said the definition of insanity is doing the same \nthing over and over and expecting a different result is exactly what \nhas happened in trade agreements. Go back 20 years--18 years, in 1993, \nPresident Clinton--mimicking President Bush, who had negotiated the \nagreement--said the North American Free Trade Agreement would create \n200,000 jobs in our country quickly. We have lost 600,000 net jobs \nbecause of NAFTA. That same model of NAFTA with investor-state \nrelations--with investor-state provisions and other things, gave rise \nto the Central America Trade Agreement and other agreements that cost \nus jobs. Every time the administration--either party, it doesn't \nmatter--promises these trade agreements will create jobs, they never \ndo. This body, again--Colombia, North Korea, Panama--a strong majority \nof Senators again bought that line, ``Hey, this is going to create \njobs,'' and it never does.\n\n  The same promises, businesses promise jobs will increase exports. \nThey only talk about half of it. They say NAFTA, CAFTA, the Korea Free \nTrade Agreement, the Panama Free Trade Agreement, Colombia Free Trade \nAgreement, are going to mean more exports. Talking only about exports \nis like telling a baseball score and only reporting half of the score. \nYesterday, the season obviously mercifully ended for the home team of \nthe Presiding Officer, but it is like saying yesterday the Twins scored \neight runs. Good for them, but the Indians scored 12. But they only \ntold you about the Twins' runs. You don't report baseball scores that \nway. You report scores like the Twins got 12, the Indians only got 8, \nand it was 12 to 8 or the Tigers won 3 to 2.\n  With trade, the people who support these trade agreements are the \nsame ones who say it lets us increase the exports. Maybe it is, but \nimports are increasing much more dramatically.\n  President Bush once said $1 billion in trade surplus or trade deficit \ntranslated into 13,000 jobs. If you have a $1 billion trade deficit, if \nyou are selling more than you are buying, that creates 13,000 jobs. If \nyou are buying more than you are selling, if you have a $1 billion \ntrade deficit, you lose 13,000 jobs. You know our deficit is in the \nrange of $600 billion. Do the math. Each time we\n\n[[Page S6499]]\n\npass one of these trade agreements--and it will probably happen with \nKorea and Colombia and Panama--each time we do it, the trade deficit \nrises. Our trade deficit with China has more than tripled. Before NAFTA \nwe had a trade surplus with Mexico and small trade deficit with Canada. \nAfter NAFTA, which was a trade agreement among the United States, \nCanada, and Mexico, the trade deficit with Canada exploded. The trade \nsurplus with Mexico went from a surplus to a deficit. We know this does \nnot work.\n  We have a serious jobs crisis on our hands, 14 million people out of \nwork. We hear Senators talking about that all the time--another 15 \nmillion underemployed or stopped searching for work. The economy must \nhave 150,000 new jobs each month simply to keep up with population \ngrowth. So what do we do? We add a Korea agreement, a Colombia \nagreement, a Panama agreement, none of which will create jobs. They \nnever do. They promise them, but they never do. That is because these \ntrade agreements do not tell the whole story about how a trade agenda \ncan actually create jobs.\n  I want trade, I want more trade. I think the American people want \nmore trade, but the American people know these trade agreements don't \nserve us as a nation. It is impossible. I know you hear this in Duluth, \nyou hear it in Rochester, you hear it in Minneapolis. I hear it in \nCincinnati, I hear it in Columbus, I hear it in Zanesville. When \nunemployment is far too high, our constituents demand that Washington \ndo its job and help folks get back to work.\n  We tried to do that this week on another issue and that was the \nPresident's jobs bill. When I heard Senator McConnell, the Republican \nleader, say--it is almost a direct quote--my No. 1 goal in 2011 and \n2012 is to make sure Barack Obama doesn't get reelected--I never heard \na leader in the U.S. Senate to my knowledge in history ever say that \nwas his No. 1 goal. Of course, the Presiding Officer and I will support \nBarack Obama. That is what happens in politics--you hear the leader of \none political party say my No. 1 goal is to defeat the sitting \nPresident of the United States. And he rounds up his troops to vote no \nagainst any job creation bill that President Obama offers. In fact, he \ndidn't just vote against this bill and led every Republican to do that, \nhe led his Republican troops to say: No, we are not going to let it \ncome to the floor to be debated.\n\n  Senator Cardin was speaking earlier, and I was presiding. He was \nincredulous in many ways--that the leader of one party would say on the \njobs bill, of all things, we are not even going to allow it to come to \nthe floor to debate and offer amendments. Senator Cardin had several \namendments I thought sounded like a good idea. A lot of us have \namendments to the jobs bill, and we wanted a chance to offer them. Yet \nRepublicans--because of this dysfunctional rule that we have to have 60 \nvotes to even put up a bill for debate--the Republicans say: No, we are \nnot even going to debate it.\n  Let me take one part of that bill that is particularly important. The \naverage U.S. public school building is 40 years old. Many are older; \nsome are newer. The average public school building is 40 years old. I \nknow what I preach to my kids. I know what my neighbors preach. I know \nwhat we preach as politicians. I know what almost everybody says in \nthis country. We say to our children and the pages--people who are 15, \n16, 17 years old--education is the most important goal to pursue, the \nmost important in our country.\n  What do we do? We send them to crumbling old school buildings that \nare not easy places in which to learn. It is pretty clear that when the \naverage school building is 40 years old, it is going to cost real money \nto fix them. Conservative estimates suggest it would cost $270 billion \nto maintain and repair them.\n  With the slowly recovering economy, we know that too many school \ndistricts have been forced to cut budgets and lay off teachers, let \nalone make improvements to our schools. I introduced Fix America \nSchools Today, the FAST Act, that would help localities make critical \nrepairs to schools. It will support more than 12,000 jobs in Ohio.\n  I introduced the bill a few weeks ago. Soon after, the President was \nat Fort Hayes Public School in Columbus, OH, in the central part of my \nState. The President talked about the FAST Act, about how we should do \nschool renovation as part of his jobs bill.\n  I would plead with my colleagues on the Republican side of the \naisle--the same colleagues who worked with me on a bipartisan basis to \npass the biggest bipartisan jobs bill, the China currency bill of this \nsession--to work on this bill. At least, if they will not let us debate \nthe jobs bill as a whole, let us pass the Fix America's Schools Today, \nthe FAST Act, it will make the kinds of repairs--it will create jobs \nbecause workers will rebuild these schools and renovate them. It will \ncreate jobs in manufacturing as companies all over my State that make \nsteel, plastic, cement, and brick will go to work to create and make \nthese products, and it will lay the groundwork for prosperity.\n  We know in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, the United States of \nAmerica built infrastructure the likes of which the world had never \nseen. That is why we had that kind of prosperity in this country. When \nthe Presiding Officer and I were in high school and college and were \nyoung adults, we had that kind of prosperity brought about because we \nhad the best infrastructure in the world. We have to rebuild and \nmodernize the infrastructure to create opportunities for young people. \nWe need to pass the FAST Act. It will make such a difference for our \ncountry in the years ahead.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/13/senate-section/article/S6499-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6499-S6502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INTERNATIONAL TRADE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I come to the floor today to speak on \nan issue that is of great importance to my home State of Louisiana: \ninternational trade. From its founding, Louisiana has been a hub for \ntrade and entrepreneurship. In fact, the French explorer Bienville \nchose the site for the city of New Orleans in 1718 because, at a \ncrescent bend in the Mississippi River, it is close to the Gulf of \nMexico but safe from tidal waves. President Thomas Jefferson later made \nthe Louisiana Purchase in 1813 to increase opportunities for U.S. \ntraders and protect U.S. access to the Port of New Orleans. Ever since \nthen, Louisiana and the Mississippi River have been the gateway to the \neconomic heartland of the United States. For example, 60 percent of all \ngrain exported from the United States is shipped via the Mississippi \nRiver. It is also a little known fact that the Port of New Orleans \nimports more steel than any other port in the country. This crucial \nport sees more goods leave its docks each day than almost anywhere in \nthe Nation. Studies have found that the Port of New Orleans pumps $882 \nmillion into the Louisiana economy and helps sustain more than 160,000 \njobs. The reality is Louisiana's ports are America's ports and the \ngateway to the world. There are 31 ports in the State of Louisiana and \nsome of the busiest in the world in terms of gross tonnage. Five of the \n31 ports in Louisiana, from the Gulf of Mexico to Baton Rouge, are \ndeepwater ports. We are home to 5 of the country's top 13 ports, \nexporting more than $40 billion in goods last year alone and making \nLouisiana the fourth largest exporting State in the country. Louisiana \nsends everything from sugar to oil to more than 200 countries \nworldwide. Port Fourchon supports infrastructure that provides 18 \npercent of the Nation's entire oil supply. The Port of South Louisiana \nexports more than any other port in the country. When combined with the \nnearby Port of New Orleans, these ports form the fourth largest port \nsystem in terms of volume handled. Today New Orleans hosts an \nAustralian Trade Office, a Mexican Consulate, a French Consulate, and \ncountless honorary consuls. For all of these reasons, I do all I can \nhere in the U.S. Senate to promote exports from Louisiana. These \nexports mean jobs in my State--from the suppliers, to the \nmanufacturers, to the shipping companies, to the port workers.\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\n  I support the trade promotion agreements with Colombia, South Korea, \nand Panama. This is because I believe that these agreements are fair \nand present excellent opportunities for Louisiana companies. Since \ncoming to the Senate in 1996, I have been a strong supporter of free \ntrade. However, my first priority is our local businesses and workers \nin Louisiana. For example, I voted against the Central American Trade \nPromotion Agreement in 2005. I voted against this agreement because I \ndid not feel that the agreement was fair. Free trade requires that all \nplayers operate on as level a playing field as possible--accountable to \nthe same labor laws, environmental standards, and governmental \nintervention.\n  A main reason that I am able to strongly support these three \nagreements is that the Congress just passed the extension of the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance, TAA, Program. Congress created TAA in 1962 to \nhelp workers and firms adjust to dislocation that may be caused by \nincreased imports. The program assists workers who lose their jobs or \nwhose hours of work and wages are reduced as a result of imports. In \n2010 alone, 12 TAA petitions were certified in Louisiana, providing \nalmost $5 million in Federal funds, and most importantly, assisting \n1,309 workers.\n  An example of a key business that benefitted from TAA is the Georgia \nPacific plywood plant in Logansport. Georgia Pacific was the largest \nemployer in Logansport and in October 2007 it announced that it was \nimmediately closing its local plywood operation, putting 280 employees \nout of work. The Department of Labor determined an increase in imports \ncontributed to the plant closure, making these workers eligible for TAA \nbenefits. Furthermore, in November 2008, over 500 workers in Bastrop \nwere laid off because of the closure of the International Paper Mill. I \nworked closely with U.S. Representative Rodney Alexander to secure TAA \nassistance for these workers in 2009. These workers in Logansport and \nBastrop are but two examples of how important this program has been in \nassisting workers in Louisiana impacted by increased imports.\n  In terms of the pending trade promotion agreements, in my view, \nColombia presents the most economic opportunities for Louisiana \nbusinesses. Colombia is a fast-growing market of 45 million consumers. \nThis makes it the second largest country in Latin America and the third \nlargest economy in the region. It purchases more U.S. products than \nRussia, Spain, Indonesia, or Thailand. The United States is also \nColombia's largest trading partner in terms of exports and imports. \nTwo-way trade between the countries accounted for more than $28 \nbillion.\n  While these figures sound promising for U.S. exports to Colombia, \nthey do not tell the whole story. In order to keep competing for \nColombia's consumers, we must view trade with Colombia as a marathon, \nnot a sprint. The United States is Colombia's top supplier today but \nChina is closing fast on our heels. China has increased its share of \nthe Colombian market sixfold in the last 10 years. Imports from China \nincreased 47 percent in 2010, compared to the previous year. At the \ncurrent pace, China will displace the United States as Colombia's main \ntrading partner in less than a decade. For my part, I do not intend to \nconcede the race before it is won. Colombia has long been one our \nclosest allies in South America and is making great strides in curbing \ndecades of violence caused by drug cartels, paramilitaries. To concede \nthe Colombian market to China after years of cooperation on economic \nand strategic interests is unwise. It is particularly unwise and \nshortsighted as Colombia is an emerging market close to our shores. \nColombia has also recently signed agreements with Canada, the European \nUnion, and South Korea that present challenges to U.S. companies \ncompeting in the country. Other countries are not standing still on \ntrade opportunities with Colombia and neither should the United States.\n  As of 2010, Colombia was Louisiana's 12th largest export market with \n$727 million in exported goods. This is down from highs of $856 million \nin 2007 and $1.5 billion in 2008. The decline in exports is attributed \nin large measure to a reduction in U.S. agricultural market share in \nColombia since 2008. U.S. farmers saw their market share decrease from \n46 percent in 2008 to 21 percent in 2010. The reduction stems in part \nfrom Colombian agreements with other countries, such as Argentina and \nBrazil as well as tariffs on U.S. goods as high as 20 percent. Tariffs \nresult from the absence of a bilateral trade promotion agreement, TPA, \nbetween the United States and Colombia. That is a major reason I \nbelieve the Colombian Trade Promotion Agreement can benefit Louisiana.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Louisiana is \ncurrently the third largest exporter of rice in the United States with \n$136 million in total rice exports. However, U.S. rice exports to \nColombia currently face tariff rates from 5 to 20 percent. Under the \nTPA, Colombia will establish a 79,000-ton, zero-duty rice tariff rate \nquota, TRQ, that will grow 4.5 percent annually for 19 years. Louisiana \nrice exports to Colombia could increase by more than $3.2 million per \nyear. Funds from companies bidding on rights to export rice to Colombia \nduty free will go to research boards in the six biggest rice production \nStates, including Louisiana. This is estimated to be as much as $10 to \n12 million per year.\n  As with other agricultural products, since 2008, U.S. soybean exports \nwere down significantly to Colombia as the United States lost market \nshare in the country and tariffs ran as high as 20 percent. In 2010, \nthe United States exported $103 million of soybeans and soybean \nproducts. This was a 21-percent drop in U.S. soybean exports from 2009 \nto 2010 and followed a 51-percent drop from 2008 to 2009. Under the \nTPA, Colombia will immediately eliminate duties on soybean imports from \nthe United States. Colombia will also establish a 31,200-ton, zero-duty \nrice tariff rate quota for crude soybean oil that will grow 4.5 percent \nannually. Louisiana soybean exports to Colombia could increase by more \nthan $600,000 per year. Lastly, the country will also phase out its 24-\npercent tariff for refined soybean oil over 5 years.\n  Furthermore, in 2010, the United States exported $100 million of \ncotton to Colombia. Under the TPA, Colombia will immediately eliminate \nduties on cotton. Louisiana cotton exports to Colombia could increase \nby more than $710,000 per year. This provides duty-free opportunities \nfor Louisiana cotton producers to gain a new partner to spin, cut, and \nsew our Louisiana cotton for textiles instead of exporting raw cotton \nto China. This could provide a double benefit to the U.S. economy as \nour cotton exports to Colombia are used in many apparel items that \nColombia then exports back to the U.S. market.\n  Outside of agricultural products, there are also benefits to other \nindustries in Louisiana from increased opportunities in Colombia. For \nexample, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission, the TPA \nwill result in an annual increase of 23 percent, to $1.9 million, in \nU.S. exports in chemical, rubber, and plastic goods to Colombia. Why is \nthis important to Louisiana? As you may know, Louisiana hosts 90 major \nchemical plants and 300 petrochemical manufacturers that directly \nemploy 27,000 skilled workers. The State supplies infrastructure \nrequired for world-class manufacturing combined with the necessary \nservice providers--more than 1,000 Louisiana service companies support \nthe petrochemical industry. From 2008 to 2010, 15 percent of the $937 \nmillion in goods exported to Colombia consisted of chemical products. \nColombian tariffs on Louisiana chemical exports range as high as 20 \npercent. Under the TPA, 86 percent of U.S. chemical exports would \nimmediately receive duty-free treatment. This will significantly help \nLouisiana chemical companies looking to export to Colombia.\n  Next, under the TPA, Colombia will immediately eliminate its tariffs \non 75 percent of U.S. plastics exports. An example of how this benefits \none Louisiana product is that the State exported almost $6 million \nworth of polyethylene, a plastic widely used in packaging materials, to \nColombia in 2010. This product would see almost $900,000 in duty \nsavings.\n  Louisiana companies in the oil and gas machinery and services \nindustries also stand to benefit greatly from the TPA. According to the \n``Oil and Gas Journal,'' Colombia has 1.9 billion barrels of proven \ncrude oil reserves in 2011,\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\nthe fifth largest in South America. These reserves are expected to \nincrease with the exploration of several new blocks that were auctioned \nin 2010. The Energy Information Administration projects that Colombian \noil production will surpass the 1 million barrel per day mark during \nthe third quarter of 2012. Also, as of 2010, there were natural gas \nreserves in Colombia of 4 trillion cubic feet. Because of the huge \npotential of these reserves, the Colombian Government has made oil and \ngas exploration and production a top priority.\n  Currently, Louisiana companies exporting oilfield equipment to \nColombia face tariffs of 10 percent or higher. They also face growing \ncompetition, with 11 percent of the market in 2009 from Chinese \ncompanies at lower costs, but lower quality and reliability in relation \nto U.S. products. Under the TPA, Colombia will immediately eliminate \ntariffs on 52 percent of U.S. energy equipment exports. Tariffs on an \nadditional 6 percent of exports would be eliminated after 5 years and \nthe remaining 42 percent would be eliminated after 10 years. This \nallows our highly skilled oilfield companies in Louisiana to get more \nof their quality products into the Colombian market at lower prices.\n  I also understand that the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement \nincludes strong protections for workers rights. These protections were \nstrengthened further this year by a labor action plan agreement between \nPresident Obama and President Santos. The concerns this plan addresses \nare: violence against Colombian labor union members, inadequate efforts \nto bring murder suspects to justice, and insufficient protection of \nworkers rights in Colombia. The action plan included major steps that \nthe Colombian Government had to undertake before the trade promotion \nagreement would enter in force. Key to these reforms included the \ncreation of three ministries: Labor, Justice and Housing. The new Labor \nMinistry will be responsible for implementing programs to protect labor \nrights. I also believe that the Colombian Government's efforts to turn \nthe tide on the long-running terrorist insurgency will promote long-\nterm stability in Colombia and the region. This is because a great deal \nof the violence seen in Colombia over the past decades was fueled by \ndrug money funneled to paramilitary groups and criminal organizations. \nAs the Colombian Government has recovered more control over its \nterritory and demobilizing these groups, it is seeing increased \nsecurity, social progress and economic growth.\n  I have presented facts and figures, but let me give you an example of \na Louisiana company that has already had success in Colombia. Textron \nMarine and Land Systems, based in New Orleans, manufactures armored \npersonnel carriers and armored security vehicles. They are four-wheeled \nvehicles that have multiple layers of armor to defend against small \narms fire, land mines, and explosive devices. Both of these vehicles \nhave an impressive track record around the world and are vital to the \nU.S. and coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Textron builds these \nvehicles for the U.S. Army at their plants in eastern New Orleans and \nSlidell.\n  With the help of the U.S. Foreign Commercial Service, Textron was \nable to secure a $45.6 million contract in 2009 to provide 39 armored \npersonnel carriers for the Colombian Army. These vehicles were \ndelivered to the Colombian Army and see daily service throughout the \ncountry protecting their soldiers. Not only did these exports help \npromote peace and security in Colombia, but they allowed Textron to \nmaintain its workforce and continue the vehicle line into the future. \nTextron was so successful with this first order that Colombia has \nrequested another 38 armored security vehicles. The combined value of \nboth contracts is more than $80 million. In addition to these vehicles, \nTextron is working closely with the Colombian Government to create a \nCenter of Excellence for vehicle maintenance in the country. This \ncenter would develop maintenance and supply systems to cover all the \nColombian armored security vehicles with the potential to cover all \nother vehicle fleets owned by the government. The company also helped \nlead a 2009 trade mission of 12 Louisiana companies to Colombia. I \napplaud Textron, as well as our local U.S. Foreign Commercial Service \nstaff in New Orleans, for promoting these exports in Colombia. Textron \nis a great example of a Louisiana company that has not just succeeded \nin tapping this market--they continue to succeed in Colombia. Under the \ntrade promotion agreement, I am optimistic that more Louisiana \ncompanies will be able to follow in Textron's successful footsteps.\n  In regards to the South Korea Trade Promotion Agreement, this is \nanother promising, high-growth market for U.S. companies. Korea has an \neconomy at close to $1 trillion and is the eighth largest trading \npartner of the United States. Korea's economy grew 5.8 percent in the \nsecond quarter of 2010 and the International Monetary Fund expects it \nto grow by 6.1 percent in 2010. There also is currently a trade deficit \nbetween Korea--$11 billion in 2009. The trade promotion agreement is \nestimated by the International Trade Commission to improve the trade \nbalance with Korea by $3.3 billion to $4 billion. Lastly, I am aware \nthat as in Colombia, the European Union, EU, signed a trade promotion \nagreement with South Korea on July 1, 2011. This agreement eliminated \n98.7 percent of the Korean tariffs on EU products. U.S. companies are \nnow at a sharp competitive disadvantage in this growing market. We used \nto be Korea's top trading partner but now have taken a backseat to \nChina, Japan, and the EU. Over the last decade, China's market share \nincreased in Korea from 7 percent to 18 percent alone while U.S. market \nshare flipped from 21 percent to 9 percent. So this is another instance \nwhere inaction on a bilateral agreement could cost the United States \ndearly on Korean market share, missed export opportunities, and most \nimportantly, lost job opportunities here at home.\n  Overall, I note that Korea bought $3.9 billion in agricultural \nproducts in 2009, making Korea our fifth largest agricultural export \ndestination. This is despite the fact that Korea's tariffs on imported \nagricultural products average 54 percent, compared to the average 9 \npercent levied by the United States on the same type of imports. \nAccording to the American Farm Bureau Federation, exports by American's \nranchers and farmers to Korea will increase by almost $1.8 billion \nevery year under the agreement. This is attributed to increases in \nexports of grain, oilseed, fiber, fruit, vegetable, and livestock \nproducts.\n  Louisiana farmers stand to benefit greatly from these reductions in \nagricultural tariffs in Korea. For example, as the agreement eliminates \ntariffs and other barriers on most agricultural products, this \nincreases export opportunities for Louisiana cotton, beef and soybeans. \nI have heard from my soybean farmers in Louisiana that they have tried \nin the past to develop a market in Korea, but have had difficulty. They \nare optimistic that the agreement will help efforts to establish a \nmarket in Korea--particularly with getting soybean products into \nKorea's livestock industry.\n  One company that should benefit from the Korea Trade Promotion \nAgreement is Pontchartrain Blue Crab. As you know, Korea is the fifth \nlargest market for U.S. fish and fish product exports. Gary Bauer, \nowner of Pontchartrain Blue Crab, PBC, has been in the blue crab \nfishery for nearly 29 years. He began working in the industry as a \ncommercial fisherman in 1979, where he worked part time to support his \nfamily. Mr. Bauer then established a seafood dock to service fishermen \nfrom Lake Pontchartrain. Pontchartrain Blue Crab has grown from 4 \nemployees to now more than 70 employees.\n  In 2002, PBC was able to create a blue crab processing plant located \nin Slidell, LA, which then allowed the company to pasteurize crab into \nexportable containers. Like other businesses in south Louisiana, \nhowever, it had to rebuild its facilities following Hurricane Katrina. \nWith assistance from the Small Business Administration, SBA, Mr. Bauer \nand his company were able to export into the Korean market. Their \nsuccess in Korea has encouraged PBC to also look into expanding into \nthe European market in the near future. So although PBC is already in \nthe Korean market, reductions in Korean tariffs offer new opportunities \nfor the company.\n  There are also benefits to nonagricultural businesses from this trade\n\n[[Page S6502]]\n\npromotion agreement. One area that will greatly assist Louisiana \ncompanies is reductions on tariffs on chemical exports. Currently \nchemical product exports accounted for an average of $360 million per \nyear of Louisiana's exports to Korea between the years of 2008 to 2010. \nHowever, Korean chemical tariffs average 6 percent but can run as high \nas 50 percent. As such, U.S. exporters of chemicals and related \nproducts, including chemicals, organic chemicals, plastics, and \nfertilizers will see significant reductions in tariffs on their exports \nto Korea. First, 50 percent of U.S. chemical exports will receive duty-\nfree treatment immediately after the agreement enters into force. The \nremaining tariffs will be phased out over 10 years. Tariffs on such \nproducts as silicon and plastics will also be eliminated immediately.\n  The third trade promotion agreement is with Panama. It is my \nunderstanding that Panama is already a great market for U.S. exports, \neven with an uneven playing field. U.S. products entering Panama are \nsubject to tariffs, but most products from Panama receive duty-free \ntreatment when entering the United States. The trade promotion \nagreement will encourage further expansion and diversification of U.S. \nexports in the country. With a major expansion of the Panama Canal, a \nhuge subway project in Panama City and development of the world's fifth \nlargest copper mine underway, the opportunities ahead for U.S. \ncompanies in Panama are significant. By entering into a bilateral \nagreement with Panama, the United States also ensures that our \ncompanies can compete for contracts on the $5.25 billion Panama Canal \nexpansion project. EU and Canadian companies currently have the inside \ntrack on these contracts because of their bilateral agreements with \nPanama.\n  In terms of Louisiana, agricultural exports to Panama stand to \nbenefit greatly from the trade promotion agreeement. While the benefits \nfor the Louisiana rice industry as not as great as with Colombia, \nduties on U.S. rice exports will be phased out over 20 years. There \nwill also be two separate tariff rate quotas established--one for rough \nrice and one for milled rice. The milled rice TRQ in year one of the \nagreement is 4,240 metric tons and will increase 6 percent each year \nbefore becoming duty free in year 20. This TRQ qill allow for improved \naccess for Louisiana milled rice starting in the agreement's first year \nof implementation. As I have indicated before, in 2010 Louisiana \nexported $427 million in soybeans and soybean products abroad. The \nLouisiana soybean industry will also see Panama lock in its current \nzero-tariff treatment for soybeans and soybean meal after the agreement \nis implemented. Panama is a smaller market than Korea or Colombia but \nthe country's geographic proximity to Louisiana presents unique \nopportunities for our companies.\n  With that in mind, let me give you an example of a Louisiana company \ncurrently working in Panama. Baker Sales Inc. of Slidell, LA, is a \nsmall business that distributes imported steel tubing and fencing. When \nconstruction slumped during the recession, so did demand for steel \nproducts. They saw their sales drop 20 percent last year when oil/gas \ncontractors pulled orders after the Deepwater Horizon disaster. For 30 \nyears, Baker Sales has imported steel products and sold them to \ncustomers largely within a 200-mile radius of Slidell. The company has \nalways wanted to export--particularly recently as they identified \nopportunities in Panama, where South American immigrants are moving in, \nnecessitating new housing developments and high-rises.\n  President Robert Baker paid $800 for U.S. Commercial Service's Gold \nKey Service last March. He met with a dozen potential clients in Panama \nover 2 days and one developer he met is interested in ordering $100,000 \naluminum fencing. Thanks to the higher loan limits authorized by the \nSmall Business Jobs Act passed by Congress last year, Baker Sales Inc. \nreceived a $3 million U.S. Small Business Administration 7(a) loan that \nwill help them expand their business by facilitating export \ntransactions with buyers in Panama. They immediately hired two more \nemployees because of the loan. As sales to Panama increase--and \npotential sales to South Korea materialize--the company expects to hire \nmore employees.\n  In closing, as chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business \nand Entrepreneurship, I am aware that cash registers are not ringing \nlike they used to for our small businesses around the country. For this \nreason, exporting has become a practical solution for small businesses \nlooking to survive and grow. Small businesses across the country have \nnot only used exporting to weather the economic storm, they have proven \nthat what helps our entrepreneurs helps our entire economy. According \nto the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. exports supported an estimated \n9.2 million jobs in 2010--up from 8.7 million in 2009. Furthermore, for \nevery billion dollars of exports, over 5,000 jobs are supported. As our \ncountry digs out of the economic crisis, helping more small businesses \nexport for the first time and current exporters reach new countries, \nshould be a top priority. I believe that small businesses can lead us \nout of this recession by creating new and higher paying jobs and \nlessening this trade deficit. These three trade promotion agreements \nwill further promote small business exports and help our companies \ncompete in these growing markets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/13/senate-section/article/S6502-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6502-S6503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING MARTIN'S POINT HEALTH CARE\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today to commend Martin's Point \nHealth Care in Portland, ME, for its outstanding accomplishment of \nscoring two five-star ratings from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid \nServices, CMS, for its Medicare Advantage health plans.\n  This is truly an accomplishment as a five-star designation is quite a \nrarity. With fewer than ten plans nationwide receiving this top rating, \nMartin's Point Medicare Advantage plans are among a very select group. \nThey are also the only Maine health care organization to receive this \ndistinction for 2012.\n  The CMS five-star rating system was developed to help demonstrate the \nvalue of Medicare plans and to help ensure that they meet specific \nquality standards. It provides the nation's nearly 48 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries with a tool to compare the quality of care and customer \nservice that Medicare health and drug plans offer. The rating system \nconsiders several quality measures, such as success in providing \npreventive services like screenings and vaccines; chronic illness \nmanagement; and ratings of plan responsiveness, care, and customer \nservice.\n  Martin's Point is a not-for-profit health care organization committed \nto providing the best possible health care experience to its patients \nand members. The organization is comprised of a multispecialty medical \ngroup with nine primary care health centers in Maine and New Hampshire. \nMartin's Point also administers three health plans: a Medicare \nAdvantage plan in Maine, the U.S. Family Health Plan for military \nfamilies and retirees throughout New England, and a new innovative \nprogram called MaineSense for small to medium employers in Maine. Its \nMedicare Advantage plans cover more than 12,500 Medicare beneficiaries \nacross the State of Maine.\n  Martin's Point began in the early 1960s in the Camden/Rockport, ME, \narea when Dr. Niles Perkins obtained federal funding under the Great \nSociety Act of Congress to provide health care services to uninsured or \nunderinsured indigent individuals. These individuals, many of them \nfisherman and employees of a local fish processing plant, didn't \nqualify for Medicare, but also couldn't afford health insurance on \ntheir own. With the Federal funding obtained, Dr. Niles formed \nPenobscot Bay Medical Association.\n  Meanwhile in 1982, Dr. Johann Brower, a colleague of Dr. Perkins at \nPenobscot Bay Medical Associates, wrote a proposal to purchase some of \nthe land and facilities at Martin's Point from the U.S. Government. \nDespite the fact that several other organizations, including Mercy, \napplied for the grant, Dr. Brower's application was the only one \nsubmitted on time and was accepted. The purchase price was $1.00, under \nthe conditions that Penobscot Bay Medical Associates would operate the \nfacility as a not-for-profit for 30 years.\n\n[[Page S6503]]\n\n  Penobscot Bay Medical Associates, doing business as Martin's Point, \nbecame a designated uniform service treatment facility. Maine military \nretirees were able to come from all over the State to the facility and \nhave their care paid for by CHAMPUS. Access to primary care--family \nmedicine, internal medicine and pediatrics--along with on-site \nlaboratory, dental, optometry, pharmacy and radiology was made \navailable to all patients utilizing the facility.\n  In 1996, under the U.S. Family Health Plan, Martin's Point was \nauthorized as a TRICARE prime provider and awarded their first \nmultimillion-dollar, multiyear contract with the Department of Defense. \nThis all happened under the direction of Dr. David Howes, who became \nthe president and CEO of Martin's Point in 1996.\n  In the 2000s, Martin's Point expanded their USHFP membership--they \nnow have over 35,000 members in Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New \nYork, and the northern tier of Pennsylvania\n  Then, in 2006, they launched their Generations Advantage plans. These \nare Medicare Advantage options for seniors and persons with \ndisabilities in six Maine counties. They have since expanded so that in \n2010, their Medicare Advantage plans are offered in all 16 counties in \nMaine. They serve over 12,500 members.\n  In 2008, Martin's Point became one of the first 40 organizations to \nbecome a prototyping organization in the Institute for Healthcare \nImprovements Triple Aim initiative. In 2009, they affiliated with \nBowdoin Medical Group, a large group of physicians with five health \ncenters in southern and coastal Maine communities. This acquisition \nessentially doubled Martin's Point provider base and patient count--\nbringing their total number of health centers up to 9.\n  In November 2010, Martin's Point opened the doors of their new, \nstate-of-the-art primary care facility on the Veranda St. peninsula at \nMartin's Point. This flagship facility, designed with input from \nproviders, patients and other clinical employees, is a fitting tribute \nto the patient-focused philosophy of Martin's Point and helps them to \nrealize their unending commitment to providing a better health care \nexperience for their patients.\n  Today, Martin's Point's Medicare Advantage plans are in the top 3 \npercent nationally based on quality. I am delighted to recognize \nMartin's Point for this accomplishment, and I wish them all the best in \nthe coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/13/senate-section/article/S6503-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL TRADEMARK EXPO\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I would like to recognize and express my \nsupport of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's, USPTO, National \nTrademark Expo.\n  Trademarks are characteristics of a good or service such as a name, \nsymbol, or sound that identify and distinguish one party's goods and \nservices from those of others and help many of us distinguish between \nauthentic and counterfeit merchandise. On any given day, an individual \nmay be exposed to as many as 1,500 trademarks.\n  Trademarks are useful tools against counterfeit goods, which cost the \nUnited States billions of dollars and many jobs each year, as well as \nundermine consumer confidence in brand integrity when purchasers \nencounter imitation goods of lesser quality. Through the USPTO's \nefficient approval process and registration of trademarks, the agency \nassists businesses in protecting their investments, promoting goods and \nservices, and safeguarding consumers against confusion and deception in \nthe marketplace.\n  This year's National Trademark Expo will be held on Friday, October \n14, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturday, October 15, from 10 a.m. to 4 \np.m., at the USPTO headquarters in Alexandria, VA. The Expo will \nfeature educational seminars, children's workshops, story time, guided \ntours and presentations from some of America's leading large \ncorporations, small businesses, governmental agencies and nonprofit \ncorporations.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the USPTO for its \ncontinued efforts to educate the public on the important role of \ntrademarks, as well as the benefits of the National Trademark Expo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/13/senate-section/article/S6503-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6503-S6504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL ALFRED FLOWERS\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I take this opportunity to \ncongratulate MG Alfred K. Flowers, U.S. Air Force, for his dedicated \nservice to our country. General Flowers has the distinct honor of being \nthe longest serving member in the history of the U.S. Air Force, and he \nis the longest serving active duty member in the Department of Defense.\n  In his present assignment, General Flowers serves as the Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for Budget and is responsible for planning and \ndirecting the Air Force's budget. Over the last 2 years in this role, \nhe led a team of over 160 military, civilian and contractor \nprofessionals charged on behalf of the Secretary and Chief of Staff of \nthe Air Force to present to the Congress the funding of all Air Force \nprograms. It is his responsibility to organize and present to the \nCongress annual appropriations submissions as well as various overseas \ncontingency operations requests. His leadership and his keen \nunderstanding of the Congress has served the Air Force and the security \ninterests of our country very well during appearances of the senior \nleadership of the Air Force before committees of the House and Senate. \nGeneral Flowers' vision, inspirational leadership, and unselfish \ndevotion to duty have resulted in important improvements in the \nresourcing of and strategic direction of Air Force's missions.\n  General Flowers began his career as an enlisted supply warehouseman \nin August 1965 at Grand Forks Air Force Base. He then served as an air \ntransportation specialist for 4 years beginning in September 1967. In \n1971, General Flowers became an accounting specialist for the Air Force \nand served 7 years in that role. After his selection to the grade of \nmaster sergeant, General Flowers was commissioned, following graduation \nfrom Officer Training School as a distinguished graduate in December \n1978. In his first three assignments as a budget officer, he served at \nthe squadron, major command and air staff levels. In 1990, he was \nassigned as Chief of the Budget Operations Division for Air Combat \nCommand, where he later served as the chief of budget.\n  The general has served on the Joint Staff as a defense resource \nmanager, and in 1999 was the director of budget programs for the \nDepartment of the Air Force. General Flowers also served as the Air \nEducation and Training Command comptroller. His other assignments \ninclude director, Center for Force Structure, Requirements, Resources \nand Strategic Assessments at Headquarters U.S. Special Operations \nCommand, and commander, Air Force Officer Accession and Training \nSchools. Prior to his current assignment, the general was commander, \n2nd Air Force, at Keesler Air Force Base, MS.\n  Of distinct importance and significance, as the comptroller for \nHeadquarters Air Education and Training Command, he budgeted and \nmanaged funding of the largest flying hour program in the Air Force, \ninvolving 542,000 hours annually and 38 percent of the Air Force's \ntotal flying hour program and spanning 21 major weapons systems. As \ndirector, Center for Force Structure, Requirements and Strategic \nAssessments, U.S. Special Operations Command, he spearheaded the \nlargest increase in resources and force structure for Special \nOperations Forces in the history of U.S. Special Operations Command. \nHis insightful vision and tireless dedication were instrumental in \ngarnering 13,000 additional personnel and $11 billion in additional \nfunding to enhance and expand Special Operations Forces to successfully \nexecute the Global War on Terrorism.\n  As the 2nd Air Force Commander, General Flowers led the largest \ntransformation of basic military training in 50 years, expanding \ntraining from 6.5 to 8.5 weeks. This modernization was vital to \nproviding realistic expeditionary combat skills training to prepare \nenlisted airmen for their deployments. His support of combatant \ncommanders included providing over 14,000 joint expeditionary tasking \nairmen to the area of responsibility and reshaped the role of the Air \nForce in Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom.\n\n[[Page S6504]]\n\n  Following these assignments, General Flowers was well prepared to \nassume his current position as the director of the Air Force budget. \nUnder his direction, this organization developed, established, and \ncultivated professional relationships within the air staff, the Office \nof the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, the Army, the Navy, the \nMarine Corps, and with Members and staff of the U.S. Congress, \nsignificantly improving the record of approval of resources necessary \nto support key warfighter programs. He provided critical oversight and \ndirection for over 30 Air Force appropriations to accurately deliver a \nnearly $800 billion Future Years' Defense Program budget to the Office \nof the Secretary of Defense on time and on target. He has successfully \ncompleted annual budget submissions of close to $170 billion for fiscal \nyears 2011, 2012, and 2013 and justified them to the Secretary of \nDefense, the Office of Management and Budget, the Congressional Defense \nAppropriations and Authorization Subcommittees and the Congressional \nBudget Office. General Flowers' leadership, sound judgment, and wise \ncounsel will be sorely missed by all.\n  I am pleased to commend General Flowers for his historic and \noutstanding service to our country, which is a great example of \ndistinguished military service. On the occasion of his upcoming \nretirement, I wish General Flowers and his family all the very best in \nthe years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/13/senate-section/article/S6504-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. KOHL.

As a \nproud alumnus, I take these moments to reflect on the purple and gold's \nstory, success and accomplishments that have endured these past 100 \nyears.\n  Located in the Sherman Park Neighborhood of Milwaukee, WI, Washington \nHigh School, with its never-ending commitment to excellence, has \nwelcomed students through its doors and ushered them out to embrace \nbright futures for ten decades. Throughout its evolution and changes, \nWashington High School has always provided its students with a first \nclass education, instilling values and providing skills that help \nstudents pursue employment, higher education and individual dreams.\n  Well-known for its focus on technology, the innovative high school \ncreated the first Career Specialty Program in 1976 focusing on \ncomputers and earning the school its reputation as ``the computer \nschool.'' It has been nationally recognized for its curriculum which \nbuilds knowledge and critical thinking skills through the use of \ntechnology.\n  The school proudly acclaims each graduating class including notable \nalumni who achieved excellence in business, attained the office of \nGovernor of Wisconsin, served at the highest level of our military, \nbecame Commissioner of Baseball, reached stardom on Broadway and in \nHollywood, joined the ranks of professional athletes, and even one who \ngot elected U.S. Senator; each and every graduate a remarkable person \nwho graduated from a remarkable place, Washington High School.\n  Wisconsin's strong tradition of excellence in education has been \nshaped by Washington High School's rich, long history filled with a \ncentury of proud, hopeful students, and extremely dedicated faculty and \nstaff. As alumni from varied graduating classes and walks of life, we \ngather as one body to celebrate collectively the spirit of our high \nschool years, and the achievements, made individually and collectively \nby a century of alumni.\n  As all Washington High School alumni have done before, we cheer for \nthe purple and gold, the Purgolders and everything this fine \ninstitution represents.\n  With a warm welcome to all who cherish and gather to remember, I \nproudly congratulate Washington High School, my alma mater, on its \n100th anniversary, and my sincere best wishes for 100 more exceptional \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/13/senate-section/article/S6504-2", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2433.

A bill to amend the Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia \nResearch and Control Act of 1998, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Harmful Algal \nBlooms and Hypoxia Research and Control Amendments Act of 2011. This \nbill would enhance the research programs established in the Harmful \nAlgal Blooms and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998 and \nreauthorized in 2004, which have greatly enhanced our ability to \npredict outbreaks of harmful algal blooms, HABs, and the extent of \nhypoxic zones. But knowing when outbreaks will occur is only half the \nbattle. This bill addresses not only the mitigation and prevention of \nHABs and hypoxia, but also prioritizes the effective transition of \nresearch products into implementable actions that state and local \ngovernments can take to minimize adverse impacts.\n  I am proud to continue my leadership on this important issue and I \nparticularly want to thank my counterpart on this key piece of \nlegislation, Senator Bill Nelson. I also want to thank the bill's \nadditional co-sponsors, Senators Begich, Rockefeller, Whitehouse, \nGillibrand and Cardin for their support.\n  In New England blooms of Alexandrium algae, more commonly known as \n``red tide'' can cause shellfish to accumulate toxins that when \nconsumed by humans lead to paralytic shellfish poisoning, PSP, a \npotentially fatal neurological disorder. Therefore, when levels of \nAlexandrium reach dangerous levels, our fishery managers are forced to \nclose shellfish beds that provide hundreds of jobs and add millions of \ndollars to our regional economy. Red tide outbreaks--which occur in \nvarious forms not just in the northeast, but along thousands of miles \nof U.S. coastline--have increased dramatically in the Gulf of Maine in \nthe last 20 years, with major blooms occurring almost every year.\n  In 2009, Maine's shellfish industry experienced a severe economic \ncrisis as result of extensive rainfall and subsequent outbreak of red \ntide. The resulting closure of 97 percent of the State's shellfish beds \nand 100 percent of the offshore beds in federal waters for several \nmonths during the peak harvesting season was even more damaging to the \nshellfish industry and coastal economy than previous outbreaks in 2005 \nand 2008. In December 2010, Department of Commerce Secretary Locke \nfound that the 2009 red tide bloom had caused a commercial fishery \nfailure. Despite the recognition of their losses, fishermen have never \nreceived any economic assistance or compensation for the 2009 fishery \ndisaster.\n  The HABs and hypoxia programs are critical to Maine's $50 million \nshellfish industry and the 3000 jobs that depend on it. Luckily, we \nhave not experienced strong blooms in 2010 and 2011, and recent years \nhave seen an increase in testing capabilities that allow for finer \nscale monitoring so that localized areas may remain open during an \nevent. These critical procedures are a direct result of programs \nestablished by the Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia Research and \nControl Acts of 1998 and 2004.\n  While we have made great strides in bloom prediction and monitoring, \nit is clear that these problems are continuing to increase in magnitude \nand demand our ongoing commitment and attention. Harmful algal blooms \nremain prevalent nationwide, and areas of hypoxia, also known as ``dead \nzones'' are now occurring with increasing frequency. Within a dead \nzone, oxygen levels plummet to the point at which they can no longer \nsustain life, driving out animals that can move, and killing those that \ncannot. The most infamous dead zone occurs annually in the Gulf of \nMexico, off the shores of Louisiana. This area, averaging 6700 square \nmiles in size over the last 5 years, is exacerbating the already \ndifficult recovery of the Gulf region from last year's devastating oil \nspill. Dead zones are also occurring in more areas than ever before, \nincluding off the coasts of Oregon and Texas, and in the Chesapeake \nBay.\n  The amendments contained in this legislation would enhance the \nNation's ability to predict, monitor, and ultimately control harmful \nalgal blooms and hypoxia. Understanding when these blooms will occur is \nvital, but the time has come to take this program to the next level--to \ndetermine not just when an outbreak will occur, but how to reduce its \nintensity or prevent its occurrence all together. This bill would build \non NOAA's successes in research and forecasting by creating a program \nto mitigate and control HAB outbreaks.\n  This bill also recognizes the need to enhance coordination among \nstate and local resource managers--those on the front lines who must \nmake the decisions to close beaches or shellfish beds. Their decisions \nare critical to protecting human health, but can also impose \nsignificant economic impacts. The bill would require development of \nRegional Research and Action Plans to identify baseline research, \npossible State and local government actions to prepare for and mitigate \nthe impacts of HABs, and establish outreach strategies to ensure the \npublic is informed of the dangers these events can present. A regional \nfocus on these issues will ensure a more effective and efficient \nresponse to future events. Finally, this bill would provide for \nresearch, response and mitigation of harmful algal blooms annypoxia in \nfresh water systems.\n  If enacted, this critical reauthorization would greatly enhance our \nNation's ability to predict, monitor, mitigate, and control outbreaks \nof HABs and hypoxia. Over half the U.S. population resides in coastal \nregions, and we must do all in our power to safeguard not only their \nhealth and the health of the marine environment, but we must also \nprotect the jobs that depend on it. The existing Harmful Algal Bloom \nand Hypoxia Program has achieved a great deal already, and this \nauthorization will allow it to continue providing such a vital service \nto the nation. I thank Senator Bill Nelson, and all of my cosponsors \nagain for their efforts in developing this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1701\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

There is a need to identify \n     more workable and effective actions to reduce the negative \n     impacts of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia on coastal \n     waters.\n       ``(3) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n     through its ongoing research, monitoring, observing, \n     education, grant, and coastal resource management programs \n     and in collaboration with the other Federal agencies on the \n     Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia, \n     along with States, Indian tribes, and local governments, \n     possesses the capabilities necessary to support a near and \n     long-term comprehensive effort to prevent, reduce, and \n     control the human and environmental costs of harmful algal \n     blooms and hypoxia.\n       ``(4) Increases in nutrient loading from point and nonpoint \n     sources can trigger and exacerbate harmful algal blooms and \n     hypoxia. Since much of the increases originate in upland \n     areas and are delivered to marine and freshwater bodies via \n     river discharge, integrated and landscape-level research and \n     control strategies are required.\n       ``(5) Harmful algal blooms and hypoxia affect many sectors \n     of the coastal economy, including tourism, public health, and \n     recreational and commercial fisheries.

A bill to amend the Department of Energy Organization Act to \nrequire a Quadrennial Energy Review, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators Bingaman, \nMurkowski, Begich, Coons, Tester and Burr to introduce the Quadrennial \nEnergy Review Act of 2011.\n  One of the big gaps in federal energy policy is the lack of an \noverarching vision and coordination among federal agencies to define \nhow the United States produces and uses energy. Every president since \nRichard Nixon has called for America's independence from oil. We also \nneed to make sure that our nation has a 21st century electric grid that \nmatches supply with demand. If we want to create a more secure energy \nfuture for America then we need to develop a national energy plan that \ncoordinates and integrates the energy policies of the various federal \nagencies. The development of such a policy would enhance our energy \nsecurity, create jobs and mitigate environmental harm.\n  In the fall of 2009, Secretary of Energy Steven Chu asked the \nPresident's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, PCAST, to \nreview the energy technology innovation system to identify and \nrecommend ways to accelerate the large scale transformation of energy \nproduction, delivery, and use to a low carbon energy system. In \nresponse, PCAST formed a working group and in 2010 issued its ``Report \nto the President on Accelerating the Pace of Change in Energy \nTechnologies through an Integrated Federal Energy Policy''. PCAST's \nmost important recommendation is that the Administration establish a \nnew process that can forge a more coordinated and robust Federal energy \npolicy, a major piece of which is advancing energy innovation. The \nreport recommends--\n\n       The President should establish a Quadrennial Energy Review, \n     QER, process that will provide a multiyear roadmap that lays \n     out an integrated view of short-, intermediate-, and long-\n     term energy objectives; outlines\n\n[[Page S6511]]\n\n     legislative proposals to Congress; puts forward anticipated \n     Executive actions coordinated across multiple agencies; and \n     identifies resource requirements for the development and \n     implementation of energy technologies.\n\n  Last month, the American Energy Innovation Council (AEIC) released a \nreport, Catalyzing American Ingenuity (http://\nwww.americanenergyinnovation\n.org/2011-report/), which noted:\n\n       The nation needs a robust National Energy Plan to serve as \n     a strategic technology and policy roadmap . . . [to] \n     ``provide a clear, integrated road map with short-, \n     intermediate-, and long-term objectives for federal energy \n     policies and technology programs, along with a structured, \n     time-bound plan to get there. We support DOE's Quadrennial \n     Technology Review, QTR, which we see as an important and \n     meaningful first step toward developing a national energy \n     strategy. The federal government should build on the QTR and \n     move quickly toward a government-wide QER.\n\n  AEIC is a group of prominent business leaders who came together last \nyear to call for a more vigorous public and private sector commitment \nto energy technology innovation. AEIC members include: Norm Augustine, \nformer chairman and chief executive officer of Lockheed Martin; Ursula \nBurns, chairman and chief executive officer of Xerox; John Doerr, \npartner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers; Bill Gates, chairman and \nformer chief executive officer of Microsoft; Charles O. Holliday, \nchairman of Bank of America and former chairman and chief executive \nofficer of DuPont; Jeff Immelt, chairman and chief executive officer of \nGE; and Tim Solso, chairman and chief executive officer of Cummins Inc.\n  A Quadrennial Energy Review could establish government-wide energy \ngoals, coordinate actions across agencies, and lead to the development \nof a national energy policy.\n  As the lead agency in support of energy science and technology \ninnovation, the Department of Energy has taken the first step to \ndeveloping a national energy plan by conducting a Quadrennial \nTechnology Review of the energy technology policies and programs of the \nDepartment. The QTR serves as the basis for DOE's coordination with \nother agencies and on other programs for which the Department has a key \nrole.\n  The next step is to build upon DOE's report and perform a Quadrennial \nEnergy Review that would establish government-wide energy objectives, \ncoordinate actions across Federal agencies, and provide a strong \nanalytical base for Federal energy policy decisions.\n  Our bill, the Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 2011, would authorize \nthe President to establish an Interagency Working Group to submit a \nQuadrennial Energy Review to Congress by February 1, 2014, and every 4 \nyears thereafter. The Group would be co-chaired by the Secretary of \nEnergy and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, \nOSTP, and consist of level I or II Executive Schedule members \nrepresenting the Departments of Commerce, Defense, State, Interior, \nAgriculture, Treasury, and Transportation, Office of Management and \nBudget, National Science Foundation, Environmental Protection Agency, \nand other Federal organizations, departments and agencies that the \nPresident considers to be appropriate.\n  The bill lists what information, at a minimum, shall be reported in \nthe Quadrennial Energy Review and requires the Secretary of Energy to \nprovide the Executive Secretariat and for agency heads to cooperate \nwith the Secretary.\n  We live in a global world with global demands on energy. The country \nthat best manages its energy resources will lead the 21st century and \nprovide its people a secure energy future. The U.S. needs to win the \nenergy race and this bill will help the United States remain that \ncountry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Ms. AYOTTE (for herself and Mr. Reed);\n  S. 1704. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to modify \ncertain authorities relating to the strategic airlift aircraft force \nstructure of the Air Force; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Ms. AYOTTE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, along \nwith my colleague Senator REED, the Strategic Airlift Force Structure \nReform Act of 2011.\n  Current Federal law U.S. Code Title 10, 8062(g)(1) sets the Air \nForce's minimum number of strategic airlift aircraft at 316. However, \nbased on the Mobility Capabilities and Requirements Study-2016, \nDepartment of Defense and Air Force officials have testified \napproximately 300 aircraft can meet our nation's strategic airlift \ncapacity requirements.\n  During a July 13, 2011, Senate Armed Services Subcommittee hearing, \nChristine Fox, Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, \nCAPE, in the Office of Secretary of Defense; General Duncan McNabb, \nCommander of U.S. Transportation Command, TRANSCOM; and General Raymond \nJohns, Commander of Air Mobility Command, AMC, testified that reducing \nthe number to around 300 aircraft would allow the Air Force to meet \nairlift requirements while saving over $1.2 billion and not increasing \noperational risk. In fact, General Johns testified that strategic \nairlift aircraft in excess of 301 were ``over capacity'' that forces \n``extra workload on our airmen to keep that capability when we don't \nneed to utilize it.''\n  Based on this testimony, the Strategic Airlift Force Structure Act of \n2011 would reduce the strategic airlift aircraft floor from 316 to 301.\n  In this time of fiscal austerity, Congress needs to stop forcing the \nPentagon to spend defense dollars maintaining aircraft that our \nwarfighters say they don't need. Every defense dollar wasted deprives \nour warfighters of the resources they have actually requested. Reducing \nthe aircraft floor is a commonsense step that would save taxpayers \nmillions of dollars while ensuring that our military continues to meet \nstrategic airlift requirements.\n  I encourage my colleagues to carefully review our legislation and I \nwelcome their comments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1704\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Strategic Airlift Force \n     Structure Reform Act of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STRATEGIC AIRLIFT AIRCRAFT FORCE STRUCTURE OF THE AIR \n                   FORCE.\n\n       Section 8062(g)(1) of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Effective October 1, 2009, the \n     Secretary'' and inserting ``The Secretary''; and\n       (2) by striking ``316 aircraft'' and inserting ``301 \n     aircraft''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1705. A bill to designate the Department of Veterans Affairs \nMedical Center in Spokane, Washington, as the ``Mann-Grandstaff \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Medical Center''; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce legislation \nto name the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Spokane, \nWA, after two Medal of Honor recipients, Private First Class Joe E. \nMann and Platoon Sergeant Bruce A. Grandstaff. My colleague Senator \nCantwell is joining me to introduce this bill in the Senate. This \nproposal has received widespread support from the Washington state \nchapters of several key national veterans service organizations, \nincluding the Veterans of Foreign Wars, American Legion, AMVETS, \nDisabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Vietnam \nVeterans of America.\n  I would like to share something about these two heroes. Private Mann \nwas born in Reardan, Washington, and served in the 101st Airborne \nDivision during World War II. While attempting to seize the bridge \nacross the Wilhelmina Canal, his platoon was isolated, surrounded, and \noutnumbered by enemy forces. Despite heavy enemy fire, he bravely \nadvanced to within rocket-launching range of the enemy as the lead \nscout. Private Mann was wounded four separate times while destroying an \nenemy artillery position near Best, Holland. Despite his wounds, he \nvolunteered to stay on sentry duty that night with both his arms \nbandaged to his body. The following day when the final assault came, an \nenemy grenade was thrown in his vicinity. Unable to throw it to safety \ndue to his\n\n[[Page S6512]]\n\nwounds and bandages, Private Mann threw himself on the grenade, \nsacrificing his life to save the lives of his fellow soldiers.\n  Sergeant Grandstaff was born in Spokane, Washington, and served in \nthe 4th Infantry Division. While leading a reconnaissance mission near \nthe Cambodian border, Sergeant Grandstaff's platoon was ambushed by \nheavy automatic weapons and small arms fire from three directions. He \nran through enemy fire to rescue his wounded men, but was only able to \nsave one. Twice he crawled outside the safety of his unit's position to \nmark their location with smoke grenades for aerial fire support, and \ntwice he was wounded. His second marker successfully notified the \nhelicopter gunships of his location, but drew even more enemy fire. \nSeeing the enemy assault about to overrun his position, Sergeant \nGrandstaff inspired his remaining men to continue the fight against \nenemy forces. He called in an artillery barrage on himself to thwart \nthe enemy forces, and continued to fight until he was finally and \nmortally wounded by an enemy rocket. Although every man in his unit was \na casualty, survivors testified that his spirit and courage inspired \nthe unit to inflict heavy casualties on the assaulting enemy even \nthough the odds were stacked against them.\n  I am especially proud to introduce this bill. Its purpose is to honor \nnot just one American hero, but two native sons of Washington who gave \ntheir lives fighting on behalf of our nation. Also, both of these men \nnow rest in peace approximately 10 minutes away from the Spokane VA \nMedical Center, which serves veterans of all generations, from World \nWar II to Vietnam to our newest generation of American heroes.\n  Above all else, this bill is intended to honor both Private Mann and \nSergeant Grandstaff for their ``conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity \nat the risk of life above and beyond the call of duty.'' By renaming \nthe Spokane VA Medical Center as the Mann-Grandstaff VA Medical Center, \nwe will honor the service and ultimate sacrifice provided by these two \nlocal heroes. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and \nthank them for their continued support of our dedicated men and women \nin uniform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1705\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF MANN-GRANDSTAFF DEPARTMENT OF \n                   VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Medical Center in Spokane, Washington, shall after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act be known and designated as the \n     ``Mann-Grandstaff Department of Veterans Affairs Medical \n     Center''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference to in any law, regulation, \n     map, document, record, or other paper of the United States to \n     the medical center referred to in subsection (a) shall be \n     considered to be a reference to the Mann-Grandstaff \n     Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, \n        and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 1708. A bill to establish the John H. Chafee Blackstone River \nValley National Historical Park, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation for the \ncreation of the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National \nHistorical Park, along with my colleagues from Rhode Island and \nMassachusetts, Senators Whitehouse, Kerry, and Scott Brown. Our \nlegislation seeks to preserve the industrial heritage and natural and \ncultural resources of the Blackstone Valley, help provide economic \ndevelopment opportunities for the local economies, and build upon the \nsolid foundation of the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National \nHeritage Corridor.\n  Samuel Slater built his mill in 1793 and started the American \nIndustrial Revolution in Rhode Island along the Blackstone River. \nToday, the John H. Chafee Blackstone River Valley National Heritage \nCorridor contains an exceptional concentration of surviving mills and \nvillages that illustrate this chapter of American history.\n  The Blackstone Valley is a national treasure, which also includes \nthousands of acres of beautiful, undeveloped land and waterways that \nare home to diverse wildlife.\n  The extensive work of the National Park Service and the tireless \nefforts of Federal, State--both Rhode Island and Massachusetts--and \nlocal officials, developers, and volunteers have resulted in the \nrecovery of dozens of historic villages, riverways, and rural \nlandscapes throughout the Corridor. These types of economic \nredevelopment and environmental restoration efforts reflect the ongoing \nstory of the Blackstone River and the valley.\n  The Ashton Mill in Cumberland is one such example of local \nredevelopment. With the designation of the National Heritage Corridor, \nthe cleanup of the Blackstone River, the creation of the Blackstone \nRiver State Park in Lincoln, Rhode Island, and the construction of the \nBlackstone River Bikeway, the property was restored for adaptive reuse \nas rental apartments. Once again the mill and its village are a vital \npart of the greater Blackstone Valley community.\n  Great progress has also been made in restoring the environmental \nresources of the river valley. As a result, people are once again \nenjoying the river, whether in kayaks or canoes, or through other \nmeans. I have been pleased over the years to help support the \npreservation and renewed development of the Blackstone River Valley.\n  In 2005, I cosponsored legislation introduced by my then-colleague \nSenator Lincoln Chafee to conduct a Special Resource Study of the \nCorridor to determine which areas within the Corridor were nationally \nsignificant and whether they were suitable to become part of the \nNational Park Service. When it was released this July, the study \nrecommended the creation of a new national historic park whose \nboundaries would encompass both Rhode Island and Massachusetts, \nincluding the Blackstone River and its tributaries; the Blackstone \nCanal; the historic districts of Old Slater Mill in Pawtucket; the \nvillages of Slatersville and Ashton in Rhode Island; and the villages \nof Whitinsville and Hopedale in Massachusetts.\n  The partnership park described in the Special Resource Study clearly \nstated the importance of the rural and urban areas, the landscape, and \nthe river in telling the story of the Blackstone River Valley.\n  It will build upon the solid foundation of the John H. Chafee \nBlackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor and the workers and \nvolunteers in all the surrounding communities, in restoring the \nCorridor.\n  Designating these areas as a national historical park has important \neconomic, environmental, historical, and educational benefits for the \nregion. This is a two state initiative, and truly a national \ninitiative, that will embrace both Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and \nensure the preservation of the industrial and natural heritage of the \nBlackstone River Valley for future generations to enjoy.\n  Establishing a national park will provide opportunities for work, \nopportunities for recreation, and opportunities to boost economic \ndevelopment, while memorializing the history of this place and its role \nin the American Industrial Revolution.\n  The partnerships between the federal, state, local, and private \norganizations have a proven track record of success with the Corridor, \nand I expect that the communities in Rhode Island and Massachusetts \nthat have been engaged on this endeavor for many years will continue to \npartner with the National Park Service going forward.\n  Creating a national historic park sets a clear path to preserve our \ncultural heritage, improve the use and enjoyment of these resources, \nincluding offering outdoor education for young people, and increase the \nlevel of protection for our most important and nationally significant \ncultural and natural resources.\n  I have been proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation in honor \nof my late-colleague John H. Chafee, who years ago had a great vision, \nshared with many others in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, to preserve \nand protect the Blackstone Valley.\n  I look forward to working with all of my colleagues to create the \nJohn H.\n\n[[Page S6513]]\n\nChafee Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1708\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the United States courthouse located at \n222 West 7th Avenue, Anchorage, Alaska, as the James M. Fitzgerald \nUnited States Courthouse; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce a \npiece of legislation honoring a great Alaskan. James Martin Fitzgerald \nwas a giant of my State's judicial community for 5 decades--almost as \nlong as Alaska has been a State. This legislation, naming the Anchorage \nfederal courthouse facility in Judge Fitzgerald's honor, is a fitting \ntribute to his legacy.\n  James Fitzgerald first came to Alaska in the 1950s. He was a \ndecorated World War II Marine veteran, an accomplished lawyer, an \nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and became Alaska's first Commissioner of \nPublic Safety. From November 1959 until his retirement until 2006, he \nserved with distinction as a State and Federal judge unanimously \npraised for his fairness, brilliance and humility.\n  Judge Fitzgerald served as a judge on the Alaska Superior Court, \nThird District, from 1959 through 1972. He was the presiding judge on \nthat court from 1969 through 1972. At that time, he became an Alaska \nSupreme Court Justice, where he would serve until 1975.\n  President Gerald Ford nominated Judge Fitzgerald to be a Judge of the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Alaska in December of \n1974. He was quickly confirmed by the U.S. Senate and received his \ncommission to the Federal bench. Judge Fitzgerald served on this \nFederal court until his retirement in 2006 and also spent 5 years as \nthe chief judge of the court.\n  In addition to his impressive record of accomplishments and his years \nof public service, Judge Fitzgerald was also known for his integrity \nand character. His colleagues on the bench, the lawyers who testified \nin his courtroom and his friends and neighbors all knew him to be a \nhumble, kind, thoughtful and generous man. For decades he was praised \nfor his legal brilliance and his respect for all those who sought \njustice in his court. His contributions to the State of Alaska will not \nbe forgotten.\n  Naming the Anchorage federal courthouse in Judge Fitzgerald's honor \nis broadly supported by Alaskans. In fact, I assembled a small \ncommittee of outstanding Alaska leaders to review this proposal and \nthey strongly endorsed extending this honor to Judge Fitzgerald. I \nwould like to thank the committee members for their public service: \nAnchorage attorney Lloyd Miller, Judge John D. Roberts, Juneau Mayor \nBruce Botelho, and Liz Medicine Crow of the First Alaskans Institute.\n  For all these reasons, today I am proud to introduce this legislation \nto designate the United States Courthouse in Anchorage as the James M. \nFitzgerald United States Courthouse. He was a great man and this is a \nfine way to remember all he did for my State.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1710\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. JAMES M. FITZGERALD UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The United States courthouse located at \n     222 West 7th Avenue, Anchorage, Alaska, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``James M. Fitzgerald United States \n     Courthouse''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other\n\n[[Page S6514]]\n\n     record of the United States to the United States courthouse \n     referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be a \n     reference to the ``James M. Fitzgerald United States \n     Courthouse''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN of Ohio:\n  S. 1711. A bill to enhance reciprocal market access for United States \ndomestic producers in the negotiating process of bilateral, regional, \nand multilateral trade agreements; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President I rise to talk about our Nation's \nflawed approach to trade and its damaging effects on economic growth \nand job creation. Yesterday, this body approved three trade agreements \nthat will do far too little to create manufacturing jobs here in the \nUnited States. In fact, it is clear these more-of-the-same agreements \nwill cost manufacturing jobs in Ohio and across the nation.\n  In towns and cities across Ohio, workers have the proud tradition of \nmanufacturing products that matter to America.\n  From steel tubes made in Lorain that equip our energy markets, to car \nparts made in Moraine that move our auto industry forward, Ohio \nmanufacturers represent the heart of our nation's economy.\n  Ohio manufacturers and workers are some of the most industrious and \ninnovative in the United States.\n  Our companies and the people who fill our factories can compete \nacross the world--but only if your government implements trade policies \nthat create a level playing field.\n  However, Republican and Democratic administrations alike, along with \nCongress, have signed and passed trade agreements premised on hollow \npromises.\n  Supporters of free market policies promised that past trade pacts \nlike NAFTA would stimulate growth and create jobs.\n  Some companies and constituents in Ohio would argue these \nassertions--and the assurances that accompany current trade \nagreements--could not be further from the truth.\n  Once successful companies in my state are now collapsing under the \nweight of misguided trade policies.\n  Working families in West Chester, Pickerington, Lima, and Akron are \nholding on for dear life in the face of our government failing to \nnegotiate and enforce trade deals.\n  A rational trade agreement should open new markets, include standards \non labor and safety that are at least as strong as the commercial \nprovisions, and help U.S. companies expand their consumer base around \nthe world.\n  However, recent trade pacts have slashed tariffs for foreign \ncompetitors while doing little to address the tariff and nontariff \nbarriers that U.S. businesses face with our trading partners. Nothing \nin these newly approved agreements will change this pattern.\n  All too often, U.S. trade negotiators have been willing to open our \nmarkets to a flood of imports while failing to win the concessions \nrequired to make trade work for America.\n  A quick glance at our Nation's trade statistics makes it clear that \nwe need a new gameplan when it comes to trade.\n  The U.S. merchandise trade deficit has surged 46 percent over the \nlast decade, reaching an astronomical $634 billion in 2010.\n  Since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994, the U.S. has lost more \nthan three million manufacturing jobs.\n  Behind these numbers are the faces of middle-class Americans who have \nlost their job because of ill-advised trade agreements.\n  Whether it is the worker getting laid off at a manufacturer providing \nenergy appliances, or the person losing their job at a steel plant, the \nloss of a job due to trade can be a devastating experience for families \nacross America.\n  Two examples of our nation giving too much, for too little in return \ncan be seen with the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement.\n  South Korea has the lowest level of import penetration for auto \nsales--at just 4.4 percent--of any developed country.\n  In 2009, the U.S. exported fewer than 6,000 cars to Korea. In the \nsame year, Korea exported 476,000 cars to the U.S.\n  While a marginal improvement, the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement \nwould allow each American-based automaker to export 25,000 cars to \nSouth Korea free of burdensome regulations.\n  However, it is clear that this ``concession'' does not do enough to \nshift the imbalanced trade in the auto sector in our direction.\n  In addition--much like China--South Korea would still be able to \nmanipulate its currency--thwarting the ability of American companies to \ncompete and hire workers.\n  Instead, South Korea will be able to exploit this trade agreement and \nmake the limited market access we would have meaningless.\n  It is time that our free trade agreements increase market access to \nU.S. goods so that we're exporting goods--not jobs.\n  The American people are demanding a plan to make trade work.\n  It is time for Congress to meet the demands of the American people \nand take action to ensure a level playing field for our businesses and \nworkers.\n  That is why I'm introducing the Reciprocal Market Access Act.\n  The Reciprocal Market Access Act would require the reduction or \nelimination of U.S. duties to be reciprocated by the nation with which \nwe are entering into a trade pact.\n  In the event that a trading partner does not adhere to this \nrequirement, the U.S. Trade Representative would be authorized to \nwithdraw tariff concessions if a trading partner has failed to \neliminate relevant tariff and non-tariff barriers.\n  This requirement will make sure that any type of barrier doesn't put \nAmerican products at a disadvantage before we open our doors to \nAmerican goods.\n  The U.S. should no longer acquiesce to demands to further open our \nmarket--already the most open market in the global economy--without \ngaining meaningful market access for American manufacturers in \nexchange.\n  In addition, this bill would instruct the International Trade \nCommission to assess the impact of a potential trade agreement on \nopportunities and barriers for U.S. products that will be affected by \nthe trade agreement.\n  If Congress is committed to creating jobs and reducing the trade \ndeficit, we've got to make sure we have the policies that put us on a \nlevel playing field with our trading partners.\n  If we are serious about standing up for workers, small business and \nmanufacturers who continue to play be the rules, we need to pass this \nlegislation.\n  It is time to take action to help rebuild the economic foundation of \nthe middle class.\n  It is time we negotiate trade agreements that put American workers \nand American businesses first.\n  It is time to pass this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1711\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Reciprocal Market Access Act \n     of 2011''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to require that United States \n     trade negotiations achieve measurable results for United \n     States businesses by ensuring that trade agreements result in \n     expanded market access for United States exports and not \n     solely the elimination of tariffs on goods imported into the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RATES \n                   OF DUTY PURSUANT TO CERTAIN TRADE AGREEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, on or after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     President may not agree to a modification of an existing duty \n     that would reduce or eliminate the bound or applied rate of \n     such duty on any product in order to carry out a trade \n     agreement entered into between the United States and a \n     foreign country until the President transmits to Congress a \n     certification described in subsection (b).\n       (b) Certification.--A certification referred to in \n     subsection (a) is a certification by the President that--\n       (1) the United States has obtained the reduction or \n     elimination of tariff and nontariff barriers and policies and \n     practices of the government of a foreign country described in \n     subsection (a) with respect to United States exports of any \n     product identified by United States domestic producers as \n     having the same physical characteristics and uses as the \n     product for which a modification of an existing duty is \n     sought by the President as described in subsection (a); and\n       (2) a violation of any provision of the trade agreement \n     described in subsection (a) relating to the matters described \n     in paragraph (1)\n\n[[Page S6515]]\n\n     is immediately enforceable in accordance with the provisions \n     of section 4.\n\n     SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS.\n\n       (a) Withdrawal of Tariff Concessions.--If the President \n     does agree to a modification described in section 3(a), and \n     the United States Trade Representative determines pursuant to \n     subsection (c) that--\n       (1) a tariff or nontariff barrier or policy or practice of \n     the government of a foreign country described in section 3(a) \n     has not been reduced or eliminated, or\n       (2) a tariff or nontariff barrier or policy or practice of \n     such government has been imposed or discovered,\n\n     the modification shall be withdrawn until such time as the \n     United States Trade Representative submits to Congress a \n     certification described in section 3(b)(1).\n       (b) Investigation.--\n       (1) In general.--The United States Trade Representative \n     shall initiate an investigation if an interested party files \n     a petition with the United States Trade Representative which \n     alleges the elements necessary for the withdrawal of the \n     modification of an existing duty under subsection (a), and \n     which is accompanied by information reasonably available to \n     the petitioner supporting such allegations.\n       (2) Interested party defined.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1), the term ``interested party'' means--\n       (A) a manufacturer, producer, or wholesaler in the United \n     States of a domestic product that has the same physical \n     characteristics and uses as the product for which a \n     modification of an existing duty is sought;\n       (B) a certified union or recognized union or group of \n     workers engaged in the manufacture, production, or wholesale \n     in the United States of a domestic product that has the same \n     physical characteristics and uses as the product for which a \n     modification of an existing duty is sought;\n       (C) a trade or business association a majority of whose \n     members manufacture, produce, or wholesale in the United \n     States a domestic product that has the same physical \n     characteristics and uses as the product for which a \n     modification of an existing duty is sought; and\n       (D) a member of the Committee on Ways and Means of the \n     House of Representatives or a member of the Committee on \n     Finance of the Senate.\n       (c) Determination by USTR.--Not later than 45 days after \n     the date on which a petition is filed under subsection (b), \n     the United States Trade Representative shall--\n       (1) determine whether the petition alleges the elements \n     necessary for the withdrawal of the modification of an \n     existing duty under subsection (a); and\n       (2) notify the petitioner of the determination under \n     paragraph (1) and the reasons for the determination.\n\n     SEC. 5. MARKET ACCESS ASSESSMENT BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE \n                   COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The International Trade Commission shall \n     conduct an assessment of the impact of each proposed trade \n     agreement between the United States and a foreign country on \n     tariff and nontariff barriers and policies and practices of \n     the government of the foreign country with respect to United \n     States exports of any product identified by United States \n     domestic producers as having the same physical \n     characteristics and uses as the product for which a \n     modification of an existing duty is sought by the President \n     as described in section 4(a).\n       (b) Identification.--In conducting the assessment under \n     subsection (a), the International Trade Commission shall \n     identify the tariff and nontariff barriers and policies and \n     practices for such products that exist in the foreign country \n     and the expected opportunities for exports from the United \n     States to the foreign country if existing tariff and \n     nontariff barriers and policies and practices are eliminated.\n       (c) Consultation.--In conducting the assessment under \n     subsection (a), the International Trade Commission shall, as \n     appropriate, consult with and seek to obtain relevant \n     documentation from United States domestic producers of \n     products having the same physical characteristics and uses as \n     the product for which a modification of an existing duty is \n     sought by the President as described in section 4(a).\n       (d) Report.--Not later than 45 days before the date on \n     which negotiations for a proposed trade agreement described \n     in subsection (a) are initiated, the International Trade \n     Commission shall submit to the United States Trade \n     Representative, the Secretary of Commerce, and Congress a \n     report on the proposed trade agreement that contains the \n     assessment under subsection (a) conducted with respect to \n     such proposed trade agreement.

Res. 30\n\n       Whereas according the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, there are approximately 166,000 individuals \n     living in the United States with a form of spina bifida, the \n     United States most common permanent birth defect;\n       Whereas the risk of spina bifida can be reduced by up to 70 \n     percent if women consume 400 micrograms of folic acid daily, \n     before and during pregnancy;\n       Whereas there are 65,000,000 women of childbearing age in \n     the United States, all of whom are potentially at risk of \n     having a child with spina bifida;\n       Whereas 1,500 children are born each year with spina \n     bifida;\n       Whereas, according to the Spina Bifida Association, spina \n     bifida is a complicated condition, adversely impacting \n     virtually every organ system and requiring multiple clinical \n     specialists to provide lifelong comprehensive, quality \n     medical and psychosocial care;\n       Whereas the National Spina Bifida Program, administered by \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, exists to \n     improve the health, well-being, and quality of life for the \n     individuals and families affected by spina bifida through \n     numerous programmatic components, including the National \n     Spina Bifida Patient Registry and critical quality of life \n     research in spina bifida.\n       Whereas the National Spina Bifida Patient Registry helps to \n     improve the quality of care, reduce morbidity and mortality \n     from spina bifida, and increase the efficiency and decrease \n     the cost of care by supporting the\n\n[[Page S6516]]\n\n     collection of longitudinal-treatment data, developing quality \n     measures and treatment standards of care and best practices, \n     identifying ``centers of excellence'' in spina bifida, \n     evaluating both the clinical and cost-effectiveness of \n     treatment of spina bifida, and exchanging evidence-based \n     information among health-care providers across the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the Spina Bifida Association is the only national \n     voluntary health agency working for people with spina bifida \n     and their families through education, advocacy, research, and \n     service; and\n       Whereas October is designated as National Spina Bifida \n     Awareness Month to help increase awareness and the prevention \n     of spina bifida, as well as enhancing the quality of life of \n     persons living with spina bifida: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Spina Bifida \n     Awareness Month;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of highlighting the \n     occurrence of spina bifida, bringing to light the struggles \n     and successes of those who live with spina bifida, and \n     advancing efforts to decrease the incidence of spina bifida;\n       (3) supports the ongoing development of the National Spina \n     Bifida Patient Registry to improve lives through research and \n     to improve treatments for both children and adults;\n       (4) recognizes that there is a continued need for a \n     commitment of resources for efforts to reduce and prevent \n     disabling birth defects like spina bifida; and\n       (5) commends the excellent work of the Spina Bifida \n     Association to educate, support, and provide hope for people \n     with spina bifida and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/10/13/senate-section/article/S6516-1", "month": "10", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 31--DIRECTING THE SECRETARY OF THE SENATE \n           TO MAKE A CORRECTION IN THE ENROLLMENT OF S. 1280\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

Law enforcement agencies \n     may request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons \n     are not necessarily reported to the Federal Government. Not \n     all firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms \n     traced are used in crime.\n       (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen for \n     purposes of determining which types, makes, or models of \n     firearms are used for illicit purposes. The firearms selected \n     do not constitute a random sample and should not be \n     considered representative of the larger universe of all \n     firearms used by criminals, or any subset of that universe. \n     Firearms are normally traced to the first retail seller, and \n     sources reported for firearms traced do not necessarily \n     represent the sources or methods by which firearms in general \n     are acquired for use in crime.\n       Sec. 517.

The results shall \n     be made available in redacted form to exclude--\n       (1) any matter described in section 552(b) of title 5, \n     United States Code; and\n       (2) sensitive personal information for any individual, the \n     public access to which could be used to commit identity theft \n     or for other inappropriate or unlawful purposes.\n       (c) A grant or contract funded by amounts appropriated by \n     this Act may not be used for the purpose of defraying the \n     costs of a banquet or conference that is not directly and \n     programmatically related to the purpose for which the grant \n     or contract was awarded, such as a banquet or conference held \n     in connection with planning, training, assessment, review, or \n     other routine purposes related to a project funded by the \n     grant or contract.\n       (d) Any person awarded a grant or contract funded by \n     amounts appropriated by this Act shall submit a statement to \n     the Secretary of Commerce, the Attorney General, the \n     Administrator, Director, or President, as appropriate, \n     certifying that no funds derived from\n\n[[Page S6538]]\n\n     the grant or contract will be made available through a \n     subcontract or in any other manner to another person who has \n     a financial interest in the person awarded the grant or \n     contract.\n       (e) The provisions of the preceding subsections of this \n     section shall take effect 30 days after the date on which the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Office of Government \n     Ethics, determines that a uniform set of rules and \n     requirements, substantially similar to the requirements in \n     such subsections, consistently apply under the executive \n     branch ethics program to all Federal departments, agencies, \n     and entities.\n       Sec. 518.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available under this Act may be used to issue patents on \n     claims directed to or encompassing a human organism.\n       Sec. 519.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or \n     treaty, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available under this Act or any other Act may be expended or \n     obligated by a department, agency, or instrumentality of the \n     United States to pay administrative expenses or to compensate \n     an officer or employee of the United States in connection \n     with requiring an export license for the export to Canada of \n     components, parts, accessories or attachments for firearms \n     listed in Category I, section 121.1 of title 22, Code of \n     Federal Regulations (International Trafficking in Arms \n     Regulations (ITAR), part 121, as it existed on April 1, 2005) \n     with a total value not exceeding $500 wholesale in any \n     transaction, provided that the conditions of subsection (b) \n     of this section are met by the exporting party for such \n     articles.\n       (b) The foregoing exemption from obtaining an export \n     license--\n       (1) does not exempt an exporter from filing any Shipper's \n     Export Declaration or notification letter required by law, or \n     from being otherwise eligible under the laws of the United \n     States to possess, ship, transport, or export the articles \n     enumerated in subsection (a); and\n       (2) does not permit the export without a license of--\n       (A) fully automatic firearms and components and parts for \n     such firearms, other than for end use by the Federal \n     Government, or a Provincial or Municipal Government of \n     Canada;\n       (B) barrels, cylinders, receivers (frames) or complete \n     breech mechanisms for any firearm listed in Category I, other \n     than for end use by the Federal Government, or a Provincial \n     or Municipal Government of Canada; or\n       (C) articles for export from Canada to another foreign \n     destination.\n       (c) In accordance with this section, the District Directors \n     of Customs and postmasters shall permit the permanent or \n     temporary export without a license of any unclassified \n     articles specified in subsection (a) to Canada for end use in \n     Canada or return to the United States, or temporary import of \n     Canadian-origin items from Canada for end use in the United \n     States or return to Canada for a Canadian citizen.\n       (d) The President may require export licenses under this \n     section on a temporary basis if the President determines, \n     upon publication first in the Federal Register, that the \n     Government of Canada has implemented or maintained inadequate \n     import controls for the articles specified in subsection (a), \n     such that a significant diversion of such articles has and \n     continues to take place for use in international terrorism or \n     in the escalation of a conflict in another nation. The \n     President shall terminate the requirements of a license when \n     reasons for the temporary requirements have ceased.\n       Sec. 521.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States \n     receiving appropriated funds under this Act or any other Act \n     shall obligate or expend in any way such funds to pay \n     administrative expenses or the compensation of any officer or \n     employee of the United States to deny any application \n     submitted pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 2778(b)(1)(B) and qualified \n     pursuant to 27 CFR section 478.112 or .113, for a permit to \n     import United States origin ``curios or relics'' firearms, \n     parts, or ammunition.\n       Sec. 522.

If at any time during any quarter, the program \n     manager of a project within the jurisdiction of the \n     Departments of Commerce or Justice, the National Aeronautics \n     and Space Administration, or the National Science Foundation \n     totaling more than $75,000,000 has reasonable cause to \n     believe that the total program cost has increased by 10 \n     percent, the program manager shall immediately inform the \n     Secretary, Administrator, or Director. The Secretary, \n     Administrator, or Director shall notify the House and Senate \n     Committees on Appropriations within 30 days in writing of \n     such increase, and shall include in such notice: the date on \n     which such determination was made; a statement of the reasons \n     for such increases; the action taken and proposed to be taken \n     to control future cost growth of the project; changes made in \n     the performance or schedule milestones and the degree to \n     which such changes have contributed to the increase in total \n     program costs or procurement costs; new estimates of the \n     total project or procurement costs; and a statement \n     validating that the project's management structure is \n     adequate to control total project or procurement costs.\n       Sec. 525.  Funds appropriated by this Act, or made \n     available by the transfer of funds in this Act, for \n     intelligence or intelligence related activities are deemed to \n     be specifically authorized by the Congress for purposes of \n     section 504 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. \n     414) during fiscal year 2012 until the enactment of the \n     Intelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012.\n       Sec. 526.

(a) Findings.--Based on a preliminary study \n     published in December 1982 by the Commission on Wartime \n     Relocation and Internment of Civilians, Congress finds the \n     following:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States--\n       (A) expanded its internment program and national security \n     investigations to conduct the program and investigations in \n     Latin America; and\n       (B) financed relocation to the United States, and \n     internment, of approximately 2,300 Latin Americans of \n     Japanese descent, for the purpose of exchanging the Latin \n     Americans of Japanese descent for United States citizens held \n     by Axis countries.\n       (2) Approximately 2,300 men, women, and children of \n     Japanese descent from 13 Latin American countries were held \n     in the custody of the Department of State in internment camps \n     operated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service from \n     1941 through 1948.\n       (3) Those men, women, and children either--\n       (A) were arrested without a warrant, hearing, or indictment \n     by local police, and sent to the United States for \n     internment; or\n       (B) in some cases involving women and children, voluntarily \n     entered internment camps to remain with their arrested \n     husbands, fathers, and other male relatives.\n       (4) Passports held by individuals who were Latin Americans \n     of Japanese descent were routinely confiscated before the \n     individuals arrived in the United States, and the Department \n     of State ordered United States consuls in Latin American \n     countries to refuse to issue visas to the individuals prior \n     to departure.\n       (5) Despite their involuntary arrival, Latin American \n     internees of Japanese descent were considered to be and \n     treated as illegal entrants by the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service. Thus, the internees became illegal \n     aliens in United States custody who were subject to \n     deportation proceedings for immediate removal from the United \n     States. In some cases, Latin American internees of Japanese \n     descent were deported to Axis countries to enable the United \n     States to conduct prisoner exchanges.\n       (6) Approximately 2,300 men, women, and children of \n     Japanese descent were relocated from their homes in Latin \n     America, detained in internment camps in the United States, \n     and in some cases, deported to Axis countries to enable the \n     United States to conduct prisoner exchanges.\n       (7) The Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians studied Federal actions conducted pursuant to \n     Executive Order 9066 (relating to authorizing the Secretary \n     of War to prescribe military areas). Although the United \n     States program of interning Latin Americans of Japanese \n     descent was not conducted pursuant to Executive Order 9066, \n     an examination of that extraordinary program is necessary to \n     establish a complete account of Federal actions to detain and \n     intern civilians of enemy or foreign nationality, \n     particularly of Japanese descent. Although historical \n     documents relating to the program exist in distant archives, \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians did not research those documents.\n       (8) Latin American internees of Japanese descent were a \n     group not covered by the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (50 \n     U.S.C. App. 1989b et seq.), which formally apologized and \n     provided compensation payments to former Japanese Americans \n     interned pursuant to Executive Order 9066.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to establish a \n     fact-finding Commission to extend the study of the Commission \n     on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians to \n     investigate and determine facts and circumstances surrounding \n     the relocation, internment, and deportation to Axis countries \n     of Latin Americans of Japanese descent from December 1941 \n     through February 1948, and the impact of those actions by the \n     United States, and to recommend appropriate remedies, if any, \n     based on preliminary findings by the original Commission and \n     new discoveries.\n       (c) Establishment of the Commission.--\n       (1) In general.--There is established the Commission on \n     Wartime Relocation and Internment of Latin Americans of \n     Japanese descent (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Commission'').\n       (2) Composition.--The Commission shall be composed of 9 \n     members, who shall be appointed not later than 60 days after \n     the date of enactment of this section, of whom--\n\n[[Page S6540]]\n\n       (A) 3 members shall be appointed by the President;\n       (B) 3 members shall be appointed by the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives, on the joint recommendation of the \n     majority leader of the House of Representatives and the \n     minority leader of the House of Representatives; and\n       (C) 3 members shall be appointed by the President pro \n     tempore of the Senate, on the joint recommendation of the \n     majority leader of the Senate and the minority leader of the \n     Senate.\n       (3) Period of appointment; vacancies.--Members shall be \n     appointed for the life of the Commission.

No funds made available under this \n     paragraph may be provided directly to lenders or homeowners \n     to discharge outstanding mortgage balances or for any other \n     direct debt reduction payments.\n       (3) The use of Mortgage Foreclosure Mitigation Assistance \n     by approved counseling intermediaries and State Housing \n     Finance Agencies shall involve a reasonable analysis of the \n     borrower's financial situation, an evaluation of the current \n     value of the property that is subject to the mortgage, \n     counseling regarding the assumption of the mortgage by \n     another non-Federal party, counseling regarding the possible \n     purchase of the mortgage by a non-Federal third party, \n     counseling and advice of all likely restructuring and \n     refinancing strategies or the approval of a work-out strategy \n     by all interested parties.\n       (4) NRC may provide up to 15 percent of the total funds \n     under this paragraph to its own charter members with \n     expertise in foreclosure prevention counseling, subject to a \n     certification by the NRC that the procedures for selection do \n     not consist of any procedures or activities that could be \n     construed as an unacceptable conflict of interest or have the \n     appearance of impropriety.\n       (5) HUD-approved counseling entities and State Housing \n     Finance Agencies receiving funds under this paragraph shall \n     have demonstrated experience in successfully working with \n     financial institutions as well as borrowers facing default, \n     delinquency and foreclosure as well as documented counseling \n     capacity, outreach capacity, past successful performance and \n     positive outcomes with documented counseling plans (including \n     post mortgage foreclosure mitigation counseling), loan \n     workout agreements and loan modification agreements.
