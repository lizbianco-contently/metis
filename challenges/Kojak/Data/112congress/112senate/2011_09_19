I just received word an hour or two ago that another \nperson has died in the hospital. My heart goes out to those who were \nhurt, and my thoughts are with the families of those who lost their \nlives when the pilot of a World War II airplane crashed into \nspectators.\n  I commend the many first responders who rushed to the scene Friday. \nTheir quick thinking and skillful assistance saved lives. While this \ncrash was devastating--and it was--it is fortunate and I am glad the \npilot took quick action to avoid additional loss of life by avoiding a \ngrandstand packed with thousands of spectators.\n  My four grandchildren and my son attended the show on Thursday. My \noldest grandson Mitchell was at the event with a Scout Troop on Friday, \njust hours before this terrible accident. Although officials are \ninvestigating the crash, initial reports indicate that a piece of the \nplane's tail broke off prior to the accident.\n  I hope this terrible event, the first of its kind in this Nation, \nwill not deter people from attending airshows in the future. Thousands \nof people enjoy these shows every year. The late Senator Ted Stevens \nattended this show many times and told me it was the best of its kind. \nI will continue to monitor the investigation, of course.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/19/senate-section/article/S5707-9", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5707-S5708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR CHARLES PERCY\n\n  Mr. REID.

But I do know he was an \nindependent thinker and a moderate who always put his country before \nparty. The Senate could use more of his brand of pragmatism today.\n  Senator Percy was a proponent of tough environmental regulations and\n\n[[Page S5708]]\n\nconsumer protections and was an outspoken opponent of the Vietnam war \nand a proponent of nuclear nonproliferation. He was also a Navy veteran \nand businessman who was often mentioned as a Presidential contender.\n  This body, the Senate, honors him for his faithful service to his \ncountry as a sailor and as a Member of Congress.

Mr. President, today President Obama laid out a commonsense \nplan to substantially reduce the budget deficit. I congratulate \nPresident Obama for his vision. Last week he presented the country with \na roadmap to reduce our jobs deficit, a proposal to create nearly 2 \nmillion jobs and reduce unemployment by a percentage point. Today he \nhas also offered a pathway to reduce our budget deficit--not only the \njobs deficit but a budget deficit. It is a concrete strategy to cut the \ndeficit by more than $4 trillion over the next decade and to do it \nfairly.\n  The plan calls for shared sacrifice for all Americans, including \nthose who can best afford to help. It calls on those who have benefited \nfrom the tax policies that sunk this country deeper and deeper into \ndebt to help get us out of this debt.\n  Americans know shared sacrifice is the best path to fiscal \nsustainability. All the polls indicate that Republicans believe that, \nDemocrats believe that, and Independents believe that. They believe \nmany of the richest few should pay more, and one of the richest of all \nof them, Warren Buffett, agrees. That is why the President has proposed \nthe so-called Buffett rule, that no American making more than $1 \nmillion a year should pay a lower tax than this Nation's middle class.\n  This would apply to the top three-tenths of 1 percent--that is all, a \nsmall group of Americans--but they are the richest of the rich just \nlike Mr. Buffett. Warren Buffett believes it is unfair that he pays a \nlower income tax than his secretary. This is what he said:\n\n       If you're in the luckiest 1 percent of humanity, you owe it \n     to the rest of humanity to think about the other 99 percent.\n\n  Actually, it is more than 99 percent; it is 99.7 percent. There are \nabout 22,000 people in this country who make more than $1 million a \nyear--this is net income--yet paid less than 15 percent of income in \ntaxes. The top 400 earners in this country, all of whom make more than \n$110 million a year, pay a small percentage of their income in taxes. \nThey pay a smaller share than plumbers and teachers and factory \nworkers. More than anyone else these millionaires and billionaires \nbenefit from these tax cuts that contributed $3 trillion to our \ndeficit. They helped plunge this Nation into a financial hole. Yet \ncongressional Republicans believe the middle class and seniors, not the \nmillionaires and billionaires who enjoyed trillions in tax breaks, \nshould bear the burden of getting us out of that hole.\n  A balanced approach to reducing the deficit means those who benefited \nthe most from policies that created our deficit should also help solve \nthe deficit crisis we have. A balanced approach means everyone pays his \nor her fair share. It means middle-class seniors and those who can \nleast afford it will not bear the heaviest burden. So I commend \nPresident Obama for insisting on basic fairness as we address our \ndeficit problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/19/senate-section/article/S5708-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last week was a productive one in the \nSenate. We reached a bipartisan agreement to pass emergency aid for \ncommunities affected by devastating floods, tornadoes, and wildfires. \nWe also reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration, keeping \n80,000 safety inspectors and construction workers on the job. We passed \na highway bill keeping 1.8 million people at work building bridges and \nhighways.\n  Congress has no duty more pressing than putting people back to work, \nand this highway legislation will do just that. But we can and must do \nmore. That is why this week the Senate will take up the trade \nadjustment assistance legislation. The TAA Program helps U.S. workers \nwho lose their jobs because of international trade to learn new skills \nso they can reenter a changing workforce, and it helps them pay for \nhealth insurance while they are training for new jobs.\n  A global economy means fierce global competition. Unless our \nworkforce is flexible and well-trained, we cannot hope to compete.\n  Between 2001 and 2008, Americans lost 2.4 million jobs because of \ntrade with China. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Program is retraining \nmany of these people, getting them back to work and into the workforce \nand boosting our economy at the same time. It is unfortunate that my \nRepublican colleagues who say they care so much about free trade have \nprevented three such agreements from moving forward because of \nobjections to this trade adjustment assistance legislation.\n  We have known for a long time we were going to move to this trade \nadjustment assistance. It is unthinkable that the Republicans would \nstop us from doing that, and that is just what happened. As we struggle \nto rebound from the worst recession in generations, it is unthinkable \nthat we would abandon hard-working Americans who lost their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own.\n  The trade adjustment assistance legislation provides a lifeline they \nneed to get back on their feet.\n  Mr. President, would the Chair announce the business of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/19/senate-section/article/S5708-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in the decade that has passed since the \ndevastating attacks of 9/11, we have seen enormous changes in our daily \nlives. For many of us, these changes have become routine. We have \nbecome more alert to potential suspicious activities, accustomed to \nadditional screening procedures at airports, and understand the need \nfor additional security precautions in places that could be seen as \npotential targets for terrorists. For many other Americans, though, \ntheir lives were altered in ways that are anything but routine. These \nare the families, friends, and brothers in arms of those who have given \ntheir lives in the global war on terror, including the over 3,000 lives \ntaken in the horrific attacks on our Nation on September 11, 2001.\n  This past Sunday was a somber day to reflect, remember, and honor the \nlives that have been cut short by terror. On Sunday morning, I spoke at \nmy church about the impact 9/11 had on me personally and us \ncollectively as a nation. It is important to take the time in the \nSenate Chamber to remember these brave heroes. We all remember where we \nwere at the time the planes struck the towers and the awful feeling \nwhen we realized this was not an accident. We remember the emotional \noutpouring our Nation shared and how the tragedy brought us all closer \ntogether. What happened after the moments of devastation on September \n11, 2001, unified our Nation and demonstrated the perseverance and the \nwill of the American people.\n  We remember the people who refused to leave an injured coworker and \nthose who led others to safety. We remember the firefighters, the \npolicemen, and all the first responders who saved lives that day, many \nof whom gave their\n\n[[Page S5709]]\n\nlives in doing so. We remember the heroes at the World Trade Center, \nthe Pentagon, and the brave passengers of Flight 93. We also remember \nall the brave service men and women who fought and continue to fight to \nkeep us free. They do so by choice. They do so out of love of country, \nand they do so to protect our Nation, our freedom, and our values.\n  Since the 9/11 attacks, thousands of Arkansans have been deployed to \nfar regions of the globe to fight terrorism. The Arkansas National \nGuard, which has historically been a reserve unit, has taken on a more \nactive-duty role in the war on terror. Units from the Arkansas National \nGuard have played a vital role in the war on terror with deployments to \nAfghanistan and Iraq, and some units having served multiple tours on \nthe battlefront. American's military personnel and veterans of the \nglobal war on terror can be proud of all they have accomplished. Their \ncontinued efforts brought Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind these \nattacks, to justice, along with a number of his top lieutenants and \nnumerous Taliban commanders. They continue to battle bin Laden's \nfanatical followers and protect us from those who remain committed to \ninflicting harm on the United States.\n\n  Many of the veterans from the global war on terror have returned home \nwith permanent, life-altering injuries. We have worked hard in this \nbody and in the House to ensure that they and all the veterans of this \nwar receive all the care and benefits they have earned and deserve upon \ntheir return. We must continue to uphold our promise to our veterans. \nWe must also continue to ensure that our military personnel on the \nbattlefield have everything they need to successfully accomplish the \nmission and to return home safely.\n  According to the U.S. Central Command, more than 6,200 servicemembers \nhave made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedoms in Operations Iraqi \nFreedom and Enduring Freedom. Each one is a portrait of bravery. Navy \nCorpsman Michael Vann Johnson, Jr., a native of Little Rock, was the \nfirst Arkansan killed on the battlefield in the global war on terror. \nHe was killed by selflessly tending to wounded colleagues in Iraq. \nSince his death, another 101 Arkansans have given their lives for our \ncountry in the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. This year alone, we \nhave lost five servicemembers from Arkansas.\n  At the beginning of the year, SGT Ethan C. Hardin was killed in \naction in the Logar Province of Afghanistan. He was killed when \ninsurgents attacked his unit with an improvised explosive device. \nSergeant Hardin was 25 at the time of his death. Sergeant Hardin grew \nup in Fayetteville, AR, and was remembered by his high school principal \nas a young man with a ``pleasant, likable, gentle personality.'' His \npastor echoed those thoughts, calling Sergeant Hardin a ``warrior'' who \nwas motivated to take up arms for his country not out of any \nhostilities toward the enemy but, rather, out of a strong desire to \nkeep our country safe.\n  Less than a week after the death of Sergeant Hardin, SGT Zainah C. \nCreamer was killed in the Kandahar Province of Afghanistan when \ninsurgents attacked her unit with an IED. Sergeant Creamer was born in \nTexarkana, TX, and graduated from Arkansas High School in Texarkana, \nAR. She was 28 at the time of her death. Sergeant Creamer's friends and \nfamily say they will remember her lovely singing voice and her love of \ncountry, friends, family, and fellow soldiers, including her K-9 \npartner Jofa. A soldier for more than 6 years, Sergeant Creamer was \nassigned to the 212th Military Police Detachment as an Army dog \nhandler. She and her K-9 partner were assigned to check vehicles and \nfacilities for explosives and were carrying out a routine clearance \nmission when the blast occurred.\n  In March, another IED attack in the Kandahar Province once again \nimpacted Arkansas. Army CPL Loren Buffalo of Mountain Pine, AR, was \nonly 20 years old when insurgents took his life. Corporal Buffalo was \ncarrying on the family tradition of military service. His father and \nhis uncle served in the Army and his great-grandfather was a B-17 \nbomber pilot during World War II. His father says Corporal Buffalo was \na dedicated military man who loved music, liked to hunt and ride \nhorses.\n  Last month, two Arkansans were among the 30 U.S. servicemembers \nkilled when their Chinook helicopter was shot down in the Wardak \nProvince of Afghanistan. The Taliban claim responsibility for the \nattack, which resulted in one of the greatest losses of U.S. military \nlives in a single incident in the decade-long war in Afghanistan. Most \nof those killed in the attack were U.S. Special Forces personnel.\n  Navy Special Warfare Operator Senior Chief Petty Officer Thomas A. \nRatzlaff of Green Forest, AR, was one of those Special Forces officers \nkilled in the attack. Senior Chief Ratzlaff graduated from Green Forest \nHigh School in 1995 and immediately enlisted in the Navy to begin the \nprocess of achieving his lifelong dream of becoming a Navy SEAL. \nAccording to the Green Forest mayor Charlie Reece, Senior Chief \nRatzlaff developed a reputation as one of the most highly decorated \nofficers in his elite unit, but humbly remained grounded. The mayor \ncalled him a ``high-class young man.'' Senior Chief Ratzlaff was 34 at \nthe time of his death.\n  Air Force Tech SGT John W. Brown of Siloam Springs, AR, was also \nkilled in that attack. An accomplished athlete in his youth, Sergeant \nBrown played football and basketball. He went to John Brown University \non a swimming scholarship. In Siloam Springs, he was known for his \npositive attitude, his intelligence, and his sense of humor. After \nseeing a video of a special operations unit, he abandoned plans to \nbecome a nurse anesthetist and enlisted in the Air Force where he was \nassigned to the elite 24th Special Tactics Squadron at Pope Field, NC. \nHe was 33 at the time of his death.\n  This is something we need to remember not just on anniversary dates \nbut at all times. It should serve as the ultimate reminder that we in \nthis Chamber have an obligation to come together and to make this \ncountry a better place.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in honoring their lives \nand their legacy, as well as the sacrifice of all who have fought and \ndied in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, and \nOperation New Dawn. Let us never forget their sacrifices and let their \nlegacies be an inspiration for every American.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish today to discuss two more ways to \nreduce the budget deficit by eliminating tax loopholes and special tax \nbreaks and restoring fairness to the Tax Code while protecting \nessential programs for American families.\n  Last week I sent a letter to members of the Joint Select Committee on \nDeficit Reduction outlining a 7-point plan that could lower the deficit \nby $1 trillion over 10 years through some restored revenues. I spoke \nlast week on the floor about the necessity of addressing revenue, not \njust spending cuts, to achieve real deficit reduction. I discussed in \nsome detail two of the proposals in my plan, which are combating \noffshore tax haven abuse and eliminating the tax loophole that forces \ntaxpayers to subsidize stock option compensation for corporate \nexecutives.\n  Since I spoke last week, President Obama has outlined his ideas for \ndeficit reduction. Significantly, the President has embraced the need \nto restore significant revenues to reduce the deficit. I believe the \nPresident's proposals are an important step toward serious deficit \nreduction. Indeed, some of his ideas parallel the proposals which I \nhave made to the joint select committee.\n  Today I wish to outline and describe two more of my proposals, each \ndealing with a tax loophole that benefits Wall Street at the expense of \nworking families and our fiscal well-being. One would end the carried \ninterest loophole that allows hedge fund managers to pay the lower \ncapital gains tax rate on their pay for managing investments. The \nsecond would end the blended rate loophole that gives preferential \nstatus\n\n[[Page S5710]]\n\nto income from derivatives trading even in the case of derivatives held \nfor seconds or minutes. That preferred status is given over the kinds \nof long-term investments that are more important in helping put capital \nto work, growing the economy, and creating jobs.\n\n  Each of these two loopholes amounts to a subsidy. Working American \nfamilies who pay their taxes every year end up carrying an extra burden \nbecause these provisions allowed Wall Street to pay a lower tax rate \nand the rate applied to average workers. I cannot see how anybody can \nexplain to working Americans that they must bear a greater tax burden \nso hedge fund managers get a tax break on pay that often amounts to \nmillions of dollars a year or so that speculative traders can pay a \nlower tax rate on so-called investments they might hold for just a few \nseconds.\n  Let's first talk about the carried interest loophole. Hedge fund \nmanagers generally make their money by charging their clients two fees. \nFirst, the manager gets a management fee, typically 2 percent of the \nassets. Second, the manager typically gets 20 percent of the profits \nfrom those investments above a certain level. That 20 percent is known \nas carried interest and, under current law, hedge fund managers can \ntreat that income as a long-term capital gain taxed at a maximum rate \nof 15 percent and not at the higher ordinary income rates.\n  What is the blended rate loophole? Since 1981, those who trade in \nsome financial products such as futures contracts and options have \nenjoyed a specially created tax loophole that allows them to pay a \nlower rate than, for example, traders who buy and sell stock. No matter \nhow long a speculator holds on to a futures or options contract--again, \neven if it is a few seconds--their gains and losses are taxed at a \nlower so-called blended rate; that is, part at the capital gains rate \nand part as ordinary income. So a dealer who buys a stock and sells it \nwithin a year must pay taxes at the ordinary income rate, while that \nsame dealer who buys an option and sells it 30 seconds later gets to \npay the lower capital gains rate on most of that income.\n  These special tax breaks impose an unfair burden on American \ntaxpayers, and they contribute significantly to the budget deficit. \nBased on estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation, eliminating \nthe carried interest loophole could reduce the deficit by $20 billion \nor more over 10 years. The Joint Committee has made no estimates of the \ncost to the Treasury of the blended rate loophole, but it is reasonable \nto assume that ending it would reduce the deficit by billions of \ndollars.\n  Beyond their fiscal impact, these proposals would help restore \nfairness to the Tax Code. These tax subsidies give preference to \nactivities that do not contribute much to economic growth or job \ncreation the way other activities that don't enjoy the same subsidies \ndo. Instead, they subsidize hedge fund managers and derivative dealers.\n  Take the carried interest loophole again for a moment. We tax income \nthat investors receive from hedge funds and other investments at the \nlower capital gains rate because, in theory at least, those investments \nhelp put capital to work, creating jobs and growing the economy. But \nthe hedge fund manager isn't putting his own capital at risk; he is \njust doing his job, the same as his employees or the janitor who cleans \nhis office at night. This tax break doesn't reward risk taking or job \ncreation; it rewards what is already an extremely lucrative profession. \nAccording to a survey by a magazine covering the hedge fund industry, \nthe top 10 hedge fund managers last year each made at least $440 \nmillion. Six made more than $1 billion in 1 year. It is hard to imagine \nthat we need to offer a tax break to encourage people to become hedge \nfund managers.\n  Similarly, the derivatives blended-rate loophole doesn't just add to \nthe deficit, it is plainly unfair. It is unfair not only to working \nAmericans who have to pay higher tax rates than these derivative \ntraders, it is also unfair to investors who risk their capital and \nlong-term stock and other investments that are more important to job \ncreation but don't enjoy that same tax break. This loophole gives \npreferential treatment to short-term, speculative trades over long-\nterm, patient capital, and that is exactly the wrong message to send.\n  We should end these Wall Street loopholes. I have encouraged the \nmembers of the joint select committee to end them. We should end them \nbecause they add to the deficit, because they subsidize activity that \ndoes not need a subsidy and that does not add much to economic growth, \nand because they are unfair to the millions of American taxpayers who \ndo not enjoy the same tax breaks and have to pay more in taxes to make \nup for these unfair subsidies. Eliminating them would be good for our \neconomy. It would enable us to reduce the deficit by billions of \ndollars a year. It would help us fund important programs that protect \nseniors and children, programs that make our Nation stronger.\n\n  So I hope the joint select committee will look hard at these and \nother proposals in my plan as they carry out their difficult task. I \nwill be back again in the next few days to discuss three more ideas \nthat can reduce the deficit, protect the middle class, and avoid \nDraconian cuts in vital programs.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, each year I nominate outstanding \nNebraskans as Angels in Adoption, thanking them for their shining \nexample of caring for children in need, children who want nothing more \nthan a family of their own.\n  This year, I am pleased to share the story of Paul and Mandy Mueting \nof Kearney, NB. They are true adoption heroes who have opened their \nhearts and home to three young boys.\n  After Paul and Mandy had their biological daughter, Lydia, and became \nparents for the first time, they could not imagine a child not having \nthe blessing of a loving family. Soon after, they learned of a young \nmother--a ward of the State herself--who was considering making an \nadoption plan for her then 22-month-old and 4-month-old boys named \nSteven and Edward.\n  In August 2007, the boys were placed in the Mueting home and a plan \nwas put in place for an open adoption. However, the birth mother left \nwithout relinquishing her parental rights. This was a setback for the \nMuetings, but they continued to care for and love the boys with the \nhope that they could still someday adopt them. Several months later, \nthe boys' birth mom returned, asking for another chance to mother \nSteven and Edward. The Muetings took time to grieve their loss but did \nnot give up hope of adopting children.\n  In December 2008, the Muetings were informed by Nebraska Children's \nHome Society that another birth mother selected their family and wished \nto place her soon-to-be-born son with them. Evan was born in January \n2009. The Muetings were overjoyed. They welcomed Evan into their family \nwith joy.\n  Not long after they settled in with their new son, the Muetings \nreceived yet another call. Steven and Edward's birth mom had again made \na decision to relinquish her parental rights. Seeing the love the \nMuetings had for her children, she requested that the boys be placed \nonce again with Paul and Mandy. This was a big decision. It meant \ninstantly doubling the number of children in their family from two to \nfour. They knew that providing love and care to three adopted children \nis a big responsibility.\n  Well, you will not be surprised to learn that Paul and Mandy didn't \nhesitate a moment. With open arms, they welcomed Steven and Edward back \ninto their lives. The adoption was finalized last year. I am told that \nLydia has fully adjusted to being outnumbered by three brothers. All \nfour are fortunate to have each other, a wonderful home, and loving \nparents.\n  It is with great pleasure and admiration that I nominate Paul and \nMandy Mueting as Angels in Adoption. They\n\n[[Page S5711]]\n\nare a wonderful example of compassion. My hope is that their story will \nencourage others to open their hearts to vulnerable children whose only \ndream is a loving and permanent home.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

This month marks the third anniversary of the Federal \nseizure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the collapse of Lehman Brothers, \nthe bailout of AIG, and other events that marked a turning point in the \nglobal financial crisis.\n  At the time, many journalists, pundits, and policymakers were eager \nto interpret the crisis as a failure of capitalism, as some called it, \nor a failure of free markets. There was a famous Newsweek cover that \nsaid, ``We're All Socialists Now.''\n  This interpretation is fundamentally flawed, and I wish to speak a \nlittle bit about that. Blaming capitalism and free markets and \nderegulation for causing the crisis that occurred 3 years ago does not \ntell the real story. We must remember that misguided government \npolicies played a big role in pumping up the housing bubble, and they \nhave subsequently played a big role in delaying our recovery from this \ncrash. So I wish to briefly discuss the findings of several economists \nwho highlight these points.\n  Loose monetary policy was one such misguided policy that fueled the \ncrisis. Writing recently in the quarterly journal, National Affairs, \nStanford economist John Taylor pointed out that U.S. monetary policy \nbecame highly discretionary in the years leading up to the 2008 crisis, \nwhereas monetary policy had been more rules-based during the previous \ntwo decades. Taylor has determined:\n\n       The low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve from 2003 \n     to 2005 added fuel to the housing boom and led to risk-taking \n     and eventually a sharp increase in delinquencies and \n     foreclosures and in the toxic assets held by financial \n     institutions. A more rules-based Federal funds rate--\n     particularly one that held to the general approach that \n     characterized Fed decisions throughout the 1980s and '90s--\n     would have prevented much of the boom and bust that followed.\n\n  This, according to economist John Taylor. In other words, with \ntighter, more prudent monetary policy, the housing bubble would have \nbeen significantly smaller.\n  Another major cause of the bubble was Federal housing policy, \nespecially the reckless mortgage activities of government-sponsored \nenterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These two institutions, \noperating under an implicit government guarantee, played a central role \nin the housing bubble. The government's guarantee permitted them to \noperate without adequate capital, to assume more risk than competing \nfinancial institutions, and to borrow at a below-market rate of \ninterest. Between 2004 and 2007, Fannie and Freddie became the largest \nbuyers of so-called subprime and Alt-A mortgages.\n  As Columbia Business School economist Charles Calomiris has observed:\n\n       Logic and historical experience suggest that even in the \n     presence of loose monetary policy and global imbalances, if \n     the U.S. government had not been playing the role of risky-\n     mortgage purchaser in the years leading up to the crisis, \n     mortgage-related losses would have been cut by more than \n     half.\n\n  To be sure, government entities were not the only institutions \npromoting the growth of nontraditional mortgages. But government policy \nwas the critical factor that made the bubble so dangerously large. \nHousing-finance expert Peter Wallison of the American Enterprise \nInstitute argues that:\n\n       Without the huge number of defaults that arose out of the \n     U.S. housing policy, defaults among the mortgages in the \n     private market would not have caused a financial crisis.\n\n  So with better, more responsible Federal housing policies, the crisis \nmight have been avoided or have been less severe.\n  Government failures have also, in the words of Nobel Prize-winning \neconomist Gary Becker, ``prolonged the crisis.'' Indeed, the economy \nhas not responded well to the prodigious spending, trillions in debt, \nand countless new regulations imposed during the Obama \nadministration. The economic policies of the last few years seem to \nhave hampered the confidence of job creators, while creating widespread \nuncertainty and undermining confidence.\n\n  Michael Boskin of Stanford, in a piece entitled ``The Obama \nPresidency by Numbers,'' said this:\n\n       President Obama's debt explosion will be a drag on the \n     economy for years to come. . . . The share of Americans \n     paying income taxes is the lowest in the modern era, while \n     dependency on government is the highest in U.S. history.\n\n  These are dreary findings.\n  In January 2009, the U.S. unemployment rate stood at 7.6 percent. By \nOctober 2009, it had surged above 10 percent despite the passage of the \n$1.2 trillion stimulus bill. Unemployment has been above 9 percent for \n26 of the 30 months since the passage of the stimulus. In fact, Boskin \nhas found that even by the administration's inflated estimates of jobs \n``created or saved'' by the stimulus, each job has cost $280,000--each \njob, $280,000. That is five times the average American's annual pay. \nRemember, that is borrowed money that will eventually have to be taken \nout of the private sector to pay it back.\n  In addition to the failed stimulus package, the last Congress also \nenacted a pair of 2,000-page bills that were supposedly designed to \nrepair the health care and financial systems. In the view of Becker, \n``These laws and the continuing calls for additional regulations and \ntaxes have broadened the uncertainty about the economic environment \nfacing businesses and consumers. This uncertainty decreased the \nincentives to invest in long-lived producer and consumer goods. \nParticularly discouraged was the creation of small businesses, which \nare a major source of new hires.''\n  My point is not to needlessly pile on President Obama but to \nunderline the need for a new approach. His policies have made things \nworse, and the uncertainty surrounding his new proposals has crippled \nAmerica's economic recovery. As Carnegie Mellon economist Allan Meltzer \nhas written, ``High uncertainty is the enemy of investment and \ngrowth.''\n  America's job creators are eager to know whether their taxes will be \nraised at the end of 2012, whether the new health care law will force \nthem to lay off a substantial number of workers, whether the Dodd-Frank \nbill will impose unforeseen new costs, and whether the administration \nwill impose even more regulatory hurdles. Notably, despite the \nadministration's recent rhetoric about regulatory review, the massive \nnew regulations in its two signature bills--health care and financial \nregulatory reform--will not be reconsidered.\n  In conclusion, the 2008 financial crisis was not simply a failure of \ncapitalism or a result of free market economic policies. We can \nreasonably say the crisis would not have been nearly as severe or may \neven have been avoided entirely without misguided government policies.\n  All of us here would like to see a strong economic recovery, but \nreckless spending, debt, more regulation, and government intervention \nhave not boosted the economy so far. It is time for another approach, \none that eschews the top-down Washington management and focuses on \ncreating incentives and long-term certainty in the private sector.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today with a deep sense of \nhonor and a deep sense of sadness to speak about the late Senator \nCharles Harting Percy of Illinois who passed away this past Saturday, \nwith his family surrounding him.\n  Before I begin, though, I also wish to speak about two other losses \nto the Senate family. One, of course, is Kara Kennedy, the beloved \ndaughter of Senator Ted Kennedy, as well as Eleanor Mondale, the \nbeloved daughter of Vice President and Senator Fritz Mondale. Each of \nthese two wonderful people died at the age of 51 and it is \nincomprehensible. It is terrible. They were far too young to be taken \nfrom us. The Percy and Rockefeller family love flows to their families.\n  Senator Chuck Percy was blessed to live a long and accomplished life. \nHe lived to be 91 years old. Many of my colleagues know Senator Percy \nwas a distinguished Republican Member of the Senate for 18 years, from \n1967 to 1984, which is the year I came to the Senate. He was chairman, \nas people know, of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and a man \nwith an absolutely vast talent that he poured into every aspect of his \npublic service as well as his private business career. He was \nextraordinary in that way. He had brains. He had vision. He had \nstamina. He had energy. He was incredibly athletic. He could do \nanything for any amount of time and under all of this was built this \nincredible discipline that made him do it all.\n  Most importantly to this Senator, Chuck Percy was my father-in-law \nfor more than four decades, since I was lucky enough to marry his \nunique and beautiful daughter, Sharon Percy, who, I might say, has many \nof the characteristics, nature and habits of Senator Percy. It just \nworked out that way. She has those characteristics. He extended to me \nin every way the great gift of joining the family he nurtured, watched \nover, cared for, and protected all of his life, and for that, \nobviously, I am forever grateful.\n  I wish to share a few remembrances of Senator Percy with my \ncolleagues because many here didn't know him--a few did, but most did \nnot; with the people of Illinois, and with all of the family and \nfriends who are hurting from the news of his loss.\n  Chuck Percy was absolutely unshakeable in his belief in the future. \nHe believed in our country and he believed in our ability to make this \nworld a better place, if we would only put our minds and will and \ndiscipline to it. He was a believer. He always saw not through a glass \ndarkly but through a glass brightly. It was his nature. He was guided \nmore by what was right than by party label.\n  Interestingly, in a press interview in 2008, then-Senator Barack \nObama noted that his hope was that more Republicans would look at \nmembers of their party for inspiration and then compare them to Abraham \nLincoln and Chuck Percy, two ``pretty good Republicans,'' he said.\n  What made Chuck so magnetic and so successful was his determination \nto share his optimism, to share his sense of promise with everyone \naround him, even at a very young age.\n  Chuck Percy began his business career not at Bell & Howell, where in \nfact at the age of 29 he became the youngest CEO and president of a \nmajor American company, but in fact he did it years earlier at the age \nof 4. His family was impoverished. They had been devastated by the \nGreat Depression. They faced bankruptcy. They shifted from place to \nplace in some of the most difficult parts of Chicago. So Chuck Percy at \nthe age of 4 wanted to help, and he knew how to help: the \nentrepreneurial instinct. He took cookies, baked presumably at home, \nand sold them on the streets of Chicago for a very little amount of \nmoney, but he made money from that which he then turned over to the \nfamily.\n  He helped his impoverished family weather the Great Depression and \npushed himself, by force of will, to get an education, all the way \nthrough the University of Chicago, on scholarship.\n  Before his business career took off, as did many men of his \ngeneration, Chuck Percy went off to war serving his country for 3 years \nas a naval officer during World War II. Upon returning home, he \nrejoined Bell & Howell and led that company from 1949 to 1964 through \nan astounding thirty-two fold increase in the expansion of sales, in \nwhat were then cutting-edge film products.\n  He launched his political career in large part to get back into \npublic service because he missed it. He yearned for it. One could argue \nthat business might have been his real calling, or maybe public service \nwas, but to him he was interested in everything and wanted to do \neverything. So he had a chance to get back into public service, but he \nhad no grand ambition. He simply wanted to find ways to challenge \nhimself and to help make the country better.\n  Chuck Percy had a seriousness of purpose. As a young man he resolved \nto read all of the great books of his generation and generations that \npreceded his, the master works, as well as the Constitution, the Bill \nof Rights, the Federalist Papers. He not only read them, but he \ndiscussed them all with his professor. It was a stunning emphasis to \ndrive himself to increase his knowledge to the highest level possible.\n  But Chuck also had a sense of fun and of sport. He loved to be \nactive. He loved to ski, among other things. As fate would have it, he \nwas skiing in Idaho when then-President Eisenhower called him in 1959 \nto see if he could be persuaded to work on a project to reinvigorate \nthe Republican Party by leading a commission on national goals. It was \nan ambitious task and rife with political risk for Chuck, but Chuck \ndidn't hesitate. His work helped pave the way for his election, in \nfact, to the Senate in 1966.\n  But even more than that, his report served as a template for the \nreflection and soul searching that went on in this country ahead of \nthat 1976 bicentennial. He cared about the 200th anniversary of \nAmerica. Everybody did, but he really did, and he wanted to know what \nwe could do better, what we could do more of, and that is what he used \nthat commission for. He wanted America to be a better nation.\n  As a Senator, Chuck Percy took a strong interest in the economy and \ninternational affairs. As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee \nhe traveled the globe, going to countries whose names were hardly known \nat a time when very few Senators were even traveling at all. He could \ndo that as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, but he wanted \nto do that and he was good at it. He would get into the tiniest track \nof a small village to try and meet people, maybe even breaking cultural \nhabits by trying to shake hands with people who were not allowed to \nshake hands because they were considered too impoverished. Nothing \ndiscouraged him, and he wanted to make himself a better person and a \nbetter Senator.\n  Chuck was on a trip to inspect the battlefields of Vietnam, even \nthough he was very skeptical of that war. He was on a helicopter when \nhis aircraft took fire from the Vietcong in a hamlet about 90 miles \nnorth of Saigon.\n  The helicopter lifted off for safety, but left Chuck with four other \nmen and two guns between them to huddle against the ground as mortar \nshells exploded 15 feet away and small arms fire whizzed overhead. \nAdditional U.S. helicopters soon arrived and rescued the men, and the \nstory went on. He was fearless.\n  When he came to the Senate, Chuck took on the culture of the Senate. \nHe didn't like a lot of what he saw. I am looking, as I speak now, at \nSenate pages. He thought there was no reason why girls could not be \nSenate pages as easily as boys, but that was the custom then. Girls \nwere not deemed to be able to do the work. There was an attitude here \nin the Senate then that the opportunity of being a page was suited for \nboys, and during the debate, interestingly, some Senators worried about \ngirl pages not being able to carry copies of the Congressional Record \nto the Senate desks.\n  He cosponsored the Equal Rights Amendment and spent the better part \nof his career arguing that women should have the same opportunities as \nmen. Senator Percy knew firsthand from the remarkable women in his own \nlife, his own family, and the remarkable women in his office that women \ncan do anything men can do, and perhaps better. In fact, Senator Percy \nwas furious when he found out that textbooks paid for by the Federal \nGovernment included sentences such as ``girls\n\n[[Page S5713]]\n\nshould be nurses and secretaries, while boys should be doctors and \nbusinessmen.''\n  Chuck Percy also cared deeply about helping less fortunate Americans. \nPeople think of him as always having been very rich. No. He was very \npoor and his family was even poorer. He struggled for a long time. He \nis rightly credited for authoring and pushing the first-ever \nlegislation to create opportunities for home ownership for low-income \nAmericans.\n  He focused on older Americans. He wrote a book back in 1974 about the \ndaunting process of growing old in America. This is back in 1974, 9 \nyears after Medicare, and the shameful living conditions and hospital \nconditions the elder poor had to face. His book was a call to action \nand a moral imperative to restore dignity to aging.\n  Chuck favored open government and sunshine laws at a time when it was \nnot popular. He felt strongly that in a democracy, the military \nestablishment should be held accountable and answer specifically to \ncivilian leaders.\n  He also opposed, for the most part, war and took many positions that \nundoubtedly hurt him within his party.\n  But, in fact, he defied party labels, describing himself as \n``fervently moderate.'' So aggressively did he seek out evenhandedness \nthat it was known by those who knew him that at his dinner parties at \nhis house, they were always equally divided between Democrats and \nRepublicans; specifically, one Republican, one Democrat, and different \nparts of the government and business. It was a matter of principle to \nhim.\n  He wanted to hear all sides, though he was absolutely resolute when \nhe made up his mind. One of the things I thought was most captivating \nabout Chuck was the fervor with which he held his beliefs.\n  Senator Percy's desire to be President came to be well known--and he \nwrote about it publicly--but the timing was never quite right so that \ndid not happen.\n  He lost his race for a fourth Senate term in 1984, just when this \nSenator was coming into the Senate, and it was one of several very \ndifficult times Chuck Percy faced in his life with courage and with \ngrace.\n  Early in his life, his family was literally penniless when his father \nlost his job and all their savings. Then later, at the midpoint of his \ncareer, he lost a beloved daughter, Sharon's twin sister Valerie, in an \nunspeakable and lethal crime that still tears at the soul of our \nfamily. Then, in his final years, he was struck down by Alzheimer's for \na decade or more. There is no cure for Alzheimer's. The end was fated.\n  He was never downcast. He was always--until he no longer could--\ntrying to read, walk, play tennis, have meals outdoors, and do \nsomething. But it was through the whole of his dynamic and full life \nthat Chuck Percy steadily became the great man whom I have been \nprivileged to know, admire, and love deeply.\n  Chuck warmed to a challenge. He leaned into life in every way--\ninsisting for himself, his children, and his grandchildren that the \nbest part of living consists of learning, improving, and trying to do \nbetter each day. His energy and his focus on this process, fueled in \npart by Christian Science, was amazing and unmatched, as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  He was an incomparable father to Sharon and to her siblings. He lived \nwhat he believed--very simple--never wavered in his unconditional \nsupport and love, and sought and created truth.\n  America benefitted greatly from his life and from his service. The \nentire Percy and Rockefeller families have been incredibly and \nindelibly shaped by his legacy and by his love.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement from the Percy and \nRockefeller families be printed in the Congressional Record. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement From the Percy and Rockefeller Families on the Passing of \n                        Senator Charles H. Percy\n\n       It is with a profound sense of personal loss that the \n     family of former Senator Charles H. Percy announces his death \n     on Saturday, September 17, 2011, at the age of 91.\n       He loomed as large in his private life as he did in his \n     public one.\n       His determination--to overcome odds, to help others, to \n     persuade decision-makers to actions he believed were \n     important--showed us how much can be achieved through the \n     inspiration of a single man.\n       The energy and enthusiasm he brought to everything in his \n     many-faceted life encouraged us to rise early and to embrace \n     each day's opportunities for work and fun until late at \n     night, and buoyed us up when we flagged. His courage in the \n     face of devastating adversity made us braver and taught us \n     resilience. His insistence on a balanced perspective in his \n     public life, (calling himself ``fervently moderate''), helped \n     us understand it is both possible and preferable to live in a \n     world without partisanship.\n       He led by example with his self-confidence, relishing the \n     company of people who challenged and informed his thinking, \n     including his outstanding business and Senate staff. He \n     provoked animated discussions around the dinner table and \n     roared with laughter at Capitol Steps skits at his expense. \n     His voice was strong and deep, and it filled and warmed a \n     room.\n       He taught us humility and respectfulness as, win or lose, \n     he would show up at the Chicago Loop the day after each \n     election to thank the voters. He taught us generosity, as he \n     tried to help others as he'd been helped along the way. He \n     taught us how powerful unconditional love can be.\n       He went through life with his arms flung wide. He welcomed \n     all who wanted to accompany him on his journey, celebrated \n     the victories with them, and supported and comforted them \n     through his own difficult times.\n       He unreservedly believed he would be joining the loved ones \n     who had gone before him, and in the face of such conviction \n     we cannot but believe he is having the joyous reunion he had \n     longed for.\n       We also believe he would want to thank extended family, \n     friends, colleagues, and compatriots for so enriching his \n     life. We will all miss him.\n       The family will be holding a private service. In lieu of \n     flowers, contributions may be made in the name of Charles H. \n     Percy to The Friends of Georgetown Waterfront Park (P.O. Box \n     3653, Washington, D.C. 20027) or WETA (3939 Campbell Avenue, \n     Arlington, VA 22206).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, let me extend my sympathy to my \ncolleague, Jay Rockefeller from West Virginia, son-in-law of the late \nSenator Chuck Percy, and, of course, his wife, Senator Percy's \ndaughter, Sharon. They are great friends, and I know this loss, though \nthey all found it inevitable, still brings pain to their lives. I hope \nthe reflections of so many people in the greatness of Chuck Percy and \nhis contribution to Illinois and to America will help to, in some ways, \nalleviate the pain they are going through.\n  I join my colleague, Senator Kirk, today in paying tribute to our \nfallen colleague and friend, Senator Charles Percy, who died on \nSaturday. He served Illinois and our Nation for 18 years here in the \nSenate.\n  Although he ran against the two men who were my greatest political \ninspirations--Senator Paul Douglas and Senator Paul Simon--I always \nregarded Senator Percy as a friend and as an honest and honorable \nrepresentative of our State of Illinois.\n  It is a little known fact about Chuck Percy that he was nearsighted \nin one eye and farsighted in the other. That unusual vision was a good \nmetaphor for his politics as well. He described himself as ``fervently \nmoderate.'' A progressive Republican, he said he was ``a conservative \non money issues but a liberal on people issues.'' He used the word \n``liberal'' in the days when you could get away with it.\n  Charles Harting Percy was born in 1919 in Pensacola, FL. His family \nmoved to Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood when he was a baby. His \nfather worked as a bank clerk. His mother taught violin for 25 cents a \nlesson. The bank at which his father worked failed in the Depression \nand the Percy family was forced into bankruptcy and onto relief.\n  Chuck Percy got his first job at the age of 5, selling magazines, to \nhelp his family along. He sold his mother's homemade cookies door to \ndoor, rose at 3:30 in the morning to deliver newspapers and parked cars \nand worked as a janitor--all while he was in high school.\n  He worked his way through the University of Chicago on a half-tuition \nscholarship. Along the way, he had an economics professor, Dr. Paul \nDouglas.\n  In 1936, while Chuck Percy was still in college, his Sunday school \nteacher encouraged him to enter a training program at the man's \ncompany. The company was Bell & Howell, near Skokie, IL, a very small \nmanufacturer, at the time, of home movie cameras.\n  After graduating from the University of Illinois with a degree in \neconomics,\n\n[[Page S5714]]\n\nChuck Percy went to work full time at Bell & Howell. At 23, he was \nelected to the board of directors. At age 29, he was named Bell & \nHowell president and chief executive officer, the youngest person to \nhead a major American corporation up to that time.\n  In 14 years, under Chuck Percy's leadership, Bell & Howell extended \nits reach in the consumer electronics market. Its number of employees \nincreased twelvefold, and its annual sales climbed from $13 million to \n$160 million.\n  In 1964, Chuck Percy was a delegate to the Republican National \nConvention. It was the same year he ran unsuccessfully for Governor of \nIllinois against Otto Kerner.\n  Two years later, Chuck Percy challenged that former University of \nChicago professor, Paul Douglas, for his seat in the Senate. I knew all \nabout that campaign. It was my first. I was a college student and an \nintern to Senator Douglas and went back to work on his campaign in \nIllinois when Chuck Percy challenged him.\n  In the final weeks of that campaign, I was with Senator Douglas in my \nhometown of East St. Louis, IL. He was staying at the Holiday Inn, and \nhe received word, early in the morning, that Chuck Percy's daughter, \nValerie, had been murdered in their home.\n  Senator Douglas--I remember this to this day--saw a church across the \nstreet from that Holiday Inn--it was Saint Henry Catholic Church--and \nthough Douglas was a Quaker and later a Unitarian, he said: I am going \nto that church to pray. He went in and he prayed for the Percy family. \nHe walked out the door and he said, in quiet tones to his staff: This \ncampaign is over until Chuck Percy announces it will resume, and we \nwill say nothing about this tragedy other than to express our sympathy \nto his family. What a different day in American politics.\n  Both candidates declared a halt to the campaign. It lasted nearly 1 \nmonth. It was the month of September. That decision showed a humanity \nand a respect which is missing on too many occasions from today's \npolitics.\n  Chuck Percy went on to win that campaign. In the Senate, he backed \nconsumer protection and environmental efforts and supported \ninternational nuclear nonproliferation. When you listen to his agenda \nof priorities, you find it hard to place it in today's very \nconservative Republican agenda.\n  A Navy veteran, he was an outspoken opponent of the war in Vietnam. \nIt was an act of political courage that earned him a place on Richard \nNixon's infamous enemies list.\n  He was the first Senator to call for an independent prosecutor to \ninvestigate Watergate.\n  In 1970, he joined the Foreign Relations Committee. One decade later, \nwhen he rose to chair that committee, he explained his views on foreign \npolicy this way:\n\n       I don't want foreign policy developed just by one party and \n     ride roughshod over the other party. I'd much more value a \n     bill that has bipartisan support. That's what this committee \n     achieved in World War II, achieved in the Marshall Plan.\n\n  Chuck Percy was reelected to the Senate in 1972 by more than 1 \nmillion votes, the largest plurality of any Senate candidate in the \nNation that year. He won a third term in 1978.\n  Running for a fourth term in 1984, he was challenged in a bitter \nprimary by an archconservative--a man whose money came from out of \nState and was never traced. Although he won that primary, he would go \non to lose the general election to my friend, Senator Paul Simon, who \nwon with 50.1 percent of the vote.\n  That same year, Senator Percy's son-in-law, our colleague, Senator \nRockefeller, was elected to the Senate from West Virginia.\n  After leaving the Senate, Senator Percy said his proudest \naccomplishment in office had been pushing for more opportunity for \nwomen in the Federal Government. His lasting legacy goes way beyond \nthat.\n  In 1970, it was Senator Chuck Percy who persuaded Richard Nixon to \nnominate one of Senator Percy's former classmates for a spot on the \nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Five years later, that former \nUniversity of Chicago classmate, John Paul Stevens, was elevated to the \nU.S. Supreme Court, where he served with distinction until his \nretirement last year.\n  I can recall when Senator Percy was in office. I had backed his \nopponent, Senator Douglas, whom he defeated in 1966. I contacted his \noffice. I was a student at Georgetown Law School. We had a group of \nDemocrats, and I thought: I will just take a flier here. Let me call \nhis office and see if he will meet with us. Of course, he said yes. The \nnext thing you know, 10 Georgetown University Law Center young \nDemocrats were sitting in Chuck Percy's office. He knew it, and we had \na good time, a good exchange. That is the kind of person he was. That \nis the kind of politics he practiced. That is a reminder of what life \nwas like not that long ago.\n  After leaving office, Senator Percy became an international relations \nand trade consultant and board chairman of an organization that \nadministers education and cultural exchange programs.\n  Two years ago, his daughter, Sharon Percy Rockefeller, announced that \nher father had Alzheimer's. Senator Percy had been struggling with the \ndisease for more than a decade.\n  Even out of office, he would call me from time to time, usually with \na request about Washington, DC. Illinois was his love and the Chicago \narea always his hometown. But he had a passion and love for Washington \ntoo and he worked hard to make this a better city.\n  I wish to offer my deepest condolences to Senator Percy's wife of \nmore than 60 years, Loraine, to Sharon and Jay Rockefeller and all the \nPercy children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.\n  I feel honored to have been schooled in politics in Illinois during \nthis era, to have known such extraordinary men when I was just a \nyoungster, a college student starting out. Knowing all of them and \nwatching them in public service gave me an impression and an ideal of \nwhat this job should be all about.\n  When I heard of Senator Percy's death--I know his family had \nanticipated it--it brought back many memories of the fine contribution \nhe made to Illinois and to the Nation. We are lucky to have had men \nlike him, successful in so many ways, devoting a major part of their \nlives to public service. We are also fortunate they did it with such a \nfeeling of responsibility, not only to their State and Nation but also \nto be public servants in the best sense of the word, working with \neveryone to try to find solutions to problems. It is a lesson we need \nto relearn today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to suspend the time \nlimitation and continue for 8 minutes to eulogize Senator Percy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I rise along with my colleague from \nIllinois, our senior Senator, Mr. Durbin, and, of course, Senator \nRockefeller, related to the Percy family, to eulogize Senator Percy, \nwhom he we lost on Saturday--a great and one of the most successful \nIllinois Senators.\n  Senator Percy dedicated much of his life to serving our Nation, first \nin the U.S. Navy and then for 18 years in the Senate.\n  I think I am the only Member of the Senate who actually voted for \nSenator Percy and volunteered in his campaign, along with my mom, when \nI was only 12 years old. Senator Percy, we knew, was a focused and \ndisciplined leader, who succeeded at nearly everything he put his mind \nto.\n  He graduated from my alma mater, New Trier High School, and also \nlived in Kenilworth, IL, my hometown. He later, after graduating from \nNew Trier, went to the University of Chicago. After getting a \nbachelor's degree in economics, he joined a small camera company called \nBell & Howell.\n  He then led Bell & Howell, starting at the age of only 29, into \nmaking military cameras and movie projectors and then a new product \ncalled microfilm. As the leader of Bell & Howell, he was one of our \ngreatest job engines of the State of Illinois. Employment grew 12 times \nunder his leadership and earnings 32 times. But Charles Percy wanted to \ndo more for his country.\n  As we heard, at the request of President Eisenhower, he helped write \n``Better Decisions For America'' as part of\n\n[[Page S5715]]\n\nthe Republican platform of 1960. Charles Percy ran for Governor in \n1964, but he lost that election. In the not-so-proud tradition of \nIllinois, that Governor then went to jail and Percy became seen as a \ncorruption fighter in our State. Just 2 years after that defeat, \nCharles Percy was elected by the people of Illinois to represent them \nin the Senate, defeating Paul Douglas.\n  During that campaign, his daughter Valerie was murdered in my \nhometown and his hometown, Kenilworth--one of our town's only murders. \nIt was through this tragedy that we saw so clearly Charles Percy's \nquiet dignity.\n  In the Senate, Chuck Percy was first known as a proponent of a \nfoundation to back home ownership for low-income families. He was the \ntoast of this town in the 1960s, described by the New York Times as \n``the hottest political article in the Republican Party.'' He even led \nin polls for the 1968 Republican nomination for President.\n  Senator Percy, though, was at heart an independent who took on \ncorruption in his own State, and especially his own party. He moved the \nfirst resolution calling for an independent prosecutor on the Watergate \nscandal. The New York Times reported:\n\n       Nixon fumed to his cabinet that he would do all he could to \n     make sure that Mr. Percy, who already voted against two Nixon \n     nominees for the Supreme Court, would never become President.\n\n  Senator Percy fought corruption wherever he saw it. In 1977, he took \non White House Budget Director Bert Lance for backdating checks to gain \ntax deductions. Lance later resigned.\n  Senator Percy was best known for his work as chair of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee during historic times, when the United \nStates recovered its nerve and stared down the Soviet Union, and it won \nthe Cold War outright.\n  He was a gentle man, disciplined in swimming every day, and a devout \nChristian Scientist who read the Bible each evening.\n  Senator Percy was a strong, honest, and principled man whose \nintegrity remained uncompromised in his nearly 20 years in the Senate. \nHe believed that accountability, checks and balances, and transparency \nshould be the driving forces of government.\n  We will miss his moderate, fiscally conservative brand of politics. \nHis legacy is one of genteel, thoughtful leadership, and his fight \nagainst corruption in Illinois is sorely missed today.\n  I send my sincere condolences to Senator Percy's wife Loraine and his \nchildren, Sharon, Roger, Gail, and Mark, and their spouses--including \nour colleague Senator Rockefeller--and to the grandchildren, great-\ngrandchildren, and many friends and family who will mark his passing at \nthe funeral on Wednesday.\n  Senator Percy was one of the best-remembered Illinois Senators. He \nrepresents a tradition, in some sense followed by me. As a former \nvolunteer for his campaign and one who voted for him, we mark his loss \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/19/senate-section/article/S5715-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 2832, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the bill (H.R. 2832) to extend the \n     Generalized System of Preferences, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 \np.m. will be divided and controlled between the Senator from Montana, \nMr. Baucus, and the Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, or their designees.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Alabama, I don't \nplan to take a lot of time--maybe 10 minutes total.\n  Mr. President, in 1934, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt said:\n\n       No country, however rich, can afford the waste of its human \n     resources. Demoralization caused by vast unemployment is our \n     greatest extravagance.\n\n  President Roosevelt said these words at a fireside chat nearly 80 \nyears ago. Our economy was slowly on the path of recovery after \nsuffering the worst financial crash in American history. Roosevelt had \nturned his focus to helping the ``permanent army of unemployed'' \nAmericans--those Americans who didn't have jobs. His resulting \ninvestment in America's human resources put millions of people back to \nwork.\n  Today, we face a similar situation. After a significant financial \ncrisis, our economy is in tough shape. Our economic recovery is fragile \nbut improving. Housing foreclosures have slowed and investors are \nlooking for new opportunities. We have a long way to go. But 14 million \nAmericans are still looking for work--and that is just unemployed. If \nyou add the underemployed, it is probably closer to 20 million, and \nmaybe more than that. Like President Roosevelt, we must bolster our \ninvestment in American human resources because, as in 1934, America's \nstrength is in its people.\n  When people are denied the opportunity to work, they are denied the \ndignity that comes with that work--let alone the income, let alone \nproviding for their families. Trade adjustment assistance, or TAA, is \nthe right investment in America's workers. TAA provides training and \nincome support to thousands of Americans so they can get a good-paying \njob right here in our own country. TAA helps them earn the dignity that \ncomes from putting in a good day of work.\n  I worked with my friend, Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp, from \nMichigan, who is a good man. We worked together on a TAA agreement that \nimproves the efficiency, accessibility, and effectiveness of the \nprogram. I highly commend Representative David Camp. Our staffs have \nworked very closely over and over to try to find a common agreement for \nreauthorizing trade adjustment assistance. We worked to scale back the \ncost of the program, while maintaining the importance of training that \nhelps workers secure good-paying jobs here at home.\n  The amendment we are offering today is one I made with Chairman Camp \non TAA. It extends coverage to workers in the services sector, which \nmakes up 80 percent of our economy. It wasn't there before, at least \nnot before 2009. Extending this coverage means manufacturing workers, \nas well as computer programmers and airline maintenance technicians \nwill have equal access to the TAA Program.\n  It also extends TAA to all workers. Current law does not cover 8 of \nour top 10 trade partners, including China, Japan, and Korea. Our \namendment removes this geographic limitation and expands TAA's benefits \nto cover trade with all countries.\n  Job retraining is the heart of TAA. This training has a proven track \nrecord of providing workers the skills they need to secure their next \njob. We know it works--and it works well--in my State of Montana and \nacross the country.\n  Al Drebes worked at Plum Creek Lumber Mill in Pablo, MT. In January \n2009, Al was laid off. With a young family, he needed to quickly find a \nnew job. But after he spent months sending his resume around, he \nrealized he needed to update his skills.\n  What did he do? Al signed up for TAA and began training in recreation \npower equipment repair. Following his classroom training, TAA partnered \nhim with a local employer, S Sports, which specializes in all-terrain \nmotor vehicles, jet skis, and other such things that are so important \nto so many people in our country--and, I might add, they are a lot of \nfun. Al began on-the-job training with S and did such a great job \nthat the company hired him full time. Because of TAA job training, Al \nnow has the security and dignity that comes with a full day's work, and \nhe continues supporting his family.\n  In addition to providing essential job training, our TAA amendment \nalso helps American workers maintain health insurance for themselves \nand their families. TAA-eligible workers have access to the health \ncoverage tax credit, which provides a 72.5-percent tax credit subsidy \nto make health care\n\n[[Page S5716]]\n\nmore affordable; otherwise, they would not have any health insurance. \nWith nearly 50 million uninsured Americans, this benefit is more \nimportant than ever.\n  Finally, the TAA agreement strengthens programs that help America's \nsmall businesses and small farmers. These programs--TAA for Firms and \nTAA for Farmers--provide targeted, intensive technical assistance to \nhelp small businesses and farmers improve their business plans, and \nthey provide seed money to implement those plans.\n  This bill also provides duty-free access to the U.S. market for \nimported products from certain developing countries.\n  The Generalized System of Preferences, otherwise known as GSP, lowers \nthe costs on inputs for American employers across the United States. \nAmerican manufacturers use GSP imports--imports from developing \ncountries, where the tariffs are reduced so imports can come in more \neasily--to build cars, produce steel, and manufacture hydropower \nturbines, for example.\n  Since GSP expired last year, American companies have paid nearly $400 \nmillion in tariffs on these imports. That is an added cost to American \nbusiness of $400 million. By reauthorizing and extending GSP, we ensure \nthat these workers, and workers in 129 countries around the world, have \nthe opportunity to earn the dignity of work.\n  This amendment, in short, helps save and create American jobs. It \nhelps Americans keep their jobs by providing the low-cost inputs U.S. \nmanufacturers need. It helps Americans who lose their jobs get the \nskills they need to secure a new job and earn the dignity a solid day \nof work provides. The amendment is fully offset and doesn't add a dime \nto our deficit.\n  This amendment invests in America's human resources, just as \nPresident Roosevelt envisioned. It ensures our workers are not \ndemoralized by unemployment and that they are energized by the hope of \nagain standing on their own two feet.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his hard work \non this bill. I have supported him so many times in the past and hoped \nover the last several years as we have discussed my little problem in \nHaleyville, AL, that maybe some agreement could be reached. But the \nU.S. Trade Representative, who talks sympathetically and does nothing, \nand the congressional committee seem to be of the view that any change, \neven though that is what they are empowered to do, is somehow not \npossible and we should not make changes in our trade law. So I objected \ntoday to going to this bill because I wish to see modest changes made \nin it.\n  We are facing job losses in America. As my colleague has said, more \nthan 25 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed. The \nunemployment rate remains above 9 percent. In Alabama, unemployment is \nnow higher than the national average. A few years ago, we were below \nthe national average.\n  In times such as these, Congress ought to consider options that \ncreate a favorable environment for businesses without adding more to \nthe debt by spending money to try to stimulate the economy. One such \nmeasure would be a small change in the generalized system of \npreferences--the GSP--which the Senate is considering this week.\n  Some background: The GSP was enacted in 1974 to give developing \ncountries duty-free access to our markets, while still protecting \nAmerican industries. Importantly, a key concept of the whole plan of \nGSP was if a product is made in America, that type of good is not \nallowed duty-free access to GSP. They would not be allowed to be \nimported duty free if we have an ongoing market. In some instances, we \ndid not have ongoing production, so we allowed poorer countries to \nimport duty free because it didn't lay off American jobs. Importers are \nnot allowed the preference of a lower rate under those circumstances.\n  Unfortunately, the U.S. Trade Representative concluded otherwise a \nnumber of years ago and made an exception, straying from the original, \nfundamental purpose and principle. And that exception threatens the \nAmerican sleeping bag textile industry and those industries that \nsupport it.\n\n  In 1992, the U.S. Trade Representative added sleeping bags to the \nlist of GSP-eligible products in a special effort to support--it \nappears, at that time--the textile industry in Czechoslovakia. But, \napparently, Czechoslovakia never produced a sleeping bag. Apparently, \nthis was a political deal. They wanted to help Czechoslovakia after the \nfall of the wall.\n  I can understand that, but do you see what is happening? Some \npolitical part of the government worrying about foreign policy decides \nwe don't care too much about American sleeping bags, or whatever, \nbecause we want to make friends with this country. So we forego \nAmerican jobs for foreign jobs as a way to win favor with those \ncountries.\n  Now, I am not saying that is never good, but I am saying when we do \nthat time and time again we begin to concede too much of American \nwealth and jobs.\n  So GSP was in effect in 1974 to help those countries, and I don't \nthink it should have been changed. But a few years ago, a Chinese \ncompany began to produce sleeping bags and import them into the United \nStates. They are not eligible to be a GSP low-cost, duty-free shipper \nbecause they are not a poorer nation that qualifies under the GSP. But \nthey began to import into the United States, and when it became clear \nwe had a good American company that could compete effectively against \nthem, they realized there was a loophole and that Bangladesh could \nqualify for this loophole. So they moved their plant over to \nBangladesh--at least in name they moved it--and continued to supply the \nmaterials to Bangladesh where the sleeping bags are produced and then \nimported duty free under this loophole that should never have been \ncreated because it has put Americans out of work.\n  So with regard to China, I just have to note it is not a principled \nfree-trade country. They are out aggressively to advance their interest \nand the interests of their companies and to sell everything they can \nsell abroad to advance their interests regardless of how many Americans \nare placed out of work. So I think our leaders have to begin to be \nsensitive to these practices.\n  When will we start tough negotiations on behalf of our workers \ninstead of resisting efforts to help our workers be competitive? \nInstead of standing up and being tough with Jeff Sessions, the Senator \nfrom Alabama, they need to stand up and be tough with people in \nBeijing, it seems to me. I believe in free trade. My voting record \nproves this. I have supported virtually every free-trade agreement. But \nfree trade is not free if we allow ourselves to be exploited, if we \nhand unfair advantage to other nations.\n  Haleyville is a small town. It is in the county of Winston--known as \nthe Free State of Winston. Winston County claims and, I think, in \neffect did secede from Alabama when Alabama seceded from the Union. \nThere are people in Winston County named Ulysses right now, after \nGrant. It is a remarkable county. It is an hour and a half from \nBirmingham, the closest center. It is very rural--15,000, 20,000, \n25,000 people.\n  Also, Marion County is in the same area, and they have high \nunemployment--about 12 percent unemployment in that area. These 100 or \nso jobs are important.\n  I went there a few months ago. The local high school band played, and \nthey welcomed me. All the employees were there. They pleaded with me to \ndo what I could to help them save their jobs, and I promised to do so. \nBut I am afraid we are in a mood, and the bill is moving, and we will \njust move it through and people will forget those people back home in \nHaleyville. But I am not forgetting them.\n  I believe they have a legitimate request to make of their government \nto adhere to the true principles of GSP--that they don't get to import \ntextiles into the United States if there is a domestic manufacturer \nthat would be adversely affected. They can import, but they have to pay \nthe 9-percent tariff that other countries pay on textiles.\n  So I am afraid what is happening in Haleyville, sadly, is a symbol of \nour broken system. This trade loophole contradicts GSP principles. I \nbelieve it is indefensible. It is a benefit to China\n\n[[Page S5717]]\n\npaid for directly by American workers. It just is. This company in \nAlabama pays taxes, obeys the regulations, plays by the rules, and they \nask for nothing more than a fair shake. But how do our laws reward \nthem? Out of the blue, they find they have competition from a foreign \nimport. So we give Bangladesh the ability to skip all the taxes other \nimporters pay, and primarily to the benefit of a Chinese company so \nthey can undersell the plant in Alabama.\n  What happened to the President's pledge of just last week when he \nsaid he wanted to make sure more products are stamped with three words: \n``Made in America?'' The GSP is supposed to exclude benefits to \nAmerican-made textiles and import-sensitive products. Yet through a \nloophole and a ruling by the USTR, sleeping bags are not even \nconsidered a textile. If sleeping bags are not a textile, what are \nthey? They are not food, they are not a water pump, they are not a \npiece of machinery, they are not a bench. They are made of fabric and \nfibers. They are clearly a textile. For this reason, some sections of \nthe United States Code--including the Berry amendment--designates \nsleeping bags as textiles explicitly. It makes no sense for the \ngovernment to recognize sleeping bags as textiles under some sections \nbut not others. So all I am proposing is to bring uniformity to the law \nand following the intent of the GSP as initially passed.\n  The fast-growing exports from Bangladesh are threatening American \nsleeping bags throughout the United States. It is an industry that has \ngrown throughout the United States. Exxel Outdoors--really a California \ncompany--employs nearly 100 people in a county with unemployment at 12 \npercent. But already Exxel has seen a 20-percent decrease in its sales. \nIf the appropriate changes are not made, this factory will close and \n100 American workers in Alabama will lose their jobs, and others around \nthe country will lose their jobs.\n  Let me tell you a little more about Exxel. They came under new \nownership in 2000. The new owner had planned to close the factory and \nsend the jobs to Mexico to try to build a plant in Mexico. Instead, he \nrealized the competitiveness of being in Alabama at this plant. He met \nand liked the people in Haleyville. They surprised him. He thought he \nwould try it, he would give it a shot. He brought jobs back from Mexico \nand China. Since then they have prospered, creating quality sleeping \nbags right here in the United States.\n  Exxel uses suppliers in New York State, New Jersey, North Carolina, \nTennessee, and Mississippi. This is how a manufacturing system works in \na country such as the United States. It has ripple effects far beyond \nwhat some people might think.\n  I met one of the great industrialists in Germany recently who is \ninvesting in Alabama. He told me we have to have a Renaissance in \nmanufacturing in the industrialized first world, and he was very \nsincere about this. He is a highly intelligent, accomplished man.\n  As you can see from this map, this little plant in Alabama is \nsupporting people in Mississippi; Cullman, AL; Atlanta, GA; Volunteer \nThread in Nashville; Wiggy's in Clinton, TN. They make sleeping bags. I \nhave a letter from them saying their business will be threatened too. \nMartex Fiber in Spartanburg; Consolidated Fibers in Charlotte; Royal \nSlide in New Jersey; Polartec in Lawrence, MA; Pennsylvania, New York, \nVermont, Colorado, and California. So these things have ramifications.\n  Indeed, recently, by chance, I was talking to a person with deep \nexperience in the textile industry, and he told me they are becoming \nmore competitive. He says we are actually gaining back jobs from \nabroad. That is exactly what was happening here. This man gambled. He \nbet on the United States. He didn't know they would figure out a way to \ngo to Bangladesh and undercut him.\n  So this carve-out created for Czechoslovakia, discovered and used by \na Chinese company, is creating jobs abroad and not in the United \nStates. So the proposed fix I have suggested is not some sort of \ncorporate welfare. It would not lower taxes for any business. Indeed, \nit would ensure we collect a little tariff duty on products coming in \nfrom Bangladesh. They can ship them in, but they have to pay the normal \ntariff of 9 percent on imported textiles. It would not add one cent to \nthe deficit of the United States. It would give no loan guarantees, no \nsubsidies, no handouts. The fix simply declares sleeping bags are what \nthey are--textiles--and subject to the rules of textiles under GSP. \nReally, it would ensure Exxel and other companies in the United States \nhave the same competitive position they had before this plant was moved \nto Bangladesh.\n  Some are calling this an earmark. I don't believe that is true or \nfair to say. Earmarks give direct financial benefit to an entity \nthrough tax benefits or government grants. This is not a grant. It does \nnot eliminate tariffs so Exxel will pay less taxes. It doesn't give a \ndirect benefit to Exxel. It does not cost the United States one cent. \nIt eliminates an unfair earmark that already allows a Chinese-run \ncompany to purchase raw materials worldwide, manufacture sleeping bags \nat a Bangladesh factory, and then import them into the United States \nduty free.\n  I repeat: I am trying to strip an earmark. I am trying to actually \nstrip an earmark for China from the bill that is before us. I am asking \nthat we uphold the values and rules we have put into law. I don't know \nhow this was changed after Congress passed it in 1974, stating if you \nimport textiles you have to pay a tariff unless there is no domestic \nmanufacturer of that textile against whom you are competing. How that \ngot changed, I am not sure.\n  So I ask that we eliminate the special benefit that has been provided \nto this country and this one textile.\n  Exxel is just one company that is currently being hammered by this \nunfair loophole. They are indeed in financial threat. They were \nsupplying 30 percent of the sleeping bags in the United States. They \nsaw a decline of 20 percent already in that product.\n  Mr. President, I will offer for the Record letters written by other \nbusinesses in support of Exxel's efforts.\n  Stein Fibers of Charlotte says:\n\n       Exxel Outdoors has been a solid customer of Stein Fibers, \n     Ltd for many years. We supply synthetic fiberfill for \n     sleeping bags made at their Haleyville, Alabama factory.\n\n  Wiggy's Inc. says:\n\n       Bangladesh recently entered the U.S. market and supplied \n     over 700,000 sleeping bags last year.\n\n  Wiggy's makes sleeping bags in Grand Junction, CO. They have copied \ntheir Senators, and they ask that we support my effort.\n  Rusken corrugated containers in Cullman, AL, supplies the shipping \npackages for these products as they are shipped.\n  Dunlap Industries in Chattanooga, TN, says they are one of the \nlargest suppliers of thread in the United States, and Exxel is a \ncustomer of theirs.\n  Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation in Tupelo, MS, is also a supplier \nof Exxel.\n  Royal Slide Sales Company, Inc., of Garfield, NJ, says:\n\n       As Royal Slide provides sleeping bag carry cases to Exxel's \n     Haleyville, Alabama factory, the resulting decrease in their \n     business from this surge in duty-free importation of \n     synthetic fill sleeping bags is directly leading to a \n     decrease in our business.\n\n  They support reform.\n  Martex Fiber says:\n\n       We are a major supplier of fiberfill to Exxel Outdoors. We \n     have been proud to watch one of the last--\n\n  Listen to this--\n\n       We have been proud to watch one of the last remaining \n     American sleeping bag factories keep going steadily, even as \n     virtually all its competitors moved their facilities to other \n     countries.\n\n  They go on to say that Exxel is entitled to relief.\n  Consolidated Fibers of Charlotte, NC, says:\n\n       The impact on our company will be great if the Exxel \n     Outdoors factory is forced out of business by these foreign \n     imports without duty. We supply a great deal of fiberfill to \n     Exxel on an ongoing basis.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Stein Fibers, LTD.,\n\n                                  Charlotte, NC, February 5, 2010.\n     Re Comments--Exxel Outdoors petition, GSP, sleeping bags, \n         HTSUS #9404 30.80, Docket #USTR-2010-0004.\n\n       Secretary, United States International Trade Commission: \n     Exxel Outdoors has been\n\n[[Page S5718]]\n\n     a solid customer of Stein Fibers, LTD for many years. We \n     supply synthetic fiberfill for the sleeping bags made at \n     their Haleyville, Alabama factory.\n       We are writing in support of withdrawing from GSP, the \n     sleeping bags coming in duty free to the United States under \n     HTSUS 9404.30.80. With duty free status, the importers of \n     these bags are taking away significant business from Exxel \n     Outdoor, which in turn will hurt our business.\n       If these sleeping bags continue to get duty free treatment \n     under GSP, before long Exxel's factory will be forced to \n     close down. In 2009 Exxel Outdoor accounted for $407,985.80 \n     of our revenue, which would be of significant loss to our \n     company.\n       If you would like to discuss this with me, please contact \n     me at your convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Randy Layman,\n     Stein Fibers, LTD.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Wiggy's Inc.,\n\n                                 Grand Junction, CO, May 24, 2011.\n     Hon. Ron Kirk,\n     U.S. Trade Representative, Executive Office of the President, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ambassador Kirk: I understand that the Administration \n     will decide soon on the petition filed by Exxel Outdoors \n     (USTR-2010-0017) and determine if sleeping bags should be \n     duty-free under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), \n     assuming that Congress re-authorizes that program. I am \n     writing to urge you to recommend that imports of sleeping \n     bags from all countries remain subject to the normal U.S. \n     duty-rate of 9 percent. If non-down sleeping bags from low-\n     wage countries like Bangladesh are duty-free, it will pose a \n     great threat to the remaining U.S. sleeping bag producers \n     such as Wiggy's.\n       Until recently China was the only meaningful foreign \n     competitor in the U.S. sleeping bag market. Imports from \n     China are, and always have been subject to the normal duty \n     rate for sleeping bags. This has enabled some U.S. \n     manufactures such as Wiggy's to remain competitive with \n     foreign suppliers. However, Bangladesh recently entered the \n     U.S. market and supplied over 700,000 sleeping bags last \n     year.\n       With rising costs in China and other global dynamics, \n     Bangladesh is the world's low-cost manufacturer of textile \n     products such as sleeping bags. Manufacturers in Bangladesh \n     are ramping up production of sleeping bags and will continue \n     to do so, just as they are with other textile products. There \n     is little doubt that over the next few years Bangladesh will \n     take a sizable share of the U.S. market presently filled by \n     China. The only remaining question is: Will Bangladesh also \n     capture the market share presently serviced the U.S. \n     manufacturers? The answer to that question will be determined \n     by the decision you are about to make the petition filed by \n     Exxel Outdoors.\n       U.S. manufacturers can compete if the trade laws are fair \n     and equitable. It is grossly unfair that Bangladesh can \n     import fabrics, fiber fill and other materials duty-free from \n     China, assemble them into sleeping bags, and export the \n     finished product duty-free to the U.S., even though the vast \n     majority of those sleeping bag inputs are products of China. \n     Conversely, U.S. manufacturers must pay duty on any of the \n     components we import to produce sleeping bags.\n       I trust you will recognize this injustice, and agree that \n     GSP is not supposed to harm or threaten U.S. manufacturing. \n     Please grant Exxel Outdoors' request to remove non-down \n     sleeping bags from GSP.\n           Sincerely.\n                                                    Jerry Wigutow,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Rusken Packaging, Inc.,\n\n                                    Cullman, AL, February 3, 2010.\n     Re Docket # USTR-2010-0004, Exxel Outdoors Petition on \n         Sleeping Bags, HTSUS \n         # 9404.30.80.\n\n       Secretary, United States International Trade Commission: \n     Rusken Packaging has enjoyed a long time relationship with \n     Exxel Outdoors, supplying them with shipping cartons for \n     their sleeping bags. Exxel is a stellar example of the \n     quality work ethic that we have here in Alabama.\n       We wholeheartedly support Exxel in their petition to \n     withdraw synthetic-filled sleeping bags from the GSP. We \n     believe this creates unfair competition for Exxel's American-\n     made product This Is not only harming Excel, it is hurting \n     the American companies that Exxel sources from, such as \n     Rusken Packaging.\n       For the good of many American businesses, please remove \n     these sleeping bags from the GSP.\n       If you would like anything additional from me, I will be \n     glad to make myself available to you.\n           Warm regards,\n                                                    John Giatinna,\n     Rusken Packaging, Inc.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                February 10, 2010.\n     Re Docket USTR-2010-0004--Exxel Outdoors Petition on GSP, \n         HTSUS # 9404.30.80.\n\n       Secretary, United States International Trade Commission: As \n     one of the largest suppliers of thread in the United States, \n     U.S. Thread is in strong favor of the petition to remove \n     synthetic fill sleeping bags from the GSP--the same type of \n     bags that are cut and sewn at the Exxel Outdoors factory in \n     Alabama.\n       This special duty-free treatment for sleeping bag imports \n     from other countries could very well force Exxel to shut down \n     their Alabama factory. This would negatively impact U.S. \n     Thread's business to a great extent, and many communities \n     throughout the Southeast United States.\n       We can ill afford to lose a significant customer like Exxel \n     Outdoors. The loss of Exxel Outdoors would devastate the \n     community of Graysville, TN by adding to already astronomical \n     unemployment rate in this area. We have been supplying Exxel \n     Outdoors with all of their sewing thread for many years, and \n     if Exxel were forced to close their doors due to, what we \n     believe, would be an extremely unfair trade agreement, an \n     already economically depressed area would experience the loss \n     of an additional 200 jobs, and a revenue loss to U.S. Thread \n     of $500,000 per year.\n       U.S. Thread has already lost far too many textile and \n     apparel customers to foreign competition. Evidence of this is \n     the fact that In 2000 our active employee number was 80. In \n     2010, that number has been reduced to just 25. We can \n     factually attribute this directly to foreign, absurdly low \n     cost labor, arid back room trade deals.\n       Thank you for this opportunity to express our support on \n     this important matter. Please do not hesitate to contact me \n     if you have any questions or would like further comment.\n\n                                                 Robbie Owens,\n\n                                  Director of Sales and Marketing,\n     U.S. Thread/Dunlap Industries, Inc.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Smurfit-Stone\n\n\n                                        Container Corporation,\n\n                                     Tupelo, MS, February 5, 2010.\n     Re Docket--USTR-2010-0004, Exxel Outdoors Petition, HTSUS \n         #9404.30.80.\n\n       Secretary, United States International Trade Commission: \n     Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation strongly supports the \n     petition by Exxel Outdoors to remove synthetic-filled \n     sleeping bags from the list of duty-free imports in the GSP.\n       The duty-free importing of these sleeping bags is giving \n     foreign countries an unjustifiable price advantage over \n     Exxel's product, hurting their sales.\n       As a result, Smurfit-Stone directly loses business from \n     Exxel. We supply Exxel Outdoors with hundreds of thousands \n     shipping cartons per year, but this will continue to \n     significantly decrease as the duty-free foreign imports \n     continue.\n       In the event Exxel were to close is facilities in Alabama, \n     the impact to Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation would be a \n     loss of approximately $500,000 in packaging revenue, which \n     would in turn affect more than 200 Mississippi workers.\n       We greatly appreciate this opportunity to share our views \n     with you. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you would \n     like anything further from us.\n           With thanks,\n                                                    Danny Kennedy,\n     Smurfit Stone Container Corporation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Royal Slide Sales Co., Inc.,\n\n                                   Garfield, NJ, February 5, 2010.\n     Re Docket #--USTR-2010-0004, Petition regarding GSP treatment \n         of HTSUS #9404.30.80.\n       Secretary, United States International Trade Commission: \n     Royal Slide Sales Company respectfully agrees with the \n     petition of Exxel Outdoors, requesting that you withdrawal \n     certain sleeping bags from the GSP list of products.\n       As Royal Slide provides sleeping bag carry cases to Exxel's \n     Haleyville, Alabama factory, the resulting decrease in their \n     business from this surge in duty-free importation of \n     synthetic fill sleeping bags, is directly leading to a \n     decrease in our business.\n       We do not object to imports generally. To the contrary, \n     Royal Slide imports many of our products. But when imports of \n     a finished product directly threaten a U.S. manufacturer, at \n     minimum imports should be assessed the normal duty-rate.\n       The duty-free imports are giving them what we see as a \n     large, unjustified price advantage over Exxel, and we request \n     that you rule to remove the imports from the GSP.\n       Should I be able to assist you further with your inquiry \n     into this issue with any additional information, please to \n     not hesitate to contact me at the number or email provided \n     below.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Lew Neuman,\n     Royal Slide Sales Company.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Martex Fiber,\n\n                                                 February 4, 2010.\n     Re Exxel Outdoors GSP Petition on HTSUS 9404.30.80, Docket # \n         USTR-2010-0004.\n\n       Secretary, United States International Trade Commission: \n     Martex Fiber Southern Corporation is submitting this letter \n     to urge that you remove the synthetic-filled sleeping bags \n     from GSP, as Exxel Outdoors' petition requests.\n       We are a major supplier of fiberfill to Exxel Outdoors. We \n     have been proud to watch one of the last remaining American \n     sleeping bag factories keep going steadily, even as virtually \n     all its competitors moved their facilities to other \n     countries.\n       As importers are now bringing in duty-free sleeping bags, \n     this is taking away Exxel's ability to compete in its \n     industry. As Exxel Outdoors loses this business, so does \n     Martex Fiber.\n       The U.S. textile industry has already suffered enough. \n     Given the tow wages and other advantages companies operating \n     in foreign countries have, it is only fair that importers of \n     sleeping bags pay the normal duty rate of 9%.\n\n[[Page S5719]]\n\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me If you would like any \n     additional from me on this.\n           Very best,\n                                                    Jimmy Jarrett,\n     President, Martex Fiber Southern Corporation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Consolidated Fibers,\n\n                                  Charlotte, NC, February 5, 2010.\n     Re Docket USTR-2010-0004, Petition by Exxel Outdoors On \n         Sleeping Bags HTSUS #9404.30.80.\n\n       Secretary, United States International Trade Commission: We \n     at Consolidated Fibers support without hesitation, the \n     petition by Exxel Outdoors to remove synthetic fiberfill \n     sleeping bags (HTSUS #9404 30.80) from the GSP duty-free \n     treatment.\n       The impact on our company will be great if the Exxel \n     Outdoors factory is forced out of business by these foreign \n     imports without duty. We supply a great deal of fiberfill to \n     Exxel on an ongoing basis.\n       The closure of this factory would weigh negatively on our \n     revenues and our staff.\n       America cannot afford to lose any more good jobs because of \n     a duty-free advantage given to products from another country. \n     Especially in the Exxel's area of the country where the \n     unemployment rate is nearing 18%.\n       I will be happy to make myself available to you for \n     discussion, or to answer any questions you may have.

A small change \nwill prevent an unfair benefit from accruing to a Chinese company and \nwill prevent more Americans from losing their jobs. This will ensure \nthat trade is free and principled and plentiful.\n  Senator Baucus and I have talked about this, and he has looked at me \nsadly and listened patiently. But we are down at the licklog, and no \nrelief has been obtained, and that is why I am here today.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Remembering Senator Charles Percy\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share a few thoughts on \nthe passing of Senator Chuck Percy.\n  Among other things he did in his remarkable life--successful in \nbusiness and politics--he had a connection to Mobile, AL, my hometown. \nI believe he was born in Pensacola, FL, and was connected to Thomas \nHord Herndon, who was a Congressman from Alabama and resided in Mobile \nand was well known. I am a distant descendent of Congressman Herndon, \nand I can always remember, as a young person, particularly my great-\naunts talking about him. They followed his career, and I began to \nfollow his career. Maybe it was a factor in my becoming a Republican at \na time in Alabama when most were not. He was successful and young and \nvibrant and created a great image for public service, and it filtered \ndown to this young guy in rural Alabama in a positive way.\n  So I would just say, Senator Rockefeller, we have lost a great \nAmerican. He had a tremendously successful career in business and \npolitics. He was a man of integrity and drive and commitment and good \nspirit. I think we are wise in this body to pause a moment and to be \nappreciative and to remember people who serve their country in that \nfashion.\n  My sympathies are with the Percy family and the Rockefeller family.\n  I yield the floor.\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask the Record to reflect that if \nI would have been present for today's vote, I would have voted to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2832, to extend the \nGeneralized System of Preferences.\n  I would like to express my continued support for the extension of the \nGeneralized System of Preferences, GSP. As the GSP expired on December \n31, 2010, I am quite happy to see the Senate finally poised to take up \nthis much overdue extension of this valuable trade program.\n  I am also hopeful that this process will finally lead to quick \nconsideration of our pending trade agreements with Colombia, Panama, \nand South Korea.\n  These agreements are long past due. Unfortunately, they have been \ndelayed because the President has made it clear that his most important \ntrade priority is to spend more money on a domestic worker retraining \nprogram of dubious effectiveness. He has also made it clear that, \nunless Congress accedes to his demands, he will never submit these job \ncreating trade agreements to Congress. It is a travesty that the \nPresident cares more about spending money than creating jobs.\n  Yet now that we have this trade vehicle on the floor, I am hopeful we \ncan find a way to allow a full and fair debate on TAA--and in doing so, \nfinally remove what we hope is the last obstacle in front of these \nthree free trade agreements.\n  The GSP bill itself is important to our economy. The 2-year extension \nof GSP will provide greater certainty for both U.S. businesses and \ndeveloping country exporters who are able to utilize the benefits of \nthe program. The program has secured strong bipartisan support for over \nthree decades, and I only expect this trend to continue.\n  The GSP allows for nonreciprocal, duty-free tariff treatment of \ncertain products from designated developing countries. In fact, some of \nthe top GSP beneficiary developing countries in 2010 were Angola, \nIndonesia, Equatorial Guinea, South Africa, the Philippines, and \nTurkey. In order to be designated as a beneficiary country, nations \nmust adhere to an extensive criteria list. In turn, GSP is not only a \ntrade program, but can also be seen as one of our effective foreign \npolicy tools.\n  For starters, beneficiary countries must protect intellectual \nproperty rights, recognize workers' rights, commit to the elimination \nof child labor, and prevent the seizure of property belonging to U.S. \ncitizens or businesses.\n  GSP continues to promote trade, rather than aid, to nations that are \nadvancing their economic development; it has worked to stimulate U.S. \nexports in these markets; and encourages the elimination of trade \nbarriers in developing countries.\n  What does this mean for the United States? This means our Nation not \nonly has an opportunity to assist developing countries to promote \neconomic growth in their nations, but we also have an opportunity for \nour American businesses to thrive, while lowering costs for American \nconsumers. Across our Nation, U.S. manufacturers and importers benefit \nby receiving goods and raw materials at a lower cost. According to the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, approximately three-quarters of U.S. imports \nthat rely on the GSP program, use raw materials, parts and components, \nor machinery and equipment, to manufacture goods in the U.S. for \ndomestic consumption or for export.\n  So, although the GSP program was initially created to assist with \neconomic growth in the developing world, it now provides great \nassistance to our businesses here in the United States.\n  In 2010 the United States imported $23 billion in GSP-eligible goods \nfrom 129 countries around the world. This includes 4,800 eligible \nproducts. And, according to the Office of the United States Trade \nRepresentative, GSP saved American importers $682 million in duties in \n2010. These numbers cannot be overlooked--they represent millions of \ndollars in savings for our manufacturers, retailers, farmers and \nfamilies. GSP is particularly helpful for our small businesses. The \nsavings on duties by these small businesses allows them to compete with \nlarger companies.\n  During these uncertain and challenging economic times, we must give \nour businesses the necessary tools to compete not only in the global \nmarket, but also here at home. Unfortunately, the 9 months that the \nprogram has not been operational has negatively affected the \ncompetitiveness of thousands of American businesses that rely on duty-\nexemptions. For these companies, GSP is an integral component of their \nbusiness model.\n  In fact, according to the Coalition for GSP, from December 31, 2010, \nwhen the\n\n[[Page S5720]]\n\nGSP program expired, U.S. companies have paid an additional $1.8 \nmillion a day in new duties. To date, this amounts to nearly $480 \nmillion in unnecessary additional costs for companies. Businesses in \nevery state in the Nation have been affected by the expiration of GSP \nand have a vested interest in the renewal of the program.\n  For example, in my State of Utah--the only State in the country to \nimport Indonesian steam and vapor turbine parts--tariffs have exceeded \n$235,000 for these goods in the months following the expiration of GSP. \nComponents such as mountings for buildings imported from Thailand, cost \nUtah businesses an additional $178,000 in tariffs through July of this \nyear. And the total amount of Utah imports of GSP-eligible goods from \nJanuary until July 2011 exceeded $26.2 million, of which an additional \n$1.1 million in unnecessary import taxes were paid.\n  I have heard from Utah manufacturing companies, like Black Diamond \nEquipment, which is headquartered in Salt Lake City and employs more \nthan 475 people worldwide. That company develops, manufactures and \ndistributes a broad range of products including those used for mountain \nclimbing, camping, and skiing. As of June 2010, they incurred more than \n$40,000 in tariffs for goods imported from the Philippines--goods that \notherwise would have been covered under GSP.\n  If GSP is not renewed, Black Diamond is projected to pay over \n$100,000 in unnecessary tariffs by the end of the year. As if that was \nnot enough, because of these duties, Black Diamond is faced with \nreduced sales, competitiveness issues, and a limited hiring ability for \ntheir Utah office. To help companies like Black Diamond succeed, we \nmust act now to renew GSP.\n  I have shared just a few examples of the additional costs incurred by \nbusinesses in my State, and unfortunately, there are many other similar \nscenarios across the Nation due to the expiration of GSP.\n  These Utah companies and other businesses around the country are left \nwith difficult decisions about downsizing, hiring freezes, and employee \nlayoffs--this at a time when our economy needs more than ever to be \nadding jobs. We must lift this additional burden on our small \nbusinesses, manufacturers, and farmers, by renewing GSP today, and \nmaking sure we provide retroactive application.\n  I urge my colleagues to come together and extend the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences until July 31, 2013, and provide the much-needed \nretroactive benefits to our U.S. companies.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a hero. I rise to \nremember the sacrifice of a man I am proud to have known. I rise to \nremember SGT Joe Szczerba of the New Castle County Police who was \nkilled in the line of duty just this past Thursday night.\n  Sergeant Szczerba and several other officers responded to a \ndisorderly conduct call in New Castle, DE, just before midnight. The \nofficers arrived on the scene and set up a perimeter. Sergeant Szczerba \nspotted the suspect and gave chase. A seasoned officer, Sergeant \nSzczerba attempted to subdue the man, and in a very tough fight that \nensued he was stabbed.\n\n  The suspect continued to resist arrest. Although seriously wounded, \nSergeant Szczerba worked with three other officers to take the suspect \ninto custody. Only then did he acknowledge his injury. Officers on the \nscene performed CPR until county paramedics arrived, but it was not \nenough. Sergeant Szczerba did not make it.\n  When I was county executive for New Castle County for 6 years, after \na particularly long or difficult day, as I was heading home, I would \nflip on the police scanner in my car and listen to the chatter, to the \ncalls from dispatch and the officers responding. I was always mindful \nin those hours that here I was heading home to my family and safety and \nhere were our officers heading out on patrol into a dark and uncertain \nnight.\n  My phone rang at 5 a.m. this past Friday morning, and it was my \nfriend, Chief Mike McGowan, the county's police chief--his voice \nweighted down with grief. It was the worst news I have ever received in \npublic life.\n  New Castle County had only lost one previous officer in a line-of-\nduty death when CPL Paul Sweeney was in a traffic accident nearly 40 \nyears ago in 1972, but never had an officer been murdered in the line \nof duty. Each year, as county executive, when I attended our annual \npolice memorial, we would quietly pray that we would never know this \nday.\n\n[[Page S5721]]\n\n  Just roughly 2 weeks earlier, Delaware had marked the second \nanniversary of the killing, in the line of duty, of another brave and \ndecorated local police officer, Patrolman Chad Spicer of Georgetown. It \nwas just too soon for this to have happened again. We all know there is \nrisk--grave risk--in policing, but this could not have happened again. \nDelaware is a State of neighbors, and as a State we are still mourning \nChad's death, and we could not possibly have lost another brave police \nofficer. But we did. This Friday he will be laid to rest.\n  My State is grieving. In the days that have passed, I have grappled \nwith two questions. I have asked myself over and over: How is it that \npeople continue to do these terrible and dangerous things? How is it \nthat senseless violence continues to claim the lives of the innocent?\n  As I spoke at the graduation ceremony this past Friday for the \nDelaware State Police and the Municipal Police Academy and looked at \nthe young men and women who were right in front of me about to take \ntheir oath and put on their badge and take on, willingly, this most \ndangerous and honored profession, another question emerged to me: Why \nis it that we continue to have men and women who volunteer, who step \nforward, and who take on this most important and difficult task of \npreserving the peace, of protecting our communities? What more can we \ndo to support them, to protect them, and to honor them?\n  These are the questions I challenge all of us to consider.\n  SGT Joe Szczerba was on the New Castle County police force for 18 \nyears. He was greatly respected by his colleagues on the force and in \nthe community he served. His wife Kathy; his brothers Ed, Gerald, and \nStephen; his sisters Nancy and Karen and a host of nieces and nephews \nsurvive him.\n  Today, Heaven is a safer place because Joe Szczerba is on patrol. He \nwas a good man and a great cop, and he died a hero. He died doing what \nhe was called to do, and he died doing what he loved to do. For that, \nall of Delaware is grateful. We will treasure his memory and honor his \nsacrifice.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, recently, international media and diplomatic \nattention has focused on the inspiring stories of citizens across the \nMiddle East and North Africa demanding greater participation in their \ngovernment.\n  While the regime changes in Libya, Egypt, and Tunisia have certainly \nopened the door for democratic progress in a region long dominated by \nauthoritarian rulers, we cannot allow these hopeful aspirations to \nmonopolize our focus or distract our attention from the fact that \nbrutal and oppressive regimes remain.\n  Today, I want to highlight an especially dangerous and odious \nregime--that of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the mullahs \nin Tehran.\n  I am seriously concerned by Tehran's continued march toward a nuclear \nweapon. Earlier this month the International Atomic Energy Agency, \nIAEA, published a report confirming the obvious--that Iran remains in \nviolation of United Nations Security Council resolutions to halt its \nnuclear program, and that it is not cooperating with the IAEA.\n  We also know that the Iranian regime continues to increase its \nsupport for terrorist groups operating in Iraq; reports also indicate \nthat it is providing weapons and assistance to the Assad regime in \nDamascus in its brutal crackdown on the Syrian people.\n  Iranian authorities, apparently fearful of the popular unrest that \nswept longtime leaders in Egypt and Tunisia from power--and which is \ncurrently threatening Bashar al-Assad's dictatorship in Syria--have \ncracked down on dissent and increased the arrest and detention of \nactivists and opposition figures in the past months--even arresting \nyoung people with squirt guns.\n  One dissident whose case I have been following is Bahareh Hedayat, a \nstudent and women's rights activist. Bahareh was arrested in December \n2009 for participating in Iran's prodemocracy student movement and \nplaced in solitary confinement in the notorious Evin prison. After \nnearly 2 months of interrogation, she was sentenced to 9\\1/2\\ years in \nprison for her activism. Her 9\\1/2\\ year sentence included 5 years for \n``activities against the state,'' 2 years for insulting Supreme Leader \nKhamenei, and 6 months for insulting Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Iranian \nauthorities also reinstated a 2-year sentence she received in \nconnection with a 2006 women's rights protest that had been suspended.\n  While in prison, Bahareh has endured Evin's harsh conditions, \ninterrogation, and a lengthy solitary confinement, all while being \ndenied contact with her husband and family. She has kept her spirit and \nhas even protested her detention and treatment with hunger strikes. \nHowever, detention has taken a toll on her and her health has \ndeteriorated. Earlier this year she developed gall stones, and while it \nwas clear that the prison's facilities could not provide adequate \ntreatment, she was only allowed to seek outside care this month. After \nreceiving treatment, she was promptly returned to prison last week.\n  Bahareh Hedayat and dissidents like her--those who have been brutally \npunished for seeking basic human freedoms--has shown great courage in \nconfronting the brutality and intolerance of the Iranian regime. She \nand thousands of others have sacrificed immeasurably to bring about \nreform in Iran, the United States must show similar courage and do all \nin its power to support their vision of a peaceful, free, and \ndemocratic Iran.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/19/senate-section/article/S5721-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5721-S5722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n             Private First Class Arick Michael Dobson Tarr\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN.

He was preparing to leave in January to return to New \nHampshire.\n  Americans across the country gathered recently to commemorate the \ntenth anniversary of September 11, 2001, and to reflect on how the \ntragic events of that day changed our Nation and all Americans on a \npersonal level. Although Arick was only 10 years old at the time, his \nlife was forever changed by 9/11. That day sparked within him a desire \nto join the Army and defend the freedoms we hold dear.\n  Arick defended the American people with courage and distinction, \nreceiving many awards for his service, including the National Defense \nService Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze Service Star, \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas \nService Ribbon, NATO Medal, Combat Infantry Badge, Marksmanship \nQualification Badge, and Overseas Service Bar.\n  Arick is remembered by family and friends as having a larger than \nlife personality and a contagious smile. He understood the importance \nof family and was a role model for his two brothers and six cousins. \nAlthough Arick spent much of his life in South Portland, ME, he was \nvery excited to return to New Hampshire after his service, to attend \ncollege and begin a new chapter of his life with his fiancee.\n  Our Nation can never adequately thank this young hero for his \nwillingness to heed the call to defend the American people and our way \nof life. I hope that, even in these dark days, Arick's family can find \ncomfort in knowing that all Americans share a\n\n[[Page S5722]]\n\ndeep appreciation for his brave service and sacrifice.\n  Arick is survived by his fiance, Stefani Greco; his parents, Richard \nand Jennifer; and his two brothers, Tanner and Wyatt, all of \nLitchfield, NH.

Robert F.

As you know, \n     we objected to Mr. Eisen's nomination on the grounds that he \n     attempted to constructively remove the Inspector General (IG) \n     of the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS) \n     without the prior notice required by law and that he misled \n     Congressional investigators.\n       It is our concern that the President's decision to force \n     through such a nominee without the advice and consent of the \n     Senate signals a departure from his recent pledge to work \n     cooperatively with Congress.\n       The President announced Mr. Eisen's nomination on June 28, \n     2010. On September 27, 2010, Senator Grassley provided public \n     notice of his intention to object to the nomination. Senator \n     Grassley referred to ``Mr. Eisen's role in the firing of the \n     Inspector General of the Corporation for National and \n     Community Service and his lack of candor about that matter \n     when questioned by Congressional investigators.''\n       During that investigation, a bicameral group of \n     investigators learned Mr. Eisen personally delivered an \n     ultimatum to former CNCS IG Gerald Walpin demanding that he \n     resign or be terminated within one hour. At the time he \n     delivered the ultimatum, no notice had been provided to \n     Congress as is legally required by the Inspector General \n     Reform Act (IG Act). As you know, the IG Act requires the \n     President to communicate in writing the reasons for removal \n     of an IG to Congress not later than 30 days prior to taking \n     action.\n       During an interview on June 17, 2009, Mr. Eisen refused to \n     answer at least 12 direct questions. He did, however, assert \n     on that date that the CNCS Board of Directors unanimously \n     supported the removal of IG Walpin. He also asserted that the \n     White House conducted ``an extensive review'' in response to \n     concerns raised by the Board about 10 Walpin's fitness \n     following a May 20, 2009 CNCS Board meeting. According to Mr. \n     Eisen, his ``extensive review'' substantiated the Board's \n     concerns and informed the decision to remove IG Walpin.\n       Our investigation found that, contrary to Mr. Eisen's \n     assertions, the Board had not unanimously expressed a desire \n     to have Mr. Walpin removed prior to the decision. Moreover, \n     we could find no evidence that Mr. Eisen's ``extensive \n     review'' consisted of anything more than simply asking the \n     CNCS General Counsel to document the Chairman of the Board's \n     concerns about Mr. Walpin. Mr. Eisen did not interview the \n     CNCS Directors. He did not provide Mr. Walpin or anyone else \n     in the Office of Inspector General an opportunity to be \n     heard. He took action based on incomplete information \n     provided only by individuals who had adversarial \n     relationships with the IG.\n       Mr. Eisen has had several opportunities to address our \n     concerns and has yet to do so. He failed to be forthcoming \n     and responsive during his initial meeting with our staff on \n     June 17, 2009. He again demonstrated a lack of candor in \n     response to Questions for the Record following his nomination \n     hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on July \n     22, 2010.\n       In the interest of allowing Mr. Eisen to address our \n     concerns, we scheduled a meeting with our staff for December \n     16, 2010 at 11:30 A.M. At approximately 11:15 A.M., the White \n     House postponed the meeting until 2:15 P.M. At approximately \n     2:00 P.M., the meeting was canceled by the White House Office \n     of Legislative Affairs without further explanation. By \n     calling off a face-to-face meeting in favor of a recess \n     appointment, the White House sent the message that the \n     President is not interested in hearing the concerns of \n     Republican Members of Congress.\n       In short, Mr. Eisen took action on behalf of the President \n     that ran afoul of the IG Act and subsequently misled \n     Congressional investigators in lieu of conducting a fair, \n     thorough, and responsible investigation. Senate confirmation, \n     under the advice and consent clause, is one of the strongest \n     checks on executive power. Recess appointments are \n     meantatofill vacancies that arise during a long recess, not \n     to bypass the confirmation process. We are troubled by the \n     Administration's circumvention of that process, especially in \n     this instance. The vacancy arose on January 20, 2009, and yet \n     the President waited eighteen months before making an \n     appointment. Given that there had already been considerable \n     public controversy over Mr. Eisen's actions in this matter at \n     the time of his appointment, issues with his confirmation \n     should have been easily anticipated. For these reasons, we \n     believe that a recess appointment of Mr. Eisen to serve as a \n     United States Ambassador is particularly inappropriate.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important matter. We \n     look forward to working with the White House toward our \n     mutual goal of identifying and deploying qualified \n     individuals of the highest integrity to serve American \n     interests abroad.\n           Sincerely,\n     Darrell Issa,\n       Chairman, U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government \n     Reform.\n     Charles E. Grassley,\n       United States Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/19/senate-section/article/S5722-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5722-S5723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to join my fellow \nColoradans, my colleagues in the U.S. Congress, and others across the \ncountry to celebrate and acknowledge the many accomplishments and \ncontributions of the Hispanic community in the United States and \nespecially in Colorado. I have come to the floor on several occasions \nto highlight the long history of Latinos in Colorado. The community's \npresence in our State precedes its statehood and Hispanic heritage \ncontinues as a vibrant part of Colorado's cultural and social landscape \nevery month of the year. Today, I would like to specifically highlight \nthe contributions Colorado's Hispanic community have made and continue \nto make to Colorado's economy and to our current economic recovery.\n  More than 150 years ago, a gentleman by the name of Dario Gallegos \nestablished Colorado's longest running general store in San Luis, CO. \nThe store has served Colorado's oldest town consistently for well over \na century and today continues not just as an important fixture in the \nSan Luis Valley, but also as a part of Colorado's cultural heritage. \nThe efforts of entrepreneurs such as Mr. Gallegos and those who \nfollowed, serve as an example of the entrepreneurial spirit that drives \nColorado's Hispanic community to provide valuable services to their \ncommunities that enhance all Coloradan's quality of life. Today, \nHispanic-owned businesses of all sizes and type dot the Colorado \nlandscape in every part of our state, whether rural or urban. I am \nproud of the success these businesses have been able to find in \nColorado and equally proud that the Latino community continues to be a \nvibrant part of Colorado's cultural and social landscape.\n  Hispanic businesses are a driving force in both urban and rural \neconomic growth. Minority-owned businesses in the United States have \nincreased twice as fast as all other U.S. businesses, and in Colorado, \nthe number of Hispanic-owned firms increased by 40 percent from 2002 to \n2007. This increase in Hispanic-owned businesses in Colorado has \ncontinued since 2007 and has helped sustain our State economy as well \nas stimulate job growth across the entire State's population. Minority-\nowned businesses are especially important to Coloradans because they \nprovide jobs to Coloradans as well as valuable services that meet the \nneeds of Hispanic and non-Hispanic communities alike.\n  I was pleased that the Minority Business Development Agency and the \nU.S. Department of Commerce worked to establish the Denver Minority \nBusiness Center earlier this summer. This center shows the increased \ncommitment to\n\n[[Page S5723]]\n\nsupport minority-owned businesses in Colorado. The new Denver Minority \nBusiness Center will further promote the growth of minority-owned \nbusinesses in Colorado by ensuring they have the technical skills to \naccess contracting and financing opportunities they need to succeed.\n  Despite the tremendous potential and growth among minority firms, \nthey still face the challenges that all businesses are facing in a \ncapital constrained market. Also troubling is that research has shown \nthat these challenges can be heightened for minority-owned firms. For \ninstance, minority-owned firms are less likely to receive loans than \nnonminority-owned firms, making it more difficult for minority-owned \nfirms to secure the capital they need to establish themselves. This is \nwhy the Denver Minority Business Center will be a valuable asset to our \nentire State.\n  To help business owners start or grow their business, I introduced a \ncredit union lending bill that would responsibly lift the cap that \nlimits the amount of money credit unions can lend to small businesses. \nBy doing so, new loans can help open the doors to new businesses and \nthereby create more than 100,000 new jobs across the Nation in the \nfirst year. This is another example of how we can support Hispanic and \nnon-Hispanic businesses alike to continue to prosper. I understand that \nthere remains much to be accomplished and I am glad that Colorado's \nHispanic-owned businesses and workers are willing and ready to be part \nof the solution.\n  I am proud to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. As we celebrate the \nmany contributions of Colorado's Hispanic community to our State, I \nhope that we can draw attention to the need to cooperate so that we can \nfind shared solutions to create a stronger environment for all \nbusinesses to thrive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/19/senate-section/article/S5723-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       KOTA RADIO OF SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I recognize \na broadcasting pioneer in my home state of South Dakota. KOTA Radio is \ncelebrating its 75th anniversary this November and I would like to \ncommend the great work of the Duhamel family in building KOTA into a \nwell-respected and recognized broadcasting entity in western South \nDakota and parts of Wyoming, Nebraska, and Montana.\n  On November 26, 1936, Black Hills Broadcasting began radio operations \nas KOBH--Kall of the Black Hills--and began broadcasting from the \npenthouse of the Alex Johnson Hotel. The station became known as KOTA \nin 1945. Helen Duhamel purchased a minority interest in Black Hills \nBroadcasting in 1943, expanded her holdings in 1948, and by 1954 she \nhad purchased all remaining common stock and Duhamel Enterprises was \nformed. She helped pave the way for women in South Dakota business and \nwas one of the first women in the Nation to have such an integral role \nin the broadcasting business.\n  Over the years, many members of the Duhamel family were intimately \ninvolved in the day-to-day operations of KOTA and Duhamel Enterprises. \nHelen continued to serve as president and general manager of the \nstation until 1976, when her son William F. Duhamel took over both \npositions. Bill Duhamel has served amiably and with the highest degree \nof professionalism and dedication for the past 35 years and shows no \nsigns of slowing down. Bill grew up at his mother's side around the \nstation learning the broadcasting and journalism professions, and he \npassed on that passion to his daughter Helene, who serves as a \ntelevision anchor at the station, and other family members over the \nyears who have been integrally involved in the family businesses.\n  As part of their celebration this year, Duhamel Enterprises has \nbroadcast a daily reflection, going back to the same day in 1936 and \nproviding listeners with recollections of local, state and national \nnews items from that year. They are transferred in time and are \nreminded of local businesses, some that have long since shuttered while \nothers remain vibrant and strong to this day. They are reminded of the \ncost of a gallon of milk or loaf of bread. The stories have rekindled \ngreat memories for listeners of all ages.\n  KOTA and Duhamel Broadcasting has won numerous awards for their \nbroadcasting and journalistic excellence over the years. The Duhamel \nfamily and their family of employees have been very involved as well in \ncommunity activities, most notably the KOTA Care and Share Food Drive, \nwhich has been organizing massive food and monetary donation drives to \nhelp feed the area's hungry for the past 27 years.\n  Over the years, Duhamel Enterprises has expanded broadcasting \ncoverage to include the eastern half of Wyoming and the northwestern \nportion of Nebraska. The radio and broadcasting professionals at KOTA \nhave been well-recognized and awarded for their excellence and many of \nthe KOTA broadcasters were journalistic pioneers who helped foster and \nproduce styles of news gathering and presentation styles envied by many \nyoung broadcasters.\n  I congratulate KOTA Radio and Duhamel Enterprises as well as Bill \nDuhamel, members of the Duhamel family and their broadcasting family on \nthe occasion of the station's 75th anniversary, as well as their \nnumerous contributions to the Rapid City and Black Hills communities \nthrough journalistic and broadcasting excellence as well as their \ncommunity presence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/19/senate-section/article/S5723-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RAPID CITY HARNEY LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize and congratulate the Rapid City Harney All-Star Little League \nfor their impressive teamwork and sportsmanship.\n  In the past 4 years, 2 other South Dakotan teams have earned their \nway into the Little League World Series. Like the teams that have gone \nbefore them, I believe the Harney All-Stars stand as strong examples of \nthe very best this sport has to offer. These dedicated young athletes \nworked together as a team and exhibited the kind of sportsmanship that \ncan serve as a model for every American, including professional \nathletes playing in the major leagues, to emulate. There is no doubt in \nmy mind these young athletes played to the best of their abilities and \ntruly had both the hearts and their heads in the game.\n  I offer my sincere appreciation to all of this year's exceptional \nteam members: Tristan Deming, Justin Kraemer, Riley McSherry, Seth \nBrewer, Zach Solano, Cameron Fees, Madden Pikula, Erik Petry, Timmy \nParis, Kyle Maguire, Hayden McGriff and Brett Beyer. I would also like \nto acknowledge Coach Kasey McGriff, who helped lead the Harney team to \nthe Little League World Series.\n  These young people represented Rapid City and the State of South \nDakota in an extraordinary fashion. While the final outcome of the \nLittle League World Series was not what these young athletes had hoped \nfor, their hard work and sportsmanship well represent the very best of \nSouth Dakota's values.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/19/senate-section/article/S5723-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5723-S5724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO STAFF SERGEANT RAVEN S. TAYLOR\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I speak today in honor of one of \nour Nation's finest, a member of the U.S. Air Force. I am pleased to \nannounce that Raven S. Taylor was selected as one of 12 airmen who \nearned the award of Outstanding Airman of the Year, and I am proud to \nnote that Raven earned this distinction while serving in the rank of \nsenior airman at Eielson Air Force Base, AK. She has since been \npromoted to staff sergeant. This is an auspicious occasion and no small \nfeat considering the 12 airmen were selected from an eligible pool of \nover 288,000 for their superior leadership, job performance, and \npersonal achievement.\n  Raven is a native of Waycross, GA. She graduated with honors from \nPrince County High School and enlisted in the Air Force in 2007. After \nbasic training and technical school as a aerospace medical technician, \nAlaska welcomed her to Eielson as her first duty assignment. Like many \nothers who come to our State, Raven felt right at home, thriving in her \njob at the hospital and making meaningful contributions to the \ncommunity. She oversaw some 650 preventive health assessments and \nsupervised the infection control program, which achieved a flawless \nrecord of zero infections reported over 18,000 patient visits. Raven \nassisted with 20\n\n[[Page S5724]]\n\nminor surgeries and worked over 1,000 hours of ambulance service, where \nshe was credited with helping to save the life of a gunshot victim. \nWhile at Eielson she found time to volunteer with the USO, Big Brothers \nBig Sisters, the Air Force Sergeants Association, and youth \ncheerleading. Add to this her work toward a bachelor's degree in \nnursing, and it is clear why she stood out from her peers for this \nprestigious award.\n  Excellence is contagious. Rewarding the best of the best motivates \nothers in their own endeavors. In a time when our servicemembers are \nall volunteers, the professionalism and proficiency of the force is \nfueled by those within the ranks who lead by example and uphold the \ncore values of their service. The example Raven set through her \nexceptional performance has undoubtedly been transmitted to countless \nother airmen she served with. Alaska is proud to have had her.\n  Alaskans take pride in treating our military better than any other \nState, and we like to think our support makes them better soldiers, \nairmen, sailors, marines, and coast guardsmen. We know they make us \nbetter. Our military members are a reassuring presence in our \ncommunities, and we hope our faithful patriotism reciprocates the \ninspiration we draw from theirs. Raven has recently been transferred to \nYokota Air Base, Japan, but I trust she will fondly remember her time \nin Alaska. I congratulate Sergeant Taylor on her selection as one of \nthe 12 Outstanding Airmen, I thank her for her service, and I look \nforward to hearing of her continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/19/senate-section/article/S5724-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/19/senate-section/article/S5724-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/19/senate-section/article/S5724-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5724-S5725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  FISCAL PLAN ENTITLED ``LIVING WITHIN OUR MEANS AND INVESTING IN THE \n  FUTURE'' RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON SEPTEMBER 19, \n                              2011--PM 22\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on the Budget:\n\nTo The Congress of the United States:\n  This continues to be a time of challenge for our country. We face an \neconomic crisis that has left millions of our neighbors jobless, and a \npolitical crisis that has made things worse. Millions of Americans are \nlooking for work. Across our country, families are doing their best \njust to scrape by--giving up nights out with the family to save on gas \nor make the mortgage, or postponing retirement to send a child to \ncollege.\n  These men and women grew up with faith in an America where hard work \nand responsibility paid off. They believed in a country where everyone \ngets a fair shake and does their fair share; they believed that if you \nworked hard and played by the rules, you would be rewarded with a \ndecent salary and good benefits. If you did the right thing, you could \nmake it in America.\n  For decades now, Americans have watched that compact erode. They have \nseen the decks too often stacked against them. And they know that \nWashington has not always put their interests first. Too often, our \nNation's capital has been consumed by partisanship. Too often, the \nneeds of special interests or politics have been put ahead of what is \nbest for the country.\n  That is what must change. The American people work hard to meet their \nresponsibilities. Now, as the Nation faces an economy that is not \ngrowing and creating jobs as it should, so must its leaders. While the \ncontinued recovery of our economy will be driven by the businesses and \nworkers across our land, policymakers in Washington can take steps to \nhelp Americans right now and set the most favorable conditions we can \nfor growth and job creation for years to come. We can live within our \nmeans and invest for the future.\n  That is why last week I presented to the Congress and the American \npeople the American Jobs Act, to provide a jolt to the economy and give \ncompanies confidence that if they invest and hire, there will be \ncustomers for their products and services. This jobs bill will put more \npeople back to work and more money in the pockets of those who are \nworking. It will create more jobs for construction workers, more jobs \nfor teachers, more jobs for veterans, and more jobs for the long-term \nunemployed. It will provide a tax break for companies that hire new \nworkers, and it will cut payroll taxes in half for every working \nAmerican and every small business. It will create jobs for people to \nrebuild our aging infrastructure and repair and modernize at least \n35,000 schools. Moreover, the proposals in the American Jobs Act are \nthe kind of proposals that have been supported by Democrats and \nRepublicans in the past.\n  I am committed to paying for this jobs bill. The Budget Control Act \nthat I signed into law last month will cut annual Government spending \nby about $1 trillion over the next 10 years. It also charges the Joint \nSelect Committee on Deficit Reduction with finding an additional $1.5 \ntrillion in savings. As part of this jobs bill, I am asking the \nCongress to increase that amount so that it covers the full cost of the \nAmerican Jobs Act. In addition, I believe that the Congress should \nseize the opportunity that this new Committee presents and do much more \nso that we can put the country on a sustainable fiscal path, which is \ncritical for our long-term economic growth and competitiveness.\n  For this reason, I am sending to the Congress this detailed plan to \npay for this jobs bill and realize more than $3 trillion in net deficit \nreduction over the next 10 years. Combined with the approximately $1 \ntrillion in savings from the first part of the Budget Control Act, this \nwould generate more than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next \ndecade. This would bring the Nation to the point where current spending \nis no longer adding to our debt and where our debt is no longer \nincreasing as a share of our economy--an important milestone on the way \nto restoring fiscal discipline and moving us toward balance.\n\n  This plan is a balanced one that asks everyone to do their part. It \nincludes nearly $580 billion in cuts and reforms to mandatory programs \nof which $320 billion is savings from Federal health programs such as \nMedicare and Medicaid. These changes are necessary to maintain the \npromise of Medicare as we know it.\n  The plan also realizes more than $1 trillion in savings over the next \n10 years from our drawdowns in Afghanistan and Iraq. And the plan calls \nfor the Congress to undertake comprehensive tax reform that lowers tax \nrates, closes loopholes, boosts job creation here at home, cuts the \ndeficit by $1.5 trillion, and observes the Buffett Rule--that people \nmaking more than $1 million a year should not pay a smaller share of \ntheir income in taxes than middle-class families pay.\n  To assist the Committee in its work, I also included specific tax \nloophole closers and measures to broaden the tax base. Together with \nthe expiration of the high-income tax cuts from 2001 and 2003, these \nmeasures would be more than enough to reach this $1.5 trillion target. \nThey include cutting tax preferences for high-income households, \neliminating tax breaks for oil and gas companies, closing the carried \ninterest loophole for investment fund managers, and eliminating \nbenefits for those who use corporate jets.\n  In sum, the plan I am sending to the Congress today is a blueprint \nfor how we can reduce this deficit, pay down our debt, and pay for the \nAmerican Jobs Act in the process. I have little doubt that some of \nthese proposals will not be popular with those who benefit from these \naffected programs. And some of these changes are ones that we would not \nmake if it were not for our fiscal situation. But we are all in this \ntogether, and all of us must contribute\n\n[[Page S5725]]\n\nto getting our economy moving again and on a firm fiscal footing.\n  After all, we are all connected. No single individual built America \non his or her own. We built it together. We have been, and always will \nbe, ``one Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for \nall.'' We have always been a people with responsibilities to ourselves \nand with responsibilities to one another. This means that as Americans \nwork hard to find a job, keep their businesses afloat and grow, and \nprovide for their kids, their representatives in Washington must meet \ntheir responsibilities and make the tough choices needed to get our \neconomy back on track.\n  This plan lives up to a simple idea: as a Nation, we can live within \nour means while still making the investments we need to prosper. It \nfollows a balanced approach: asking everyone to do their part, so no \none has to bear all the burden. And it says that everyone--including \nmillionaires and billionaires--has to pay their fair share.\n  These may be tough times for our country, but I have a deep faith in \nthe American spirit, and we are tougher than the times we live in and \nbigger than the politics we have recently seen.

Across our country, families are doing their best \njust to scrape by--giving up nights out with the family to save on gas \nor make the mortgage, or postponing retirement to send a child to \ncollege.\n  These men and women grew up with faith in an America where hard work \nand responsibility paid off. They believed in a country where everyone \ngets a fair shake and does their fair share; they believed that if you \nworked hard and played by the rules, you would be rewarded with a \ndecent salary and good benefits. If you did the right thing, you could \nmake it in America.\n  For decades now, Americans have watched that compact erode. They have \nseen the decks too often stacked against them. And they know that \nWashington has not always put their interests first. Too often, our \nNation's capital has been consumed by partisanship. Too often, the \nneeds of special interests or politics have been put ahead of what is \nbest for the country.\n  That is what must change. The American people work hard to meet their \nresponsibilities. Now, as the Nation faces an economy that is not \ngrowing and creating jobs as it should, so must its leaders. While the \ncontinued recovery of our economy will be driven by the businesses and \nworkers across our land, policymakers in Washington can take steps to \nhelp Americans right now and set the most favorable conditions we can \nfor growth and job creation for years to come. We can live within our \nmeans and invest for the future.\n  That is why last week I presented to the Congress and the American \npeople the American Jobs Act, to provide a jolt to the economy and give \ncompanies confidence that if they invest and hire, there will be \ncustomers for their products and services. This jobs bill will put more \npeople back to work and more money in the pockets of those who are \nworking. It will create more jobs for construction workers, more jobs \nfor teachers, more jobs for veterans, and more jobs for the long-term \nunemployed. It will provide a tax break for companies that hire new \nworkers, and it will cut payroll taxes in half for every working \nAmerican and every small business. It will create jobs for people to \nrebuild our aging infrastructure and repair and modernize at least \n35,000 schools. Moreover, the proposals in the American Jobs Act are \nthe kind of proposals that have been supported by Democrats and \nRepublicans in the past.\n  I am committed to paying for this jobs bill. The Budget Control Act \nthat I signed into law last month will cut annual Government spending \nby about $1 trillion over the next 10 years. It also charges the Joint \nSelect Committee on Deficit Reduction with finding an additional $1.5 \ntrillion in savings. As part of this jobs bill, I am asking the \nCongress to increase that amount so that it covers the full cost of the \nAmerican Jobs Act. In addition, I believe that the Congress should \nseize the opportunity that this new Committee presents and do much more \nso that we can put the country on a sustainable fiscal path, which is \ncritical for our long-term economic growth and competitiveness.\n  For this reason, I am sending to the Congress this detailed plan to \npay for this jobs bill and realize more than $3 trillion in net deficit \nreduction over the next 10 years. Combined with the approximately $1 \ntrillion in savings from the first part of the Budget Control Act, this \nwould generate more than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next \ndecade. This would bring the Nation to the point where current spending \nis no longer adding to our debt and where our debt is no longer \nincreasing as a share of our economy--an important milestone on the way \nto restoring fiscal discipline and moving us toward balance.\n\n  This plan is a balanced one that asks everyone to do their part. It \nincludes nearly $580 billion in cuts and reforms to mandatory programs \nof which $320 billion is savings from Federal health programs such as \nMedicare and Medicaid. These changes are necessary to maintain the \npromise of Medicare as we know it.\n  The plan also realizes more than $1 trillion in savings over the next \n10 years from our drawdowns in Afghanistan and Iraq. And the plan calls \nfor the Congress to undertake comprehensive tax reform that lowers tax \nrates, closes loopholes, boosts job creation here at home, cuts the \ndeficit by $1.5 trillion, and observes the Buffett Rule--that people \nmaking more than $1 million a year should not pay a smaller share of \ntheir income in taxes than middle-class families pay.\n  To assist the Committee in its work, I also included specific tax \nloophole closers and measures to broaden the tax base. Together with \nthe expiration of the high-income tax cuts from 2001 and 2003, these \nmeasures would be more than enough to reach this $1.5 trillion target. \nThey include cutting tax preferences for high-income households, \neliminating tax breaks for oil and gas companies, closing the carried \ninterest loophole for investment fund managers, and eliminating \nbenefits for those who use corporate jets.\n  In sum, the plan I am sending to the Congress today is a blueprint \nfor how we can reduce this deficit, pay down our debt, and pay for the \nAmerican Jobs Act in the process. I have little doubt that some of \nthese proposals will not be popular with those who benefit from these \naffected programs. And some of these changes are ones that we would not \nmake if it were not for our fiscal situation. But we are all in this \ntogether, and all of us must contribute\n\n[[Page S5725]]\n\nto getting our economy moving again and on a firm fiscal footing.\n  After all, we are all connected. No single individual built America \non his or her own. We built it together. We have been, and always will \nbe, ``one Nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for \nall.'' We have always been a people with responsibilities to ourselves \nand with responsibilities to one another. This means that as Americans \nwork hard to find a job, keep their businesses afloat and grow, and \nprovide for their kids, their representatives in Washington must meet \ntheir responsibilities and make the tough choices needed to get our \neconomy back on track.\n  This plan lives up to a simple idea: as a Nation, we can live within \nour means while still making the investments we need to prosper. It \nfollows a balanced approach: asking everyone to do their part, so no \none has to bear all the burden. And it says that everyone--including \nmillionaires and billionaires--has to pay their fair share.\n  These may be tough times for our country, but I have a deep faith in \nthe American spirit, and we are tougher than the times we live in and \nbigger than the politics we have recently seen. If we all put \npartisanship aside and roll up our sleeves, I have no doubt that we can \nmeet the challenges of the moment and show the world once again why the \nUnited States of America remains the greatest country on Earth.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, September 19, 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/19/senate-section/article/S5725-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5725-S5726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-3273.

A bill to designate certain Federal lands in San Diego \nCounty, California, as wilderness, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Beauty \nMountain and Agua Tibia Wilderness Act of 2011. I am pleased to have \nworked with Representative Darrell Issa on this legislation.\n  My bill would add 13,635 acres to the Beauty Mountain Wilderness and \n7,796 acres to the Agua Tibia Wilderness in northern San Diego County, \npreserving thousands of acres of natural habitat that are home to \ngolden eagles, mountain lions, and other iconic species. The bill \ncomplements the Riverside County wilderness designations in the \nCalifornia Desert and Mountain Heritage Act, which I authored with \nRepresentative Mary Bono Mack and which was signed into law in 2009.\n  In addition to designating new wilderness, my bill would require the \nBureau of Land Management to work\n\n[[Page S5728]]\n\nwith The Conservation Fund to construct new recreational facilities at \nthe Beauty Mountain Wilderness, promoting increased visitor access and \nenjoyment of this wonderful resource.\n  The proposed Beauty Mountain Wilderness additions in northern San \nDiego County serve as a vital biological corridor connecting the \nPalomar, San Jacinto, and Santa Rosa Mountains. With its captivating \nrock formations, rich chaparral, oak woodlands, and rolling hills, the \nname ``Beauty Mountain'' is only fitting to describe this area. These \nlands afford visitors many opportunities for recreation. The California \nRiding and Hiking Trail crosses the area, and during spring, aromas of \nsage, manzanita, and California lilac delight visitors.\n  The proposed Agua Tibia Wilderness additions span much of the scenic \nnorthern portion of the Palomar Mountain Range in the Cleveland \nNational Forest. The landscape in this area is marked by deep canyons \nblanketed in coastal sage and chaparral. Seasonal streams wind through \ncanyon valleys lined with willow, oak, and cottonwood trees, providing \na cool haven for native species. Stately big cone Douglas firs and \nother conifers stand tall against the north-facing slopes of the area. \nThe Cutca Trail passes through the wilderness for visitors to enjoy \noutdoor activities.\n  Protecting these areas is not only good for the environment, but also \ngood for the economy. The Outdoor Industry Association estimates that \noutdoor recreation supports more than 400,000 jobs and contributes $46 \nbillion annually to California's economy. Based on the models of \nColorado State University resource economists John Loomis and Robert \nRichardson, the relatively modest wilderness additions in my bill could \ngenerate nearly $330,000 per year in local revenue.\n  That is why my bill has earned support from a diverse group of \nstakeholders, including the Cities of Oceanside, Perris and Vista; \nChambers of Commerce in Canyon Lakes, Lake Elsinore, Murrieta, \nOceanside, Temecula, Vista and Wildomar; Off-Road Business Association; \nAmerican Motorcycle Association District 37 Dual Sport; California \nWilderness Coalition; The Wilderness Society; The Conservation \nAlliance; San Diego Audubon Society; San Diego River Coalition; Friends \nof the Santa Margarita River; and Sierra Club Santa Margarita Group.\n  By permanently protecting these natural treasures, we can preserve \nimportant habitat and migratory corridors, ensure that future \ngenerations can come to visit these places to recreate and revel in \ntheir scenic beauty, and help stimulate the local tourism and \nrecreation economy in San Diego County. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to enact this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/19/senate-section/article/S5728-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 271--HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF THE HONORABLE \n       CHARLES H.
