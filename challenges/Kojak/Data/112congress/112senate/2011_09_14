Madam President, the House sent us a package, and I \nappreciate that very much. It funds the highway bill for 6 months, and \nit funds the FEMA bill for 4 months. That is terrific. We should move \nto this as quickly as we can; however, we are told it is going to be \nheld up by the Republicans. If someone wants to have a vote on an \namendment as it relates to this, I will be happy to discuss this with \nthe Republican leader and see if we can work something out. In the \ninstance I am talking about, however, the Senator said he doesn't want \nto vote; he just wants to hold up the bill. He said if we put in what \nwe got from the House and stuck his provision in that, then he would be \nhappy. Well, I guess anyone would. It is a pretty good way to legislate \naround here--just be a dictator and say: Either take this or leave it. \nThat isn't the way things work around here. We have to have votes on \nissues to find out how people feel.\n  I am convinced his issue would lose overwhelmingly, but he is holding \nup this legislation, and we are in a position now legislatively that I \ncan't get to this bill. We cannot get to this bill prior to Friday, \nwhen the FAA expires. So it is unfortunate that is the position we are \nin. One Senator is holding this up, and what it will do is--the highway \nbill does not expire on Friday; FAA does. But they are a package. If \nthis continues, we will have about 80,000 people out of work by \nSaturday, 4,000 who work for the FAA and about 70,000 or 75,000 who are \nworking on airport construction jobs. In Las Vegas, for example, there \nis a new tower being built because of McCarran Field being \noverwhelmed--the old tower can't handle things well--and those people \nwill be laid off. That is the way it is all over the country. That is \nvery unfortunate.\n  I really appreciate, Madam President, and I have tried to say \nindividually--I have been to each Republican Senator--the Senators who \nhave voted to help us move forward on funding for FEMA, I really \nappreciate it. As you know, we have a majority, but it is not a huge \nmajority, and to get things done on issues that are specialized, we \nneed seven Republicans, and we have eight Republicans in this instance \nwho helped us pass this legislation. All the Democratic Senators voted \nfor this, and we got those Republicans. This allows us now to fund \nFEMA.\n  I have told my friends on the Republican side of the aisle, if it is \nsomething that--if they want to change the\n\n[[Page S5588]]\n\nnumbers around, let's have a discussion on that. But right now, people \nare desperate.\n  Last night around 6 or 6:30, I spoke to the man who is in charge of \nFEMA, and he said we are spending money every day on Lee and on Irene. \nThese are not a couple of women; one is a tropical storm, and the other \nis a hurricane. They are not spending money other places. Why? Because \nthey don't have the money.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, there are people in her State who \nhave lost their homes. This is all up and down the coast, from the \ncoast of Florida up to Maine, and even places inward. As we talked \nabout yesterday, some of the very severe damage was not on the \ncoastline but, for example, in the State of Vermont, the worst storm \nlikely they have ever had, and those people are trying to get from one \nplace to the next, but they have scores of bridges that are inoperable. \nAnd that money--what money they have left in FEMA--will run out I think \nhe said on the 25th. If things keep going the way they are, on the 25th \nof this month, they will be out of money--no money.\n  So we need to get this done. Procedurally, we are on this, and I \ncan't move to the highway bill and the FAA bill. And, I repeat, the FAA \nbill expires. So I hope we can have something worked out with this \nSenator so we can get this bill done.\n  The disasters facing this country are untoward. Forty-eight States \nhave already had emergency declarations. Some States have had multiple \nemergency declarations. Only two States--West Virginia and Michigan--\nhave not had emergency declarations. We have had in the State of Texas, \nas an example, 20,000 fires since the first of the year; on Sunday \nalone, 19 fires. Millions of acres have burned, and 2,000 homes have \nburned to the ground. That is what FEMA is all about.\n  FEMA is an organization that is relatively new, but as a country we \nhave been helping people who have experienced disasters since we have \nbeen a country.\n  In the early 1800s, there was a big fire in the State of New \nHampshire. I believe the date was 1813. The Federal Government stepped \nin to help with the rebuilding there. That is the way it should be. \nThat is what our country is all about. I am sorry, Madam President, it \nwas 1803. In 1803, the Federal Government played a role in rebuilding \nafter a calamity in New Hampshire. Congress passed legislation that \nyear to help New Hampshire recover from the devastating fire they had.\n  FEMA was established in 1979. To this point, it appears this could \nvery likely be the worst disaster year in the history of the country. \nIrene alone is one of the five worst disasters monetarily we have had \nin this country.\n  So I hope my Republican colleagues will work with us and help us move \nthese things along. It is important that we do that. It is important \nthat we do that as quickly as we can so that people in Joplin, MO, and \nother places in the country that have been devastated can receive the \nhelp they deserve from the Federal Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/14/senate-section/article/S5588-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise today with my colleagues to talk \nabout trade and the importance of trade and specifically to talk about \nthree pending trade agreements. And when I say ``pending,'' man alive, \nam I emphasizing ``pending.'' These agreements have been around a very \nlong time. And I am referring to Korea, Panama, and Colombia.\n  We all know the benefits of trade in the United States. In Nebraska, \nmy home State, more than 19,000 jobs and more than $5.5 billion in \nrevenue were directly tied to exports last year.\n  In trade discussions, we often hear about the need to level the \nplaying field. Well, these agreements do exactly that. They eliminate \ntariffs and a whole host of other barriers on most agricultural \nproducts, including products that are important to my State: beef, \ncorn, soybeans, and pork. No doubt about it, they increase the economic \nopportunities for Nebraska farmers and ranchers, for businesses and for \nworkers.\n  Well, for 3 years, we have heard the President say the right thing. \nIn fact, every time he would say something about this, I thought, \nfinally, the trade agreements are going to bust loose and we are going \nto have an opportunity to vote on them.\n  He said in last year's State of the Union:\n\n       If America sits on the sidelines while other Nations sign \n     trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our \n     shores.\n\n  Then again in May, the President called for a ``robust, forward-\nlooking trade agenda that emphasizes exports and domestic job growth.''\n  Just last week, the President noted that now is the time. He said, of \n``a series of trade agreements that would make it easier for American \ncompanies to sell their products in Panama, Colombia and South Korea,'' \nnow is the time. If now is the time, why is the administration \ncontinuing to fail to act? It has been 1,538 days since the Korea \nagreement was signed. It has been 1,540 days since the Panama agreement \nwas signed. It has been 1,758 days since we completed negotiations with \nColombia.\n  As I said, I have colleagues with me today who are in a much better \nposition than I would be to explain the positive impacts of these trade \nagreements. I am going to ask that Senator Roberts speak first, Senator \nPortman, Senator Hoeven, Senator Blunt, and Senator Isakson. It is my \nhope that if there is time permitting, I will wrap up.\n  I ask Senator Roberts, as former chairman of the House Agriculture \nsubcommittee and ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee \ntoday, how important are these agreements to agriculture and job \ncreation in the United States?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, I thank my colleague and dear friend \nfrom Nebraska for the question.\n  In the end, the biggest consequence for inaction that is now facing \nour Nation, our biggest challenge, is jobs. In regards to his question, \nthe three pending trade agreements add up to $13 billion in additional \nexports and an estimated 250,000 jobs. From the agricultural \nperspective, the three pending\n\n[[Page S5589]]\n\ntrade agreements represent $2.5 billion, if they are ever implemented.\n  The estimates are that the three agreements in total are expected to \nincrease direct exports by $129.5 million just for Kansas farmers and \nranchers and an additional 1,150 jobs for our State. For folks on the \nfarm, these export markets are absolutely critical. Approximately one-\nthird of our crop production is exported. For wheat, that number jumps \nto one-half.\n  The administration's prolonged delay is causing U.S. businesses and \nproducers to simply lose market share. We are losing out. Other \ncountries are not waiting. They are enacting trade agreements without \nthe United States.\n  Let me give a very good example. The Colombia-Canada trade agreement \nwent into force on August 15 of this year. Already, Nutresa, the \nlargest food processor in Colombia, has announced it will source all of \nits wheat from Canada to take advantage of the lower duties the \nCanadian wheat will receive from the trade agreement. Nutresa's wheat \ndemand alone represents 50 percent of all wheat imports to that \ncountry. Our Kansas Farm Bureau estimates that Kansas farmers stand to \nlose $21 million from lost wheat sales alone and $38 million from all \nagricultural exports just by doing nothing on the trade agreement.\n  Soon after the United States negotiated the trade agreement with \nKorea, the European Union followed suit. In July, the Korea-European \nUnion trade agreement went into effect. According to Korean customs, \nwithin the first 29 days of July, I say to my friend, the European \nexports were up 34 percent.\n  Get this one: Notably, aerospace equipment increased by a whopping \n1,693 percent. That is astounding. Kansas is a major player in the \naviation sector, exporting $2.7 billion in transportation equipment \nlast year. As the aviation capital of the world, Wichita's aviation \ncompanies and 17,000 workers have much to lose in trying to compete \nagainst the European Union.\n  It is long overdue time for the President to put some action behind \nhis words. Send the three trade agreements to Congress immediately.\n  I am going to make a statement that I regret to say. Trade assistance \nnotwithstanding, I am very sad to say that I do not believe we are \ngoing to see any trade agreement this year or the next. I hope my \nprediction is not correct. This is ridiculous.\n  Every third foggy night, the President makes a speech and says: We \nneed these trade agreements. We are losing market share.\n  Well, I don't see the trade agreements. These are not the trade \nagreements. Maybe somebody can find them here on the floor or in the \nHouse. Maybe they are somewhere. But I think they are in the White \nHouse, and until we get the politics out of this and the President \nsends the trade agreements here, what on Earth is he doing saying we \nshould be passing these trade agreements? We don't have the bill. Send \nus the bill, Mr. President.\n  As the administration delays moving forward on these export \nagreements with Korea, Panama, and Colombia, what is happening to \nAmerican exports to these important markets?\n  Senator Portman is an expert on this issue. There is not anybody in \nthis Senate who is more of an expert on trade. If you apply the \nadministration's own metrics, how many jobs will be created--I am not \ntalking about lost but will be created by these pending agreements?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. I thank my colleague from Kansas, who has just made the \ncase eloquently as to why we need to move forward.\n  To answer his question, when you apply the metrics the President of \nthe United States and his administration have used for these three \ntrade agreements alone, they would create 250,000 new jobs. I ask my \ncolleagues, with 9 percent unemployment and continued bad economic \nnews, can't we use those jobs? By the way, jobs that are related to \ntrade tend to be higher paying, tend to have more benefits. This is \nexactly what we need to do in this Senate and in the House and here in \nWashington--put the partisanship aside and move forward on what makes \nsense to create jobs.\n  I can't think of anything that would have a more immediate impact on \nthose exporters Senator Roberts talked about, who right now are seeing \ntheir market share eroded because the United States is sitting on its \nhands. In 2006, the Colombia agreement was finalized. It has been \ntinkered with since then, but we are talking 5 years ago. It is \nunbelievable. When we have sat on our hands and not moved forward with \ngiving our farmers and our workers and our service providers the chance \nto go into that Colombian market, you are exactly right, they have gone \nahead and made trade agreements with other folks.\n  Colombia is a great example. Back when we negotiated this agreement \nand completed it--and I was the U.S. Trade Representative then, as the \nSenator indicated, and I negotiated with the then-President of \nColombia, President Uribe, who made lots of concessions, including on \nmanufacturing and agricultural services. At that time, we had a 71-\npercent market share in terms of exports of agricultural products--\nwheat, corn, and soybeans--into Colombia--a 71-percent market share. \nToday, that market share is about 26 percent. Why? Because after we \ncompleted our agreement with Colombia, they engaged with other \ncountries, including the Mercosur countries of Argentina and Brazil, \nand now they are buying their products instead from those countries \nthat got their act together and moved forward with trade agreements \nthat this President will not get his act together on and send to us.\n  As Senator Roberts said, just recently, in August, this summer, they \ncompleted an agreement with Canada. Guess what the Canadians love to \nexport--the same kind of wheat we love to export. So the Senator is \nright, they are going to take the wheat market away from Kansas and \nNorth Dakota and other States that really need those jobs and need \nthose exports.\n  We have to move forward. It is really a crime that we have not been \nable to provide our farmers, workers, and service providers these \nopportunities.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield for one quick question?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Yes. Absolutely.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The Senator has been there and done the negotiating. He \nknows these trade agreements not only apply to our exports but our \nnational security. What has this continued delay done--what does it do \nto the credibility of the people who are actually negotiating, our \ntrade representatives?\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Unfortunately, I think some of these countries--all \nthree of which are great allies of the United States: Panama, Colombia, \nand South Korea--feel as though the United States has let them down.\n  We are going to move forward here, I believe. I am more optimistic \nthan the Senator from Kansas. I believe the President will finally send \nthese forward. He has to. The logic is difficult to escape. Why \nwouldn't you? And that is good. We will be able to move forward, I \nhope, with not just opening more markets but helping on our \nrelationships with these incredibly important allies. But in the \nmeantime, there has been damage done. The Senator is absolutely right. \nI think they believe in some respects that the rug has been pulled out \nfrom under them. They made huge concessions and commitments to the \nUnited States and politically took great risks.\n  Frankly, in Colombia and Panama, where they moved forward immediately \nto ratify these agreements in their legislature, it wasn't just the \nadministration, it was the elected representatives of the people, as we \nare, who took risks to say: Yes, we want to be a partner with the \nUnited States of America, the greatest economy on the face of the Earth \nand this beacon of hope and opportunity, and here we are in America \nletting them down.\n  So in both its commercial impacts on the United States--we have lost \nmarket share, we have lost jobs because of it, but it also has had an \nimpact, as Senator Roberts says, in terms of our standing in the world.\n  We have to move forward not just with these three, but the important \npoint is that we have to move forward with additional agreements. There \nare over 100 trade agreements being negotiated right now around the \nworld, and because the United States does not have a trade promotion \nauthority, the ability for the President to negotiate and bring an \nagreement back here for an up-or-down vote, we are not engaged in these \nagreements. We are engaged in\n\n[[Page S5590]]\n\none, which is a regional one--the transpacific partnership--but none of \nthese bilateral ones, which is where you are really going to get these \ntrade openings and new exports and, therefore, new jobs.\n  This is a bigger issue that must be addressed. This Congress, I hope, \nwill address it in the context of the votes we are going to have in \nconnection with the trade agreements. We are going to promote getting \nthe United States back in the game of expanding our trade and helping \nU.S. jobs.\n  By the way, it was mentioned earlier that it is not just that we have \nthe opportunity to create over 200,000 jobs. It is also that if we do \nnot move forward on these three agreements, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce has done some analysis showing we would lose 380,000 jobs.\n  This sort of goes both ways. There is a cost to not moving forward, \nand that is also hundreds of thousands of jobs we desperately need in \nStates such as Ohio and the States represented by the Senators who are \nhere with us on the floor today. The International Trade Commission now \nsays these three agreements alone would expand exports annually by $13 \nbillion--again meaning jobs and opportunity.\n  It is time for us to move forward. Senator Roberts has talked about \nwhat is happening with the European Union, which actually negotiated \nits agreements after we completed ours.\n  In the auto sector, by the way, there is an EU-Korea agreement that \nsays the 8-percent tariff on imported cars has already started being \nreduced. That has resulted in the companies sending UK cars, including \nHondas that are being produced in the United Kingdom--they are being \nexported to South Korea. We have a Honda plant in Ohio. I visited it \nrecently. There are 4,200 Ohio workers there. We want to export Hondas \nfrom Ohio to Korea. We can do that with these export agreements.\n\n  It is time for us to move forward. It is not the time for us to play \npolitics. We have to move forward because we need these jobs and \nbecause, again, the United States should be at the forefront of these \nagreements in order to not just protect the market share we have but \nexpand it. Ninety-five percent of the consumers live outside of our \nborders, and we need to access those consumers.\n  I now ask, if I could, one of my colleagues to talk a little about \nhis experience in his State.\n  John Hoeven was Governor of North Dakota, so he was like the trade \nrepresentative from North Dakota. He was out there promoting trade as \nGovernor, and North Dakota is a State that has a lot of exports, \nincluding wheat, as we talked about earlier, so they are being hit by \nwhat Senators Roberts and Johanns talked about in terms of what is \nhappening in Colombia today with the Canadian agreement and also the EU \nagreement with Korea.\n  I ask Senator Hoeven if he would talk a little about why these \nagreements with Colombia and Panama are so important to his State.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank Senator Portman, and I thank Senator Johanns for \norganizing this discussion on a very important issue, a timely issue. \nIt is good to be here with Senator Roberts, with Senator Blunt and \nSenator Isakson. I think, coming from our different States, we show how \nimportant these trade agreements are not only to our individual States \nacross the country but how important these trade agreements are to our \nNation right now.\n  When we are talking trade, we are talking jobs. We need to create \nmore jobs in this country, and it is the private sector that creates \njobs. It is business investment, it is companies that create jobs. Our \njob, our task, our role is to create an environment where our companies \nand our entrepreneurs and American ingenuity that built the greatest \neconomic engine in the history of the world--this country, this \neconomy, this U.S. economy--we have to create that environment so they \ncan invest and create those jobs.\n  One of the important ways we do that is with good trade agreements. \nLet's make sure our companies can export their great products and \nservices all over the world. We have to compete in a global, high-tech \neconomy, and these trade agreements let us do it. That is why it is so \nimportant that we move forward.\n  Today, we are on the floor of the Senate saying: Why do we have these \ntrade agreements? Thursday night, we heard from the President that we \nneed to move forward with these trade agreements. We want to move \nforward with these trade agreements. We are ready to go. We have been \nfor some time. In fact, the Senators here on the floor and others have \nbeen working very hard to do everything we can to make sure we have \ncleared the path so these trade agreements can come to the Senate \nfloor.\n  It was not too long ago that Senator Johanns, myself, and Senator \nPortman went with Senator Mitch McConnell and Senator Moran over to \nSouth Korea to meet with President Lee. He wants the agreements. He is \nready to go. As a matter of fact, he said, please ratify the agreements \nin your country, get them over to me, because I am ready to take that \nto my legislators and get this approved.\n\n  Second, our President said there are some concerns we need to deal \nwith as part of these trade agreements. He said we need to address TSA, \ntrade assistant adjustment. We said we will work with TSA. We will make \nsure we have enough Senators so it is squared away. We have it covered. \nThat has been communicated. So the question is: Why at this point don't \nwe have the trade agreements? That is the question I think that has to \nbe asked. Where are they? Why aren't they here on the Senate floor so \nwe can move forward with them? In our State, as others mentioned in \ntheir States, they are incredibly important.\n  A few big stats to follow on what Senator Portman mentioned a minute \nago. For every 4-percent increase in trade, we create a million jobs in \nthis country. For every 4-percent increase in trade, a million jobs in \nthis country are created. How important is that? The United States-\nSouth Korea free trade agreement alone means more than a quarter of a \nmillion jobs, more than $10 billion in increased U.S. exports to that \ncountry alone. I cannot think of a time when it is more important to \ncreate those jobs than right now when we have more than 14 million \npeople out of work and many more who are either not working because \nthey have not been able to get a job or who are underemployed. \nUnemployment is more than 9 percent.\n  This is one of the ways we create that environment that gets our \npeople back to work by empowering the private sector to make that \ninvestment and create those jobs.\n  I was just back in North Dakota, and one of the many events I went to \nwas an expansion of one of the Caterpillar company's locations in West \nFargo, ND. They remanufacture a lot of their equipment in West Fargo, \nND. This equipment goes all over the world. It is part of the huge \nmachines that Cat makes. They use these machines for excavating, for \nmining, road building, for all these things all over the world, and \nthey are the technology leader in the world in this huge equipment. \nThey bought Bucyrus, which is huge in mining, so now they are big in \nthe mining business. Getting into places such as Colombia and Panama is \nincredibly important for Caterpillar. It is not just about creating \njobs in North Dakota, but think of the impact throughout the heartland \nin Indiana or in Illinois or, as Senator Roberts talked about, \nagriculture.\n  In North Dakota we have more cattle than people. I think we have more \nthan 3 million cattle. Right now to send them to South Korea, we pay \nmore than 40 percent tariff. How do we compete with Argentina or \nAustralia in that situation? This is an opportunity. This is absolutely \nan opportunity. We need to reach out and grab it with both hands. We \nhave the President right now saying, pass those trade agreements. \nAbsolutely. Please get them down here to us. We have worked so hard to \nmake sure we have cleared all the hurdles, TAA, or whatever else is \nrequired. Bring those trade agreements to us. We stand ready to pass \nthem.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Would the Senator yield for a second? The Senator talked \nabout being at home and talking to his constituents about this, and I \nam sure all of us have stories like this, but I will tell you this \nmorning we had one of our weekly coffees and the Ohio pork producers \ncame. There were about 12 pork producers from around the State of Ohio. \nDo you know what the No. 1 issue was they raised with me? Trade\n\n[[Page S5591]]\n\nand getting these trade agreements done. Why? Because it affects their \nprices directly. They have to have these international sales in order \nto make ends meet. Particularly with the price of feed going up, they \nhave to have these foreign markets. It was interesting that of all the \nissues they could have raised with me, the one they are most concerned \nabout is to make sure we get these three agreements done, and then move \nforward with the additional agreements.\n  It is our job to provide the environment for success. Part of that \nenvironment is to give our exporters the ability to have a level \nplaying field to access these markets. They are the best farmers in the \nworld. We have some of the most productive land in the world. They just \nneed a fair shake.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. It is absolutely true. In handing off the ball in this \ndiscussion, I want to go back to the trade adjustment assistance, which \nI mentioned earlier. There were a number of things the administration \nwanted to see before bringing these trade agreements forward to us for \nratification. Senator Blunt and Senator Portman were instrumental--and \nalong with these two, Senator Johanns, myself, Senator Isakson, and \nothers. We even signed on to a letter not once but I think twice, to \nmake sure we got it right. Senator Blunt's leadership in making sure we \nhad taken all the necessary steps so the administration was prepared \nand willing to bring these agreements to the Senate floor has been \ncovered. I thank the Senator for that leadership. He may want to touch \non that, but I know how important the trade agreements are to the State \nof Missouri. But I also thank the leadership of Senator Portman, as \nwell, in making sure we addressed TAA and all of the issues that needed \nto be addressed as part of moving forward with these trade agreements.\n  Mr. BLUNT. I think what Senator Portman and I thought when the \nPresident said for these three trade agreements to be voted on, we had \nto have trade adjustment assistance. We looked at the negotiated \npackage. It was not exactly what any of us who signed the letter would \nhave negotiated. We said, look, these are the jobs that are the low-\nhanging fruit of job creation if we get these three trade bills. We are \nwilling to look at the Baucus camp-negotiated TAA, and support it in a \nway the White House can sign it and send these agreements up.\n  Senator Hoeven mentioned, as he and I and all of us were sitting in \nthe House Chamber last Thursday night, listening to the President's \nremarks when he said we need to pass these three trade agreements, I \nwas almost sure the next sentence would be: And so tomorrow, I am \nsending these trade agreements up. That next sentence did not occur. \nJust like the week in August where the President was on his bus tour \nand every single day on the bus tour he said Congress can do something \nright now that would create more American jobs if they will pass these \nthree trade agreements. Every time he said that, even though I was \nhearing it on the TV, I could not help but talk back to the television \nor the radio and say: Well, we cannot pass them unless you send them \nup. You are absolutely right, this is one of the easiest things we \ncould do to create jobs, Mr. President, but we have to have the \nagreements from you before we can vote on them. Don't tell the American \npeople all we have to do is pass the bill when you know that you have \nto send the bill up before we can pass the bill. We need these three \nagreements. As Senator Portman has pointed out, we need more \nagreements, but that is not happening right now. We do need the \nPresident to have the authority that I, and I think all of us, would be \nmore than willing to give him, but that is not part of this package, \nthe trade promotion authority we wish to see extended into the future.\n  Right now we have three agreements that have been negotiated for a \nlong time, and whether it is the Missouri and North Dakota beef \nindustry or the Missouri and Ohio pork industry or the grain industry \nthat we all are impacted by, there is a real opportunity here and these \nmarkets are waiting for us.\n  To look at our State, since 2002, exports have increased more than \nthree times faster than the State domestic product has grown. So for \nthose who say, well, exports cost American jobs or Missouri jobs, they \nclearly provide those jobs. U.S. farm exports reached an all-time high \nin 2010, amounting to more than $115 billion in sales. For every $1 \nbillion worth of agricultural exports, there are an estimated 8,000 \njobs. So these countries are waiting for agreements that will increase \ntrade in soybeans and beef and corn and pork and dairy products and \nprocessed food; in fact, in processed goods of all kinds. We cannot get \nto those markets until we pass these trade agreements.\n  All of us are eager to work with the President to get that done. All \nof us are eager for him to send us those trade agreements. Since these \nagreements were negotiated, others have negotiated agreements and \nlaunched them--and it may have been mentioned already this morning, but \nif it has not, it is important to understand that on July 1, the \nEuropean Union trade agreement with South Korea went into place and \nthey had a 1-month, 38-percent increase year over year the first month \nof that trade agreement.\n  The Canada-Colombia agreement went into place on August 15. Having \nbeen to Colombia and worked on this for some time, there is no question \nthere is a preference for our goods, but once they start buying these \nother products, then you have to convince them you need to come back to \nthe product you would rather have had to start with if that product had \nhad an even shot at the marketplace.\n  Panama is negotiating all kinds of work agreements and expansion \nagreements on the canal we are disadvantaged in because we have not \npassed that agreement.\n  Let's get these three agreements done. Let's start creating the \nprivate sector jobs these agreements clearly will lead to. As we have \ntalked to the White House and the President about that, my good friend \nfrom Georgia, Johnny Isakson, has been in the middle of all of those \ndiscussions. We know what can happen. For it to happen, we have to get \nthese agreements sooner rather than later. Let's get them up here. \nLet's get them passed. Let's get them back in the hands of our new \ntrading partners and see these jobs increase.\n  I am pleased to recognize and encourage the ongoing efforts for this \neffort with my good friend, Mr. Isakson.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank Senator Blunt.\n  I thank Senator Johanns for organizing this colloquy.\n  I represent a State that is home to the second largest port on the \neastern seaboard in the United States of America. The port is Savannah. \nWe are talking about creating jobs in America. The port of Savannah \ndirectly employs 300,000 people in the southeastern United States. Can \nyou think of what an impact this is going to have to increase that \nemployment if we get these free trade agreements?\n\n  Let me give you an example that is amazing. South Korea surpassed \nJapan in 2010 as the second largest Northeast Asian destination for \nSouth Atlantic exports behind only China--second largest in all of Asia \nbehind only China--most of that going out of the port of Savannah, most \nof that being agricultural products from your State and from your State \nand from mine.\n  Senator Portman talked about pork. In Georgia it is all about \nchickens and cattle. We are No. 1 in poultry, and South Korea is a huge \nimporter of our poultry. They would be a lot bigger with a free trade \nagreement.\n  Let me give another number that is chilling. South Korea's imports \nfrom South Korea into the United States went up by 26 percent last \nyear. Our exports to them went up by 15 percent. That is an 11-percent \nnegative in the trade deficit, which causes us tremendous problems.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask for unanimous consent for 5 \nadditional minutes to close.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. So my point is very simply this: We can help to balance \nour trade deficit. We can help to increase employment in the \nsoutheastern United States. We can help poultry, we can help pork, and \nwe can help beef. It has been 968 days since the President could have \nsent us these free trade agreements, and he has not. My point in this \ndebate is very simple. There is\n\n[[Page S5592]]\n\none person in the United States of America standing between us and more \njob creation, and it is the resident of the White House, President \nObama.\n  I wish to turn it over to the organizer of this event, Senator \nJohanns.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I end my comments today by saying to \nall of my fellow Senators, thank you so very much for coming to the \nfloor today and making the case. There is an old saying in a profession \nI used to be engaged in: I rest my case. Well, after hearing from these \nfine gentlemen about the importance of these agreements and why we need \nto have the President send them here, I rest my case. It is going to \nimprove job creation. It is going to improve our opportunity to export \nour products. It is going to level the playing field. It is going to \ngive our producers the opportunity to reclaim market share that has \nbeen lost while we have been waiting for these agreements to come here.\n  The final point I wish to make is this. I come from a State where \nunemployment is right above 4 percent. In this recession in Nebraska, \nunemployment never went over 5 percent. In fact, as I was doing my \ntownhall meetings across the State, I had members of my business \ncommunity coming to me and saying: One of the challenges we are facing \nis finding the workers for the jobs we are creating. Therefore, in my \nState, trade adjustment assistance would not be the high priority it is \nin many States. Notwithstanding that fact, when Senator Blunt came to \nme and said, look, the President is insisting on trade adjustment \nassistance as a condition to move these agreements and would I sign on \nto a letter that will back trade adjustment assistance, I said I would. \nWhy? Because the trade agreements are important to us.\n  It is my hope that after the many speeches we have all given--the \nmany speeches I have given on the importance of these agreements not \nonly on the Senate floor but across this country--the President is \nlistening and will finally send us these agreements so we can work with \nthe President. We can join forces on these agreements and do everything \nwe can to get the votes in the Senate and in the House to pass them and \nto put them on his desk and create 250,000 new jobs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/14/senate-section/article/S5592-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5592-S5593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DISASTER RELIEF\n\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Madam President, over the past 2 weeks, I have \ntraveled the State of Connecticut, as the Presiding Officer has done in \nthe State of New York, and she has described eloquently the damage she \nhas seen in her State. I have seen much the same in mine. I have seen \nthe destruction of small businesses, of homes; rivers swelling, \nflooding of historic dimensions causing significant destruction; the \nwind and rain striking Connecticut with a fury, its ferocity virtually \nunmatched in recent memory.\n  I met with families and community leaders, farmers and small \nbusinesses, about the help they will need to rebuild their homes and \ntheir businesses and their lives and their livelihoods. It is a \npowerful and moving struggle. The citizens of Connecticut, similar to \nthe citizens of New York and others struck by this storm, have acted \nwith determination and resolve, not with desperation or despair. They \nare determined and dedicated to rebuild and recover from this storm, \nbut they need the help that is provided by FEMA. We are here, hopefully \nin a bipartisan effort, to make sure these communities and others like \nthem throughout the Northeast and throughout the United States have the \nhelp and the real consequential aid they need to make this recovery in \nrebuilding their lives.\n  The early estimates suggest that the damage caused by Irene could \nreach more than $10 billion, making it one of the 10 costliest \ndisasters in U.S. history. The suffering and real sadness of \nConnecticut citizens gives us a bond and a cause in common with \nmillions of other Americans who have suffered from hurricanes, \ntornadoes, floods, and other natural disasters across the country. This \nyear alone, we have seen flooding on the Mississippi and Missouri \nRivers and other rivers in the Midwest, devastating tornadoes in the \nSouth, wildfires in the South and West, and now Hurricane Irene and \nTropical Storm Lee.\n  In times of natural disaster, Americans come together. In times when \nthey face crises, Americans rally as neighbors, as a community. \nRegardless of specific States where they live, they come together to \nrebuild their homes, to make common cause, to recognize our bonds as a \nnation. The spirit of our Nation is that we put people above politics \nevery time, without exception; that we provide disaster relief for \nvictims, such as Connecticut residents now, and with the resources they \nneed to rebuild.\n  Currently, FEMA is funding disaster relief for over 550 disasters, \nincluding 29 in Oklahoma, 21 in Kentucky, 17 in Texas, 19 in \nMississippi, and 18 in Kansas. Yet 2 weeks ago, House majority leader \nEric Cantor stated that relief funds for Hurricane Irene would need to \nbe offset by savings found elsewhere in the Federal budget. I reject \nthat contention and so should this body and my colleagues from those \nStates I have just named and all the other States in the Union. In \nfact, all but a handful or less have received and are receiving \ndisaster relief just since January of this year.\n  We need to do everything we can to put Connecticut and America back \nto work, to make sure our economy moves forward again, to create jobs, \nand to reduce the deficit. Yes, we need to reduce the deficit and the \ndebt and cut unnecessary and wasteful spending. However, we cannot \npermit Washington politics to create a legislative logjam and gridlock \nthat bogs down these efforts for disaster relief. The need is too \nurgent for thousands of families and businesses in Connecticut and \naround the country that have been devastated by these unprecedented \nfloods and other natural disasters, such as hurricanes, wildfires, \nfloods, and tornadoes.\n  Turning disaster assistance into a political football is unacceptable \nand unconscionable. It is a recipe for gridlock and it is just plain \nwrong. It is wrong and a disservice to the men and women whose homes \nand businesses have been hit by the forces of nature that are \nunpredictable and unpreventable. Now they are attempting to rebuild \ntheir lives, and we owe it to them to match their courage and \nresilience with efforts from FEMA.\n  We can't prevent those hurricanes or tornadoes or wildfires, but we \ncan step forward when these disasters occur and lend a hand to our \nneighbors, as we have done throughout our history, and we can provide \nthese communities with the real resources they need to recover, without \ndistinguishing between what State or what part of the country.\n  There is one story from Connecticut which I think tells a lot about \nthe choices we face right now. Mel Goldstein and his wife Arlene, whose \nhome was completely destroyed by flooding caused by Hurricane Irene, \nare being told their homeowners insurance will not cover the damage. \nTheir only hope of recovery is FEMA flood insurance and other FEMA \nassistance. Right now, they are using their savings to stay in a hotel \nwhile they rebuild their lives. Mel is one of the best known weathermen \nin the State of Connecticut. He is an icon in the broadcasting world \nand a hero to many of us for his struggle against cancer. His treatment \nin this unstable environment at this point in his recovery adds an \nunnecessary toll and stress to their lives. As we have in the past, we \nmust come together to help folks such as Arlene and Mel Goldstein move \non after the unthinkable happens in their lives. The unthinkable \nhappened to them and to many of their neighbors in East Haven along the \nshores of Connecticut.\n  I have heard their voices and seen their faces throughout our State, \nin communities big and small, where flooding has put a small business \nout of business and where homes have been destroyed and people are \nliving in shelters or with their neighbors or were for awhile. These \nkinds of human stories are part of the fabric of the larger story we \nneed to recognize. I hope my colleagues will come together, as we did \non the vote yesterday, to approve this measure. The vote yesterday \nsignaled perhaps a return to the bipartisanship that should prevail \nwhen the Nation confronts crisis and disaster. Our No. 1 goal, which \nshould be a bipartisan goal, must be to deliver help to our fellow \nAmericans as quickly as possible.\n\n[[Page S5593]]\n\n  Thank you. I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm \nLee left a trail of devastation across New York State. I saw firsthand \nthe impact they left on our communities: hundreds of families living in \nshelters, complete homes destroyed, belongings piled up on people's \nfront yards, small businesses uncertain whether they would even reopen \nand worrying about whether they could hire back their employees, farms \nthat had no feed for livestock for days, crops and livelihoods \nvanishing without any trace in a single day, crumbling bridges, washed-\nout roads, heating oil soaking into buildings and the ground. I was \nborn and raised in upstate New York, and I can say we have never seen \nthis kind of devastation--certainly not in my lifetime.\n  America has always stood by those who have suffered greatly from \ndisaster and we have always helped them to rebuild. We have an \nobligation to these families, businesses, and farmers to help them \nrebuild today.\n  This picture is of downtown Binghamton. I met with hundreds of \nfamilies displaced and placed in a Red Cross shelter at the University \nof Binghamton. They were on day four at the shelter, unclear if they \nwould be able to see what was left of their homes.\n  I can't fully describe the worry and fear in the eyes of parents who \nare in a shelter with their children. I talked to one mother who has 10 \nchildren, the youngest of whom was 2 years old, trying desperately to \nkeep them fed, keep them safe but literally having no sense of when she \ncould return to her home and what it would look like when she returned.\n  I talked to one father whose daughter turned 13 years old that day in \nthe shelter and his worry was mostly: I don't know what is in front of \nus. I don't know when we will be able to go home. I don't know how much \nhas been destroyed, and I don't know how I will rebuild.\n  One parent I talked to was a young mother. She held a 6-week-old \ninfant in her arms, and she said to me: I have everything I need right \nhere. That exemplified the courage of Americans when they fight through \nsuffering--the strength of New Yorkers that they will pull themselves \nup by their own bootstraps and make the difference. But we in \nWashington must help.\n  In Schoharie County, on the main street of the villages of both \nSchoharie and Middleburgh, every single home was flooded. The water \nmark was at about 7 feet. As you drive down the main street and begin \nto talk to the business owners and the families, you can see there was \nnot one left untouched. Every piece of these families' belongings is \nliterally on the front lawns of these homes and businesses.\n  But I watched these business owners begin to rebuild. I could see \nthem literally bringing the mud from the basements, bringing the mud \nfrom their ground floors, pulling down all the drywall because \nobviously the damage was so great it would cause long-lasting damage. \nPeople are very worried about how they can make sure their business is \nsafe.\n  This is just a snapshot right here in this picture of the town of \nMiddleburgh. This is the farming community within Schoharie County. \nThese farmers have lost everything. I can tell you, the water was so \nstrong, the surge was so great, it literally took trees out of the \nground, completely uprooted and overturned. The crops that we could see \non this farm--they were so covered with silt from the river, we could \nnot even recognize what kind of crops they were. I saw potatoes that \nhad been uprooted from the ground all over the road. That farmer could \nsalvage nothing of their farm.\n  We had one farmer who came down to meet with me because her cows were \nstranded. They had 800 cows stuck because the roads had been completely \nwashed out. They had no way to get feed up to those cows. They had no \nway to deal with manure and dump all the milk that had to be destroyed. \nThey needed a rescue effort. Because of the efforts of our Governor--he \nreacted quickly--our National Guard got up there, got food and water up \nto those farmers, they fixed the road, and the feed was delivered. But \nthis is the kind of reaction we need from government. This is why the \nFederal Government must be there to help and protect these families and \nbusinesses.\n  Our next picture is of Greene County. In Greene County, waters rushed \ndown the main street of Windham--this is a picture of Windham--and \ndestroyed all businesses in its wake. The homes of families were also \ndestroyed. There was absolute destruction throughout Greene County.\n  I talked to just one business owner, and she had a business for \nchildren's clothing, children's needs, children's toys. She had just a \ncouple employees, but she said: I have nothing to rebuild. I have no \nway that I can rebuild my business. I don't think I could rehire those \nemployees.\n  So there is the feeling of hopelessness and worry and dread and \nconcern on top of a very tough economy anyway. These are the businesses \nand families and farmers we need to help because we need them to \nrebuild. We need them to have the ability to rehire those employees, to \nproduce food for our families, to make sure we have thriving \ncommunities once again.\n  The last picture I wish to show is of Keene, up in the North Country. \nIn Keene, the river rose 22 feet above the flood stage, washing out \nroads and bridges, and it left much of the town actually stranded for \ndays. Half the town's firehouse was ripped apart and swept away by the \nriver.

We must stand with them in their greatest time of need.\n  Federal assistance is essential to help these families, these \nfarmers, these businesses, and communities not only recover but rebuild \nand be stronger than they were before.\n  We need immediate funding for FEMA and the USDA disaster assistance \nto provide relief for these communities all across New York and for all \nthe other States that were affected by these storms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/14/senate-section/article/S5593-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5593-S5594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SYRIA SANCTIONS ACT OF 2011\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I would now like to address a second \nissue that is causing me very grave concern. I would like to talk for a \nmoment about a piece of legislation I have introduced with Senators \nKirk and Lieberman to toughen the sanctions on Syria.\n  Syrian President Assad has killed over 2,000 of his own people in an \nalarming torrent of violence from one of the world's most repressive \nregimes--2,200 people are estimated to have died so far.\n  Assad's aggression against the Syrian people is matched by his \nsubversive aggression abroad. His regime is a state sponsor of \nterrorism, one of Iran's closest allies, and a key backer of Hamas and \nHezbollah. Assad's regime has for years helped foreign fighters enter \nIraq and kill our U.S. soldiers.\n  In response to this violent crackdown, I introduced the bipartisan \nSyria Sanctions Act of 2011 to hold Assad's regime accountable. This \nlegislation would block access to the U.S. market for companies that \ninvest in Syria's energy sector, purchase the county's oil, and sell \ngasoline to Syria. This sanction is critical, since Syria's energy \nsector accounts for one-third of that state's revenue.\n  I ask my colleagues to sponsor S. 1472 and send a clear message to \nSyria that until the Assad regime responds to the democratic urging of \nits people, halts its nuclear development, and ends support for \nterrorism, Syria will not and should not have access to the global \neconomy, and any company that does business with Syria will no longer \nhave access to the global economy.\n\n[[Page S5594]]\n\n  This legislation is very clear and simple: that no company should be \nallowed to put their profits before our national security.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise to speak about the need to have \na disaster assistance effort to support those in New York, your State, \nas well as across the country and the tremendous needs we have as a \nresult of what has happened regarding the weather. This year we have \nseen a terrible string of natural disasters that have shut down \nbusinesses, farms, and left families homeless all across our country. \nAs chair of the Agriculture Committee, I am particularly focused, of \ncourse, on what has happened to our farmers in America.\n  I am concerned about the flooding along the Mississippi and Missouri \nRivers, the record droughts that have devastated the livelihoods of men \nand women who grow our food all across America. Earlier this year we \nhad the worst drought in recorded history in Oklahoma, with about $1.6 \nbillion in crop losses. In Kansas I have had the opportunity, and my \nstaff has, to join with my ranking member, my colleague, Senator \nRoberts, to talk with folks and a chance to see that the drought had \nwiped out about $2 billion in crops.\n  Floods in the Mississippi River Valley washed over 3 million acres--3 \nmillion acres--of farmland. Hurricane Irene destroyed more than 450,000 \nacres of cotton and 300,000 acres of corn in North Carolina. In New \nYork we have seen similar damage to corn, soybeans, alfalfa, fruits, \nand vegetables. In Vermont crop losses are estimated at more than $5 \nmillion.\n  All across our country we have serious challenges that are creating \nhardships for our businesses, our farmers, and our families. We need to \nrespond. That is our responsibility. Right now the droughts are worse \nin Texas where the damage is also in the billions of dollars. We have \nmore than 1,000 homes that have been lost.\n  Already this year there have been natural disasters in 48 of our \nStates--48 out of 50 States have had natural disasters. Michigan, thank \ngoodness, is one of the two States that has not been affected by the \nweather. But throughout our Nation's history when men and women in one \npart of the country were hit with a natural disaster, all of America \ncame together to support them and to help rebuild.\n  That is what this effort is about, coming together as Americans. That \nis who we are as Americans. We stand with each other in times of \ntrouble. This is not the time to play politics, not when hundreds of \nthousands of families, farmers, and businesses have been devastated by \nan unprecedented string of floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, \nand other natural disasters.\n  Already, FEMA has had to halt rebuilding efforts in 41 States. So it \nis critical that we get this done. This legislation in front of us \nneeds to pass, and it needs to pass quickly.\n  But I also want to tell you about another emergency that has taken \nplace in my State and in too many other States. It is called a jobs \nemergency. We may not have been affected by the natural disasters of \nthe weather, but as we look over the last decade in a global economy, \nas the economy has changed we have been through the same kind of \ndevastation--over a longer period of time, but our people are affected \nas much as any other State disaster.\n  We have 14 million people out of work in this country--14 million \npeople out of work. We have a huge national deficit. We will never get \nout of debt with more than 14 million people out of work. We have to \nmake smart decisions on cutting what is not important, and we have to \ngrow. We have to create jobs for people and support the efforts of the \nprivate sector to create jobs.\n  For each and every one of those families, their job search is an \nemergency. It is an emergency every time they think about how to put \nfood on their table. It is an emergency every month when they have to \nscrape together money for the rent or the mortgage. It is an emergency \nevery minute of every day when those men and women are filling out \napplications, going to job fairs, trying their best to get back to \nwork.\n  So I find in the middle of all of this, in the middle of support for \nall that is going on around the country in terms of natural disasters, \nit is extremely concerning--and in fact outrageous to me--that the \nHouse Republicans have proposed a job-killing offset to pay for the \nhelp that is critically needed for natural disasters; that would pull \nthe rug out from under businesses and families all across our country \nand put up to 50,000 American jobs at risk. That is what they are \nproposing.\n  I absolutely oppose this. They propose paying for this critical \ndisaster bill by taking dollars out of a very successful advanced \nmanufacturing retooling program that we passed in the 2007 Energy \nbill--and it took a while to get it up and going. The previous \nadministration never administered it. I thank the Obama administration \nfor coming in in 2009 and beginning the process of putting it together \nand all of the rules it took, and so on. So it took a while to get up \nand going. It has not moved as fast as I would like at all. But, thank \ngoodness, the Obama administration saw it as a priority and has moved \nforward to put it in place.\n  So what has happened already? Well, these retooling loans have meant \n41,000 jobs in Tennessee, California, Indiana, Michigan, Delaware, \nIllinois, Kentucky, Ohio, and Missouri. These retooling loans have \nhelped companies retool older manufacturing plants to build the \nproducts of the future in America rather than shipping those jobs \noverseas. It has been extremely successful.\n  In Michigan retooling loans made it possible for Ford Motor Company \nto save 1,900 jobs at the Michigan assembly plant in the city of Wayne \nso they could build the all new Ford Focus and the battery-electric \nFocus in America. In the process of that, as we partnered with them on \nbattery funding as well--in the process of that, with the help of these \nretooling loans they are bringing jobs back from Mexico to support the \nwork they are doing on the new vehicles.\n  I do not know how many economic development efforts we can stand on \nthe Senate floor today and talk about in the Senate or House that are \nactually bringing jobs back from overseas. This is the program that the \nHouse Republicans want to cut. This loan--and it is a loan, so it has \nto be repaid--is allowing them to be able to have lower costs to be \nable to do the retooling on those older plants, to be able to make \nthese new high-tech vehicles.\n  As I said, in the case of the Ford Motor Company, they have saved \n1,900 jobs and are bringing jobs back from Mexico. Another Michigan \ncompany, Severstal North America, was able to secure a retooling loan \nto retool an old steel mill, the Rouge steel mill in Michigan, into a \ncutting-edge plant building advanced, high-strength steel for \nautomotive production.\n  Jobs here. That does not count what is happening in States across \nAmerica. That loan, along with private loans and a billion-dollar \ninvestment from the company, will help create over 2,500 constructive \njobs and will bring the total number of permanent manufacturing jobs at \nthat plant, again, to\n\n[[Page S5595]]\n\n1,900. That is a pretty good investment from a loan that is going to be \npaid back while creating jobs.\n  These are the kinds of things that we need to be doing--we need to be \ndoing--to address the jobs emergency that Michigan and States all \nacross the country are feeling and have been feeling. Right now there \nare 35 to 40,000 jobs at stake in this proposal by the House \nRepublicans.\n  We have other companies that want to use the retooling loans to make \nthings in America--in Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Louisiana, and \nFlorida. These loans are expected to be approved in the next few \nmonths. They are very close, and we would see 35 to 40,000 jobs \ndisappear--the opportunity for those jobs to disappear--if we were to \naccept the House proposal.\n  After the next round of manufacturing retooling loans, we could see \nanother 10,000 jobs created across the country. But if these retooling \nloans do not happen, those jobs will not happen either. To add insult \nto injury, these companies have been working closely with the \nDepartment of Energy, in some cases for several years, in order to \nqualify for these loans.\n  They have had to undergo the must rigorous screening to make sure the \nproducts and companies are in sound financial shape, as they should. We \nneed to make sure they are going through rigorous screening not only so \nthey can be successful but to make sure that we are making products in \nAmerica. It is an important project and partnership.\n  These companies have invested countless hours and, frankly, a lot of \nmoney to get these projects off the ground and to get to this point. As \nI indicated, we have a number of companies in States around the country \nthat are within a month or 2 months or 3 months from being able to \ncomplete the deal and create the jobs.\n  We are so close, and the rug will be pulled out from under not only \nthe companies but the communities and the families who are affected. \nThese businesses are America's job creators. They are doing the right \nthing. They want to invest in America. While others have been on the \nsidelines waiting, they have jumped in. They are committed to creating \njobs. They want to make things here, and they have moved through a \nprocess, spent time, money--a tremendous amount of time. In fact, in my \njudgment, it hasn't moved as fast as it should. But they are now at a \npoint to actually make it happen.\n  I am outraged that we would see an effort to end the creation of \nthese jobs. There is no question, as I said, that we have had a series \nof natural disasters, and families, businesses, and farmers who are \naffected across this country. Even though those natural disasters, \nfortunately for us, did not come to Michigan, I support the effort to \naddress them. We are all in this as Americans. But I will not--I will \nnot--support an effort that, in the process, takes tens of thousands of \njobs away, because the crisis for Michigan is a jobs crisis. We were \nthe first ones in it. We have been in it the longest. We are coming out \nof it now but way too slowly. We are coming out of it because we have \nbeen creating partnerships to support the private sector to make things \nin America again.\n  I strongly urge everyone involved not to come forward with something \nthat will in fact jeopardize these jobs. It makes absolutely no sense \nto me, and it is certainly something I will strongly oppose if it does.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that I speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              IRS Tax Scam\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, there is a tax scam that is \ngoing on in this country for which you certainly have to give some \ncreativity to these thieves and robbers--and that is exactly what they \nare.\n  I first started to get wind of this when people in the Tampa Bay \nregion of my State called in saying an interesting thing happened. They \nhad sent in their income tax return, and they got back a notice from \nthe IRS that their return had already been filed. What they found out \nwas that somebody had stolen their Social Security number, had in their \nname filled out a tax return, and then, guess what. It showed they had \na tax refund due.\n  When I started hearing from about 25 or 30 people, I knew there was \nsomething going on. Sure enough, law enforcement in the Tampa Bay \nregion--the sheriff's office, the city police, combined with the State \nattorney and the U.S. Attorney--a couple of weeks ago had a bust and \narrested 49 people who were in a scam whereby they procure people's \nSocial Security numbers. What is unbelievable is the amount of money \nthey were getting back, estimated at being, just in the Tampa Bay \nregion, something like $100 million in refunds. That is a rip-off of \nthe American taxpayer because that is their money.\n  But the story doesn't stop there. Oh, if you were one of the victims \nwhose Social Security number had been stolen and you wanted to file \nyour tax return, the IRS is telling you you can't do it because you \nhave already filed a tax return. Guess what a nightmare that is for the \nlegitimate taxpayer.\n  So we have filed legislation. A number of Senators have joined me. \nNo. 1, one of the unbelievable things was that it was difficult to get \nthe IRS to cooperate with the local and State law enforcement agencies, \nbecause the IRS is prohibited because of privacy from sharing any of \nthis information. And, of course, we want to protect the privacy of \npeople, but we also want to go after these crooks.\n  We had done it a few years ago with regard to inmates in the Federal \nprison system by allowing the IRS, under the law we passed back in \n2008, to cooperate with the Federal prison system in order to get the \ninmates who were filing false tax returns to get tax refunds. That was \nextended administratively into the State prison system with the IRS. \nBut then this has been taken to a new level, one in which it is a great \nrip-off of the taxpayers.\n  What was incredible is when the Tampa police department and the \nsheriff's department ended up arresting some of these people, it was as \nif they didn't know they had done anything wrong.\n  What is going on? They did not know they had done anything wrong, and \nthey are driving around in BMWs, with Rolex watches and gold chains all \nover them. It is the use of tools in the electronic age just the same \nas yesterday, when the thief used a crowbar to break in and steal \nsomebody's possessions. This has to stop.\n  What we do not know is the extent to which this is all over the \ncountry. So the first thing we have to do is get the legal ability for \nthe IRS, without divulging people's private financial information, to \nbe able to cooperate with local and State law enforcement and the U.S. \nattorney to be able to go after these people, to identify them so the \nU.S. attorney and the State attorney can prosecute.\n  Additionally, we have to help the victims. In this legislation we \nfiled, we say the IRS will give the victims a special PIN number so \nthey can file a return and that PIN number will identify them as a \nvictim and it will not be kicked out of the system.\n  Additionally, since so much of this is being done electronically, we \nhave to give the taxpayer the option to file what we called in the old \ndays a paper tax return and in the process see if we can stop this; \notherwise, if $100 million has been stolen from the American taxpayer \njust in the Tampa Bay region of Florida, you can imagine how extensive \nthis crime probably is across the entire country.\n  It is important we act and that we get to the bottom of it. If we \npass a law, a crook will try to figure out a way to get around it. But \nwhen somebody in this electronic age can just sit at a computer, steal \na Social Security number and then file a false tax return, enough is \nenough.\n\n[[Page S5596]]\n\n  It is my delight to see my colleague from Maryland. It looks as if he \nhas some good stuff to tell us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I am not sure it is good stuff, but it \nis what has happened in our State. I thank the Senator from Florida for \nhis leadership on so many of these issues and his comments on the floor \nof the Senate.\n  About 2 weeks ago, right before Hurricane Irene struck, I was at the \nMaryland Emergency Management Center located in Reisterstown, MD. I was \nwith Governor O'Malley, the Governor of our State, and other leaders. I \nsaw our team there to prepare the people of Maryland for the onslaught \nof Irene and later from Tropical Storm Lee. I saw Maryland preparing \nthe best it possibly could to minimize the risk to the people of our \nState from a natural storm. I saw the local officials do the right \nthing and tell people in our coastal areas to evacuate their homes \nbecause of the potential risk to life and property from this massive \nstorm.\n  I also saw another agency that was located right there, side by side \nwith the Maryland agencies, and that was FEMA, the Federal officials. \nThese were people I met for the first time. They were not from \nMaryland. They had come in from other States to help the people of \nMaryland and provided the expertise to our State officials so we could \nproperly prepare for this storm that was potentially damaging to the \npeople of Maryland. They were there.\n  I thank President Obama for declaring, before the storm hit, \nemergency declarations to Maryland so we could utilize Federal \nresources and we could take maximum steps to minimize the loss of life \nand property. It was the right thing to do.\n  I take this time on the floor--I am going to talk a little bit about \nthe damages that occurred in my State--to point out that we have always \ncome together as a nation to stand by those who have been devastated \nthrough these natural disasters. This has been a particularly rough \nyear. We have seen hurricanes and storms and tornadoes and flooding and \neven an earthquake on the east coast of the United States. This has \nchallenged our ability to respond in a timely way. We have a \nresponsibility to make sure our Federal agencies have the resources to \nrespond--how they were able to be about Maryland before the storm, \nduring the storm and after the storm and they are there now to help the \npeople of Maryland. Our governments--our local governments, our \nbusinesses, and our residents are counting on that continued Federal \npurpose to get us through this very difficult period.\n  Hurricane Irene caused severe storms, flooding, and strong winds in \nthe State of Maryland. It was followed by Tropical Storm Lee, which \naggravated the flooding and other damage throughout the State, \nincluding damage to roads, water treatment plants, and agriculture. Our \nagricultural community was hit hard. Our water treatment facilities, \nthe plants we depend upon to keep our waters clean and to keep our \nneighborhoods safe, were damaged severely by this storm. I have talked \nto our transportation people. Roads were knocked out. Damage was \ncaused.\n  On the Eastern Shore of Maryland, as I have already indicated, there \nwas a mandatory order for evacuation of Ocean City the weekend before \nthe Labor Day weekend, resulting in heavy economic losses during one of \nthe most profitable periods during the summer for that city. The \nflooding in Queen Anne's County destroyed railroad tracks. I have a \nphotograph. This is, by the way, railroad tracks. They have been \nknocked out by the hurricane. As you can see, this required emergency \nattention.\n  Multiple roads were closed and numerous homes were flooded in the \ntown of Millington after the Chester River flooded over its banks. In \nMillington, the wastewater treatment plant was disabled, also affecting \nthe residents in Kent County. The storm in Talbot County caused roads \nand pipeline damage.\n  Let me show you this photograph, if I might, because I think it \npoints out the problem. When that amount of water goes through the \nstorm pipes, it can cause significant damage because these pipes were \nnot able to handle the amount of water that was brought down by the \nhurricane and tropical storm. As a result, the pipes burst, causing the \nroad which the pipe was under to give way, bringing about a road \nclosure. That was terribly inconvenient, of course, to the people of \nthat area, the businesses, et cetera. I am showing an example in Talbot \nCounty, MD, on the Eastern Shore. We could show numerous other examples \nof the failure of stormwater management pipes as well as roads that had \nto be closed for public safety. In Caroline County, the towns of \nFederalsburg and Greensboro experienced major flooding of the Choptank \nRiver, including the malfunctioning of a wastewater treatment plant. In \nCecil and Harford Counties, Irene led to the opening of a significant \nnumber of floodgates at the Conowingo Dam, due to rising water levels \nfeeding in from the Susquehanna River. This was the first time the \nengineers took such measures since Tropical Storm Isabel hit Maryland \nin 2003. Opening the floodgates led to flooding and property damage in \nmany areas, and mandatory evacuation orders were issued for Port \nDeposit and Havre de Grace, in Maryland.\n  People had to leave their homes. The streets were underwater. When \nthe water receded, there was muck and damage to the towns.\n  In southern Maryland, damage from metal on a roof that was blown into \na transformer forced the shutdown of a reactor at Calvert Cliffs \nNuclear Power Plant. In Calvert County, many of the substations were \ndamaged and rendered inoperable during Irene, resulting in widespread \npower outages for many customers and that forced businesses to close \nfor several days. You heard about power outages. We had whole counties \nwhere everyone was out of power--everyone. In most of our counties the \nmajority of people lost their power, not for a couple hours, for many \ndays, causing major disruptions to our businesses, to our families, to \nschools that could not open and, therefore, parents who could not go to \nwork because they had to deal with the unexpected news that the schools \nwould be closed because there was no power in the schools themselves.\n  In the Washington metro region, Irene and the additional storms \ncaused severe power outages and flooding in Montgomery and Prince \nGeorge's Counties. In Prince George's County, the loss of power caused \nthousands of basements to flood. As you know, without power you cannot \nuse your sump pumps. Without that, there is significant damage.\n  Frankly, because the water came in from the low level rather than \nfrom the roof, these property owners are now being challenged as to \nwhether their insurance will cover this damage. That raises the \nimportance, I might say, of the Federal protections that are available \nwhen a disaster is declared an emergency by the President because of \nthe altercations over what insurance does not cover. All the more \nreason why the Federal Government must be there in its traditional role \nto help communities when a storm or emergency occurs.\n  Hurricane Irene and subsequent storms required governments to incur \nadditional expenses due to overtime needed for first responders who \nsave lives and property after the storm. I must tell you, I saw those \nfirst responders. I saw them out there working 24-hour shifts in some \ncases. They didn't get home to their families because they were there \nto help us maintain order and help reduce the loss of life and the loss \nof property. I thank President Obama for making a timely major disaster \ndeclaration for the State of Maryland in advance of the hurricane. \nMaryland is now eligible for Federal disaster recovery dollars through \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency. The State budget has already \nbeen very much impacted. We all understand our States do not have the \nflexibility of our country. It is during emergencies that our State and \nlocal leaders look to Washington, look to their Federal Government to \nbe there as a partner to deal with this issue that States cannot deal \nwith.\n  Congress has always acted in a bipartisan manner to help Americans \nand their communities recover from natural disasters. Congress has \nnever insisted that disaster fund being offset.\n  Let me explain this issue because it may be confusing to the people \nwho are watching. Yes, the Federal Emergency\n\n[[Page S5597]]\n\nManagement Agency has a budget. FEMA has a budget. But you cannot \npredict the number and scope of natural disasters. No one had predicted \nthis storm would be as widespread as it was. Hurricane Irene affected \nthe entire east coast of the United States. FEMA did not have in its \nbudget that type of a scenario, along with the tornadoes we had, along \nwith what has happened in the Midwest. During this period, we have seen \n48 of our States declared eligible for FEMA assistance. This affects \nour entire country. Now the people on the east coast of the United \nStates are looking to the Federal Government to be there. We have \nalways done this, as I said, in a bipartisan manner, without the \nrequirement that if additional moneys are needed, those moneys will be \nappropriated by Congress. We will not ask other agencies to have to \ncontribute toward that because that was not anticipated when we did the \nbudget. I might point out that we had a very contentious fight over the \nBudget Control Act. That is the bill we passed that allowed us to \nincrease our debt ceiling and set our budget allocations for fiscal \nyear 2012, the year that will start on October 1.\n\n  As you know, there was an agreement in that Budget Control Act that \npermits the modification of the fiscal year 2012 discretionary cap to \nbe adjusted to accommodate additional disaster relief funding without \nan offset. That is what we did. We came together as one entity \nrecognizing we cannot predict the next hurricane, storm, earthquake, \nflood, or tornado. We just cannot predict that. Therefore, Democrats \nand Republicans said adjust the cap. Meet whatever disaster is out \nthere. Whether it was Katrina in Louisiana, whether it is a bridge \nfalling down in Minnesota that the Presiding Officer had to deal with, \nwhether it is tornadoes as we had in the Midwest, droughts and floods \nthat occurred in our country, we will be there to help the people of \nAmerica. We helped rebuild countries around the world. We want to make \nsure we help the communities.\n  I was with my colleagues from Vermont, and they shared with us the \nnumber of bridges that had been wiped out, people who have been \nisolated as a result of Hurricane Irene and then Tropical Storm Lee. We \nhave a responsibility, and we recognize that in the budget agreement, \nthat we adjust the caps without setoffs so the Federal Government can \nbe there as a true partner in dealing with these issues. We were there \nfor preparation. It is now time to help restore the communities. In \nsome cases it will take months before we are back to normal. We know \nthat, the people know that, but they have a right to expect that the \nFederal Government will be there to help.\n  I commend Senator Landrieu, the chair of the Homeland Security \nSubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee; Senator Inouye and the \nmembers of the Senate Appropriations Committee. They recognize that. \nThey have given us a budget that will accommodate the extra needs so \nFEMA will have the resources it wants.\n  I thank President Obama. His budget request to us reflects the \nresources we need so we have the recommendation from our Appropriations \nCommittee. We have the leadership from the White House. Now it is time \nfor us to act. We have the vehicle on the floor of the Senate. It is \ntime for us to give the resources to the Federal agencies so they can \nbe there in all parts of this country--including helping the people of \nMaryland cope with the disaster of Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm \nLee and the other natural disasters that have happened in other parts \nof the country by--taking up this issue now, passing it at this moment \nso the funds are there and the resources are there.\n  We can live up to the historical mission of the United States to \nalways be there to help any part of our Nation affected by a natural \ndisaster. I hope we will be able to bring up this issue quickly. As the \nvote in the Senate Appropriations Committee indicated, it should not be \ndelayed because of offset issues. We should get the needed funds and \nresources to the agency, working with our State and local governments, \nworking for our local communities so we can try to restore and rebuild \nthose areas that have been devastated by these natural disasters. I \nwould urge us to do that as quickly as possible.\n  Mr. President, I would yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Tim O'keefe\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to bid a fond farewell to \na man who has been a fixture in the Senate for 33 years. Mr. Tim \nO'Keefe of the Senate Disbursing Office is retiring today after more \nthan three decades of service to this body and his country. Known to \nmany as a loyal friend and well liked by nearly everyone he has met in \nthese halls--including most of my colleagues and thousands of Senate \nstaffers--he will be greatly missed.\n  Tim began his career with the disbursing office, and in the Senate, \nin 1978. Every Senate employee becomes familiar with that office early \nin their tenure because that is the office in charge of the Senate \npayroll as well as everything relating to an employee's compensation, \npayroll deductions, retirement, life and health insurance, and other \nbenefits. The disbursing office used to be located in the Capitol when \nTim started. In fact, it was located in S-233, which is now part of the \nRepublican leader's office. During Tim's early years on the job, \nstaffers and Senators alike would line up in the hallways on payday to \nreceive their paychecks. Maybe that is how Tim became legendary for \nnever forgetting a face or a name for so many members of this very \nlarge Senate family, and always having a kind word for every one of \nthem.\n  The disbursing office moved in 1980 when my predecessor, Howard \nBaker, expanded the Republican leader's suite of offices. That is how \nTim and his coworkers ended up in their now familiar location on the \nfirst floor of the Hart Building. Tim has kidded me about that a few \ntimes over the years. So on behalf of the Republican leader's office, \nlet me take this opportunity to apologize to him for being booted from \nhis perch.\n  Tim is a native Washingtonian. He attended St. John's College High \nSchool and the University of South Carolina, which has a heck of a good \nfootball team this year. Just as Tim is loyal to the Senate, he is a \nloyal alumnus of both those institutions. He goes to Columbia, SC, \nevery year to see South Carolina play football. Tim is also a great fan \nof the Washington Redskins who, amazingly enough, are off to a good \nstart this year. He has season tickets, and has been attending their \ngames since his boyhood. He loves to talk football, college or pro, \nwith folks in the office, but be careful if you are a Cowboys fan.\n  Tim's father George O'Keefe was a distinguished veteran who fought in \nWorld War II. His mother Gisela O'Keefe worked for the District of \nColumbia school system at Alice Deal Middle School. I know they would \nboth be proud to see how well liked and well respected their son has \nbecome. Tim also has a brother, Dennis, who lives in South Carolina, \nand Tim lives in Alexandria with his teenaged son Connor.\n  When the disbursing office held a retirement party for Tim a few \nweeks ago, he got quite the sendoff. It was the day of the historic \nearthquake, felt all along eastern North America from Quebec City to \nAtlanta and centered about 90 miles away in central Virginia. As Tim \nwas opening his presents, the ground began to shake and the Capitol \ncomplex was soon evacuated. It is almost as if Washington, DC, itself \nwas protesting that it did not want Tim to go.\n  Indeed, it will be hard for many to imagine the Senate with Tim gone. \nHe has the longest tenure of anyone in the disbursing office today, and \nthousands of Senate staffers know him as the man who led them in the \nFederal oath of office they take on their first day on the job--the \nsame oath the Vice President of the United States administers to \nSenators at the beginning of their 6-year terms.\n  In his retirement, Tim will have time to pursue his many interests, \nincluding his love of horse racing. He is particularly a fan of \nLexington, Kentucky's Keeneland racetrack. And I would be\n\n[[Page S5598]]\n\nremiss if I didn't mention that today, the day of his retirement, is \nalso Tim's birthday.\n  I know many on Capitol Hill, after hearing about his retirement, have \ntaken a moment to say thank you and goodbye to Mr. Tim O'Keefe. I \nwanted to make sure I was one of them. He will be missed here in the \nSenate, and we are very grateful for his 33 years of service.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Poverty in America\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, yesterday the Census Bureau released \ninformation about poverty, income, and health insurance in our country, \nand the news was, in short, devastating. The number of people in \npoverty is at an all-time high. Income gains over the last decade have \nbeen totally wiped out. Americans are struggling more than ever before.\n  I am appalled by these facts and I know my colleagues are too. Today \nI wish to talk about these numbers, but I wish to talk about what we \ncan do about them and about where our country's priorities must be and \nhow we have to focus on rebuilding the middle class in light of the new \ncensus numbers.\n  Yesterday we learned that 46.2 million people in America were poor \nlast year. That is more than 15 percent of Americans. Let me remind my \ncolleagues what this means. The poverty line for a family of four with \ntwo adults and two children is $22,000--just slightly over $22,000 a \nyear. Can anyone here in this body--and we all know what we make; every \nSenator, every Congressman, except leadership who get paid a little bit \nmore, makes $174,000 a year. If we think to ourselves: Could we and our \nspouses and two children live on $22,000 a year, $425 a week? But, \nbeyond that, we also learned that deep poverty; that is, families with \nincomes less than half the poverty line, is also at the highest rate on \nrecord. More than 20 million Americans lived in deep poverty last year. \nThat is just over $11,000 a year for a family of four. That is almost \nmind-boggling. How do people live like that?\n  Our children are suffering incredibly high levels of poverty. The \nCensus Bureau pointed out that 22 percent--1 out of every 5 kids in \nAmerica--were poor last year. When compared to other industrialized \nnations--the OECD countries--the United States has one of the highest \nrates of child poverty in the world. That is inexcusable. It is a \nnational crisis. It is something we should be discussing here on the \nSenate floor daily.\n  In addition to our children, other vulnerable populations are \nsuffering as well. People with disabilities continue to face higher \npoverty than people without disabilities. About 28 percent--almost 1 \nout of 3 individuals with disabilities in America--are poor, compared \nwith 12.5 percent of those without disabilities. That is twice the \namount.\n  Minorities also face devastating levels of poverty. More than a \nquarter of Blacks and Hispanics--more than 25 percent or 1 in 4--are in \npoverty in America. Again, keep in mind, for a family of four, that is \njust $22,000 a year. So 25 percent of Blacks and Hispanics are in \npoverty, 10 percent of Whites, 13 percent of Asians. These disparities \nare deeply troubling. More than 10 million Black and Hispanic children \nwoke up this morning in a household struggling with poverty.\n  Again, we have to remember, while I talk about these as numbers, \nthere is a real story, there is a real family, a real individual, a \nreal child behind every one of them.\n  There are 46 million stories about families sitting around their \nkitchen table--if they are even lucky enough to have one--struggling to \nfigure out how to make ends meet, stories of people choosing between \nwhether to pay the rent or pay the utility bills, choosing whether to \npay for diapers or medication for their kids, choosing whether to put \nfood on the table or gasoline in the car--so they might get to a \nminimum wage, part-time job someplace. This should not be happening in \nAmerica.\n  We have heard a lot of talk and I have heard Senators and Members of \nthe House in speeches recently talking about how we cannot afford this \nand we cannot afford that because, let's face it, we are broke, we are \ndeeply in debt in this country and we are broke. I beg to differ. The \nUnited States of America is today the richest country in the world--the \nrichest country in the history of the world.\n  If we are so rich, why are we so broke? We are not poor. We are the \nrichest country in the world. So what this census report yesterday \npoints out is this is a wake-up call that we are failing. We are \nfailing our most vulnerable citizens. We are failing to provide a \nladder of opportunity for people to become part of the middle class. We \nare destroying futures, destroying hope among our children.\n  First and foremost, I think this report yesterday graphically \nillustrates how dangerous it would be if we as lawmakers give in to the \ncurrent atmosphere of budget hysteria--budget hysteria--fear, and \nfatalism that is now going on on Capitol Hill. By giving in to it, we \neviscerate the essential economic security programs just because \nsomehow we want to score political points.\n  Well, people all know that most people in poverty have a higher rate \nof not voting than wealthier people. We know that. So I guess, if you \nwant to get votes, you appeal to people who have money. If you want to \nget elected, you appeal to people who have money because they are the \nones who give you money to get elected by, like big corporations. So \nthe poor are kind of forgotten about. So if we give in to this budget \nhysteria, the first people who are usually hurt are the most vulnerable \nof our citizens.\n  The Census Bureau's numbers show, again, without question how \neffective and important these safety net programs are to keeping \nmillions of people out of poverty. Social Security alone--according to \nthe census numbers, kept 20 million people above the poverty line. \nUnemployment insurance kept 3.2 million more people out of poverty.\n  We have always known these are crucial programs, but now we know just \nhow important they are. And other programs, if they were counted by the \nofficial poverty measure, which they are not, would have lifted \nmillions more people out of poverty. For example, the SNAP program--\nfood stamps--would have lifted 3.9 million people above poverty. The \nearned-income tax credit would have lifted 5.4 million people. Without \nthese crucial safety net programs, the poverty situation would be much \nworse. Yet, mark my words, with this supercommittee that is meeting or \nwhether we go into some kind of a sequestration or whatever that means \naround here, are we going to cut back on the food stamp program, are we \ngoing to cut back on unemployment insurance, maybe cut back on Social \nSecurity, as some would want to do, and Social Security benefits? That \njust means more people will fall below the poverty line.\n  I think the second lesson we can learn from this report is about the \ncrippling effect falling paychecks and rising inequality are having on \nour economy. Income went down again last year. Real median household \nincome was $49,500. That is down 2.3 percent from the year before and \ndown 6.4 percent since the start of the recession. This is not just the \neffect of the recession; these are long-term economic trends that have \ncaused a dramatic increase in the income inequality in this country, \nand it has been going on for at least the last three decades, little \nbit by little bit by little bit, to the point now where we have a huge \ndisparity in income equality in this country.\n  Again, paychecks for American workers are not falling because they \nare not working as hard or producing less. According to testimony from \nformer Secretary of Labor Robert Reich to the HELP Committee, the \ntypical American family is working more than 500 hours longer per year \nnow than they were in 1979. Got that. The typical American family is \nworking 500 hours longer per year than they were in 1979. In addition \nto working longer, their productivity, as measured by the Bureau of \nLabor Statistics, has continued to rise.\n\n[[Page S5599]]\n\n  So what has happened? People are working longer. There is more \nproduction, more units per person per hour worked, and yet wages have \nfallen. Why is that? You would think wages and benefits would have gone \nup with longer hours and more productivity. Well, that is not what \nhappened. It is not that companies cannot afford to pay their workers \nmore. Profit margins of Standard & Poor's 500 companies are at their \nhighest levels since the late 1960s. So what has happened during the \nlast three decades, since 1979, is that the executives have shifted \nrevenues from workers' paychecks to the corporate bottom lines and \ntheir own pockets--more to profit, more to capital, less to labor.\n  We cannot allow these trends to continue. Economists across the \npolitical spectrum agree that a major cause of our current economic \nstagnation is a chronic lack of demand. For nearly three decades, \nworkers' incomes have been stagnant. Working families lack the \npurchasing power to drive America's consumer economy. Without adequate \ndemand, businesses are reluctant to invest and hire. Simply put, until \nwe raise the numbers on people's paychecks and the number of people \nworking and making a paycheck, the economy will never recover.\n  The final lesson I think we can learn from yesterday's census report \nis about health care. There is a small silver lining here. While the \nrecession is obviously continuing to impact health care coverage, there \nare some signs that the early stages of implementation of the \naffordable care act, that is, the health care reform bill, are making a \ndifference. While the census data shows that the number of uninsured \nincreased from 16.1 percent to 16.3 percent of the population--the \nCensus Bureau deemed this ``not statistically different''--the \naffordable care act's requirement that health plans provide dependent \ncoverage to young adults to stay on their parents' policy until age 26 \nis making a difference.\n  The data from the Census Bureau shows that the 18-to-24 age group was \nthe only group ``to experience a significant increase in the percentage \nwith health insurance over the past year,'' up to 72.8 percent from \n70.7 percent in 2009. So, again, there is a small silver lining there \nin terms of health care coverage for our younger population. So it is a \nmodest step forward for young Americans.\n  But the overall picture the census report reveals is a nation--the \nUnited States of America--on the brink of a crisis. It should be a call \nto action. I think the President's jobs bill is a good start. We have \nto create more jobs, not just any job but good-quality jobs that pay \ndecent wages and benefits, a job to lift a family out of poverty and \nnot to keep a family in it.\n  Again, I have been paying attention a little bit to some of the \ndebates that have been going on in the other party.\n  I was looking at the figures from the State of Texas that more jobs \nhave been created in Texas than any other part of the country. Well, \nwhen you look closely, Texas had by far the largest number of minimum \nwage jobs than any other state, and the number of minimum wage workers \nmore than doubled between 2007 and 2010. That is our future--minimum \nwage jobs at $7.25 an hour? That is barely $15,000 a year, under the \npoverty line for a family of four. Is that something to brag about, \nthat we are creating more minimum wage jobs that will just keep \nfamilies in poverty? As I said, we need jobs to lift families out of \npoverty, not keep them down, under the poverty level.\n  Lastly, I have said so many times here on the floor that we will not \nbe able to tackle the problem of poverty in this country until we have \na strong middle class and a clear path for people to become middle-\nclass citizens. That means we should invest more in education, more in \ninnovation, more in infrastructure-building in this country. It means \nrestoring a level playing field with fair taxation--fair taxation. To \nrepeat something the President said the other night--why should Warren \nBuffett pay less of a percentage of his income than his secretary? You \nwonder why people get cynical about government. Of course they are \ncynical. They have every reason to be cynical when we pass these laws \naround here and we tax capital at a lower rate than we tax labor. Why \nshould someone who is laboring and working be taxed at a higher rate \nthan a wealthy person who maybe invested a lot of money, and they are \nputting it all into capital gains, and they are paying a lower rate of \ntaxes than someone who is out there working for a living? Why is that \nfair?\n  Well, we also need vibrant unions, vibrant unions that can bargain \ncollectively for their people for wages, hours, conditions of \nemployment. We need a strong ladder of opportunity to give every \nAmerican access to the middle class.\n  So, again, yesterday's poverty numbers told a bleak story about 46 \nmillion Americans who cannot make ends meet. I hope that next year at \nthis time, when the new census numbers come out, we can begin to tell a \ndifferent story about how we acted boldly, with imagination and vision, \nto help these people turn their lives around and build a better future. \nIn a nation as strong and as vibrant and, yes, as rich--as rich--as the \nUnited States of America, no one who works hard for a living should \nhave to live in poverty, and we should not rest until that vision \nbecomes a reality.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Spirit of Cooperation\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, there has been a promising new tone in \nCongress since our return from the summer recess. It has taken some by \nsurprise. But even more striking than the new tone is that it has \nbrought with it a few modest signs of a new spirit of cooperation.\n  The House this week sent us the highway extension and an aviation \nextension that are clean. During August, there were clamors from some \ncorners in the other party to mount a fight over the gas tax or insist \non harmful cuts to road and bridge repair, even if these demands risked \na shutdown of road construction projects. As recently as last Friday, \nRepublicans were planning to insist on a 5-percent cut to the FAA \nbudget--a move that could well have threatened another shutdown of that \nagency like we saw in August. But both fears, fortunately, have \nreceded. Barring a setback in the Senate, we should be able to extend \nboth the FAA and highway measures on time and without controversy.\n  This is a very positive sign. There was a sour taste left in \neveryone's mouth at the end of the debt ceiling debate, and that is \ncausing a change in behavior. It is actually bringing us together. That \nprocess was made unnecessarily difficult because of the extreme tactics \nof a bloc within the House. The political process broke down and the \npublic noticed.\n  In the aftermath of that debate, it seems everybody finally realizes \nthere is a premium on reasonableness. The public does not want to see \nmore of the ``my way or the highway'' approach that has been exhibited \nby some in the House. That is why there was head scratching earlier \nthis week to hear a new rumor in the Capitol that the House Republican \nleadership might consider seeking to reopen the debt ceiling fight, \nignoring the agreed-upon spending level for the 2012 fiscal year. As \nyou know, the deal included a top-line budget number of $1.043 trillion \nfor the fiscal year that begins October 1. This was a significant cut, \nan actual cut from the fiscal 2011 level of $7 billion. This agreement \nwas ratified by all of those who voted for the final debt ceiling \nagreement. It was hailed as one of the better aspects of the overall \ndebt ceiling deal because it would mean a lesser likelihood of another \nbudget fight on September 30.\n  However, since this number was agreed to, some extreme Republicans \nhave started looking to cause trouble. They have tried to see the $7 \nbillion in cuts represented by the $1.043 trillion figure as a floor, \nnot a ceiling. This would be a violation not just of the spirit of the \ndebt limit deal but the letter of it.\n  The public will not stand for another budget fight. Republicans \nshould understand that more brinkmanship on\n\n[[Page S5600]]\n\nthe budget at the end of September is not in either side's interest. \nSome, thankfully, in the House leadership seem to realize this. \nMajority Leader Cantor, in a memo to the House Republican caucus sent \nin August, warned against picking another budget fight on the CR. \nLeader Cantor wrote:\n\n       While all of us would like to have seen a lower \n     discretionary appropriation ceiling for the upcoming fiscal \n     year, the debt limit agreement set a level of spending that \n     is a real cut from the current year. I believe it is in our \n     interest to enact into law full-year appropriation bills at \n     this new lower level.\n\n  Leader Cantor affirmed these remarks earlier this week:\n\n       I say to my Republican colleagues, a deal is a deal. It's \n     hard to imagine you would go back on the debt limit \n     agreement, but if you are even considering it, please stop.\n\n  We already will likely need to take time next week resolving what \nlevel of FEMA funding we should appropriate for fiscal year 2012. \nEarlier indications are that some House Republicans may want to \nshortchange the level of funding FEMA says it needs for next year. I \ncan't imagine why anyone would want to play games with disaster relief. \nBut if they want to debate that, they should not also be tying it to \nanother budget fight that we have already resolved and that nearly \ncaused a default for the first time in American history. We should not \ngo back over those pages. We have had enough debates on the docket \nwithout reopening the ones we have already done.\n  The public is tired of these fights, and the public understands who \nkeeps instigating them. To the House Republicans I say: Don't go back \non your word on the CR. Leader Cantor was right when he said in August \nyou should abide by the level agreed to over the summer. Stick with \nthat decision and let's move on to other issues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                      International Space Station\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am very happy to announce to \nthe Senate that today NASA announced its new, big rocket design, with \nthe President stepping forth to indicate that he will request funding \nfor the design and building of this rocket.\n  I want to take the opportunity to share with the Senate what this \nrocket is going to be. To set the stage, you will recall that we have \nthe International Space Station up in orbit now. There is a combination \nof six astronauts on board. It is an international crew. The space \nstation itself--people don't realize how big it is. If you think about \nsitting in a football stadium on the 50-yard line, and looking from one \nend zone to the other, that is how big the space station is--120 yards \nlong.\n  The space shuttle has been the vehicle that we have used now for 30 \nyears, the last 10 of which have been used to build the International \nSpace Station. The Russians have been taking up some components, but \nthe major components, the heavy components are being taken up in the \ncargo bay of the space shuttle and assembled over the last decade into \nthe station. We have six astronauts doing research in the zero gravity \nof orbit.\n  The future rockets going to and from the space station--a space taxi, \nif you will--are a competition among commercial rocket companies, and \nwe think that competition will bring down significantly the cost of \nthose rockets to take cargo and crew, and at the end of this year one \nversion of those rockets will in fact launch, rendezvous, and dock with \nthe space station and deliver cargo.\n  To make those human rated, with all of the redundancies and escape \nsystems to save human life, it is going to take another few years. Of \ncourse, it is a disappointment for so many of us that the new rocket, \nready to go to and from the space station, as the space shuttle used \nto, is not ready for humans, even though we are launching cargo. Thus, \nin the interim, we have to rely on the Russians with their spacecraft, \nwhich we have done before, because when the Space Shuttle Columbia was \ndestroyed on reentry back in 2003, for well over 2 years we were down \nand not flying the space shuttle, until we could make sure that it was \nfixed. We relied on the Russian Soyuz to get to and from the space \nstation.\n  All right, that is going to low-Earth orbit. But NASA, with its human \nspace program, has another mission. Now, with the nonmanned space \nprogram, we just launched to Jupiter, we just launched a mission to the \nMoon, next month we are going to launch a mission on Earth \nobservations, and before Thanksgiving we are launching a Volkswagen-\nsize Recovery to Mars, with six wheels powered by a plutonium source so \nit doesn't have to go to sleep in the Martian night. This will rove all \nover.\n  It has a pole that will stick up, with a laser, and it can zap rocks \nso we can analyze their chemical content. It has a big scooper that can \nalso get us additional samples. It has two eyes that will pop up as it \nroams around so we can see in real time the surface of Mars.\n  So we have a vigorous space program. But we still have to do what \nNASA is supposed to do; that is, leave the orbit of the Earth and \nventure out into the heavens with humans. That is what was announced \ntoday--announced by Senator Hutchison and myself, with NASA \nAdministrator General Charlie Bolden making the formal announcement. \nThe President has signed off on the specifics.\n  I am going to explain this rocket. But before I do, let me say there \nhave been a lot of critics saying: Oh, it will cost too much. Remember, \nlast year we passed the NASA bill unanimously in the Senate and passed \nit in the House with an overwhelming three-quarters vote. That set the \nparameters on the funding for this new rocket, and all of NASA's \nfigures have come in underneath those levels that we set in the NASA \nauthorization bill. Those are the numbers the Office of Management and \nBudget and the White House have scrubbed to make sure they are \nrealistic, and that is what has been announced today.\n\n  Here it is. This is the rocket. Just to give an idea of the scale of \nthis monster, the space shuttle in the stack, with the external tank \nand the two solids on either side, the tallest point of that stack is \nthe top of the external tank. From here that would come up to right \nthere. That gives an idea of how much larger this rocket is. This \nrocket will launch more payload than any rocket in America's space \nprogram and probably the Russian/Soviet space program, certainly, now. \nBack in the old Soviet days I don't think the Soviets had one that was \nanywhere near this one.\n  What this rocket has is a core, and this is a core with liquid \noxygen, liquid hydrogen fuel tank. It is taking the space shuttle \nengines--so we can keep the cost down, and a lot of this has already \nbeen developed--and putting five in the tail of this first stage. So \nfirst stage, liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen. But it is boosted on \neither side by those solid rocket boosters--in this case a new one. \nUnder the space shuttle it was four segments, but this one has five \nsegments. So it is elongated and gives more thrust. These, on future \nversions, will be competed as to whether it is going to be solid \nrockets--and, by the way, the consistency of this pencil eraser is what \nthe solid rocket material looks like--or whether those in the \ncompetition will be liquid boosters.\n  All right, that is the core. That comes up all the way to here. Then \nthere is the second stage. We have second-stage engines we have been \nusing in the past called the J-2. They are now updated with a new, more \npowerful version called the J-2X. So we have a lot of history on these \nengines. That is what is going to be the second stage, which then takes \nthe housing for a lot of the electronics, and then the capsule.\n  The tower at the top is an escape tower. We could actually have an \nexplosion right here on the pad, and the crew could survive because \nthey would eject in the full capsule, being thrust away from the \nexplosion, and then the parachutes would deploy and the crew saved; \nlikewise, we could save the crew on this rocket all the way to orbit. \nSo if there was a problem, we could still save the human life of the \nfour to seven astronauts who are going to be in this crew capsule. We \ncould save their lives, and that was one of the mandates after we lost \nColumbia in the reentry over Texas. The investigation board said: Build \na safer rocket, and certainly one that is more economical.\n  This is now on a schedule for its first test--this version. This is \nthe smaller version. This thing can evolve. This is\n\n[[Page S5601]]\n\nabout 70 to 77 tons. This thing can evolve to 150 tons, and then we are \ntalking about a monster. On this version they will test it on a \nschedule for 2017. They will have several other tests, and they are on \na schedule to put a crew into this rocket in 2021. They are then \nscheduled to rendezvous, or land, on an asteroid--this will be the \nfirst time that has ever been done--as a way of preparing us to then go \nto Mars.\n  So that is what NASA has announced today. I want to give great \ncredit--great, great credit--to Senator Hutchison. She has been the \nranking member and, alternately, chairman of the Subcommittee on \nScience and Space and is now the ranking member of the full Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation. She has been a princess in \nhelping guide, first of all, the NASA authorization bill and the \nfunding. Tomorrow, she and Senator Mikulski--the chair of the \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies of the \nCommittee on Appropriations--will be taking up NASA's budget as they \nget ready to come to the floor.\n  This rocket will now allow us to get out of low-Earth orbit, assemble \ncomponents--heavy components--that ultimately will take us out into the \nheavens exploring in ways we never have even started to design. \nRemember, 40 years ago we went to the Moon. That was quite an \naccomplishment. But the Moon is about 250,000 miles from Earth. With \nrockets like these, we are going to go far out into the heavens to \nexplore the origins of the universe, to explore that which we have \nnever even dreamed of, as we fulfill our destiny as a people who are \nexplorers and adventurers by nature.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in imploring \nCongress to provide needed assistance to our families, our communities, \nand our businesses suffering from the rash of natural disasters that \nhave hit our country hard this year.\n  While many of us who represent States on the east coast planned to \nspend our final week of our August work period traveling our State, \ntouring factories, stopping by schools, and visiting military bases, \nMother Nature had other plans.\n  We still traveled to our States, but we saw a very different scene: \nwhole streets and towns flooded, homes and businesses washed away from \ntheir foundations, destroyed crop fields, and constituents worried \nabout the loss of their homes and mourning their loved ones.\n  Over 2 weeks ago, Hurricane Irene barreled down our eastern seaboard, \nand early estimates suggest it could be one of the top 10 costliest \ndisasters in U.S. history. I am here to tell the story of North \nCarolina.\n  In the early morning of August 27, Irene first touched down over \neastern North Carolina's Outer Banks. Even before it made landfall, the \nstorm brought on several tornadoes along the coast that swept away \nentire homes.\n  This is a photo of what is left of three homes hit by tornadoes in \nTyrrell County. I was there, and it was truly devastating. One elderly \nman who had one of these homes was there the next day with a rake, \nforlorn look in his eyes, and said: The only thing I own now are the \nclothes on my back.\n  By the time Irene finally moved beyond the State of North Carolina, \nsix North Carolinians had been killed, storm surges 6 to 9 feet high \nhad flooded many towns, more than 500,000 were without power, and \ncountless homes, businesses, and schools had been destroyed or severely \ndamaged.\n  Fortunately, our State had prepared diligently for days leading up to \nthe storm, boarding up houses and businesses and declaring mandatory \nevacuations for tourists and residents in our most at-risk towns.\n  A lot of pundits woke after Irene hit and started saying: Hey, it \nwasn't that bad. I wish to invite those individuals to come to eastern \nNorth Carolina and see what I saw in the wake of Hurricane Irene.\n  I saw small business owners in downtown Manteo emptying stores they \nhave run for decades, tossing their waterlogged inventory, moving their \nfurniture to the curb, moving out carpet totally destroyed, and these \nbusiness owners wondering if it was even worth reopening their stores.\n  There was a bookstore, and a resident in the community came up to me \nand he said: Senator Hagan, I have raised my children by sitting on \nthis man's knees having books read to him day in and day out. We need \nthis bookstore back in Manteo.\n  I wish to be sure it gets there.\n  I also saw crops that had been beaten by wind and rain for 15 hours, \nand it looked like they had gone through the spin cycle of a washing \nmachine. I saw flooding in the fields so severe that Agricultural \nSecretary and former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack said it was the worst \nagricultural flooding he recalled seeing.\n  I saw families clearing and burning debris, pumping floodwater, \ntossing aside their soaked possessions that were beyond saving.\n  I also stood along Highway 12, eerily quiet, a highway that is \nusually busy with traffic, totally still at the point where Irene had \nleft a gaping hole, blocking any vehicle travel to and from Hatteras \nIsland and the towns of Rodanthe, Waves, Salvo, Avon, Buxton, Frisco, \nand Hatteras. We can clearly see the breach of the highway here. It \nactually breached in three separate points along Highway 12. The only \nway to get to the island now is by ferry; and, according to local \nreports, the line for that ferry was 15 miles long this weekend.\n  That is the picture in North Carolina. It is not the only picture. \nWhile there were scenes of destruction and loss, I also saw tremendous \nacts of determination and kindness. If winds and rains may have swept \naway our possessions, they also stirred up the best parts of North \nCarolina spirit. Our intrinsic devotion to community and to assisting \nthose in need produced countless heroes across our State the past 2 \nweeks.\n  Everywhere I went, I saw emergency workers, volunteer organizations, \nand members of the community reaching out to their neighbors in need. \nIn Craven and Tyrrell Counties, the American Red Cross and the North \nCarolina Baptist Men and Women provided hot meals. The North Carolina \nBaptist Men and Women were there, distributing 5,000 meals one \nafternoon when I was with them and also helping shelter and debris \nremoval for those affected by the hurricane.\n  The North Carolina National Guard activated 400 members--including a \nmember of my own staff who serves in the Guard--to provide emergency \nwater, food, and supplies to some of the hardest hit areas. Emergency \nworkers throughout the State continue to help families, businesses, and \nentire communities recover and rebuild.\n  While the people of the great State of North Carolina are committed \nto getting themselves and their neighbors back on their own feet, we \nhave to do the same in Congress. For the North Carolina families, \nfarmers, fishermen, educators, seniors, and small businesses struggling \nto recover, government assistance cannot come fast enough. It must not \nleave too soon.\n  Here is my bottom line: Congress must fully fund Irene recovery \nefforts now. But we must also fund the emergency funding needs in \ntornado-devastated Joplin, MO, and Alabama, and the flooded communities \nof the Midwest, also, and in the wildfire disaster currently in Texas.\n  Without a doubt, this year, our country has been ravaged by an \nunprecedented series of natural disasters. Since January 1, the \nPresident has issued disaster declarations in 48 States, and the \nhurricane season is far from over.\n  We are aware of this trend all too well in North Carolina. Just about \n4 months before Irene hit, 28 tornadoes touched down across central and \nsouthern North Carolina, the most severe weather to hit our State since \n1984. More than 20 North Carolinians were killed, 6,200 homes damaged, \nand about 440 homes were completely destroyed;\n\n[[Page S5602]]\n\n21 businesses, including the largest employer in the town of Sanford, \nwere demolished, with another 92 significantly damaged, leaving at \nleast 2,000 North Carolinians in that one area out of work. Shaw \nUniversity, located in downtown Raleigh, was forced to close for the \nremainder of the semester due to the immense damage to its campus.\n  We will never be able to predict the whims of Mother Nature, but we \nare able to prepare and prepare we must. Right now, FEMA's Disaster \nRelief Fund is running dangerously low. Even before Hurricane Irene \narrived we were using $400 million a month on disaster relief efforts. \nToday the fund is down to $377 million, not enough for a week of \nspending before Hurricane Irene hit, and we still have 3 weeks to go in \nthis fiscal year.\n\n  If we do not act now to fix this shortfall, millions of Americans \nwill be left behind. Already, FEMA is shifting funds away from vitally \nneeded reconstruction projects in previously hard-hit areas to what \nthey call ``immediate needs'' assistance. I do not believe any one of \nus wants to be in the position of telling one of our constituents--one \nof our small business owners, one of our school principals--that we \ncan't help because they are not considered an ``immediate need.'' \nAmerican victims of natural disasters should not be left at the mercy \nof a rob-Peter-to-pay-Paul system. That is not who we are as Americans.\n  We have a choice right now. In my mind and in the minds of all North \nCarolinians affected by the storms of Irene and the tornadoes that took \nplace in April, the choice is clear: Congress must make these FEMA \nsupplemental funds available.\n  The Budget Control Act that we passed in early August established \nstrict spending caps to get our fiscal house in order while also \nallowing for a limited amount of funds to be made available in case \ndisaster struck. Disaster struck, and now is the time to make those \nfunds available. Meeting these needs is not just a necessity for the \npeople of my State and many others, but it is also wholly consistent \nwith the fiscal discipline that we agreed on and voted on in August.\n  But FEMA funding is not enough. Our farmers in North Carolina and \nacross the eastern coast were devastated by Irene, and they are in \ndesperate need of assistance. North Carolina is an agricultural State. \nAgriculture generates about $78 billion a year in economic activity, \nand it employs close to one-fifth of the workers in North Carolina. Our \nagricultural industry, particularly our cotton and tobacco farmers, are \nin trouble.\n  At the end of the day, when all of the damage assessments are \ncompleted, our farmers could be out more than $400 million from \nHurricane Irene, and these crops were just getting ready to be \nharvested. Our farmers in our State absolutely cannot afford a blow \nlike this one. We in Congress need to work together so assistance from \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture can be expedited and delivered in a \ntimelier manner. We need to act soon.\n  I want to end with a story from my State that I believe is \nparticularly relevant at this time when communities across the country \nare in the process of recovery. Back in April, one of the most \nrecognizable scenes from the post-tornado coverage was of a Lowe's \nstore in Sanford, NC. Unlike with Irene, there were few warnings of the \ntornado's arrival. But when Michael Hollowell, the store manager, saw \nthe storm approaching his store--and it was very fast--he calmly moved \nevery customer to the back corner where he knew--because he had been \ntrained--they would be the safest. I saw that Lowe's the very next day.\n  This is what that store looked like. It was completely demolished. \nBut every single person in the store when the storm hit was alive. Mike \nHollowell is a hero, not just to those people in the Lowe's store but \nto people all over North Carolina. Last week, not even 5 months after \nthis devastation, that same Lowe's reopened, and it reopened with 2,000 \nmore square feet than it had before. It just shows that North \nCarolinians and people across the country are committed to a recovery \nthat will leave our communities better than ever.\n  The people of this great country are stronger than any storm. They \nwill rebuild and recover. But that process may take many months, it may \ntake many years. As their representatives, we have a responsibility to \nprovide a reliable, comprehensive program of relief for that duration. \nTo do any less is a dereliction of duty.\n  I call on all my colleagues to pass this FEMA supplemental bill as \nsoon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Stimulus Bill\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, in recent days the President has \nrepeatedly told Congress to pass the stimulus package immediately. This \nbegan during his joint address to Congress last week when he said at \none point:\n\n       I am sending this Congress a plan that you should pass \n     right away. You should pass this jobs plan right away. Pass \n     this jobs bill--pass this jobs bill.\n\n  Immediately following the President's joint address to the Congress, \nPress Secretary Jay Carney declared:\n\n       The President will submit a bill early next week, the \n     American Jobs Act, which will specify how he proposes paying \n     for the American Jobs Act.\n\n  As ranking Republican on the Budget Committee and wrestling with \nthese difficult issues--I know Senator Cardin is a member of the \ncommittee--we tried to figure out what this means and how much money \nthe spending will be. But the bill that was transmitted to Congress \nMonday afternoon does not contain any fiscal tables, costs for any of \nhis provisions, actually how those provisions will be paid for and when \nthe pay-for will occur, or even an overall pricetag for the bill.\n  How can the President call on Congress to ``pass this bill \nimmediately'' when no one even knows how much it will cost or where the \nmoney is coming from?\n  I sent a letter yesterday to the President's Director of the Office \nof Management and Budget, Jack Lew, asking that this information be \nprovided to the Congress at once. But so far we have had no response. \nPart of the reason we need this information is that the total cost of \nthe President's bill may be much higher than advertised. That has been \nthe pattern around here. No one should be surprised. When the President \nsaid his plan would be ``paid for,'' he did not specify if he meant the \ntotal cost--to include increased interest resulting from the borrowed \nmoney to be spent immediately--or just the cost of the jobs provisions \nalone, actually how much goes out the door. Depending on whether the \nmoney is spent out and when it is paid back--assuming it is ever paid \nback--interest costs resulting from just this bill's borrowing could \ntop $100 billion. In other words, the interest on the money over the \n10-year window, the 10-year budget we are talking about--if we spend \n$450 billion now, we pay interest on that money. It is borrowed money. \nPeople loan us the money and we pay interest. Interest rates alone \nnow--CBO projects them to go up, our Congressional Budget Office. \nCertainly they will. They are extraordinarily low today. But, at any \nrate, we could easily see the interest on this money over 10 years \nreaching $100 billion.\n\n  The problem with looking at it as a 10-year scenario is that the debt \nis probably not going to be paid off in 10 years. Most of the debts we \nrun up will be part of our deficit. If we want to raise taxes to fund a \nnew program, maybe we ought to raise taxes to pay off the debt we have \ninstead of spending it on a new program. The debt we have distributes \nAmerican wealth to people who hold our debt all over the world.\n  In my letter to OMB, I request tables showing the year-by-year data \nfor this bill's budgetary impact, including projected changes to the \ndeficit for each of the next 10 years. In other words, how will it play \nout? If we spend $450 billion in 1, 2, or 3 years, how much does that \nrun up the debt? When does the repayment begin? How will it be paid, \nand at what rate? If the President wants to advocate for a sharp, near-\nterm increase in the deficit in exchange for the possibility of some \nundefined economic future, with the possibility of a\n\n[[Page S5603]]\n\nstimulus, he ought to make that argument clearly to the American \npeople.\n  I believe the President also needs to be honest in admitting that the \nbill's short-term costs would wipe out--obliterate--the $7 billion in \nsavings next year resulting from the debt limit deal. In other words, \nwe went through this long, painful exercise that resulted in an \nagreement in the eleventh hour and the 59th minute to save $900 \nbillion, and then, hopefully, form a committee that would save another \n$1.1 trillion to $1.5 trillion, only a fraction of this $2.1 billion in \nsavings, of the $13 trillion the Congressional Budget Office tells us \nwill be added to the debt in the next 10 years. So it would save a \nlittle over $2 trillion over 10 years but, at the same time, we are \nrunning up over $10 trillion in debt. So it is not a big enough step. \nIt is a step. There is progress. I certainly respect that, but it \nwasn't much.\n  To show us how small it is, next year we are projected, under the \nagreement Congress ratified, to reduce spending by $7 billion. That is \nall. That is all it would be reduced from this year to next year in \nactual spending levels. So I ask my colleagues: Don't we need to be \ncareful? After all the effort we took to achieve that much savings, \nshouldn't we think very carefully about a new stimulus plan that would \nspend $450 billion, obliterating that savings? I think we should. But, \nat any rate, we do need to know precisely how much it is going to cost \nand precisely how the money would be spent.\n  Let's flash back to February. The Office of Management and Budget \nDirector, Jack Lew, said this. This was when the President submitted \nhis budget for the next 10 years. It was brought up here on the floor \nof the Senate. In fact, I brought it up. It was voted down 97 to \nnothing. But this is what Mr. Lew said about that budget:\n\n       Our budget will get us, over the next several years, to the \n     point where we can look the American people in the eye and \n     say we're not adding to the debt anymore; we're spending \n     money that we have each year, and then we can work on \n     bringing down the national debt.\n\n  We all know there is a certain amount of political license people get \nto utilize in the political world, and exaggeration sometimes is \nforgiven. But let me tell my colleagues, this is the Office of \nManagement and Budget talking about the President's budget that he had \njust submitted to Congress. He said:\n\n       Our budget will get us, over the next several years, to the \n     point where we can look the American people in the eye and \n     say we're not adding to the debt anymore; we're spending \n     money that we have each year, and then we can work on \n     bringing down our national debt.\n\n  What is the truth? The Congressional Budget Office scored this \nbudgetary plan and this is what they concluded: that over a 10-year \nperiod there would be huge deficits every single year. In about year 6 \nor 7, the lowest deficit would occur--$750 billion would be the lowest \nannual deficit that would occur--and by the 10th year we would be back \nup to $1 trillion. President Bush's largest deficit he ever had was \n$450 billion and he was criticized for that. So we are going to have \nthe lowest--and he says this is going to pay down the debt and wouldn't \nbe adding more to the debt if we passed his budget, when his budget \nspent more, taxed more, and ran up more debt. I believe this is the \nmost irresponsible budget ever submitted to the Congress of the United \nStates, at a time of national crisis, when all experts are telling us \nthe greatest threat to our national security is our debt.\n  Forgive me if I want to see the fine print on this legislation, when \nan administration tells us that--and the President said very similar \nthings; the President himself said very similar things--we would not be \nadding more to the debt.\n  We in Congress raised the legal debt limit--I did not vote for that \nparticular bill--but we have breached, I am afraid, our economic debt \nlimit. America's $14.5 trillion gross debt is now 100 percent of our \nGDP, our economy. Experts tell us we have already crossed a dangerous \nthreshold. Our debt is pulling down growth and putting a damper on job \ncreation right now.\n  We have to ask ourselves: Can we continue to borrow, running up even \nmore debt in the hope that we can spend it today in a sugar-high type \nstimulus to create jobs in the short run? The Congressional Budget \nOffice scored the first stimulus package 2 years ago that has come \nnowhere near achieving what was promised for it. They said, OK, if you \nspend $825 billion now, you will get some short-term economic benefit, \nbut scored over a decade, we would have an economic decline. The net \ngrowth of the United States would be less over 10 years than if we \ndidn't pass a stimulus package at all. When we get up to 100 percent of \nGDP, I submit it is even more dangerous to keep running up debt.\n  This is a dilemma. We are in a fix. The economy is not growing the \nway we wish it to grow. CBO was projecting in January of this year that \neconomic growth for the first 6 months would be about 2.9 percent. We \nwere hoping that would be true. But what happened? The first quarter of \nthis fiscal year it was .4 percent--not 2 percent, not 2.9 percent--and \nthe second quarter was extremely low also. We have averaged about 1 \npercent growth the first half of this year.\n  We want to do something to help this economy grow. I submit we should \ndo everything we can that would help our economy grow now that does not \nrun up the debt. What are some of those things? Producing more energy \nat home, creating jobs here; pumping more energy supply which could \nbring down the cost of energy. We can bring down the cost of energy, \ncreate jobs, create tax revenue, and create growth that way. We should \neliminate every regulation that is not beneficial to this economy, and \nthere are a lot of them. Some regulations are good. Many of them add \ncosts to the entire economy for little or no benefit. We need to have \nthe kind of tax reform of a permanent nature that creates confidence in \nour economy--the kind of tax reform that advances economic growth \nrather than increasing taxes to give Washington more money.\n  Those are my suggestions about how to deal with this. First and \nforemost, we are going to look at this proposal. We certainly are \nworried about the status of the economy today. We are deeply \ndisappointed in the job numbers that continue to fall and, hopefully, \nwe will find the key to changing that. But fundamentally the economy \nwill come back and jobs will come back when growth occurs and growth \nwill occur not in the public sector but in the private sector. We need \nto ask ourselves what it is we can do to create a better climate for \ngrowth and job creation. We need to be rigorous in analyzing the \nPresident's proposal, and to look at the details of it and how much it \nis going to cost and how we plan to pay it back. I think at a very \nminimum, we are entitled to that.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nAlabama who has come to the floor. We see the world differently, but we \nboth acknowledge we are at a moment where action is the only \nalternative. Doing nothing is unacceptable. When President Obama came \nto speak to us in a joint session of Congress last week, that is what \nhe told us. He basically said, Let's roll up our sleeves, work \ntogether, both parties in Congress, for a change, and do something \nabout this economy.\n  There are 14 million Americans out of work. The report now from the \nJoint Economic Committee and others cites the highest level of poverty \nin our country in decades; the problems working families are having \nweek to week, month to month, and year to year, falling behind, despite \nall of their hard work. Their wages aren't rising to keep up with the \ncost of living. Many are surviving paycheck to paycheck.\n  A survey was taken recently across America asking working families \nthe following question: Could you come up with $2,000 in 30 days if you \nhad to, either from savings or borrowing it? Fifty-three percent of \nworking families said yes and 47 percent said no. That is how close to \nthe edge almost half of working families are living. A $2,000 medical \nbill at an emergency room is almost nothing these days--it is for a \nminor injury--and these families could not come up with it. That is \nwhat they are facing. That is why the President said let us focus on \ndoing things that will help these families and equally, if not more \nimportantly, help small businesses create jobs.\n\n[[Page S5604]]\n\n  There is no argument here about creating an army of government jobs. \nThat is not even on the table. The President is not proposing that. \nHere is what he said: Let's give a tax cut, a payroll tax cut to \nworking individuals so they have more take-home pay. I took a look at \nwhat it would mean in the State of Illinois. It would mean that for the \naverage income, which is $53,000 a year, that family would get $1,400 \nin tax cuts or $120 a month. I think it is worth something to working \nfamilies to have that much more in their pockets to meet the needs of \ntheir families and perhaps make some critical purchases for their \nchildren, for their future, whatever it might be. That is a tax cut the \nPresident has proposed.\n\n  He also proposed a tax cut for small businesses if they will hire \nunemployed people, a tax credit of up to $4,000 to hire these folks, \ntake them off the unemployed rolls, and put them to work.\n  I went to several job centers during the August recess. One was in \nMcHenry, IL, and one was in Elgin, IL. I spent the better part of the \nday sitting with unemployed people and talking to them. You ought to go \nthere. If you think unemployed Americans--the 14 million on whom we \nhear the statistics--are living the life of luxury on their \nunemployment checks, they are not. Most of them are struggling to \nsurvive, and many of them come each day to a job center to brush up \ntheir resume, to find out the latest people asking for new workers and \nput in new applications day after day. Many of them are discouraged \nafter submitting hundreds of applications with no response. Some go \nback to school. I met a few who really made the right life choice by \ngoing back to take courses at community college, where they could \nafford it, or at job-training centers where there would be no charge to \nthem, so they could pick up a new skill in an area in which they could \nget a job. That is the reality. The President is trying to create tax \nincentives for small businesses to hire those people.\n  Usually the Republicans who come to the floor applaud tax cuts. My \nexperience is that they are for tax cuts when times are good and bad, \nbut this time they are against these tax cuts. What is the difference \nbetween these tax cuts and the ones the Republicans historically \nsupport? There are two differences: The President's tax cuts are \nfocused on middle-income families, not the wealthiest, and they are the \nPresident's tax cuts. Those are the two differences.\n  I hope some on the Republican side will reflect on the fact, as the \nPresident said, that the American people are not going to reward us for \nour campaign rhetoric if this economy does not turn around. They want \nus to work together to solve the problems facing our economy. They want \ntax cuts for working families. They want small businesses to have an \nincentive to hire people. They want us to focus on creating good-paying \njobs here at home. What kinds of jobs? Building America.\n  As the President said, if we are going to succeed in this world, we \nneed to outeducate our competitors, outinnovate our competitors, and \noutbuild them.\n  I went to China over Easter. What is happening in that country is \nincredible. They are building in every direction--building cranes and \nconstruction activity everywhere. They are building the infrastructure \nin China to become the No. 1 economic power of the world in the 21st \ncentury. What are we doing? We are hearing speech after speech saying \nthat because of the deficit, we cannot invest in America. Some say we \ncannot invest in education. They argue that we cannot invest in \nresearch, we cannot invest in building America. I think they are wrong.\n  The deficit is a serious challenge. Even the Bowles-Simpson \nCommission, which I served on and voted for, said: When you get serious \nabout cutting spending, do it when this recession is behind you. They \nknow, we know you can't balance the budget with 14 million Americans \nout of work.\n  Let me say a word about the safety net in America. I made a visit in \nChampagne, IL, to a food-distributing operation. They distribute food \nto pantries and soup kitchens all around central Illinois. \nUnfortunately, their business has never been better. More and more \nfamilies are showing up in these places for a helping hand. I went in \nthere to hear how they are doing. They are getting a lot of help from \nthe private sector that donates food that is near expiration, for \nexample, and a lot of contributions from churches and charitable \nindividuals. It is very heartwarming to see it.\n  As I went to tour this place, there was a young woman there. She was \nan attractive, well-dressed woman. I assumed she worked for this food \ndepository. She said to me that she had a job in a local school \ndistrict as a teacher's aide. I was a little bit puzzled as to whether \nshe was on the board of directors or what her connection was. She came \nthere to tell me that as a single mom with two little kids, even with a \njob in the school district, which she was happy to have, she still \nneeded food stamps to put food on the table every day for her kids.\n  I don't think Americans--those of us lucky enough to never have to \nworry about the next meal--know what families are going through, \nworking families struggling with low income, trying to keep their kids \nwell-fed and to do what every parent wants to do. More and more of \nthese families are going to soup kitchens very quietly because that is \na meal they don't have to pay for. They are going to the pantries to \npick up the groceries. I have seen them in one of the nicest and most \nprosperous counties in my State, DuPage County. I went to the pantries \nthere, and I saw the people coming through the door. You would not be \nable to pick them out, but they are working families who need a helping \nhand. That is the reality. That is why the safety net is so important.\n  I am troubled that so many people today are on food stamps. I am not \ntroubled that they are on food stamps; I am troubled because they have \nto be on food stamps. I hear critics come to the floor who say: There \nare too darned many people on food stamps. There is something wrong \nhere.\n  What is wrong is not the food stamps; what is wrong is hunger and \nlow-income and working families struggling to get by paycheck to \npaycheck. That is what is wrong. The number of Americans now qualifying \nfor this food stamp assistance is even going up among those who are \nemployed, such as the lady I met in Champagne, IL. That is a reality.\n  Something else is happening too. As more and more people lose their \njobs, they lose their health insurance. When I sit down with the \nunemployed, that is one of the first items that comes up. Once you have \nlost that health insurance premium your employer helps you pay, most \nfolks can't afford it. It is just way beyond them. So they are out \nthere without insurance, and they are vulnerable. Some of them have \nsick kids, chronically ill children, and they worry about it. They go \nto the free clinics. We are seeing more and more working families \nshowing up at free clinics across America. That is a reality of this \neconomy too.\n  When we talk about cutting spending on Medicaid, keep in mind who \nreceives Medicaid payments in America. In my State of Illinois, 36 \npercent of Illinois children are covered by Medicaid insurance. When it \ncomes to births in the State of Illinois, 52 percent of all births in \nIllinois are paid for by Medicaid. But the biggest single expense in \nMedicaid is neither one of those. Mr. President, 20 percent of the \nMedicaid recipients in my State account for 60 percent of the cost of \nthe program: the elderly--parents, grandparents, great-grandparents in \nnursing homes and convalescent centers, on Medicare and broke and stay \nthere because Medicaid steps in and helps them keep things together, so \nthey have at least some care and some attention in the late years of \ntheir lives. When we talk about cutting spending in Medicaid, we are \ntalking about hurting the most vulnerable people in America: children, \nsuch as the kids of that single mom I met; those who need prenatal care \nso their babies will be healthy; and, of course, the elderly who are \nstuck in that situation.\n  The same thing is true with Medicare. I understand Medicare costs are \ngoing up dramatically. I also understand the number of people under \nSocial Security and Medicare is going to rise as baby boomers reach \nthat age. But we have to take care that at the end of the day we \nprotect the basic premiums and benefits that are presently available \nunder Medicare. For a lot of\n\n[[Page S5605]]\n\nseniors, it is their only health insurance. It is what keeps them \nindependent and strong. We can't compromise that basic protection by \nprivatizing Medicare or raising the cost of Medicare beyond the reach \nof senior citizens.\n  Finally, when it comes to Social Security, let me just say that this \nis a program which means a lot. For 70 percent of Social Security \nrecipients, it is a majority of their retirement. For 25 percent of the \nSocial Security recipients, it is all they get. That is it. So guarding \nSocial Security and protecting its future is important for our parents \nand grandparents. It is important for our country and for its future as \nwell.\n  The President came forward, and he said: This is my jobs bill. This \nis what I think will help move America forward, put more spending power \nin the hands of working families, create incentives for small \nbusinesses to hire people, focus on putting firefighters, cops, and \nteachers back to work. That is a priority in our country for sure, and \ninvesting in building in America.\n  One of the few lines the President had that got a bipartisan standing \novation--and there were not many last Thursday--was when he said it is \nan embarrassment that 10 percent of our returning veterans are \nunemployed. Let's put our veterans back to work. That is part of our \nPresident's plan.\n  When I listened to the Senator from Alabama--he doesn't like the way \nthe President is paying for the plan, but he does pay for it. How does \nhe pay for it? One thing he does is he reduces the Federal subsidy to \noil and gas companies. Filled your tank lately? Take a look at what \nthey are charging at the pump. In Illinois and most places, it is over \n$4. That is translating into the highest reported profits in the \nhistory of American business. Oil companies have never ever had it so \ngood. President Obama has said--and I agree with him--that if there \nwere ever a moment in time when the Federal subsidies to these oil \ncompanies should come to an end, this is it. The money saved should go \nto small businesses and families across America in this difficult \neconomy.\n  The President also believes--and I agree with him--that the \nwealthiest among us, those who are most comfortable, should be asked to \nshare in the sacrifice. There are some on the other side who would not \naccept one penny more in taxes on the wealthiest people in America. I \ndon't get it. As I travel around Illinois, a lot of families are \nsacrificing in this tough economy. They know they have to. It is the \nonly way they are going to make it. They know that some of the \ngovernment programs which have been around in the past are not going to \nbe there in the future or may be not as generous.\n  If working families and middle-class families across America accept \nthat reality, why can't the wealthiest families in America accept it \ntoo? Honestly, I think they can. By and large, the people I know who \nare blessed with a lot of wealth and a pretty comfortable life have \nsaid to me: Senator, I don't need all of this. I don't need all of that \nSocial Security payment. I can get by without it. I don't mind paying a \nlittle more in taxes.\n  Those are the people I run into. But you hear from the other side \nthat is totally unacceptable. Some of them have said the President's \nplan is going to fall flat on its face because it taxes the wealthy in \nAmerica. I think the wealthy should pay their fair share, and I think \nthe President's plan is an honest, good plan that moves us forward. So \nfor those who are critical of it, give me your alternative.\n  I wrote down here what the Senator from Alabama suggested. He wants \nmore energy produced here at home. I am for that. I think we ought to \ngo to places where it is environmentally responsible and produce more \nenergy here in the United States. But I will say two things to keep in \nmind:\n  No. 1, all of the known oil and gas reserves in the United States of \nAmerica that we could reach onshore and offshore equal 3 percent of the \nknown oil and gas reserves in the world. Each year, the United States \nof America consumes 25 percent of the oil and gas consumed in the \nworld.\n  We cannot drill our way into energy independence. We can expand the \nbase and do it in an environmentally responsible way, perhaps find \nbetter sources, newer sources for things such as natural gas, but this \nis not the answer to our prayers.\n  Secondly, moving toward energy efficiency is not only good for the \nenvironment, it is good for the bottom line for a family and for a \nbusiness, promoting efficiency.\n  My wife and I take a little pride in the fact that we own a car, a \nFord Fusion Hybrid, and we were kind of patting ourselves on the back a \nlittle bit. As we came back from vacation in Michigan, we were getting \n36 miles a gallon. We felt pretty good about it. I was bragging to my \nfriends about it, and now I am bragging on the Senate floor. It can be \ndone. We can create more fuel-efficient vehicles. We didn't compromise \nanything, and we bought American.\n  I think that is what we need to encourage in this country: cars and \nother energy-saving equipment made in this country, creating jobs, \nreducing the need for energy to be imported from overseas and reducing \nthe pollution that, unfortunately, hinders our environment and our \nhealth. I think that is a good thing.\n  So on the Senator's first point, sure, more energy at home, but put \nit in perspective. That is not the answer to America's economic needs.\n  The second point he says is to eliminate certain regulations. That \ncould be true. I am sure the President agrees there are regulations now \nthat don't make any sense. Get rid of them. I am not sure this is a big \nball and chain being dragged around by our economy, but there is no \nsense in wasting time or money on regulations that really don't serve a \ngood public purpose.\n  The final point he said--and I couldn't agree more--tax reform. We \nlose $1.2 trillion a year to the Tax Code. Credits and deductions and \nexclusions and special favors written in the Tax Code for businesses \nand individuals have to come to an end. I actually think that is a good \nway to raise revenue and maybe even reduce marginal tax rates for \ncorporations and individuals in the process.\n\n  That is what Bowles-Simpson said. So even my friend from Alabama who \nspoke earlier--even he and I can find some common ground. I hope he \nwill agree with me and the President: doing nothing is unacceptable. \nThe President has said: No more games, no more delay, no more politics. \nDo something. That is the message I got in August, as I returned to \nIllinois. It is a message I hope my colleagues share as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                            A Second Opinion\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I do almost on a \nweekly basis, to talk about the health care law and, I do that as a \nphysician, someone who has practiced medicine in Wyoming for a quarter \nof a century, taking care of Wyoming families. I come to the floor \nbecause I have great concerns about this health care law.\n  We know--history proves--that landmark pieces of legislation written \nin Congress often contain drafting errors at one stage or another \nduring the bill's development. This is one of the main reasons most \nlandmark bills are written and negotiated in an open and transparent \nmanner. Writing and negotiating bills in this way helps Members of \nCongress minimize mistakes. It helps uncover any unintentional \nconsequences. It helps fix problems. This is done through rigorous \ncommittee and floor debate, as well as House-Senate conference \ncommittees, as the bills go through the process.\n  Most importantly, doing something in an open and transparent manner \ngives the American people, the folks at home, an opportunity to read a \nbill, to study it, to think about it, to discuss it during townhall \nmeetings with their Members, and ask questions and weigh in.\n  Well, unfortunately, we all know the largest health care law ever \nenacted did not undergo an open, transparent, or bipartisan process. \nPresident Obama\n\n[[Page S5606]]\n\npromised the American people they could watch the discussions and the \nwriting process--he said--on C-SPAN. Well, instead, the President and \nDemocrat leaders in both the House and the Senate sealed themselves \nbehind closed doors. Their strategy? Pass sweeping health care \nlegislation based on stealth and speed. Use sound bites to sell America \nabout expanding coverage, about cutting costs, about improving quality, \nand then offer very few details explaining exactly how the bill would \nimpact individual Americans, nor what it would cost the country.\n  Well, while this entire strategy was being played out, the President \nand Washington Democrats were writing the legislation behind closed \ndoors. Why? Well, to limit the time the bills could be read and \nreviewed by the American public. Some in Washington thought rushing a \nhealth care bill into law before America could read it was the perfect \nway to avoid public debate and public questioning.\n  Many of us recall when former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi \ninfamously said: First, you have to pass the bill to find out what is \nin it. Well, the President passed his health care law, and the American \npeople continue, on a daily basis, to find out what is in it. They do \nnot like it, and it is easy to understand why.\n  As the American people had a chance to read the details, they started \nasking more questions. The numbers simply were not adding up. Health \ncare costs, they were seeing, were going up, even though the President \npromised that health care costs would go down. There were costly \nmandates on small employers, and that was going to discourage hiring. \nNancy Pelosi said they would hire 400,000 people immediately. They have \nnot been hired. She said 4 million new workers would be hired \nultimately. We have not seen it yet.\n  Mandates we have seen come out of the health care law do nothing to \nspur economic growth and help the 9.1 percent of individuals \nnationwide--14 million Americans--who are currently unemployed and are \nlooking for work. Then there are even more government orders forcing \nindividuals to buy one-size-fits-all, government-approved insurance or \nface a fine.\n  The American people have had 17 months to find out what is in the \nPresident's health care law. One news report after another has been \nuncovering a laundry list of so-called glitches in the health care law. \nWell, former Speaker Pelosi wanted the American people to find out what \nwas in the law, and 17 months later the American people are finding out \nthat the President and Washington Democrats did not even write it \ncorrectly.\n  On Wednesday, September 7, of this year, Investor's Business Daily \nprinted an article titled, ``Oops! No ObamaCare Tax Credit Via Federal \nExchanges?'' The article explains that the way ObamaCare was written, \nindividuals who qualify for a taxpayer-funded subsidy to buy \ngovernment-approved health insurance in the new State exchanges may not \nget it. Section 1311 of the health care law requires the States to set \nup a State-run ``exchange.'' This State-based exchange is a place where \nindividuals can use their government subsidy to buy health insurance. \nNow, if a State declines to set up their own exchange, then section \n1321 mandates that the Federal Government set it up and run it for \nthem.\n  Here is the catch: The health care law, as written, as signed by the \nPresident, explicitly says the taxpayer-funded subsidies can only go to \npeople who are enrolled in exchanges set up by the State. Nowhere does \nthe health care law mention that the subsidy can be given to people \nenrolled in the Federal exchange.\n  So the American people are now finding out that their family might \nactually qualify for government help to buy health insurance, but they \nare not going to receive the help. Instead, individuals enrolled in \nfederally run exchanges could be forced to buy health insurance that, \nabsolutely, they cannot afford.\n  Not only might this law cause individuals to spend money they do not \nhave, the law may also offer taxpayer-funded subsidies to people who do \nnot actually need it. Let me repeat that. The law may actually offer \ntaxpayer-funded subsidies to people who do not actually need it.\n  At a time when our country can hardly afford to spend money we do not \nhave, Medicare's Chief Actuary, Richard Foster, exposed yet another \nglitch in the President's health care law. The law allows approximately \n3 million middle-class early retirees to qualify for Medicaid. Well, \nMedicaid is a safety net program designed to help low-income Americans.\n  Here is how this one works: The health care law defines how the \nFederal Government will set an individual's Medicaid eligibility. The \ncalculations are all based on income. Here is the glitch: The health \ncare law excludes a large part of an individual's Social Security \nincome from that calculation. Well, today, Federal low-income \nassistance programs are required to count Social Security benefits as \npart of an individual's income. Thanks to the health care law, early \nretirees earning up to $58,840 a year could now be eligible for \nMedicaid.\n  Here is what Mr. Foster said in an Associated Press article. He said:\n\n       I don't generally comment on the pros or cons of policy, \n     but that just doesn't make sense.\n\n  This is the Chief Actuary of Medicare. ``I don't generally comment,'' \nhe says, ``on the pros or cons of policy, but that just doesn't make \nsense.''\n  Well, I agree. That is why I cosponsored legislation introduced by \nSenator Mike Enzi closing this loophole. Senator Enzi's bill, S. 1376, \nchanges the health care law subsidy eligibility calculation to include \nall nontaxable Social Security income.\n  The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimate if we enacted Senator Enzi's bill, we will save the Federal \nGovernment and the American people about $13 billion. The Senate should \nimmediately take up S. 1376 and pass it. This is $13 billion we can \nsave right now, today. Let's show the American people that when we see \nour country spending money that it shouldn't, we will take a stand, \ncollectively as a Senate, and stop it.\n  These examples--these two examples--inevitably beg the question: What \nnext? Clearly, the self-described ``most transparent Administration in \nhistory'' has a lot of explaining to do. I do not believe my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle, who wrote this very flawed health care \nlaw--and they did it behind closed doors--I do not think they knew what \nthey were doing when they wrote these provisions. How do I know that? \nWell, if they understood how devastating their policies would be, I \nthink they might have had second thoughts.\n  How many more disruptive, ticking time bombs are there lurking in \nthis law and in the regulations that still have not been written about \nthis health care law that was signed a year and a half ago? We do not \nknow. We do not know because many of the provisions do not even go into \neffect until the year 2014 or later.\n  As a physician who has practiced medicine a long time, cared for \npatients all around the State of Wyoming, been active in the Wyoming \nhealth fairs, bringing low-cost health screenings to people all around \nthe Cowboy State, I intend to fight each and every day in this Senate \nto make sure the American people will not have to find out what kind of \nadditional ticking time bombs there are in the health care law. That is \nbecause I am more committed than ever to repeal the health care law and \nreplace it with patient-centered care, replace it with health care \nreforms that help American families get the care they need, from the \ndoctor they want, at a price they can afford.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know we have had several speeches over \nthe last couple of hours on very important topics--the jobs bill, our \nefforts to stimulate the recovery, a response from one of our \nDemocratic leaders to Senator Sessions, and the good Senator who was \njust speaking talking about health care--but I have\n\n[[Page S5607]]\n\ncome to focus our attention, if I could, again this afternoon on a \nparticular issue. We spent most of yesterday talking about a matter \nthat is absolutely right at hand; that is, disaster relief funding and \ncalling on this Senate and the House of Representatives to focus some \nimmediate and comprehensive thought and attention on this subject, \nwhich is affecting so many of our constituents--Republicans, Democrats, \nand Independents--in big cities, small towns, and rural areas all over \nthis country.\n  In fact, this is the first year in our memory and in, I think, the \nrecorded recent history, we have had a Presidentially declared disaster \nin 48 of our 50 States. Just a few days ago, we along the eastern \nseaboard and the gulf coast, where I am from representing Louisiana, \nsuffered from the original hit and then remnants of Tropical Storm Lee \nand then Hurricane Irene.\n  There are some Senators who joined me in a press conference earlier \ntoday. I think it was the Senator from North Carolina who said it has \nactually been three disasters: an economic disaster, in terms of an \neconomy that is weak and fragile and we are doing our best to lift it \nand to strengthen it, and then Tropical Storm Lee and then Hurricane \nIrene.\n  It has been millions and millions of dollars of damage. \nUnfortunately, we on the gulf coast tragically are getting to be \nexperts in this field because we, as Senators and House Members from \nthe gulf coast, have battled multiple disasters over this last decade. \nKatrina and Rita, which broke all records, surpassed any planning this \ngovernment has ever done.\n  We had a FEMA that showed up not ready, not comprehensive enough in \nits view. Our people have suffered. But we have made a lot of changes \nsince then, and here we are today with actually a better FEMA, from all \naccounts. I wish to give a lot of credit to this administration, \nparticularly, and not just Homeland Security. But the Cabinet of this \nPresident has been extraordinary in their reasonableness when it comes \nto this subject.\n  I have seen the opposite. So I think I am in a position to see the \ndifference. It is a big difference in this Obama administration in \nterms of the Cabinet. They want to say yes to disaster victims. They \ndid not want to say no. That is very important. They cannot always say \nyes to everything, to rebuild every building, repave every street, \nelevate every home. But they are trying to say yes. Most importantly, \nthe lawyers have been instructed to find a way forward, as opposed to \ninstruction that came from the last administration which was to find a \nway to say no.\n  So let me give credit where credit is due, to the Obama \nadministration and their willingness to be flexible, to be forward \nleaning, to have attorneys who are trying to be on the side of the \ntaxpayer, on the side of the victims, and not shortchanging people in \ntimes of desperate need.\n  Having said that, the administration cannot do it all on its own. \nThey need Congress, as the Constitution says, to provide the funding so \nthe executive branch can do its job. The executive branch, by all \naccounts, even Republicans have come to the floor from States that have \nbeen hard hit and said: It is a more muscular FEMA, it is a more \ndynamic FEMA, it is a more flexible FEMA.\n  I wish to thank Senators Lieberman and Collins. They are the \nauthorizers. Yes, I have had a part of it--others have, but they have \nworked tirelessly after Katrina and the disaster that happened on the \ngulf coast, where we were all shamed when we saw what did not happen \nthat should have.\n  We fixed a lot of it, and that is something to be happy and proud \nabout. When government does set its mind to improve things, it can. But \nwe cannot do anything without the funding. Right now, FEMA is empty. \nThe pot of money is empty. Projects, millions, hundreds of millions of \ndollars today, not just in my State but in California, in Tennessee, in \nIowa, in Texas, and in North Dakota--and I could go on and on--but for \nthe Record let me say a couple.\n  In Tennessee, mitigation of private residences from the 2010 floods \nhas been halted. For those who might not be familiar with the word \n``mitigation,'' which most people are, it means one could be elevating \ntheir house, one could be putting shutters or storm windows on their \nwindows. Let's see what else. A person could be potentially \nstrengthening the frame of their house if they are trying to mitigate \nagainst high winds from a tornado. There are rules that allow people to \ntry to improve their home so the next time it happens not only are they \nnot homeless, but taxpayers are not paying again for the same sort of \nincident.\n  The Federal Government, under good policy, requires a certain portion \nof all disaster funding to be specific, to go to mitigation because \ntaxpayers think, when we are trying to rebuild from a flood or a storm \nor a tornado or a bridge collapse, do not just build the same old \nthing, try to mitigate so it does not happen again. That is smart \nbecause then we are not double, triple spending taxpayer money.\n  But in Tennessee this family, let's say, is in the middle of \nelevating their home. Let's say they have gotten it off the ground by 2 \nfeet, and the contractor showed up on Monday. They were sent home \nbecause this project has been stopped. So somewhere there are homes in \nTennessee--I am not sure in what particular community--where private \nsector contractors, many small business owners and their employees, \nshowed up to work and were told: Go home. FEMA is out of money.\n  We have to fix this this week before we leave and, if not, at the \nlatest by next week.\n  In Iowa, repairs for an electric utility--I am not sure who provides \nutilities in Iowa. Potentially, it may be, as in my State in rural \nareas, the local rural co-op. Everybody knows what a rural co-op is. \nTheir project has been shut down. Potentially, people are still \nreceiving electricity. I do not think people are sitting in the dark. I \nam hoping not. But whatever they were planning to repair and fix in \nIowa has been halted because we have run out of money.\n  In Texas, repairs to the University of Texas medical facility have \nbeen stopped. In Louisiana, roadway construction has been stopped. In \nfact, there was an article in our paper, the Times-Picayune, just this \nweek that said $100 million for Jefferson Parish--$100 million--that is \njust 1 of my parishes, 1 of 64, the suburban parish that sits right \nbeside Orleans that was very hard hit by these storms, not as hard as \nOrleans Parish but received billions of dollars of damage--those \nprojects have been put on hold while we move that money to help the \nvictims in the Northeast. That should not be the case.\n  We need to act quickly to refill the FEMA funds. In addition, I \nunderstand in North Dakota and in other places there are problems. It \nis not just the DRF. The Corps of Engineers in its budget last year did \nnot have enough money for emergencies. I slipped out of the Chamber a \nfew minutes ago to go actually meet with the mayor of Grand Isle, who \nwas here, as he is quite often, advocating on behalf of the only \nbarrier island that is inhabited in the State of Louisiana, and he \nbrought up pictures. Again, they are too small to see, but I am going \nto have them blown up for tomorrow. But I have in my hand pictures of \nthe levees that were just ripped up and destroyed again from Tropical \nStorm Lee. These were levees on the gulf that we just completed.\n  But because the Corps of Engineers, when they rebuild levees, in \ntheir authorizing legislation are prohibited--which makes no sense \nwhatsoever, it is a complete waste of taxpayer money--they are \nprohibited from betterment. They can build back what was there, but \nthey cannot build it better or higher, unless they are directed to do \nso.\n  I am about ready to direct them because I am tired, on behalf of my \npeople and the people of this country and the taxpayers, from \nrebuilding levees 10 times in a matter of 5 years. It is a waste of \nmoney--it is aggravating to the people whose homes are behind these \nlevees--because we do not even have a policy, when we are building \nlevees, to be ordered to build them stronger, higher, except, of \ncourse, in the case of some levee systems in Katrina. That was \nspecifically directed, and it is being done.\n  We are building around the city of New Orleans a much stronger, much \nbetter system. One would think that would be being done all over the \ncountry. It is not. Why? Because we are\n\n[[Page S5608]]\n\nshort on funding, short on political will, and short on imagination and \ncreativity when it comes to building infrastructure in this country. I, \nfor one, am tired of it. So are the people I represent.\n  I am asking the other side of the aisle to step up and to provide \nfunding, funding that is not offset in the middle of a disaster. We \nwill figure out how to pay for these later--these disaster funds later. \nBut as I think Senator Leahy said so eloquently in our press conference \ntoday: Do the Republicans, some people in the Republican Party, \nactually believe we want fire departments all over the United States, \nwhen someone's house is on fire and they show up with the engines, to \ndebate in the middle of the street how they are going to pay for the \nextra overtime to put out the fire? I do not think so.\n  Even if the fire department is broke, even if the funding has run \nout, we do not want to have a debate over how they are going to pay for \novertime when the fire is burning. Put the fire out. Bring the people \nto safety. Put the families in shelter. Then go back to the city \ncouncil meeting next week and they can debate for as long as they want \nhow they are going to ultimately pay for it.\n  We paid for World War II, obviously. It was a long time ago. It is \ncompletely paid for. We paid for World War I. We are paying for \nAfghanistan. We are paying for Iraq, which, by the way, not one, \nsingle, solitary Republican--and not many Democrats, for that matter, \nbut not one Republican whom I can recall stood and asked or debated for \n5 seconds how we were going to pay for the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  But when the people of Vermont stand in front of their bridges \ncollapsed, their homes collapsed, their schools collapsed, and say: We \nneed help, we have to have now a month-long debate on how we are going \nto pay for it. We have not done this since the 1800s.\n  We will eventually pay for it. America has to pay for everything. We \nwill pay for it. We do not have to have that debate now. What we do \nhave to have a debate about is how do we repair levees and what is the \nbest way to mitigate it. What are the new technologies that can be used \nto make our communities stronger and smarter? How can we streamline the \nprocess? How can we eliminate the redtape? How can we get help to \npeople faster? That is what we should be debating.\n  Instead, I have Cantor and Boehner making us argue about what offsets \nthere are. So I have to go to the State of Maryland and say: Senator, \nwhat can you give up this year in your State? I have to go to Michigan: \nWhat can you up in Michigan? I have to go to California: What can you \ngive up in California, so we can pay for people who are underwater in \nVermont and North Carolina?\n  What kind of government is this? I do not want to be a part of that \nand I am not going to be. So we have to fund these disasters now. The \nsaddest thing about all this--it is sad and it is also puzzling and it \nis perplexing and it is aggravating is that we already sort of made \nthis deal 1 month ago, when we negotiated that big agreement we all \ncame to, about how the levels of funding would be for 2012.\n  Everybody remembers that, before we left for August, and we had this \nbig knock-down, drag-out--in that agreement, our leadership, \nRepublicans and Democrats, already agreed to do something that I think \nis very smart. I want to show what they agreed to. They agreed--because \nit is a puzzlement--how do we fund in advance disasters, how do we know \nhow much to set aside. It is a problem because every year is different.\n  I wish to show what our problem is, so people listening can give me \ntheir own suggestions about how to solve it. In 2003, we set aside, in \nthe whole budget of the United States--we can see this a little bit--\n$800 million for disasters. But we had $1.7 billion. So we were short \n$984 million. We funded it. That went on our books.\n  The next year we said: Well, this year we had $1.7 billion in \ndisasters. So the next year we put $1.8 in our bill, thinking we would \ncover it because last year was $1.7. But, lo and behold, we had an \nadditional $3 billion worth of disaster funding. We did not know these \ndisasters were going to happen.\n  So the next year we increased the amount of money in our base budget. \nThen, lo and behold, in that year, we put in $2 billion dollars. \nKatrina hit.\n  The levees broke. Do you know what the bill came in for? It was $43 \nbillion. We had budgeted $2 billion because in the history of the past \nthat is all we needed to cover disasters. It went from $2 billion to \n$43 billion. Who would have had a crystal ball to know that? Did we sit \nand debate? Some people tried to, until I said there was no way I was \ngoing to have to find a $43 billion offset before we can let the people \nof the gulf coast know that help was on the way. We spent what was \nrequired to help the gulf coast.\n  You can see the next year here. These numbers are very erratic, \nunpredictable. So what our leadership did, looking back on these 10 \nyears and listening to the debate and argument, was come up with a \npretty good plan. They said, OK, we will throw out the high number, we \nwill throw out the low number--in 2009 we didn't have any emergencies. \nCan you imagine 1 year that you have no declared emergencies, and the \nnext year you have one in almost every State? That is how erratic this \nis. It is not as though we are not trying to plan. It is just \nimpossible by the nature of what an emergency or disaster is. You can \nplan for them, but you cannot always predict how many you are going to \nhave and where they will be. Of course, everybody understands that.\n  What our leaders did is they threw out the top one and the bottom one \nand came up with an average. That average is about $11 billion--a very \nreasonable approach. So they put in our agreement that we made 30 days \nago--we said, OK, next year, this is what the Federal Government can \nspend and, in addition to that, you can go up to the average. You can \nspend an additional $11 billion, which is a very small amount of money \ncompared to the whole Federal budget.\n  You would think we would not be having this debate. Why? The need is \nvery evident, the history would dictate that we don't have debate over \ndisasters, and the Republican and Democratic leadership has already \nprovided a way, over and above our 2012 numbers, to pay for these \ndisasters.\n  I ask this: Why are we having to fight for this? That is a very good \nquestion. I think it is because some people on the other side of the \naisle think this is a good thing to fight about. They think they have \nto find a pay-for for everything we do even, as I have described, when \nyou cannot predict. Even if you do plan responsibly, you never know, as \nin the cases of Katrina, Rita, and Wilma. But our leadership negotiated \na way forward.\n  Yet we have people all over the country looking to the Republican \nleadership and listening to Representative Cantor and to Speaker \nBoehner saying: I want to help you, ladies and gentlemen, but we have \nto find an offset.\n  I think people might say: Why didn't we hear that when they sent \ntroops into Afghanistan or Iraq? Why didn't we hear that when they are \nrebuilding Iraq and Afghanistan? The same people are not yelling and \nscreaming--or didn't do it when we went in there. I think we have a \ngood point.\n  I am saying I am proud of the Senate for last night, with Democrats \nmostly--and, yes, about 8 Republicans--who voted to move this debate \nforward. I thank particularly Senator Blunt from Missouri, who is an \noutspoken leader on the Appropriations Committee, for the need to act \nnow, act quickly, to fund the DRF, the Corps of Engineers. Of course, \nMissouri has had terrible tornadoes and flooding. Not only did they \nhave Joplin, but they had the great flood of the Mississippi River, \nwhich was the highest in 50 years. It was so high along our capital \ncity when I visited our mayor a couple months ago--that is Baton Rouge, \nwhich is our largest city, since 100,000 people left New Orleans to \nliterally live on higher ground, although it has broken their hearts \nand divided their families. They have moved to Baton Rouge, as we are \nrebuilding levees and our flood control is stronger in the southeastern \npart of our State. People spend time walking on levees and riding bikes \non the levees. Of course, mechanical vehicles are not allowed. You \ncannot have cars, trucks, and four-wheelers because that would be \ndestructive to our levees. Our levees are quite huge. They are almost \nlike linear parks. For the first time in the history of anybody who can \nremember, the mayor had to declare that\n\n[[Page S5609]]\n\neveryone stay off the levees because the water was so high and seeping \nthrough. We literally thought maybe some of these great levee systems \nwould breach. Happily, they did not. It was a frightening situation for \nmillions and millions.\n  In some parts of Missouri, and other parts north of us, the levees \ndid breach. Sometimes the levees will blow to protect other areas. It \nis frightening if your business is behind one of those levees, as North \nDakota residents know all too well.\n  Nonetheless, we should not be debating this. I hope our bill will \npass this week and get over to the House for a quick vote. If the House \ndecides to send us a continuing resolution, please, I want the \nleadership to hear clearly what I am saying--and I will send them a \nmessage by letter in the next few minutes--please do not think you can \nnickel and dime recovery efforts, that you can fund it 6 weeks at a \ntime, or 4 weeks at a time. Disaster recovery doesn't operate that way. \nOur mayors, Governors, the Republican Governor of New Jersey, the \nRepublican Governor of Virginia, the mayor of Patterson, who was with \nus today, and mayors up along the east coast who are with their people \nevery day--the mayor of Joplin, MO, who has to be able to know that he \ncan plan a year out or 2 years out--having to rebuild an entire town is \noverwhelming even if you have the money and the plan. Can you imagine \nif you sort of have a plan, but you don't know if the Federal \nGovernment will provide you money? Do you know the frustrating council \nmeetings and school board meetings that will be had, and they will say, \nwell, the Republican party in Washington cannot figure out if we should \nget funding, but it is 6 weeks at a time?\n  I will not allow that to happen. I am going to draw the line in the \nsand right now. You may get around me on it, but it will take a huge \neffort to get around this desk on that subject--a huge effort. If I \nhave to shut the Senate down--and I have done it before--I will do it \nagain, because I can tell you, as much as my name is Mary Landrieu, you \ncannot rebuild communities with 6-week plans. It took us 2 years to put \ntogether the Road Home Program--2 years after we got the funding. The \nreason we could not put it together before was--even though Mississippi \nhad their money because President Bush gave it to them right away but \nmade the people of Louisiana wait--because Congress would not decide \nhow much money to give us. No mayor, no Governor, no matter how great \nthey are, no matter how smart they are, no matter how many engineers \nthey have, no matter how many Rotary Clubs are helping, no matter what \nthe chamber of commerce is doing, I am telling you that it cannot be \ndone without a reliable source of funding, so the planners can say \nsomething like this: We lost eight schools in this flood. They bring \nthe community together--and these are how these discussions go--and say \nwe might not have money to build all eight, but we have money to build \nsix. Which six do you want to build, and where, what materials do you \nwant to use, and which kids should go to which schools?\n  I have been in these meetings. I am not going to allow the mayors and \nGovernors to call their people together and say we lost six schools and \nwe don't know when the money is coming to build them, and we cannot \nmake any plans because the Republican leadership has decided that every \n6 weeks they are going to let us know how much money we are going to \nget.\n  That is not going to happen.\n  I want Speaker Boehner to think about this, and I want Mitch \nMcConnell to think about this, and I want the Republican leadership to \nthink about it. I will negotiate on the top number. I will talk about \nmaybe FEMA doesn't need quite this much. I will talk about maybe the \nCorps of Engineers doesn't need that much. But I will not, under any \ncircumstances, agree to a 6-week or 4-week continuing resolution. You \nmay run the Government of the United States that way. We have, \nunfortunately, gotten used to it. That is a sad commentary, I might \nsay, that we run the greatest government ever created in the eyes and \nvision and hearts of mankind, but we operate it on a 6-week basis. That \nmight be the game we play with the government, but I am not going to \nallow that game to be played with people who have lost their homes, \nlost their businesses, and who look up from a storm and say, my gosh, \nwhat happened to me? Then they don't know what is going to happen \nbecause we cannot make a decision that lasts more than 6 months or a \nyear. So the minimum will be 6 months. I hope we can find the will to \ndo a whole year, because without that you are going to shut down \nrecovery operations at a time when it is heartbreaking to think of \nsmall business owners who have lost their print shop or their dress \nstore or their shoe store, and they see everybody talking about \ncreating jobs. They used to have three of them last week--selling \nprinting material or selling shoes or whatever--and they are trying to \nget their business back, and we cannot decide--even though we have the \nmoney, even though we already budgeted the money, and although we \nalready made an agreement about how we would do this--we are going to \nstill argue.\n  I will tell you, if this is on the tea party's agenda, I suggest they \ntake it off. If it is somebody else's agenda, please speak up. I have \nnot had one single Republican Senator come down and defend this \nposition, because it is indefensible. I hope when the leadership is \nnegotiating--and they are doing so now--they will hear me in summary \nvery quickly: The FEMA pot is empty. The Corps of Engineers is always \nrunning on fumes. Levees are breaking and flooding, and it is occurring \nin places that haven't flooded in a hundred years. When we wake up and \nrealize that we have to put more money in emergency funding and be \nthere when our people are hurting, as they are now--and we will \neventually pay for this; we don't have to figure that out in the next \n30 days. We have to give them a green light and the billions of dollars \nthey need to operate for a year. Everything else is negotiable. But \nthis is not going to be negotiated. We are not going to rebuild pieces \nof 48 States 4 weeks at a time. That will not happen. Whatever amount \nof money we give, let it be for as long as we can make it, let it be as \nrobust as it can possibly be, and let's give a green light to our \nRepublican Governors, Republican mayors, Independents, and Democrats \nout there, who are shellshocked about the work before them.\n  The people in neighborhoods are still crying and in shock about what \nthey have to do in making decisions. Should we come back? Should we not \ncome back? What should our neighborhood or community do? Maybe we \nshould all move to higher ground. These decisions are being made right \nnow. The last thing they should worry about is Congress debating \nwhether there is money there to turn that hose on.\n  Let's do our job the way we have done it for 150 years.\n  Let's continue to do it and let our people know we are there for \nthem, as we try to be there for other people in the world who are \ncaught in situations such as this. We most certainly need to be here \nfor our people in America.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about a \nsite of particular historic significance to the Commonwealth of \nVirginia and an action we in Virginia are requesting the President \nmake. But before I get to that subject, I want to take a moment to echo \nwhat I know the Presiding Officer said, and my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana, and so many other of my \ncolleagues who have come to the floor over the last few days to express \nconcern and talk about the series of natural disasters and calamities \nour various States have experienced over the last few weeks and months.\n  We have had, in effect, the trifecta in the Commonwealth of Virginia \nin the last month, where, about a month ago, we had an earthquake hit--\nsomething that was a bit unprecedented in Virginia--which shut down \nschools in Louisa County. That earthquake also caused damage at the \nWashington Monument and at the National Cathedral, but in central \nVirginia--in Louisa\n\n[[Page S5610]]\n\nCounty, in Mineral, and Culpeper, and other places around Virginia--it \ncaused enormous damage.\n  We had Hurricane Irene, which--again, through central Virginia and \ndown into Hampton Roads--caused enormous damage. Then, most recently, \nwe had Tropical Storm Lee, where I had the opportunity to visit a \ncommunity not far from where I know some of the distinguished folks who \nwork in the Clerk and Parliamentarian's Offices live--in Alexandria. \nNot too far away from there is a neighborhood named Huntington, VA. \nThis community I walked through has been flooded out three times in the \nlast decade. So we have a 100-year floodplain. Yet three times in the \nlast decade they have been flooded out.\n  So all these folks--whether in Hampton Roads in Richmond or the folks \nin Louisa County and central Virginia with the earthquake or the folks \nin Huntington--are saying: We just need that assistance that other \ncommunities have when they have been met by natural disasters. What \npurpose do we have for government other than to make sure there is an \nemergency response, and then after that response that there is an \nability to get people back on their feet?\n  So I thank my colleagues again, particularly the Senator from \nLouisiana, who has been tireless on this issue of making sure FEMA has \nthe resources it needs to address these disasters, and that we do so in \na meaningful way. We recognize, of course, we can't just put these on a \ncredit card forever; that we have to have a rational way to pay it back \nand figuring out a 10-year rolling cycle to budget for emergencies \nought to be part of our discussions going forward. But trying to say \nthat must be done at this moment, with the economic downturn and the \nrecession, while communities are in need--whether they are in Oregon or \nin Virginia or one of the other 48 States that have had a disaster \ndeclaration issued over the last year--is not the way we ought to be \ndoing business.\n\n\n                              Fort Monroe\n\n  Mr. President, in addition, I rise today to encourage President Obama \nto use his authority under an act that probably most in this Chamber \nare not that familiar with--called the 1906 Antiquities Act--to \ndesignate Hampton, VA, Fort Monroe, as a national monument, which would \nmake it an official part of the National Park Service. Our hope is that \nthe President will consider designating this in the coming days as this \nhistoric fort is turned back over to the State of Virginia, having gone \nthrough the BRAC process, with the Federal Government disposing of it.\n  Let me take a moment on the Senate floor this afternoon to tell you a \nbit about this special place. This fort was built in the early 1800s, \nbut, actually, the fortifications go back much earlier than that. It is \nan area called Point Comfort. As early as 1608 Captain John Smith \nrecognized the importance of building a fort at Point Comfort, as the \nEnglish colonists called this land.\n  From its very beginnings, Fort Monroe has been associated with many \nkey figures in American history. Robert E. Lee supervised work on the \nfortress as a young U.S. Army lieutenant. Edgar Allan Poe, the famous \npoet--and I am sure our pages, at one point, hopefully, had to memorize \n``The Raven'' in high school--was a soldier at Fort Monroe. Abraham \nLincoln, during the midst of the Civil War, paid a critical visit to \nFort Monroe. And Harriet Tubman, an incredibly important American--who \nwas only recently, in the last 50 or so years appropriately \nrecognized--nursed wounded soldiers there in 1865.\n  Another historic American figure had maybe mixed feelings about his \nvisits to Fort Monroe. Jefferson Davis was at Fort Monroe on two very \ndifferent occasions: First, as the U.S. Secretary of War, and later, as \nthe former President of the Confederacy, he was imprisoned at Fort \nMonroe for 2 years.\n  By World War II, Fort Monroe was the headquarters of our military's \nsuccessful efforts to protect the mid-Atlantic coast. After World War \nII and to the current day it has been home of the Army Command \nresponsible for training our warfighters.\n  For all of these various events alone, I would argue, as a Virginian, \nthat would warrant the designation of Fort Monroe as part of the \nNational Park Service. But its true historic significance goes back, \nactually, to a night in May of 1861.\n  During the Civil War, Fort Monroe had an important strategic role as \none of the very few Union military installations located in the South \nthat was never occupied by Confederate forces. For the folks who have \ntraveled down to Norfolk and Virginia Beach, they know that Fort Monroe \nis the point that sticks out right before they go through the bridge-\ntunnel that takes them over to Norfolk and Virginia Beach. It has a \ncommanding view of the whole gateway into what we call Hampton Roads.\n  On May 23, 1861, three slaves--Frank Baker, Shepard Mallory, and \nJames Townsend--got into a small boat in Hampton, crossed the James \nRiver, and presented themselves at the front gate of Fort Monroe \nseeking safety and sanctuary. For the previous many weeks, Baker, \nMallory, and Townsend had been forced by their owners to help construct \na Confederate artillery post aimed directly at Fort Monroe. Obviously, \nthat was not something these individuals wanted to be part of.\n  I want you to think a moment about the choices that were being made \nby these three men--these three slaves--Frank Baker, Shepard Mallory, \nand James Townsend. They left behind the community where they had spent \nmost, if not all, of their lives. At least two of the three left behind \nwives and children. It was entirely possible that once these three men \nreached Fort Monroe, the Union soldiers would simply turn them around \nand send them back to their owners.\n  One of the things I think even students of American history sometimes \nforget is that it was the official U.S. Government policy, even in the \nso-called Confederate States, after the Civil War had begun in April of \n1861, to still turn slaves back over to their owners.\n  Baker, Mallory, and Townsend had to know if they were returned as \nrunaways, they could expect the most Draconian of punishments. But they \nfigured the choice should be theirs to make, so they made it. They soon \nfound themselves standing before the new commander of Fort Monroe, MG \nBenjamin Franklin Butler.\n  Deciding it might be easier to apologize later rather than seek \npermission beforehand, General Butler made a huge and historically \ncourageous decision. He classified the three slaves as ``contraband of \nwar,'' a policy that was later adopted across the Union to protect any \nslaves who managed to reach Union lines. As a result, Virginia's Fort \nMonroe ultimately became a beacon of hope for thousands of enslaved \npeople seeking freedom. In fact, Fort Monroe became known as the \nFreedom Fort.\n  The day after General Butler's edict, eight more slaves showed up at \nFort Monroe. The day after that, 47 more appeared. By the war's end, \nthousands--literally thousands--had appealed for contraband status at \nFort Monroe. General Butler's declaration of this decision of \n``contraband of war'' helped change the course of the Civil War and our \nNation's history.\n  This Thursday, September 15, the U.S. Army will officially hand over \nFort Monroe to the city of Hampton and the Commonwealth of Virginia as \npart of the 2005 BRAC process. I proudly join with my colleague Senator \nWebb, the bipartisan Virginia House delegation, Virginia's Governor Bob \nMcDonnell, local residents, and the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation in urging the President to take this opportunity to \ndeclare Fort Monroe a national historic treasure. By using the \nAntiquities Act to grant this designation, it also will allow us to \nbegin the work to create a national park at Fort Monroe.\n  For more than 100 years, Presidents have used the Antiquities Act to \nprotect some of America's most important and beloved historic places. \nAs a matter of fact, it was use of the Antiquities Act that first \ndesignated the Grand Canyon as well as the Statue of Liberty. So there \nis obviously enormous historical precedent. And there is no dispute \nover the historical significance of Fort Monroe.\n  Over the last few years, I have spent a considerable amount of time, \nboth as Governor and then subsequently during the BRAC process and now \nas a Senator, working with State and local residents and officials to \nexplore the\n\n[[Page S5611]]\n\nopportunities to partner with the National Park Service to preserve \nthis incredible piece of American history. I spoke as recently as last \nFriday with the White House about Fort Monroe. I am hopeful we will \nhave promising news in short order.\n  It would certainly be timely if the President's decision could be \nannounced this week, as the Army prepares to exit Fort Monroe, as our \nNation marks the 150th anniversary of the Civil War, and as many \nVirginians focus anew on the future of this very special place.\n  I feel this is an especially appropriate time for the President to \nrecognize the crucial role Fort Monroe has played in our Nation's \nhistory, and I again urge him to use his long-established power under \nthe Antiquities Act to keep this process on track.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. the clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Trade\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Last week, new trade figures were released. I know \nthe Presiding Officer from North Carolina is very concerned about what \nhas happened with these trade figures and what it means for jobs in her \nState and in my State.\n  The trade deficit with China widened from $26.7 billion in June to \n$27 billion in July. That is one country in one month. Granted, it is \nthe country we have the biggest trade deficit with, but it is 1 month. \nPresident Bush, Sr., some years ago, said that a $1 billion trade \nsurplus or trade deficit translated into some 13,000 jobs. Whether that \nnumber is precise or quantifiable or measurable is not the point. The \npoint is that when we have persistently large trade deficits month \nafter month, year after year, now decade after decade, we know what it \nmeans to the industrial base in our country.\n  I spent much of August in places such as Belmont County, St. \nClairsville, Cleveland, Dayton, Mansfield, and Springfield, OH, where, \nin my State alone, these cities and communities had proud industrial \nheritages. They are places where people had real opportunity to join \nthe middle class. After they graduated from high school, they could go \nand be trained and work in manufacturing and usually buy a home, a car, \nand send their child to college. My wife is the daughter of a utility \nworker, since deceased, in northeast Ohio, and she and her two younger \nsisters and brother were able to go to, in her case, Kent State, and \nother universities, in part paid for by her father's work in \nmanufacturing--if you will, his union card--and assistance from \ngovernment Pell grants and all they were able to do so the kids didn't \ngraduate with huge debt the way they too often do now.\n  The trade deficit with China through July 2011 totaled $160 billion, \nup from $145 billion over the same period in 2010. We debate the budget \ndeficit, as we should. But too many politicians in this city, too many \neditorial writers, too many pundits and economists ignore the trade \ndeficit. They are too focused on things such as pay-fors. They ignore \nhow the trade deficit has a dangerous effect on American jobs.\n  The best way to get our fiscal house in order is to get America \nworking again, and one way to do that is by cracking down on unfair \ntrade practices of some of our so-called trading partners. When the \nPresident steps up and enforces trade rules--and while I do not agree \nwith the President sending the Korea, Panama, and Colombia trade \nagreements to the Congress for votes because I don't think they serve \nAmerica's interests, I do believe this President, more than his \npredecessors, has been, relatively--I say ``relatively'' but blessedly \nso, and in some cases aggressive at enforcing trade rules. I have seen \nthat in Youngstown in creating jobs. I have seen it in Loraine, where \nit has created jobs, and in Fenway, where it has created jobs, and it \nhas helped our industry in Butler County in steel, in paper, and in \ntires.\n  It is clear that part of this problem is currency manipulation from \nthe Chinese, which undermines American manufacturing and our very own \njob-creating efforts. In June, the Economic Policy Institute released a \nnew report showing that addressing Chinese currency manipulation could \nsupport the creation of 2.25 million jobs. Put that in contrast to what \nthey say--the ``free traders at any cost'' sort of free market, free-\ntrade fundamentalists who preach: Pass NAFTA. It will mean hundreds of \nthousands of jobs. Pass CAFTA. Pass PNTR with China. It will mean \nmillions of jobs.\n  It never does. It means job growth, but the job growth usually takes \nplace--with NAFTA, it was in Mexico; CAFTA, in Central America; and \nPNTR, in China, which is East Asia. There is job growth, but there is \nnothing close to net job growth in our country. Even that, the \nPresident is saying, with this new agreement with South Korea, that it \nwill sustain or keep or contribute to sustaining or keeping 100,000 \njobs or so. So even the promises aren't that great on this new trade \nagreement, and we know they never live up to their promises. But we do \nalso know if we stood up to currency manipulation, it could create 2.25 \nmillion American jobs. My friends on the other side of the aisle don't \never want to do any kind of direct spending on infrastructure in terms \nof job creation; that costs tax money. I think it is a good investment; \nthey don't. But standing up on currency we know doesn't cost American \ntaxpayers and it will, in fact, mean American jobs.\n  A paper mill in Butler County, down near Dayton and Cincinnati, \nsomeone who worked at that paper mill told me they are now competing \nwith China for coated paper, which is a higher tech manufacturing of \npaper--the kind of magazine paper we all touch and use--that the pulp \ncomes from Brazil, it is shipped to China, it is milled in China and \nshipped back to the United States and they undercut American prices. \nYet only 10 percent of the cost of paper production is labor. What does \nthat mean? It means they are gaming the currency system. They are \nsubsidizing water and capital and land and they are paying low wages. \nHow do we compete when they are not playing fair? Forget the low wages \neven for a minute. How do we compete when they are playing these \ncurrency games? By continuing the currency manipulation, we lose far \ntoo many jobs. By combating it, we help level the playing field for our \nmanufacturers, we help our workers, we help spur our economic recovery.\n  That is why I introduced the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act. It \nwould strengthen countervailing duty laws to consider undervalued \ncurrency as an unfair subsidy in determining duty rates.\n  So when we contest on a trade agreement, all we are saying when we \ncontest is that undervalued currency is considered an unfair subsidy, \nbecause it is. It is not hard to convince people of that. It is not \nhard to illustrate or prove that. So when an industry such as the \ncoated paper company in Hamilton or the oil country tubular steel used \nin drilling in Lorain or in Youngstown, where there is a new steel mill \nbecause of a trade decision the President made--thank you--or aluminum \nin Sidney--when an industry petitions the International Trade \nCommission for relief against unfair subsidies, currency manipulation \nunder this new bill and amendment we are going to offer on the floor \nwill be part of that investigation.\n  This is a designation that would ensure the government has the tools \nto respond on behalf of American manufacturers and workers by imposing \ncountervailing duties on subsidized exports from China.\n  We have broad support here. Senator Schumer from New York, a \nDemocrat, has been very involved. Senator Snowe from Maine, a \nRepublican, has been very involved. Senator Stabenow, a Democrat from \nMichigan, and Senator Graham from South Carolina, a Republican, have \nbeen very involved in understanding that these kinds of currency \nmanipulations cost us American jobs and undermine our economy. This \ndesignation would ensure the government has the tools to respond on \nbehalf\n\n[[Page S5612]]\n\nof American manufacturers and workers by imposing these countervailing \nduties on subsidized exports from China. It is simple, straightforward, \nand achievable.\n  Addressing currency manipulation would decrease our budget deficit up \nto $70 billion a year and somewhere between $500 billion and $800 \nbillion over 10 years if sustained. Addressing our trade deficit should \nbe part of the debate in reducing our budget deficit. If we are going \nto create jobs, we have to ensure that our trading partners don't stack \nthe deck. We want trade, and we want more of it, but we want fair \ntrade, not this kind of phony free trade.\n  Almost every country in the world practices trade according to their \nnational interests. The United States in this body and the President of \nthe United States--typically, Presidents in both parties--have \npracticed trade according to some economics textbook that is 20 years \nout of date. If we are serious about standing for American workers and \ncompanies that continue to play by the rules, we need to pass this \nlegislation.\n  With each passing week, more companies and workers are faced with the \nharsh realities of unfair competition and unwanted cutbacks due to \nChinese currency manipulation. In towns and cities across our country--\ngo anywhere in this country, including Texas, where Senator Hutchison \nis from and who is awaiting a chance to speak on the floor, or North \nCarolina, the Presiding Officer's State, or my State, and we see that \ncompanies and workers are faced with the harsh realities of that unfair \ncompetition.\n  Workers have the proud tradition of making products that matter to \nAmerica. From the tanks made in Lima, OH, supporting our troops abroad, \nto steel tubes created in Lorain, equipping our energy markets, Ohio \nmanufacturers are vital to our Nation's security and economy. Our \nnational security, our economic security, our family security, all \nthose are dependent on making things in the United States of America.\n  My State is the third largest manufacturing State in the country. We \nare seventh in population, but we are third in manufacturing. We have \nlost far too many jobs in Zanesville and Jackson and Columbus and Akron \nbecause of this undermining of currency, because of this gaming of the \nsystem by China, its gaming of the system on currency.\n  It is time to take bold action. It is time to stand up to China. It \nis time to practice trade according to our communities and our national \ninterests. It is time to do that. It is time to pass this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                             Nasa's Vision\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I wish to mark today, September 14 \nof 2011, as the day that NASA announced our vision for the future. \nSince the shuttle was retired earlier this year and we saw the last \npeople go into space on an American flight, many of us have worried \nthat there wasn't going to be another heavy launch vehicle that would \ntake our astronauts to beyond low earth orbit. Today, after much study \nand a lot of going back and forth with NASA, I was encouraged to see \nthe design approved by both NASA and the OMB, and I think it is going--\nwell, it will be the heaviest, biggest, strongest, most robust vehicle \nwe have seen since we put men on the Moon.\n  I was very concerned because of the long timeframe. Congress asked \nthat this design be delivered by January of this year. We kept getting \ndelays and delays and delays. Finally, Senator Bill Nelson and I just \ngot frustrated about that timeline, so we had meetings.\n  As recently as yesterday, I met with the director of OMB, Mr. Jack \nLew, who did come to my office to meet with Senator Nelson and myself \nand General Bolden, who is the NASA Administrator, to get his \ncommitment that we would be on a robust timeline and that it would be \nas much a priority of NASA to go beyond low earth orbit as the ferry to \nthe space station would be for NASA. We got those assurances from Mr. \nLew and the NASA Administrator. Senator Nelson and myself, Senator \nRockefeller was represented, Senator Boozman--we had all the relevant \npeople in the loop on this issue because we want to make sure Congress \nand the administration are on the same goal with a timeline to achieve \nthat goal.\n  What worried us about the delays were the loss of cost efficiencies \nand the loss of experienced personnel to design that new heavy launch \nvehicle.\n  We want to have the most experienced engineers who will use the \nproven technology that has been time tested and add to that proven \ntechnology the added boosters, the added capabilities that we know we \nmust have to go to Mars, to an asteroid, and to make sure we do it in a \nsafe manner.\n  I am very encouraged by the commitments that were made and the \ntimetables we are seeing. I am told by the NASA personnel that we are \nnow going to look, in 1 week or 2, to have the contract modifications \nin place that will tell the workers that they are going to have those \njobs, that we are going to have that expedience, that they have a \nproject to work on. I think it is essential we have that kind of \nexperienced personnel to do this.\n  I am very pleased we now have this way forward. It is the most \npowerful vehicle we will have seen in many years. I think the \nannouncement today is going to set us on a path. If we can see those \ncontract modifications going out from NASA in the next week--or a \nlittle more, but no more than 2 weeks from now--then we will know there \nis progress and that we are going toward the time when we will have the \nbuilding of that rocket, that we will have the design, followed by the \nbuilding, and then, of course, testing, and then the launch.\n  I think when we saw that last flight come down this summer, so many \npeople had very mixed feelings because space exploration has been a \npart of America's drive and spirit for all these years we have watched \nmore and more things be accomplished. From President Kennedy's first \nchallenge that we would put men on the Moon, Americans have been \nexcited about that opportunity. They have not just been excited, \nthough, about the exploration and the pushing of the envelope, they \nhave also been excited with the quality of life that has been produced \nby what came from the research: the advancements we have had in medical \ntreatment, MRIs, the advancements in products we have been able to \ndiscover.\n  I fully expect that with the space station we are going to be able to \ndo the research on cancers that will grow in the microgravity \nconditions in space that will not grow the same way on Earth, and that \nmaybe we will be able to test antidotes and medicines for those. That \nis why I was pleased the President did announce we would extend the \nspace station until 2020. We have international partners as well. So we \nwant to make sure we are a good partner, that we are a reliable \npartner, and that we do some things for mankind that might make a \ndifference in our lives.\n  National security. We have gained so much in satellite-guided \nmissiles for our national security. And being able to put a missile \ninto a window from 1 mile out is because we have been able to discover \nin space the use of satellites. Earlier this summer the space shuttle \ncarried the magnetic spectrometer that Dr. Ting, the Nobel laureate \nfrom MIT, built and insisted on putting on the space station, it will \nhelp us understand the nature of dark energy and its relationship to \nthe origins and function of the universe.\n  We are looking at how matter was formed. We are looking at the cosmic \nrays. I went to the Johnson Space Center in Houston and saw from the \nspace station the magnetic spectrometer that was getting the hits from \ncosmic rays. There were 60 scientists in the room who were tracking \nthese hits, trying to determine what was happening when those cosmic \nrays hit the magnetic spectrometer because they want to see if we can \nunderstand the nature of dark energy. There are things we have not even \nthought of that we hope to find by using the space station, and then \ngoing to an asteroid or going to the Moon.\n  We have taken a first step today. I think many people in America were \nwaiting for the blueprint for the future. Now I think we have one. As \nlong as we stay on a regular timetable and with the funding levels that \nhave been approved already in the authorization bill passed by Congress \nand signed by the President--if we can stick with those, this has the \npotential to bring us energy, health, possibly curing breast\n\n[[Page S5613]]\n\ncancer, things that will make a difference in the lives not only of \nAmericans but of our fellow citizens all over the world. That is what \nthe investment can be in NASA if we go forward as we have made this \nblueprint to do.\n  We are in a time where we must be more efficient. We must fund the \npriorities and not fund the lesser priorities.\n  In today's markup of our committee, our Appropriations subcommittee \nthat does fund NASA, we have found the priorities. We also cut \nprograms. Senator Mikulski said in her whole time in the Senate she has \nnever been an appropriator who actually cut programs. But we did today. \nWe cut programs that were lesser priorities in different areas of our \njurisdiction. But we funded NASA so we would have this heavy launch \nvehicle. We would fund the commercial vehicle that is going to take our \nastronauts to the space station. That is going to be done in the \nprivate sector. That was the balance we did in our authorization bill \nlast year. Then we fund the Webb Space Telescope because that is part \nof the scientific advances we must make if we are going to know what is \nout there in space that we might be able to utilize or utilize the \nknowledge for better life on Earth.\n  I am very pleased we have the Appropriations Committee that will, \nhopefully, approve the bill tomorrow and that we have made those tough \ndecisions. We came in under the 2011 continuing resolution on our \noverall bill. We came in under the President's request. But we have \nfully funded the priorities which have the possibility to reap the \nbenefits from exploration and assure that America remains the No. 1 \ncountry in the world in space exploration. Our economy has benefitted, \nour national security has benefitted, and now we are going to be \nlooking at health care possibilities, energy possibilities, and living \nin space, and seeing how we can do that in a better way.\n  I think we have a plan that will excite the American people again \nabout what we can do in space if we put our minds to it, if we \nprioritize, if we are efficient with the taxpayer dollars, and we do \nnot lose sight of the vision that is the spirit of America.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I would ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I would like to spend a few minutes \ndiscussing some things in general.\n  In making a couple points today, I was referred to by one of our \ncolleagues as a dictator. I am not offended at that; I understand the \nfrustration of what is going on. But I think there are some significant \npoints that the American people ought to hear about where we are and \nwhat we are doing.\n  Quite frankly, if we look at our financial situation and we look at \nthe history of the world, no country has ever recovered from the \nsituation in which we find ourselves in terms of our debt-to-GDP ratio \nand our debt-to-export ratio.\n  In August, before we left, we passed a piece of legislation that \ngoes--a small amount--toward fixing the very real problems that are in \nfront of our country in terms of spending money we don't have on things \nwe don't absolutely need. But we have before us, and coming before us, \ntwo different pieces of legislation: One is a shell piece of \nlegislation, and the assumption is the majority leader will utilize it \nto fund supplementation for disaster relief for the many areas in our \ncountry that need that funding. There is not a dispute that we should \nbe doing that. There is a dispute about how much that should be. But \nthe greatest dispute is, when we are running $1.3 trillion and $1.4 \ntrillion deficits, and we know we have significant waste, duplication, \nand fraud in the Federal Government, whether we ought to spend another \n$6 billion or $7 billion by borrowing or we ought to actually reduce \nspending somewhere else to pay for a much more important and proper \nneed in which the Federal Government has a role. That is the real \ndebate.\n  I think we have worked a way to have appropriate amendments to try to \npay for that, and we should probably go forward. There are, however, \ntwo other programs that are precarious in their funding: One is FAA--\nand we have coming to us the 22nd temporary reauthorization--and the \nTransportation bill, which is, I believe, its sixth temporary \nreauthorization.\n  Now, there are some real questions the American people ought to be \nasking about why 22 times we have temporarily reauthorized the FAA for \na short period of time, and why now we are on our sixth temporary--or \nfifth; I may be wrong on one of those numbers but close--temporary \nreauthorization. That is because we are not prioritizing what is \nimportant for the country in terms of our legislative agenda. We don't \ncontrol that, but there are some things that the American people are \ninterested in that we do control.\n  The highway trust fund has received a supplementation over the last 4 \nyears of $35 billion from the American taxpayer outside of the taxes \nthey collect for that trust fund. Out of that amount of money billions \nof dollars have been spent on things other than highways and bridges.\n  We now have 146,000 deficient bridges in our country, some in every \nState in the country. We have more now after the floods in the \nNortheast. We have significant problems and we have a limited amount of \nmoney, and what is in front of us is another short-term extension of 6 \nmonths for the transportation funding which continues to spend money on \nitems that are a low priority.\n  I am not saying we couldn't spend the money on it. But when we are \nshort of money, and we are borrowing money to put money into the trust \nfund, and our No. 1 priority ought to be safety and quality roads and \nbridges, to spend significant funds on things that are not a priority \nnow--not when we are head over heels in debt, not when the trust fund \nis precarious--then we ought to not force States to spend money they \ndon't want to spend. Yet in this bill 10 percent of the surface \ntransportation moneys have to be spent on enhancement.\n  So that tells Oklahoma, or any other State: If you have an excess \nnumber of bridges, it doesn't matter that that is a safety problem for \nyour citizens; we are still going to make you spend this 10 percent \nmoney over here that doesn't have anything to do with safety or true \ntransportation, but we are going to require it because we can--except, \nthe problem is, the people in your State pay the taxes in the first \nplace for their highways and their bridges, not for the museums, not \nfor all the hundreds of other things that are spent that are low \npriority.\n  So I thought I might give us a little flavor of what some of those \nthings are. If we were at a different time where we had an excess of \nfunds, I am not saying they are necessarily bad. But when we have \nbridges falling down in this country, and concrete--like the summer \nbefore last in Oklahoma--falling out of an interstate highway bridge \ninjuring somebody, falling onto their car as they drove under it, I \nwould think that we would want to repair these 146,000 bridges rather \nthan spend money redecorating a sign.\n  So I will not go through all of them--I will put all of them into the \nRecord--but let me go through a few of them just to see. If the \nAmerican people actually believe we should not fix bridges or roads and \nwe ought to spend money, I am fine. If the Senate believes we ought to \nnot fix bridges, we ought not concentrate on safety, we ought not \nconcentrate on the quality of our roads and bridges and they vote it \ndown, I am fine too. But the fact is, we ought not to be spending money \nwhen we have the hundreds of thousands of bridges that are dangerous to \npeople in this country.\n  All we are saying is, if a State wants to continue to spend money on \nsomething other than safety and bridges and roads, fine, it can, but \ndon't make those of us who already have a big problem with safety have \nto spend money on something that doesn't protect our citizens, doesn't \nenhance their highways by spending money on something that is called an \nenhancement but doesn't enhance their safety or their ability to \ncommute.\n  So what are some of them? Lincoln Highway 200-Mile Roadside Museum in\n\n[[Page S5614]]\n\nPennsylvania--it received $300,000 in enhancement funding to \ncommemorate the historic highway along the 200-mile route. Interpretive \nsignage, colorful, repainted vintage gas pumps, engaging murals, \nrefurbishing a large coffee pot.\n  Notably, Pennsylvania ranks No. 1 in the country in terms of bridge \ndeficiency levels. Forty-six percent of the bridges in Pennsylvania are \neither structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. Mr. President, \n$300,000 would have fixed two of them. So we chose to not fix two but \nspend the money elsewhere. At a different time, sure, or if \nPennsylvania wants to spend it, let them. But don't force them to spend \nmoney on something that does not protect the quality of transportation \nfor their citizens.\n\n  How about Chinatown Gateway, a $250,000 enhancement to supplement the \nconstruction of the Twin Dragons Gateway to the Chinatown area? \nCalifornia has over 7,000 bridges that are structurally deficient or \nfunctionally obsolete. One out of every three bridges in California is \nin trouble, and we are doing aesthetics instead of fixing bridges.\n  How about the White Squirrel Sanctuary in Tennessee? Kenton, TN, \nlocated in Gibson County, calls itself ``the Home of the White \nSquirrel.'' They received $110,000 in transportation enhancement \nfunding to construct a white squirrel sanctuary with walking trails, \nbrick crosswalks, a footbridge, and a parking lot. There are 3,856 \nbridges that are structurally deficient in the State of Tennessee. They \ndidn't necessarily want to do this. They did not have any choice. They \nhad to spend 10 percent of their surface transportation money on things \nsuch as this.\n  Tuscumbia Landing in Sheffield, AL--$104,000 to investigate Tuscumbia \nLanding's archaeological features. The only problem is, 23 percent of \nAlabama's bridges are structurally deficient. That could have fixed two \nof them.\n  How about the National Corvette Museum Simulator Theater in Warren \nCounty, KY--$200,000 to build a grand simulator theater. Mr. President, \n31 percent of the bridges they cross in Kentucky are structurally \ndeficient or functionally obsolete.\n  The Pennsylvania Trolley Museum--$400,000 to construct the \nPennsylvania Trolley Museum. It is a great idea if we are in the black \nand have a good cashflow. But when Pennsylvania leads the Nation in \ndeficient bridges and dangerous bridges, why would we spend that money? \nWhy would we force them to spend that money?\n  I can go on. I will add to the record many other examples, all the \nway up to 40 separate examples of where we are spending money but we \nare not fixing bridges.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those examples be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. COBURN. We are not pouring asphalt, we are not laying concrete, \nwe are not decreasing congestion, and we are not increasing safety. \nWhat we are doing is we are following the rules of Washington when we \nhave greater needs. We are in trouble as a nation because Congress does \nnot set priorities, and when they do set priorities, there is no \nconnection to the reality of our financial situation.\n  We have some options on how to go forward. One of the options would \nbe to take the FAA bill, split it out, approve it, send it back to the \nHouse, and FAA is taken care of. The second option would be to pass the \nhighway extension for 6 months with the elimination of enhancements and \nsend it back to the House. But I will not give a unanimous consent, as \nis my right as a Senator of the United States, for us to continue to \nspend billions of dollars on things that are not a priority when the \ncountry is struggling to survive. Its very survival depends on us \nchanging the way we do business. If that means the highway \ntransportation bill does not get approved, so be it. But there has to \nbe a point in time in this country when we change direction and we \nstart meeting the obligations that are put before us.\n  The No. 1 obligation is to start spending money where it does the \nmost good and quit spending money we do not have on things we do not \nabsolutely need. With a 35-percent deficit--and we are going to run \nanother $1.3 trillion deficit next year, which will cost a significant \namount of funds for our kids and our grandkids just to repay what we \nare going to waste next year--there ought to be a time at which we say \nenough is enough.\n  I know there will be several, including my own senior Senator, who \nwill be unhappy with my position, but I believe it is time to draw a \nline in the sand for the American people, for our future. It is not \npopular. It is certainly not expedient. But it is absolutely the right \nthing to do.\n  If the Senate wants to solve the problem of these two bills, we can \nsplit them or we can keep them together, but we need to end the \nenhancements right now until we get the highway trust fund healthy \nagain, No. 1, and, No. 2, until we get our country healthy again. When \nwe do, I will be happy to defer.\n  Remember, we are not saying you cannot do it. We are just saying you \nought to have the option to not do it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Kalanianaole Highway, Ka'lwi Scenic Shoreline Trail--\n     Federal Transportation enhancement funds were used to \n     intervene in a local land use dispute in Hawaii. A decades \n     long dispute over the preservation of Hawaiian shoreline \n     versus local developmental interests was assisted by the \n     Department of Transportation, which used $11 million in \n     enhancement funds to acquire land for conservation purposes, \n     effectively meddling in the local land use. In the mean time, \n     45 percent of Hawaii's bridges are either structurally \n     deficient or functionally obsolete.\n       Antique bike collections--The University of California \n     Davis received a transportation enhancement grant of $440,000 \n     to purchase 60 unique antique bikes for its Bicycle Museum \n     Collection.\n       Shrine to Tennessee state history costs federal government \n     $23 million-- Nashville, Tennessee received $23 million in \n     federal enhancement funding to construct its bicentennial ode \n     to Tennessee state history. The project included the building \n     of ``a 1,400-foot Wall of History etched with historic events \n     from the state's first two centuries, 31 fountains that each \n     represent one of the state's rivers, and a 200-foot granite \n     state map.'' The only thing more egregious than federal funds \n     used for a clearly state interest, is that 20 percent of \n     Tennessee Bridges are either structurally deficient or \n     functionally obsolete.\n       ARTwalk--ARTwalk is tagged as a unique outdoor experience \n     that constructs pathways between shopping areas, galleries, \n     and museums in Rochester, Vermont. The project used $234,000 \n     in federal enhancement dollars to build the artsy outdoor \n     museum, while 861 of Vermont's bridges remain either \n     structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.\n       Old Roman Bath House Renovation--$160,000 worth of \n     enhancement funding was used in Berkeley, West Virginia for \n     the renovation of the oldest building in town, an Old Roman \n     Bath House. While local residents may be interested in \n     visiting a bath house where George Washington used to \n     frequent, federal taxpayers may find the connection to \n     critical infrastructure more puzzling. Moreover, 36 percent \n     of West Virginia's bridges remain structurally deficient or \n     functionally obsolete.\n       Saddletree Factory Renovation--The Ben Schroeder Saddle \n     Tree Factory, a historical factory in Madison, Indiana, \n     received transportation enhancement funding for historical \n     preservation purposes because the factory used to make \n     Saddletrees, the foundation of a saddle. 21.5 percent of \n     Indiana's bridges are either structurally deficient or \n     functionally obsolete.\n       Toledo Harbor Lighthouse--The Toledo Harbor Lighthouse in \n     Toledo, Ohio, protected by the ``phantom'' officer Frank, \n     will receive a $500,000 enhancement grant to restore windows, \n     doors, bricks, and shutters. This grant will not only help to \n     restore the facade of the historical lighthouse, but also \n     carry on the legendary ghosts of the haunted lighthouse. \n     Unfortunately, ``phantom'' officer Frank will not be able to \n     protect Ohio drivers from the 6,598 bridges that are either \n     structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.\n       Critter Crossing--The Monkton, Vermont Conservation \n     Commission received $150,000 in federal grant money to build \n     a--critter crossing, to save the lives of thousands of \n     migrating salamanders and other amphibians that would \n     otherwise be slaughtered by vehicle traffic on a major \n     roadway. Thousands of blue- and yellow-spotted salamanders, \n     frogs, and other amphibians spend the winter months in the \n     rocky uplands near Monkton, but must return to low-lying \n     wetlands in order to reproduce. To travel between these two \n     areas, the salamanders must cross the heavily-traveled \n     Monkton-Vergennes Road. While some conservationists have \n     celebrated the project, others remain skeptical. ``I \n     certainly respect all species. However, I don't see the need \n     to pay $150,000 for a salamander crossing'', read one email \n     reportedly sent to the Burlington [Vermont] Free Press \n     newspaper. ``I realize there are a lot of other stupid things \n     my tax dollars go toward, but this one is near the top of the \n     list.'' Maybe the local communities will prevent the critters \n     from crossing one of the 861 bridges that are either \n     structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.\n\n[[Page S5615]]\n\n       North Carolina Transportation Museum Spencer, North \n     Carolina--The North Carolina Transportation Museum has \n     received over 11 million to renovate and showcase steam \n     locomotive artifacts. As of 2010, North Carolina has nearly \n     5000 bridges that are either structurally deficient or \n     functionally obsolete.\n       Massachusetts bike and pedestrian allotted millions, but \n     remain unspent--Massachusetts has received $135 million in \n     federal funds for bike and pedestrian projects since 1991, of \n     which it has spent little more than $51 million, according to \n     The Boston Globe. That means nearly two-thirds of the funds \n     provided in the last two decades by Congress to the state for \n     such projects remain unspent. Perhaps Massachusetts would \n     like to use their unspent funds to work on their 2,548 \n     bridges that are either structurally deficient or \n     functionally obsolete.\n       Nevada spending millions of federal transportation dollars \n     to make Vegas highways beautiful--In 2008, Nevada received \n     its transportation enhancement allotment of $6,287,466. They \n     decided to spend it in a variety of ways, a few million went \n     to biking facilities and trails, a few million went to \n     welcome centers and interpretive centers. $498,750 even went \n     for ``decorative rocks, native plants, some pavement \n     graphics, a few walls, and some great big granite boulders'' \n     to beautify an interchange to Las Vegas' 215 Beltway.\n       A couple miles down the highway, N-DOT beautified another \n     interchange with ``striping in the rocks and some native \n     plants.'' That project has cost $319,163 so far this year.\n       The people of Nevada might have been able to think of some \n     better things to spend that money on. One local who uses the \n     interchange frequently was not impressed by the expensive \n     beautification project. ``I'm busy watching where I'm going. \n     I'm not looking at landscape improvements and stamped \n     concrete.''\n       Unfortunately, there is little that local officials can do \n     to re-direct the money to better uses. ``We applied for the \n     federal enhancement dollars and those federal enhancement \n     dollars can only be used for landscaping and pedestrian type \n     improvements,'' explains the top civil engineer at the Clark \n     County Public Works Traffic Management Division.\n       The N-DOT deputy director for southern Nevada is just as \n     frustrated as many citizens that federal restrictions \n     prohibit states from directing money where it is really \n     needed. ``It's really getting out of hand to where these pots \n     of money have these constraints associated with them and you \n     can't spend money where you want to.'' These restrictions \n     sometimes leave states no choice but to spend money on \n     frivolous projects or lose it entirely. The deputy director \n     notes, ``if N-DOT doesn't spend that money and employ workers \n     in Nevada, another state is gonna have that money up for \n     grabs.''\n       Washington, DC receives Transportation Enhancement grants \n     for murals and valet bikes--Washington, DC received nearly $2 \n     million in transportation enhancement grants in Fiscal Year \n     2010, ranging from $50,000 to $579,000. These grants include \n     items such as the stabilization of historic murals and a \n     grant for bicycle parking and valet services, along with the \n     creation of a ``Room to Breathe'' poster. The $2 million \n     allotment would be much better used for bridge repair, as 158 \n     of the 244 bridges in the District are either structurally \n     deficient or functionally obsolete.\n       Railroad Caboose Relocation and Renovation--The Princeton \n     Railroad Museum received a $78,280 transportation enhancement \n     grant to help pay for the relocation of a historic train \n     caboose to be displayed and restored.\n       Texas Highway Rest Stops--The Texas Department of \n     Transportation uses a substantial amount of their required \n     transportation enhancement spending to build highway rest \n     areas. Texas plans to spend $262 million to build or overhaul \n     roadside stops along its highways, with a majority of the \n     funds coming from enhancement grants. However, some residents \n     question the construction of rest stops in such close \n     proximity to other commercial areas, leading one local \n     resident to surmise about the $10 million Salado rest area, \n     ``I think $10 million would have made a nice third lane in a \n     lot of spots . . . It's pretty spectacular for a rest area, \n     for, I guess, $2 million worth . . . $10 million? That's a \n     lot of money.'' Additionally, the Texas Department of \n     Transportation spent $16.2 million in enhancement funding on \n     a Battleship Texas restoration project.\n       California Sculpture Competition--Federal transportation \n     enhancement dollars were used as prize money for an art \n     competition to find a sculpture fitting to place in a parking \n     lot for a Laguna Beach, California Friday Film Series event.\n       Merchant and Drovers Tavern Museum--The Merchants and \n     Drovers Tavern Museum in Union County, New Jersey received a \n     $210,790 transportation enhancement grant to create a museum \n     on the second floor of the recently renovated building. The \n     Merchants and Drovers Tavern Museum touts its amenities by \n     letting visitors ``experience the hospitality of the 1820s'' \n     and ``quench his thirst in the taproom, sit for a while in \n     the parlor or, perhaps, try a bed for size at this `hands-on' \n     museum.'' Meanwhile, visitors should also be wary of driving \n     over any New Jersey bridges on the way to the museum, as 35 \n     percent of them are either structurally deficient or \n     functionally obsolete.\n       Museum uses transportation funds for its Heating and Air \n     Conditioning system--The Sayre Historical Society Museum in \n     Bradford County, Pennsylvania received a transportation \n     enhancement grant of $74,704 for the ``Sayre Historical \n     Society RR Museum Heating and AC project.'' You read that \n     correctly, American gas taxes are being directed towards \n     heating and air installation.\n       War of 1812, Bladensburg, Maryland excavation--Enhancement \n     funding was used to excavate several historical buildings in \n     Bladensburg, Maryland to study the ``transportation history'' \n     of the area. Bladensburg was used for troop movements during \n     the War of 1812, as well as being a transportation hub during \n     early America.\n       Funding for a Transportation Exhibit--$300,000 in federal \n     money will pay for a new exhibit on the history of \n     transportation at a local museum in Missouri. The fresh \n     display at the St. Charles County Heritage museum will \n     explain the influence of rivers, railroads, roads, and trails \n     in the region over the years. The grant application \n     highlights how ``The County and its residents have had to \n     rely on multiple forms of transportation and as technology \n     changed, the area had to adapt to the changing transportation \n     methods/patterns.''\n       Not everyone in the community agrees the federal government \n     should fund this type of project. A county executive said, \n     ``It's the kind of thing the federal government can't afford \n     to do.'' Other officials however have a different perspective \n     on the federal funding. The county parks director explained \n     how ``the $300,000 grant is `a pretty insignificant amount of \n     money compared to that total pool' of federal transportation \n     spending.'' Maybe a more significant number should be 7,021, \n     the number of Missouri bridges that are either structurally \n     deficient or functionally obsolete.\n       Iowa town receives new entrance sign--Fairfield, Iowa used \n     $40,800 in transportation enhancement funds to upgrade its \n     ``Welcome to Fairfield'' sign. It is likely that Iowans would \n     welcome their transportation funds upgrading their bridges, \n     as Iowa ranks 3rd in bridge deficiency rates in America.\n       Michigan Receives Transportation funds to plant flowers and \n     rehabilitate an engine house--In 2010, the Michigan awarded \n     $5 million in federal transportation enhancement grants to \n     various projects including reconstructing cobblestone roads, \n     purchasing and installing bicycle racks, and \n     ``streetscaping'' a downtown street in Bridgetown, Michigan \n     with ``decorative sidewalk treatments, street trees, \n     perennial flowers and other decorative plantings, planters, \n     and ornamental street lighting.'' One grant awarded $336,490 \n     to rehabilitate the historic Quincy and Torch Lake Railroad \n     Engine House while another grant awarded $1,490,280 to the \n     Detroit Science Center to construct an exhibit depicting \n     ``how roads, tunnels and bridges are constructed.''\n       Transportation Funding used to replace unaesthetic fencing \n     around Oklahoma Capitol Oil Derricks--The Oklahoma Department \n     of Central Services, the controller of Capitol Grounds, \n     received $216,000 in transportation enhancement funding to \n     replace fencing around active oil wells on Lincoln Boulevard \n     with a more aesthetically pleasing form of fencing. \n     Unfortunately while Capitol Complex may look better, Oklahoma \n     bridge deficiency rates remain 2nd in the United States.\n       Over $150,000 in Gasoline Taxes directed towards making \n     brochures--Over the last 10 years, federal transportation \n     enhancement grants have been used to produce brochures for \n     various purposes including monuments paths, scenic trails, \n     and bicycle safety. The State of Kansas even received a \n     federal grant to install and replace their brochure display \n     cases at SRA.\n       Enhancement funds used to help construct replica of \n     historical schooner--In 2001, Burlington, Vermont received a \n     $20,000 grant to subsidize the building a full scale replica \n     of the 1862-class sailing canal boat, the Louis McClure.\n       Crandall Farm Restoration project--Washington County, Rhode \n     Island received a $120,000 transportation enhancement grant \n     for renovation of Crandall Farm. The project consisted of \n     renovating the 1870 house on the farm into a welcome center \n     and educational tool for the traveling public.\n       South Carolina uses gas taxes to purchase $15,000 ``Welcome \n     Signs''--Orangeburg County, South Carolina received a $34,965 \n     transportation enhancement grant o help purchase three signs \n     at a cost of $44,500, or $14,833 per sign. Unfortunately, \n     South Carolina bridges are not as welcoming, as 22 percent of \n     them are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.\n       The State of Michigan receives nearly $100,000 to celebrate \n     mysterious centennial--In 2004, Michigan received a $99,540 \n     transportation enhancement grant for publications, historical \n     commemorative items, and displays for a ``centennial \n     celebration.'' The only thing more puzzling than how these \n     activities are related to transportation is that the \n     centennial for Michigan Statehood occurred in 1937.\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, today I rise to offer my support for \nthe President's request for immediate supplemental assistance for the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency. This funding will enable FEMA to \ncontinue to provide critical aid to victims left in the wake of Irene's \ndeadly\n\n[[Page S5616]]\n\npath, and victims of other natural disasters that have struck \nthroughout the country.\n  My home State of Rhode Island has experienced two major disasters in \nthe last couple of years, so I know firsthand how hard homeowners, \nbusinesses, and municipalities have struggled to recover, even with \nFederal assistance programs.\n  This is not the time to play politics. If Congress fails to provide \nthis emergency funding between now and September 30, we run the risk of \ncompletely running out of disaster funds. Our fellow Americans need \nthis funding to recover from catastrophic disasters. Mother Nature does \nnot distinguish between blue and reds States, and both Democratic and \nRepublican Governors--and in Rhode Island's case an Independent \nGovernor--have asked for immediate disaster aid.\n  This supplemental funding will help replenish FEMA's Disaster Relief \nFund, which pays for Federal disaster response and recovery activities. \nThe fund has been running dangerously low as a result of the \ndevastating tornado in Missouri, tornados in Alabama, major flooding in \nthe Midwest and South, wildfires in Texas, and the historic flooding \ncaused by Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee.\n  This year's disasters have been particularly destructive and I urge \nmy colleagues to remain committed to all the victims as they struggle \nto become whole again. We should approve this disaster aid to ensure \nthat communities aren't left in ruins.\n  The shortfall in funding has already forced the administration to put \ncertain disaster recovery activities on hold. My State, like many \nothers, sustained a federally declared disaster last month as a result \nof Hurricane and Tropical Storm Irene. In order for FEMA to ensure it \nhad the resources to provide immediate relief for new disasters such as \nHurricane Irene, the agency had to freeze long-term recovery and \nmitigation projects.\n  This funding conundrum really hits home because in Rhode Island \ncommunities are still reeling from the historic flooding that occurred \nin the spring of 2010. Rhode Island saw more rain during that disaster \nthan any month on record, and the devastation wrought by those storms \nexceeded anything in living memory.\n  I was on the ground during the flooding last year and have been \nintimately involved in the recovery process. I know how important \nFEMA's long-term recovery and mitigation programs are for revitalizing \ndamaged communities, especially in States like mine that were already \nhurting from the difficult economic environment.\n  I urge my colleagues across the aisle to let us pass this critical \nlegislation to provide supplemental funding for FEMA. Not only will it \ngo a long way toward providing peace of mind should another disaster \nstrike, it will also ensure that communities across the country that \nare still recovering from past disasters can continue to move forward \nin their recovery. This will make us a stronger and more resilient \nnation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, Nelson Mandela once said, ``There is no \neasy walk to freedom anywhere.''\n  The walk to freedom for the Burmese people has certainly not been \neasy, and it is far from complete.\n  The military-controlled government that rules Burma continues to \nmaintain its tight grip over the Burmese people through fear, \nintimidation, and violence.\n  According to the State Department, over the last year the Burmese \nregime has ``severely restricted and frequently violated freedoms of \nassembly, expression, association, movement, and religion.''\n  And in furthering its hold over Burmese society, the regime has \ncommitted crimes of murder, abduction, rape, torture, recruitment of \nchild soldiers, and forced labor--all with impunity.\n  In recent months however, we have seen some encouraging steps.\n  Last November, the Burmese regime released Aung San Suu Kyi, the \nBurmese democracy leader and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, after a \nlong and unjustified incarceration. And the regime has made some modest \nmovement towards dialogue with the opposition.\n  But it is far too soon to think that the walk to freedom has \nsucceeded. Just 2 months after releasing Aung San Suu Kyi, the regime \ndissolved the National League for Democracy, which has sought to bring \ndemocracy to Burma for more than 20 years.\n  And the regime keeps more than 2,000 political prisoners in \ndetention.\n  As Aung San Suu Kyi herself has said, ``If my people are not free, \nhow can you say I'm free? We are none of us free.''\n  In order to help the Burmese people on their march to freedom, I urge \nmy colleagues to extend our sanctions against Burmese imports for \nanother year.\n  Several of our trading partners--including the European Union, \nCanada, and Australia--have joined us in imposing trade and investment \nsanctions against Burma. And these sanctions have put significant \npressure on the Burmese leadership.\n  So let us extend the import sanctions on Burma for another year. Let \nus do our part to help the Burmese people complete their long walk to \nfreedom.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/14/senate-section/article/S5616-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5616-S5617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING MALCOLM WALLOP\n\n  Mr. ENZI. It is with a great deal of sadness I have to tell you that \nSenator Malcolm Wallop, the 18th Senator for the State of Wyoming, \npassed away this afternoon. He had been ill for some time but had had a \nvery active life and made a great deal of difference to this body. We \nwere very fortunate to have Malcolm Wallop represent us in the Senate \nfor 18 years. For all of his three terms he was a powerful and \neffective presence in the Congress, assuring the people of Wyoming they \nwere heard and that their concerns were being addressed. Although there \nare many accomplishments I could mention--and tomorrow I will probably \nmention quite a few more--I want to mention two of them today, as they \nwere very significant efforts.\n  The first was the establishment of the Republican Steering Committee. \nHe and two other Senators considered themselves to be the conservatives \nof the Senate and formed a special caucus that today has grown to \ninclude almost all the Republicans. It was for a smaller government and \nconstitutional principles and spending constraints, and he stuck to \nthose principles throughout his entire Senate career.\n  His other accomplishment--and I can think of none that would make him \nmore proud than the mention that he started the Congressional Awards \nProgram. This is a program for young Americans where they can do \nservice for their community and receive an award from Congress. \nCongress puts no dollars into this, which would be part of the \nphilosophy of Malcolm Wallop. He helped to provide for a number of \npeople through the years to be able to come to Washington and receive \nthe Gold Award. It is set up so when you do 100 hours of community \nservice, you can get a bronze medal. When you do another 100 hours of \nservice, you can get a silver medal. When you do 200 or more hours of \nservice, you get a gold medal.\n  He helped to promote the community spirit and his community service \nhas made a huge difference to Wyoming and has spread across the Nation. \nOf course, we are always very proud in Wyoming that more kids from \nWyoming have gotten the gold medal than from any other State. It partly \nhas to with his founding of it and the time and effort he put into it, \nand that succeeding Senators have. Over the years it has served to \ninspire countless young Americans to believe in themselves and their \nability to change the world beginning in their own backyard and to \nstart some good habits. Thanks to his initiative, the young people of \nour Nation will continue to dare to do great service in their \nneighborhoods and communities, and I cannot think of a better way to \nhave Senator Malcolm Wallop be remembered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Wyoming because\n\n[[Page S5617]]\n\ntoday Wyoming and America lost an extraordinary man. Senator Malcolm \nWallop was a dedicated public servant and great legislator. He leaves a \nproud legacy of a Wyoming Senator who solved problems and initiated \ngreat solutions. He set a high bar for public service, and all of \nWyoming is grateful.\n  Whether he was serving in the Army, the Wyoming legislature, or in \nthe U.S. Senate, Malcolm Wallop always stood for freedom. For decades \nhe worked to strengthen America's national security and to protect \nStates rights. His common sense and his commitment helped break down \nWashington's barriers to American energy development. Our Nation \ncontinues to benefit from his leadership.\n  There will be much more to say about Malcolm in these coming days and \nin the weeks ahead as we seek to honor his legacy.\n  I will miss Malcolm's friendship and his support. My wife Bobbi and I \nsend our very heartfelt condolences to his family and to his friends \nthroughout this great country. We will continue to keep the entire \nWallop family in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, sadly, in just 2 days, about 80,000 people \nwill be out of work because of the obstructionism of one man. This \nSenator, the junior Senator from Oklahoma, is putting his own petty \npriorities ahead of the thousands of safety inspectors, construction \nworkers, and contractors who are about to lose their health care and \ntheir livelihoods for the second time in the last few months. These \nworkers will be furloughed or laid off on Friday if we don't \nreauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration.\n  The same Senator is holding up emergency funding for thousands of \nAmericans--hundreds of thousands, actually--whose homes have been \ndestroyed by tornadoes, floods, and wildfires. Keep in mind what I just \nsaid. We have a bill that came from the House of Representatives that \nfunded for 4 months the Federal Aviation Administration. We have a bill \nthat came from the House--they put them together--to fund the highway \nbill for 6 months. With those two bills together, almost 2 million jobs \nwill be eliminated if we don't pass the highway bill by the end of the \nmonth but FEMA by Friday.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma, to whom I referred, doesn't like a \nprovision in the highway bill. Stopping that is one thing. But now he \nis stopping us from doing something about people who are in desperate \nneed of help, who have been hit hard by fires--in Texas alone, we have \nhad 2,000 homes burned to the ground. So he is holding up emergency aid \nfor Americans whose homes have been destroyed by tornadoes, floods, \nwildfires, and millions of acres of farmland are underwater, and he is \njeopardizing almost 2 million jobs by blocking the highway bill. How he \ngets these together is something I cannot logically understand. He is \nstopping us from doing something on the FAA bill but also FEMA.\n  On Friday, as I said, it is going to cause 80,000 workers, thousands \nof whom are responsible for the millions of air travelers' safety every \nday. We have just been through this. A short time ago, we had the same \nissue, where the safety inspectors were paying for their own lunches \nwhen they would go out inspecting airplanes, and buying their own plane \ntickets, paying for their own hotel and motel rooms, and not being \nreimbursed.\n  It is interesting to note this same Senator voted for the highway \nbill in 2005--we do a major highway bill about every 5 years. He voted \nfor that when his party held the White House, although the bill \nincluded the same issue he has objected to today. I have been told his \nbig concern is over bike trails, bike paths. But the interesting part \nis that he can have a vote on this. He wants a vote to get rid of bike \npaths. He is willing to do that. In fact, we have given him the same \nvote on an amendment before. In 2009, the Senate voted down the very \nsame amendment. He has had this vote before, and it has failed before. \nHe is not willing to even take a vote anymore. This is how far afield \nthis is. He doesn't want a vote. He wants to put whatever he thinks is \nthe right thing for the world and the country as it relates to highways \nin this bill and say: Just do it; I am a dictator, and I am going to \nput it in the bill, and you are not going to do anything around here.\n  We are willing to vote on this again, but we cannot get to a vote \nbecause he is blocking us from doing so. So one Senator out of 100 is \nholding up the important work of this body, demanding that we make this \namendment law or else put 80,000 people out of work. This kind of \nobstruction should end. This is not logical, not rational. I have \nstrong feelings about this part of the highway bill. But this is a bill \nthat has billions of dollars in it. About 1.7 or 1.8 million jobs will \nbe eliminated if we don't get this bill passed. So I urge my Republican \ncolleague to reconsider how this gridlock harms real people in this \ncountry. It is hard for me to explain.\n\n  In Las Vegas we have a new tower that is being built for the air \ntraffic controllers. It is needed very much. Air traffic into Las Vegas \nis heavy--about 60 million people a year arrive, and so we need a new \ntower. We started construction on it a few months ago. It was held up \nonce because of this problem we have with this bill. Now it is to be \nheld up again.\n  But this isn't just a Nevada issue, it is all over the country. About \n75,000 construction workers are working on essential parts of our \nairports, and these jobs are badly needed. It is just the wrong thing \nfor my friend to do. I hope he will allow us to move forward on FEMA \nand allow us to move forward on the Federal Aviation Administration \nlegislation. Of course, on the highway bill, we will give him his vote. \nIf he wants another vote, we will give him another vote if there is \nanother part of the bill he doesn't like. But it is something we need \nto get done as quickly as possible--like in the next 24 hours.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/14/senate-section/article/S5618-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of \nKentucky's oldest and most respected local newspapers, the Hazard \nHerald of Hazard, KY. In July of this year, The Hazard Herald \ncelebrated over a century's worth of news coverage by publishing a \n100th-anniversary edition of its morning paper. The Herald is, and has \nbeen, the most trusted source of local and national news to the people \nof Hazard and Perry County for decades.\n  Founder and prominent lawyer and statesman Bailey P. Wootton, who \neventually served one term as Kentucky attorney general in the 1930s, \nenvisioned that the Herald would serve as the primary medium for \nprogress and information for the local community when he began \npublishing the paper in 1911. Over the years, the Herald became the \nheart of the community, sharing in both the triumphs and sorrows of \ncitizens of the county as it grew alongside them.\n  From the arrival of the first train to Hazard Depot in 1912, which a \nyear later would pave the way for boosting the region's coal industry, \nto the decade-defining flood of 1927 that devastated the county, the \nHerald was front and center. In the 1930s the Herald followed Bailey \nduring his campaign to be elected Kentucky attorney general, as well as \nthe Hazard High School boys' basketball team as they were eventually \ncrowned state champions.\n  World War II in the 1940s forced the Herald to begin printing daily \nto keep people informed with the war efforts in Europe, and it remained \nso until the mid-1950s when it then alternated to a biweekly \npublication. The paper mourned President Kennedy's death with the \nnation in the 1960s, and provided an in-depth account of President Bill \nClinton's visit to Hazard in 1999--which was printed in color after the \npaper adopted color printing technology in the middle of the decade. \nMost recently, the Herald has adopted online publications and social \nmedia to keep pace with the technological advancements that define news \nand media today.\n  Perry County is fortunate to have such an established and trusted \nnews source to inform the great people of Kentucky. In the 100th \nanniversary edition of the Herald, printed July 27, 2011, there is an \narticle that highlights the paper's founding and first decade of \nprinting. To help celebrate this landmark occasion, Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      [From the Hazard Herald, Centennial Edition, July 27, 2011]\n\n       The first decade 1911-1919: The Hazard Herald publishes \n     first issue, begins a tradition still alive a century later.\n       The first edition of The Hazard Herald was hand set and \n     came off the gasoline powered\n\n[[Page S5619]]\n\n     printing press on June 22, 1911. Though we can't find a copy \n     of that first edition, the effect the Herald had on the local \n     community during its first decade is certainly on record.\n       The Herald was operated by its founder and president at the \n     time, Bailey P. Wootton, along with officers George W. \n     Humphries, James B. Hoge, and W.C. Trosper.\n       During that first year, a one-year subscription to the \n     Herald could be purchased for one dollar as the paper's staff \n     covered the growth of Hazard, which at the time was still \n     looking forward to the coming of the railroad a year later, a \n     move that would open up a town that in the years prior was a \n     remote hamlet nearly cut off by the rough and tumble \n     foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.\n       The first two years of the Herald's publication were \n     certainly not easy ones, as noted in Perry County Kentucky: A \n     History, published by the Hazard Chapter of the Daughters of \n     the American Revolution during the 1950s. A publisher in \n     Hazard at that time certainly lacked some of the modern \n     conveniences that newspaper staff today may take for granted: \n     ``With power still not available in 1911, a two H.P. gasoline \n     engine was installed to run the press. After 1912, \n     electricity was available and the changeover was made.''\n       In those first years the Herald also served as a chronicler \n     of Hazard's history (as it still does today). One of the most \n     important events in that history was the arrival of the \n     railroad. In the July 20, 1911 edition, the paper's fifth \n     that first year, a story details work being completed by the \n     Jones-Davis Company regarding construction of a section of \n     the L Railroad which extended ``from below Yerkes to the \n     head of the river of the mouth of Buckeye Creek, about 18 \n     miles.''\n       The first train arrived at the Hazard Depot in 1912, and it \n     not only opened avenues of travel in and out of the county, \n     but it also paved the way for a more robust coal industry, as \n     noted in the Herald's October 7, 1912 edition: ``It will not \n     be long before the coal from this city will be counted by the \n     trainloads instead of the carload.''\n       Other notable events during the decade include a fire in \n     December 1913 that ravaged the business section of town, \n     destroying $50,000 worth of property, according to a headline \n     of the day. Consumed in the fire was the D.Y. Combs Hotel as \n     well as the offices of Dr. Gross and Dr. Hurst.\n       On August 17, 1914, the Herald reported on the first \n     automobile to arrive in Perry County: ``Last Thursday, Hazard \n     and Perry County (sic) were honored by the first automobile \n     ever inside the county limits. We have had the railroad \n     trains upward of two years, and that has ceased to be a \n     wonder; we have had one autocycle, which remained for a few \n     days and departed from whence it came. But the crowning glory \n     of all was the advent of the Ford touring car which passed \n     through our city last Thursday. Now we are on the qui vive \n     for the first aeroplane.''\n       By 1916, Wootton was still listed as the president, with \n     James B. Hoge and W.C. Trosper as secretary and manager \n     respectively, and a weekly editorial appeared in the \n     newspaper as well. In the January 27, 1916 edition, the \n     Herald took to task the City of Hazard for allowing the \n     city's sidewalks to fall in disrepair, writing: ``In any \n     case, there has been no excuse on the part of either Big \n     Bottom residents or the City government for leaving the walks \n     up that way in the shape it has been for such a long time.''\n       While the Herald maintained a local flavor during its first \n     decade, in this age before the Internet and instant news \n     delivery, the paper also made note of issues of national \n     importance. By 1918, World War I ended with the abdication of \n     Kaiser Wilhelm II on November 9. The Herald carried the story \n     with the headline: ``War Is Ended; Kaiser Abdicates.''\n       By the end of the decade, the paper's yearly subscription \n     rate had increased to $1.50 while Bailey Wootton remained the \n     president of the Herald Publishing Company, and John B. \n     Horton had been serving as the editor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/14/senate-section/article/S5619-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5619-S5621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FOREIGN POLICY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, on the outstanding speech he \ndelivered yesterday at the Jesse Helms Center in Wingate, NC. I share \nSenator Rubio's conviction that America is at our best in the world \nwhen we put our values at the center of our foreign policy, beginning \nwith a commitment to the cause of freedom. Senator Rubio's thoughtful \nwarning against the danger of withdrawing behind our borders is \nespecially timely and important. He is absolutely right that, when we \ndo not confront monsters like al-Qaida abroad, they will sooner or \nlater come to threaten us here at home.\n  I thank Senator Rubio for delivering such a lucid and visionary \nspeech. His remarks reaffirm for me the critical leadership role that I \nam convinced he will play in this chamber, and in our country, in the \nyears to come. His voice is an important one. I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record Senator Rubio's remarks as prepared for \ndelivery.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Senator Marco Rubio's Remarks as Delivered Tuesday, September 13, 2011\n\n       Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. First \n     of all, thank you all for coming. I am honored and privileged \n     to be here. I'm impressed by the good work, by the way, that \n     the Helms Center is doing in teaching young people the \n     foreign policy principles that Senator Helms stood for. And \n     I'm honored by this opportunity to speak to you for a few \n     moments eight and a half months into my Senate career on what \n     I think is a historic and important moment in American \n     history. And I hope by the end of our time here together \n     tonight we'll all share that belief irrespective of where we \n     fall on the individual issues.\n       I have come to deeply appreciate Jesse Helms' willingness \n     to fight for his views--particularly in foreign policy--and \n     his unwillingness to compromise on matters of basic \n     principle. That made him rare in Washington, and it also made \n     him influential. I want to read what a distinguished \n     journalist once wrote that it was ``his relentless, \n     unswerving application of conservative principles to \n     practically every issue'' is what ``made him a major player \n     in Washington and [in] national politics.''\n       Jesse Helms was, in particular, an unswerving champion of \n     freedom fighters. When he was still a junior Senator, he and \n     a former governor of California--a fellow named Ronald \n     Reagan--they worked together to introduce a ``morality in \n     foreign policy'' plank to the 1976 Republican platform.\n       Here is what it said, it said: ``The goal of Republican \n     foreign policy is the achievement of liberty under law and a \n     just and lasting peace in the world. The principles by which \n     we act to achieve peace and to protect the interests of the \n     United States must merit the restored confidence of our \n     people.''\n       It also said that ``we must face the world with no \n     illusions about the nature of tyranny.'' And it pledged that: \n     ``Ours will be a foreign policy that keeps this ever in \n     mind.''\n       Now, remarkably, this was controversial in the 1970s--the \n     era of detente, of defeat and of retreat. The idea of placing \n     morality at the center of our dealings with other nations was \n     derided by supposed sophisticates as unrealistic and \n     uninformed.\n       But then Ronald Reagan took these words to heart and he \n     made them the center of his foreign policy--a foreign policy \n     that even his critics now admit was remarkably successful.\n       President Reagan challenged the ``evil empire.''\n       ``Tear down this wall,'' he demanded--and it came down. He \n     won the Cold War not by coddling dictators but by confronting \n     them--and by standing up for the principles that have defined \n     us since the formation of our great Republic.\n       As I think about the challenges of the 21st century--\n     challenges that range from upheavals in the Middle East to \n     the fiscal crisis back home--I am mindful of Ronald Reagan's \n     example and of Jesse Helms'.\n       I am guided by their understanding that America's strength \n     lies in its ideals, and that if we are to make this century \n     another American century, we must be prepared to fight for \n     those ideals.\n       Now, fundamentally, I believe that the world is a better \n     place when the United States of America is strong and \n     prosperous. Now, I don't believe that America has the power \n     or means to solve every issue in the world. But I do believe \n     there are some critically important issues where America does \n     have a meaningful role to play in resolving crises that are \n     tied to our national interests.\n       If we refuse to play our rightful role and shrink from the \n     world, America and the entire world will pay a terrible \n     price. And it is our responsibility to clearly outline to the \n     American people what our proper role in the world is and what \n     American interests are at stake when we engage abroad.\n       At the core of our strength are the ``self-evident'' truths \n     of the Declaration of Independence: ``that all men are \n     created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with \n     certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, \n     Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,'' that government \n     exists to ``secure these rights'' and that it derives its \n     ``just powers from the consent of the governed.''\n       These are not just our rights as Americans. These are the \n     rights of all human beings. Nurtured in thirteen embattled \n     colonies along the Eastern seaboard more than two centuries \n     ago, the blessings of liberties have since spread to more \n     than 100 countries around the world.\n       Freedom's domain now stretches from Mexico to Mongolia. \n     Some of the world's democracies are ancient nations. Others \n     are more recent in origin. Some are poor. Others are rich. \n     Some are Christian. Others Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, \n     Confucian, Hindu. All are united by their respect for certain \n     fundamental human rights--even if they do not always achieve \n     in practice the ideals they seek to honor. America should \n     take pride in knowing that so many of the freedom movements \n     we have seen around the world since 1776 draw their \n     inspiration from the courage and the words of our own \n     Founding Fathers.\n       The honor roll of free countries does not yet include the \n     land of my parents or grandparents--Cuba--but that I believe \n     is only a matter of time. Because sooner or later, the tides \n     of freedom will wash against the shores of this island nation \n     that has been trapped for too long in a prison constructed by \n     Fidel and Raul Castro.\n\n[[Page S5620]]\n\n       Why am I so confident about the future? Because in our \n     time, we have seen how dictatorships have fallen and \n     democracies risen--even in the most unpromising surroundings.\n       Just in the past year, in the Middle East--the region whose \n     governments have been most resistant to freedom--we have seen \n     the first stirrings of democratic upheavals. We do not know \n     how the Arab Spring will ultimately turn out, but it has \n     already proven one thing: that no faith, no ethnicity, no \n     region, and no people are immune to the fundamental desire to \n     control their own destiny.\n       As dissidents and freedom fighters battle dictators around \n     the world, they look for support to the greatest democracy in \n     the world. And America must answer their call.\n       We do not seek to impose our vision of government. We do \n     not insist that every nation must have a presidency, a \n     supreme court or a bicameral legislature. Nor do we have any \n     intention of using force to depose every despotic regime on \n     the planet.\n       But we must do what we can to champion the cause of \n     freedom--not only with the power of our example but also with \n     our money and our resources, our ingenuity and our diplomacy, \n     and on rare occasion, when there is no good alternative and \n     when our national interest is clearly at stake, our armed \n     might.\n       Without our commitment to the rights of man enunciated by \n     our forefathers, what are we? Just another big, rich country. \n     But when we champion our ideals, we gain moral authority--and \n     we gain physical security.\n       You see, we may not always agree with our fellow \n     democracies, but seldom, if ever, do we fight them. The more \n     functioning democracies there are--``functioning'' being the \n     important quality--the easier we can breathe.\n       States that do not respect the rights of their citizens \n     seldom respect the rights of their neighbors. They become \n     breeding grounds for all sorts of ills--from the trafficking \n     of humans and drugs to contagious diseases and famine, from \n     nuclear proliferation to terrorism--that threaten our own \n     security.\n       Now some suggest that America should heed the famous words \n     of John Quincy Adams and go ``not abroad, in search of \n     monsters to destroy.'' The problem is if America turns inward \n     and ignores the monsters abroad, they are likely to come \n     here.\n       It happened in 1917 when German U-boats torpedoed American \n     merchant ships.\n       It happened in 1941 when Japanese aircraft bombed Pearl \n     Harbor.\n       And it happened ten years ago when Al Qaeda carried off the \n     deadliest terrorist attack in history from a base in the \n     Hindu Kush. If we do not have the luxury of ignoring \n     developments in lands as remote as Afghanistan, then there is \n     no corner of the world from which we can safely turn our \n     backs.\n       The fanatics who orchestrated the attacks of 9/11 were \n     nurtured in lands that knew no freedom, in countries where, \n     for too long, the people's pursuit of happiness had been \n     subordinated to the rulers' pursuit of power. A lack of \n     economic, social and political opportunity helped to create \n     the conditions that enabled a radical few--deluded by \n     demented doctrines of hate--to commit mass murder simply to \n     make a statement.\n       The form of the threat was relatively novel: We were \n     attacked not by another nation-state but by a band of \n     terrorists who took shelter in a failed state. But this \n     threat--like the threats of Nazism, fascism, and communism--\n     comes from a sick and failed ideology.\n       With Osama bin Laden's recent demise, the founder of Al \n     Qaeda joined a long list of tyrants--Adolf Hitler to Saddam \n     Hussein--who have experienced for themselves the righteous \n     wrath of a democracy bestirred from its peaceful pursuits.\n       I applaud President Obama for ordering the raid that \n     finally brought Osama bin Laden to his just fate. I applaud \n     the President, too, for his stirring words in support of \n     reformers in the Middle East. I only wish that he had shown \n     more commitment to the cause of freedom. He has been slow and \n     hesitant, and we have missed some significant opportunities \n     to alter the strategic landscape in America's favor. And the \n     President's failure to lead has served to magnify the damage \n     done to U.S. interests.\n       For example, in the summer of 2009, the young people of \n     Iran took to the streets to protest against mullahs that had \n     consigned them to poverty, while squandering oil riches to \n     build nuclear weapons and support foreign terrorist groups. \n     The President was so intent on negotiating with Iran's \n     tyrants that he did little to help its people. As the Green \n     Revolution fizzled, protesters demanded to know, ``Obama, are \n     you with us or against us?''\n       This year, the Administration did come to the aid of the \n     people of Libya, but only after weeks of hesitation that \n     allowed Moammar Qaddafi--an anti-American criminal--to get \n     back on his feet and resume slaughtering his own people.\n       Then it took another four months before the President was \n     willing to recognize the Transitional National Council as the \n     rightful government of Libya. And even then, the \n     Administration refused to commit the resources and make the \n     tactical decisions that could have shortened this conflict.\n       The regime was so lacking in popular support that it \n     finally fell, but the fact that the war dragged on so long \n     has, at a minimum, raised the costs of reconstruction and \n     lengthened the toll of the dead and wounded.\n       An anonymous presidential adviser justified this by \n     claiming that it was part of a deliberate strategy to ``lead \n     from behind''.\n       We could see the same doctrine in effect in Syria where the \n     President waited a full six months after the start of a \n     popular uprising--six months that Bashar Assad and his goons \n     spent indiscriminately slaughtering their own people--before \n     calling for Assad's removal. And even then, the \n     Administration refused to recall our ambassador or impose the \n     entire list of sanctions that some of us in Congress had been \n     pressing for.\n       Now the President's defenders suggest that it was right not \n     to get more involved because they worry about the \n     consequences of turmoil in the Middle East. I've often hear \n     it said that: ``Better the devil you know.'' We should be \n     concerned about what will come next in places like Egypt that \n     have been American allies.\n       I can understand why President Obama hesitated before \n     finally withdrawing our support from Hosni Mubarak, which I \n     believe, under the circumstances, was the right thing to do. \n     But it is hard to see why we would hesitate in the case of \n     Iran, Syria or Libya--all avowed enemies of America. It is \n     hard to imagine a ruler worse than Ahmadinejad, Assad or \n     Qaddafi, and easy to imagine that their successors might be \n     much more amenable to our interests.\n       Even in countries such as Egypt, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, \n     we simply do not have the luxury of endorsing the status quo.\n       Instead of tying our fate to discredited dictators, we \n     would be better advised to build constructive alternatives. \n     That's what Ronald Reagan did when he pushed Ferdinand Marcos \n     out of power in the Philippines in 1986. The following year \n     he did the same thing when he helped push a military ruler \n     out of power in South Korea and supported the transition to \n     civilian rule. Today, South Korea is one of the world's \n     freest countries--and one of the richest. Yet only forty \n     years ago, it was poorer than North Korea and nearly as poor \n     as Syria. Its transformation shows what is possible when free \n     people are allowed to harness their full potential.\n       This is the change that we must encourage in the Middle \n     East. Now unfortunately the views of some of the protestors \n     distasteful. I certainly condemn the anti-Israel sentiments \n     uttered by protest leaders, and I can understand why many \n     Israelis are alarmed by the recent turn of events.\n       Israel is one of America's closest allies in the world, and \n     our closest and most reliable friend in the Middle East. It \n     is a shining bastion of democracy, liberty, and opportunity \n     in one of the most blighted parts of the world. But the naive \n     strategy of trying to appease Islamist extremists like Iran, \n     and turning our back on Israel, will only embolden our common \n     enemies and weaken the prospects for peace--and for democracy \n     itself.\n       For the sake of peace, and out of principle, the United \n     States must strongly affirm its commitment to Israel, not \n     just in words but in deeds.\n       At the same time, the people of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, \n     Syria, Yemen, and other Middle Eastern lands are in the \n     streets because they want a better life for themselves and \n     their children. They aren't asking for the imposition of a \n     Taliban-style rule. They are asking for the ballot box and \n     for economic opportunity. And if their desires are fulfilled, \n     they will move closer to Thomas Jefferson's vision of the \n     world than Osama bin Laden's.\n       That is why I am so concerned that the Administration may \n     let this historic opportunity pass. I am glad that the \n     President is trying to bring along our allies. But our allies \n     would be the first to tell you that nothing important or \n     difficult happens without American leadership. Unfortunately, \n     that leadership has been missing at a critical juncture \n     during the last few years.\n       Most recently, for example, it has been suggested that the \n     advice of military commanders in Iraq be completely ignored \n     in favor of a dramatic troop drawdown that even Iraqis say is \n     too drastic.\n       It's a reminder that, in our republic, elections have \n     consequences not just at home, but all over the world. \n     Because while previous generations of leaders--and even some \n     I serve with today--have stood up for unpopular but necessary \n     measures, even at the risk of losing elections, others are \n     simply too willing to do what is politically self-serving. \n     America, and the entire world for that matter, needs resolute \n     leadership in this era of historic but volatile \n     transformation, particularly in the Middle East--and \n     particularly in Iraq.\n       Beyond the Middle East, in our own hemisphere, a \n     combination of narco-trafficking networks, anti-American \n     strongmen, and the increasing penetration of Iranian \n     influence is raising dangers of a special kind. Individuals \n     like Hugo Chavez, who have no business running anything in \n     the first place much less a country, have worked strenuously \n     to build a bloc of countries to work against U.S. interests--\n     and at great risk to great friends like Colombia.\n       Again, the Administration has missed easy opportunities to \n     stand with our allies, for instance, through free trade \n     agreements. We cannot continue to ignore or be complacent \n     about Latin America, nor can we relegate our friends in the \n     region to anything less than high priority partnerships for \n     us to continue nurturing.\n       After all, the security of our democratic society depends \n     on the success of liberty in our own hemisphere. The fight \n     against drug\n\n[[Page S5621]]\n\n     and human trafficking, and the infiltration of Islamist \n     terrorists requires the success of economic and political \n     freedoms--and of the rule of law--in Latin America. We must \n     be more vigilant--and more decisive--in defending our \n     interests in our own hemisphere.\n       And by the way, the notion that we should ``lead from \n     behind'' would have been incomprehensible even to the \n     Democrat who preceded President Obama. In his second \n     inaugural address, President Bill Clinton said that ``America \n     stands alone as the world's indispensable nation.'' That is \n     as true today as it was in 1997.\n       If America refuses to lead, who will combat international \n     outlaws? Who will stop terrorists and weapons proliferators? \n     Who will deal with the Iranian and North Korean nuclear \n     programs? The rising disorder in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia? \n     The growing challenge from China which seeks to dominate East \n     Asia, but won't even let its own people use Google?\n       The world counts on America. And whether we like it or not, \n     there is virtually no aspect of our daily lives that is not \n     directly impacted by what happens in the world around us. We \n     can choose to ignore global problems, but global problems \n     will not ignore us.\n       Yet our ability to lead is threatened. It's threatened not \n     by any external foe, but rather by our own fiscal woes.\n       This year, the national debt surpassed the size of our \n     economy and it will continue to grow unless we get it under \n     control.\n       Now, I am a strong advocate of cutting unnecessary and \n     wasteful spending, but the defense budget is not the biggest \n     driver of our debt--it accounts for roughly twenty percent of \n     our annual federal spending. By contrast, entitlement \n     programs swallow more than half the budget and they are the \n     main drivers of our debt.\n       The Pentagon already faced sharp cuts. During his last two \n     years in office, Secretary of Defense Gates cut or curtailed \n     procurement programs that, if taken to completion, would have \n     cost $300 billion. This summer, the President and \n     congressional leaders agreed to cut another $350 billion from \n     the defense budget over the next ten years.\n       Those cuts by themselves alone are worrisome enough but \n     what is more worrisome is what's looming: In the worst case \n     scenario, if the so-called Debt Super Committee doesn't reach \n     any deal at all, the Pentagon could stand to be slashed by \n     more than $1 trillion over ten years.\n       Our new secretary of defense--himself is a well-known \n     budget hawk--has warned that cutbacks of this scale would \n     have a ``devastating effect on our national defense.'' I can \n     but echo Leon Panetta's words.\n       The American armed forces have been one of the greatest \n     forces of good in the world during the past century. They \n     stopped Nazism and Communism and other evils such as Serbian \n     ethnic-cleansing. They have helped birthed democracies from \n     Germany to Iraq. They have delivered relief supplies, and \n     performed countless tasks in service to our nation.\n       All they have ever asked for in return is that we provide \n     them the tools to get the job done--and that we look after \n     them and their families. They have never failed us in our \n     time of need.\n       We must not fail them now. We must maintain a strong \n     national defense.\n       Foreign aid is also an important part of America's foreign \n     policy leadership. While we certainly must be careful about \n     spending money on foreign aid, the reality is that it is not \n     the reason we have a growing debt problem.\n       If it is done right, and when done in partnership with the \n     private sector and faith-based community, foreign aid spreads \n     America's influence around the world in a positive way. Let \n     me give you an example: the Bush Administration's program to \n     provide HIV medicine to Africa has not only saved lives, it \n     has increased America's influence across the continent. These \n     are allies in the future that can be our partners, not just \n     in our political struggles on the world stage, but in \n     economic trade. And a world where people are prosperous and \n     free to grow their economies and pursue their own dreams is a \n     better world for all of us.\n       I began by quoting the words of Jesse Helms and Ronald \n     Reagan. In closing, let me recall the great words of one of \n     the most important Democrat leaders of the 20th Century--\n     Harry S. Truman. In 1951, speaking to the New York Avenue \n     Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C., this is what he \n     said:\n       ``I have the feeling that God has created us and brought us \n     to our present position of power and strength for some great \n     purpose. It is not given to us to know fully what that \n     purpose is. But I think we may be sure of one thing. And that \n     is that our country is intended to do all it can in \n     cooperating with other nations to help create peace and \n     preserve peace in the world. It is given to us to defend the \n     spiritual values--the moral code--against the vast forces of \n     evil that seek to destroy them.''\n       There are still vast forces of evil seeking to destroy us. \n     The form of the threat has changed since Truman's time. But \n     evil remains potent--and America remains the strongest line \n     of defense, often the only line of defense.\n       I pray that we will continue to find the wisdom and \n     courage--and resources--to act effectively in the defense of \n     our moral code--the same code that we share with all \n     civilized people. The world needed a strong America in \n     Truman's time. And if this is to be another American Century, \n     the world needs a strong America now.\n       Because freedom cannot survive without us.\n       Thank you so much for having me. May God bless all of you \n     and may God bless our country. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/14/senate-section/article/S5621-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5621-S5622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            REMEMBERING COMPTROLLER GENERAL ELMER B. STAATS\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the memory of \nElmer B. Staats, one of the great civil servants of the post-World War \nII era. A former Comptroller General of the United States and head of \nthe General Accounting Office, as GAO was then called, Mr. Staats died \nJuly 23 in Washington at the age of 97.\n  Elmer Staats had the distinction of serving under every U.S. \nPresident from Franklin Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan. But more important \nthan the longevity of his career was his record of professional \nachievement. A leading figure in the world of public administration and \ngovernment accountability, Elmer Staats was renowned for his dedication \nto constructive change and good government principles.\n  Appointed Comptroller General in 1966, Elmer Staats helped lay the \nfoundation for the modern-day GAO. He transformed it from an agency \nprimarily known for financial audit work to one that evaluates the \neffectiveness of virtually every Federal activity at home and abroad, \nfrom antipoverty programs to military spending to investments in \ninfrastructure.\n  At the start of Staats' tenure at GAO, accountants comprised more \nthan 95 percent of the agency's professional staff. By the time he \nretired in 1981, the agency's workforce included such diverse \nprofessionals as economists, social scientists, attorneys, and computer \nexperts--all career employees hired on the basis of their knowledge, \nskills, and ability.\n  Under Elmer Staats, GAO took a lead role in issuing auditing \nguidance. In 1972, the Comptroller General issued the first edition of \nwhat has come to be known as the ``Yellow Book''--the final word on \ngovernment auditing standards. He also directed GAO to issue guidance \nto help state and local auditors and was instrumental in establishing \nintergovernmental audit forums in the 1970s.\n  In addition, Elmer Staats sought to strengthen ties with the \ninternational auditing community through his active involvement and \nleadership in the International Organization of Supreme Audit \nInstitutions. He founded GAO's International Auditor Fellowship Program \nin 1979, which enables auditors from other countries to meet with GAO \nstaff and acquire new knowledge and perspectives.\n  His is a living legacy that is still delivering results, both for \nCongress and the American people. Just name a Federal program or \npolicy, GAO has probably reviewed it and made suggestions for \nimprovement. Last year, measurable financial benefits from GAO work \ntotaled nearly $50 billion, an $87 return on every dollar invested in \nGAO.\n  Elmer Boyd Staats was born in Richfield, KS, in 1914. His family were \nwheat farmers. The only one of his eight siblings to attend college, \nElmer Staats graduated Phi Beta Kappa from McPherson College in 1935, \nand later earned a master's degree in political science and economics \nfrom the University of Kansas and a doctorate in political economy at \nthe University of Minnesota, where he wrote his dissertation on the new \nSocial Security Administration.\n  Elmer Staats' career in the Federal Government began in 1939, when he \njoined the Bureau of the Budget, now the Office of Management and \nBudget. His talents were recognized early on, and he served in high-\nlevel posts at the Bureau under Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, \nand Johnson. Eventually, he became the Bureau's Deputy Director before \nPresident Johnson appointed him to a 15-year term as the fifth \nComptroller General of the United States. He held that post through the \nadministrations of Presidents Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter, and \ninto the early months of the Reagan administration.\n  After leaving GAO, Elmer Staats became the president and later \nchairman of the board of trustees of the Harry S. Truman Scholarship \nFoundation. He was a member of the Governmental Accounting Standards \nBoard from 1984 to 1990. During the 1990s, he served as the\n\n[[Page S5622]]\n\nfirst chairman of the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board.\n  Elmer Staats helped found the American Society for Public \nAdministration in 1939 and later served as its national president and \nvice president. He was also a founding member in 1967 of the National \nAcademy of Public Administration and remained a trusted advisor on many \nAcademy projects over the years. He received numerous awards for \ndistinguished public service, along with honorary degrees from eight \nuniversities. He was elected to the Accounting Hall of Fame in 1981.\n  When asked whether he was a Republican or a Democrat, Elmer always \npolitely but firmly declined to answer. In fact, he was famous for \nhaving a needlepoint pillow in his office that featured an elephant on \none side and a donkey on the other. The message about his and GAO's \nnonpartisan role in government was clear.\n  As Bob Schieffer observed in a recent commentary on ``Face the \nNation,'' Elmer Staats' reputation in Washington was such that you \n``knew you could take what his agency reported to the bank--its facts \nwere seldom disputed, its neutrality never challenged, his political \naffiliation never known.''\n  I want to express my gratitude for Elmer Staat's many years of \nexemplary service to our Nation. His intelligence, dedication, and \nintegrity will be missed. At the same time, Elmer Staats set an example \nfor the type of men and women who will be needed to help lead our \ngovernment in the future--individuals of outstanding ability, sound \ncharacter, and a genuine commitment to the greater good.\n  My thoughts and prayers go to his three children--David Staats, \nDeborah Sanders, and Catharine Taubman--and to his three grandchildren \nand great-granddaughter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/14/senate-section/article/S5622-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this Saturday, the Nation marks the 224th \nanniversary of the day when the Founders signed the fundamental charter \nfor our democracy--the Constitution of the United States. During the \nConstitutional Convention, the delegates debated hundreds of issues and \nproposals before crafting the final charter. Thankfully, the Founders \nhad the foresight to know that their debate would not be the final word \non the subject. The work of defining our Nation--ensuring protection of \nrights for all Americans--would continue, as we strive to create ``a \nmore perfect union.''\n  It was through the leadership of the late Senator Robert C. Byrd that \nthe Congress began to officially celebrate the signing of the \nConstitution, calling the September 17 anniversary Constitution Day. \nSenator Byrd understood the importance of ensuring that future \ngenerations value our Nation's founding charter. This week, in schools \nacross the country, students will learn about the Constitutional \nConvention and the meaning of Constitution Day.\n  For well over two centuries, the Constitution has allowed America to \nflourish and, importantly, adapt to new challenges. Since the inclusion \nof the Bill of Rights in 1791, the Constitution has been amended just \n17 times. There has been much discussion of late about amending our \nNation's fundamental charter. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, that is not something that I take lightly. Proposing \namendments to the Constitution should not be a reflexive response to \npolitical threats. Each Member of Congress swears to support and defend \nthe Constitution; it should be treated with the reverence it deserves, \nnot as leverage in heated political debate. While I certainly believe \nthat the Constitution has been improved over time in our effort to \ncreate a more perfect union, those amendments were thoroughly \nconsidered and debated over time. Before we alter our national charter, \nwe must openly consider whether such amendment would hamstring future \ngenerations.\n  Pressure groups may demand that elected representatives sign pledges \nabout what they will and will not do if elected to office. The pledge I \nfollow--the one I was honored to make again at the beginning of this \nCongress--is to uphold the Constitution. I take that pledge seriously. \n``We the People'' owe a great debt to the Framers of our Constitution. \nAnd as we commemorate the signing of the Constitution of the United \nStates of American 224 years ago, I hope all Americans will take this \nopportunity to read the words of our founding charter and learn about \nhow it protects us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/14/senate-section/article/S5622-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO KEEGAN BRADLEY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with the Senate now back in session, as a \nVermonter I would like to call the Senate's attention to Mr. Keegan \nBradley's first-place finish in the 93rd Professional Golf \nAssociation's Championship Tournament on Sunday, August 14. Mr. Bradley \nis the first male golfer born in Vermont to win a major PGA \nChampionship.\n  Keegan Bradley has earned a permanent place for himself, and Vermont, \nin the record books. As a rookie golfer, his participation in the 2011 \nPGA Championship is his first major tournament, making him one of only \nthree rookie golfers ever to place first in a major tournament debut. \nThis win also marks the end of a six-major tournament dry spell for \nAmerican golfers. In order to win this year's PGA Championship, Bradley \nneeded to demonstrate tenacity and determination. Keegan successfully \ncame back from a four-shot deficit in the last three holes of the \ntournament, proving his ability to focus and overcome obstacles.\n  His PGA Championship win extends Mr. Bradley's successful start to \nhis professional golf career. Most notably, he placed first in another \nPGA tournament earlier this year, the HP Byron Nelson Championship in \nTexas. In 2011 he has also finished in the top 10 in 4 PGA tournaments, \nas well as having finished within the top 25 in 10 others.\n  Even more impressively, Keegan Bradley has spent many of his younger \nyears living in the New England area, with seasonal weather that did \nnot always afford him the luxury of training year-round. This resulted \nin much time-sensitive dedication and focus, as winter weather inhibits \nyear-round outside practice in our part of the country.\n  Keegan Bradley was born in Woodstock, VT, in 1986 and attended \nWoodstock High School. He is the son of Mr. Mark Bradley, golf \nprofessional at Crown Point Golf Club, and Mrs. Kay Bradley. Keegan is \nalso the nephew of Ms. Pat Bradley, a Ladies Professional Golf \nAssociation Hall-of-Famer. I am proud to recognize Keegan Bradley for \nhis accomplishment, both as a Vermonter and a professional golfer. I \njoin all Vermonters in wishing him many more years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/14/senate-section/article/S5622-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/14/senate-section/article/S5622-4", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/14/senate-section/article/S5622-5", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:23 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2218.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \npersonal savings and retirement savings coverage by allowing employees \nnot covered by qualified retirement plans to save for retirement \nthrough automatic IRAs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Automatic \nIRA Act of 2011. When fully phased in, this bill will give nearly 42 \nmillion Americans nationwide an easy, effective way to take \nresponsibility for their financial futures and plan for a secure \nretirement. The Act incorporates the President's call, in his Proposed \nfiscal year 2010, 2011, and 2012 Budgets, for Congress to enact \nAutomatic IRA legislation.\n  Currently, about half of American workers have no opportunity to save \nfor retirement at work. In my home State of New Mexico, that share is \nnearly 60 percent. Among those lacking coverage at work, only one in \nten contributes annually to an individual retirement account, IRA; the \nrest generally make no dedicated savings for retirement. The result? An \nalarming number of American workers are woefully unprepared for a \nfinancially secure retirement. According to Boston College's Center for \nRetirement Research, ``in 2009 half of today's households will not have \nenough retirement income to maintain their pre-retirement standard of \nliving, even if they work to age 65, which is above the current average \nretirement age.'' Especially in this period of economic uncertainty, it \nis imperative that Congress focus on this retirement savings crisis. My \nbill takes a common-sense approach to doing so.\n  Under this bill, most private-sector employees working in \nestablishments of 10 or more employees who are not currently covered by \na workplace retirement plan would be given the opportunity to save \nthrough regular payroll deposits that continue automatically, unless \nthey elect out. The savings will be deposited into the worker's own \nIRA, which will be subject to the laws already in place governing IRA \naccounts. Employers' administrative functions will be minimal. And the \narrangement is market-oriented; other than the smallest of accounts, \nautomatic IRAs will be provided by the same banks, mutual funds, \ninsurance carriers, and other institutions that currently provide them.\n  The automatic IRA approach is intended to help these households \novercome the barrier of inertia. It builds on the successful use--\nencouraged by reforms I strongly supported the Pension Protection Act \nof 2006--of automatic features in 401(k) plans that encourage employees \ntoward sensible decisions, while allowing them to make alternative \nchoices. We have already seen evidence that automatic 401(k) enrollment \ncan dramatically boost employee participation rates, from seven in ten \neligible workers to 9 in 10. In the 401(k) context, the gains are even \nmore striking for population groups least likely to save, including \nwomen, Latino, and low-income workers.\n  Of the 75 million American workers who now are not covered by \nemployment-based retirement plans, an estimated 42 million would be \neligible to save and enroll under Automatic IRA legislation. This \nincludes more than 250,000 in my home state of New Mexico. Many of \nthese individuals are familiar with IRAs. But when asked why they \nhaven't used the existing program, about half point to issues relating \nto setup and decision-making as the key barriers. The automatic IRA \nwould eliminate these barriers, and the Retirement Security Project \nestimates that automatic IRA legislation could increase net national \nsaving by nearly $15 billion annually.\n  This is the fourth consecutive Congress in which I have introduced \nAutomatic IRA legislation. The concept was initially developed by \nscholars at the Brookings Institution and Heritage Foundation. Indeed, \nthe Automatic IRA concept has long enjoyed broad support across the \npolitical spectrum. For instance, Martin Feldstein, chief economic \nadvisor to President Reagan, has described himself as ``a great \nenthusiast of automatic enrollment IRAs'' who thinks ``as a policy, \nit's a no-brainer'' and ``can't imagine why there would be any \nsignificant opposition from political players on either side of the \naisle.''\n  Finally, this bill seeks to send a strong signal of preference for \nemployers to offer qualified retirement plans,\n\n[[Page S5626]]\n\nlike 401(k)s. Among other features, it doubles the credit for employers \nthat newly establish qualified plans and it directs the Secretaries of \nthe Treasury and Labor to implement final regulations and establish a \nmodel plan for Multiple Employer Plans.\n  I am grateful that my colleague on the Senate Finance Committee, \nSenator Kerry, is joining me in introducing this bill. I am also \npleased to note the broad range of stakeholders supporting the \nAutomatic IRA concept, including AARP; the American Society of Pension \nProfessionals & Actuaries; Aspen Institute's Initiative on Financial \nSecurity; the Business and Professional Women's Foundation; CFED; \nConsumers Union; FINRA; the Minority Business Roundtable; New Economics \nfor Women; the United States Black Chamber; the United States Women's \nChamber of Commerce; Women Impacting Public Policy; and the Women's \nInstitute for a Secure Retirement.\n  Ensuring easy access to a retirement account and the ability to have \npart of their wages go directly from their paycheck into this account \nare proven strategies to encourage retirement savings. I call on the \nSenate to take up this bill and give it full consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1559. A bill to establish the San Juan Islands National \nConservation Area in the San Juan Islands, Washington, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the San Juan \nIslands National Conservation Area Act.\n  The San Juan Islands in northwest Washington host some of the most \nbeautiful, serene spots in the world. The San Juans are made up of 172 \nislands with over 300 miles of shoreline, some little more than rocks, \nothers home to towns, farms, and forests. The coastlines are a mix of \nsandy and rocky beaches, shallow and deep harbors, and placid and reef-\nstudded bays. And between the many islands run channels of water that \nsupport many of Washington's most important marine species, including \nabundant salmon runs and our majestic regional icon, the orca whale.\n  Included in the San Juan Islands are nearly 1,000 acres of land owned \nby the Federal Government, spread out over 60 separate locations and \nmanaged by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, BLM. These parcels, \nwhich range from pine forests to lighthouses, provide recreational, \necological, historical, cultural, and scientific benefits to island \nresidents and around 70,000 tourists that visit each year.\n  Despite their value, no long-term comprehensive management plan \nexists for these Federal parcels, threatening continued preservation \nand public access to these sites. Many of these areas are fragile, \nincreasing the challenge of accommodating increasing numbers of \nvisitors.\n  In addition, San Juan Island residents have seen the possibility of \npublic lands they treasure being transferred to private ownership. In \n2005, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources made a \nunilateral decision to divest itself of all its properties in San Juan \nCounty, including Mitchell Hill, a popular and scenic hiking trail on \nSan Juan Island. While these lands were actively pursued by a private, \nout-of-state, real-estate developer, I was proud to work with the San \nJuan Island community to help secure Federal funding to keep these \nlands in the public domain.\n  Unfortunately, the Bureau of Land Management lands in the San Juan \nIslands are not permanently protected or preserved in public ownership. \nLast July, Congressman Larsen, the Bureau of Land Management, and I \nvisited with residents and businesses that have been working for years \nto permanently protect these special places.\n  The legislation I introduce today is a direct result of our efforts \nand represents a consensus between the San Juan Island community, \nCongressman Larsen, and the Department of the Interior. If enacted, the \nSan Juan Islands National Conservation Area Act will designate all \n1,000 acres of BLM lands in the San Juans as a National Conservation \nArea, ensuring that these natural treasures remain protected, \naccessible to the public, and better managed to accommodate visitor \nuse.\n  National Conservation Area designated lands are considered some of \nthe most important Bureau of Land Management properties and are \ntherefore a higher priority for management funding than non-designated \nlands they manage. Specifically, National Conservation Area status \nwould ensure the San Juan Island properties are appropriately managed \nto protect their unique qualities and not grouped in with other BLM \nlands where activities such as mining, oil and gas exploration, off \nroad vehicle use, and grazing are allowed. Importantly, my legislation \nrequires that the management plan drafting process allows for local \ninput into how these properties are to be managed for the long-term.\n  A National Conservation Area designation will also foster a stronger \nworking relationship with other agency partners such as the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service and provide increased opportunities for sharing \nresources.\n  I am looking forward to working to advance this legislation through \nthe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and through the full \nSenate. Through our efforts we will work to ensure that future \ngenerations will be able to enjoy these special parts of the San Juan \nIslands.\n  I would also like to thank my colleague Senator Murray for agreeing \nto cosponsor this legislation, and Congressman Larsen for his \nleadership and introducing companion legislation today in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1559\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance access to controlled substances for \nresidents of institutional long-term care facilities, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Nursing Home \nResident Pain Relief Act of 2011. This legislation will help ensure \nthat nursing home residents have timely access to pain medication as \nneeded in emergency situations. By streamlining processes that can now \ncause delays in administering these vital drugs, the bill will also \nallow designated health care professionals to administer controlled \nsubstances to residents whose medical conditions warrant quick pain \nrelief.\n  To accomplish these ends, the legislation amends the Controlled \nSubstances Act, CSA, in several ways. First, it allows nurses and other \nappropriately licensed health professionals, designated by the nursing \nhome and with approval from the physician, to order and administer pain \nmedication to residents upon a physician's oral prescription. The bill \nalso establishes a clear chain of accountability for these licensed \nhealth professionals, physicians, as well as for nursing homes and \nlong-term care pharmacies.\n  Last year, the Special Committee on Aging, which I Chair, held a \nlistening session where we heard about a recent Drug Enforcement \nAgency, DEA, enforcement initiative that has kept nursing home \nresidents from receiving much-needed medication to manage their pain. \nFor many years, nurses had been able to call urgently-needed \nprescriptions into pharmacies upon a physician's order over the phone. \nPharmacies would fill the order, residents would get their pain \nmedication, and physicians would follow up with written confirmation of \nthe prescription. Now, DEA requires physicians to directly issue \nprescriptions in writing for Schedule II pain medications before they \ncan be dispensed, including in emergency circumstances. This poses a \nproblem for nursing home residents because facilities often do not have \nphysicians on site to fill out the necessary paper work in time to \nprovide critically needed pain medicine. The DEA's enforcement \ninitiative has created an unintended consequence where nursing home \nresidents often have to suffer for several hours or even days before \nthey receive pain medication.\n  These delays have serious consequences. Here is an all-too-common \nscenario: an elderly resident that returns to a nursing home after \nsurgery may be in more pain than his physician anticipated and need \nmore medication than the physician prescribed to manage the pain. In \norder to access the medication he needs, the nursing home employees \nmust first have his physician send a written prescription to a \npharmacy. If the physician is difficult to locate or slow to respond, \nthis can take hours or even days. The resident's\n\n[[Page S5628]]\n\npain may become so unmanageable while he waits that he must be \ntransported by ambulance to a hospital emergency room. The ambulance \nride and emergency room admission are not only expensive; they can set \nback the fragile resident's recovery from surgery. Our legislation \nwould make these situations entirely avoidable.\n  DEA's enforcement initiative effectively put nursing home providers \nin a difficult position: If they follow the letter of the law, they are \nin danger of violating Health and Human Services regulations requiring \nthem to administer medications in a timely manner. Failure to do so can \nresult in monetary penalties. In addition, pharmacies could face fines \nunder the CSA if they respond to the nursing home's order--which is \nalmost always transmitted by a nurse--if they fill the order. As a \nresult, a number of pharmacies, including several in the Midwest, are \nfacing tens of millions of dollars in fines imposed by DEA.\n\n  Last year DEA issued a policy statement to provide a way for nursing \nhome residents to access some kinds of medication more quickly. Under \nthis new policy, a nursing home's licensed health care professionals \nmay, on a physician's behalf, transcribe the physician's oral \nprescription for Schedule III, IV or V medications to a pharmacy to be \nfilled. While we appreciated DEA's efforts, without amending the CSA \nthe agency does not have the statutory authority to allow licensed \nhealth care professionals to transmit prescriptions for Schedule II \ncontrolled substances, the category under which nearly all pain \nmedications fall. Legislation is required in order to provide nursing \nhome residents prompt, reliable pain relief when they are suffering \nfrom severe injury or illness.\n  Our bill would provide a remedy by modifying the CSA to permit pain \nmedication to be dispensed in emergency situations by nursing home \nprofessionals without a direct written order by a physician prior to \nits dispensing. Let me explain how this would work. A physician, if he \nor she chooses, would be able to authorize the administrator of a long-\nterm care facility to designate one or more licensed health care \nprofessionals employed by the facility to act as a ``facility \ndesignee.'' In emergency situations only, and upon receiving an oral \nprescription from the physician, a facility designee would be permitted \nto contact a pharmacy to have the prescription filled and then dispense \nSchedule II medications to long-term care facility residents.\n  This would allow a physician to provide the prescription information \nto the facility designee via phone when a resident urgently needs pain \nmedication and the physician is unavailable to transmit a written \nprescription to a pharmacy for a Schedule II controlled substance. The \nfacility designee must document the physician's prescription in writing \nand transmit the written document to a pharmacy so that the \nprescription can be filled. After the pharmacy fills the prescription, \nit must send a copy of the written document memorializing the \nprescription to the physician for his or her endorsement. The physician \nmust then send the endorsed document, confirming the oral prescription, \nto the pharmacy within five business days.\n  Diversion of controlled substances for illicit purposes is of great \nconcern to me. That is why we have included numerous provisions to \nprotect against diversion in nursing homes. For example, the bill \nrequires careful recordkeeping by facilities and pharmacies, which can \nthen be reviewed by DEA as necessary. It requires each actor--the \nphysician, facility designee, and pharmacist--to make a record of his \nor her role in the process. Long-term care facilities are asked to \nmaintain a written or electronic logbook that memorializes \nprescriptions and their administration.\n  Additionally, the legislation enhances criminal and civil penalties \nfor long-term care facility administrators and facility designees who \ndivert drugs, or who violate recordkeeping requirements. These steps \nwill help to ensure that pain medications get to those nursing home \nresidents who need them.\n  I appreciate the great interest of the stakeholders, including long-\nterm care facility, physician and pharmacy organizations, in solving \nthis problem and I look forward to working with them to finally end the \nneedless delay in pain relief. I would like to thank Attorney General \nHolder, DEA Administrator Michelle Leonhardt, and their staff for \nworking with me on this legislation, and I look forward to continuing \nour work together to assure rapid approval by Congress.\n  Nursing home residents cannot wait for pain medication when they are \nin debilitating pain and our straightforward bill can help provide some \nneeded relief. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/14/senate-section/article/S5628-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 266--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF ``NATIONAL \n SAVE FOR RETIREMENT WEEK'', INCLUDING RAISING PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE \n   VARIOUS TAX-PREFERRED RETIREMENT VEHICLES AND INCREASING PERSONAL \n                           FINANCIAL LITERACY\n\n  Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Cardin) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S5628, September 14, 2011, under the heading SUBMITTED \nRESOLUTIONS, the following appears: Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. \nEnzi, and Mr. Cardin) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Finance: S.
