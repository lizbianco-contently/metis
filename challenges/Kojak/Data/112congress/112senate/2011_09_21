Madam President, this morning we learned that the \nRepublican leaders of the House of Representatives and the Senate have \ndone something which may be unprecedented. We are searching for some \nexample in the past when this has occurred, but we have learned today \nthat the Republican leaders of both the House and the Senate have sent \na letter to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke ahead of the central \nbank's 2-day meeting that begins today. That letter to Chairman \nBernanke from the Republican congressional leaders instructs him as to \nwhat they should try to achieve during their 2-day meeting.\n  A former Commissioner of the Federal Reserve said this is outrageous; \nthat an independent agency such as the Federal Reserve, which is \noperated with independence of political impact and political pressure \nover the years, would now be receiving direct political communications \nfrom the Republican leaders.\n  What is the message from the Republican leaders to the Federal \nReserve? The message is, don't lower interest rates. I don't know if \nSenator McConnell, Senator Kyl, Speaker Boehner, or Congressman Cantor \nhave been home lately. But if they have been home and met with local \nbusinesses, small businesses, they will have learned very quickly that \nit is very difficult for them to borrow money to sustain and expand \ntheir businesses and to hire more people.\n  As we have a monetary policy which allows expansion of these \nbusinesses and expansion of jobs across America, we have an opportunity \nto try to put this recession behind us. So what is the message of the \nRepublican leaders to\n\n[[Page S5796]]\n\nthe Federal Reserve Board? The message is clear and simple: Do nothing. \nStand by the sidelines and watch this economy languish.\n  It is the same message the Republican leaders are sending the \nPresident of the United States. He came to us almost 2 weeks ago and \nsaid: We have to move together to make this economy stronger. We have \nto find a way, working together, to create jobs. The President said: \nLet's give to working families across America a tax cut, a payroll tax \ncut. The average family in my State of Illinois will receive about \n$1,500 a year. This will help those families who are working but \nstruggling from paycheck to paycheck.\n  The Republican response to them: No. They have said to the President \nthey will not accept a payroll tax cut for the working families and \nmiddle-income families across America.\n  The President said: Let's give to businesses across America some \nhelp. Let's reduce the payroll tax. In fact, let's create a tax \nincentive for these businesses to hire unemployed workers.\n  We know there are plenty of people out there who need work. Some \nbusinesses, with an enticement through the Tax Code, may be able to \nfinally hire that extra worker and reduce the unemployment rolls.\n  The Republican answer, again, is no. Time and again, when either the \nFederal Reserve Board or the President or, in fact, any economist \nsuggests that we need to move forward as a nation to deal with the \nrecession, the answer from the Republican side of the aisle is no.\n  Now, with this letter to the Federal Reserve, the Republican \ncongressional leaders are telling the Federal Reserve, we believe for \nthe first time in history, that they should not provide a vehicle for \nexpansion by lowering interest rates in this economy.\n  That, to me, is wrongheaded. When I think of the businesses looking \nto borrow money, when I think of those homeowners who need to refinance \ntheir homes, interest rates are critical to the expansion of this \neconomy. Time and again, the Republican approach to this economy has \nbeen simply stated in just a few words: Do nothing and protect the \nmillionaires.\n  When the President steps forward and asks the wealthiest among us to \npay something more in terms of their own taxes, which is only fair, the \nRepublicans cry foul, class warfare, and all the words they have used \nto defend their position defending millionaires across America. Most \npeople across American understand we are going to need to have shared \nsacrifice to emerge from this recession. A lot of families are making \nthat sacrifice today. Working families and middle-income families have \nbeen falling behind for a long time. We want to help them with a \npayroll tax cut and by creating some life in this economy that creates \nnew jobs.\n  Unfortunately, we have no help coming from the Republican side of the \naisle. The President believes, as we do, that putting workers back on \nthe job while rebuilding and modernizing America is the best way to see \nus through this recession. He believes there are pathways back to work \nfor Americans looking for jobs. He wants to restructure the \nunemployment compensation program using some innovative techniques that \nhave been popular in the past with Republicans but now are being \nrejected because the President offers them--an idea that has been \nsuggested of allowing some unemployed workers to come back to work and \nstill draw unemployment so they can have valuable work experience and \nperhaps find a long-term permanent position.\n\n  Tax relief for workers and families across America--cutting payroll \ntaxes in half for 160 million workers--is going to be a break they \nneed. Many of these workers and working families are struggling with \nhigh gasoline prices. Does $125 a month mean that much to a Senator or \nCongressman? Maybe not. But if you are living paycheck to paycheck and \nyou just saw gasoline go over $4 a gallon, $125 is absolutely essential \nso you can make it back and forth to work and do what is necessary for \nyour family. The President's payroll tax cut will help these working \nfamilies, and Republicans oppose it.\n  This plan also has deficit reduction. The President understands, as \nwe all do, that the deficit America now faces in our long-term debt \nneeds to be faced squarely. He believes--and I share that belief--we \nshould spend the next year building the economy but make it clear that \nover the long term we are going to take the actions necessary to reduce \nour deficit substantially over a 10-year period of time by more than $4 \ntrillion. That is what the President announced when he made his \nstatement on Monday.\n  He also realizes that while cutting the deficit and reducing \nAmerica's debt, we have to keep our promise, the promise to Americans \nwho receive Social Security. Twenty-six percent of Social Security \nrecipients have no other source of income. If we talk about cutting \nthose benefits or privatizing Social Security, as many Republicans do, \nwe are putting at risk, literally, the lifeblood of 26 percent of \nSocial Security recipients.\n  For 70 percent of Social Security recipients, Social Security \nrepresents more than half of their income. So they listen carefully as \nthe President says we are going to protect the basic benefits under \nSocial Security. The same holds true for Medicare. Medicare is a \nprogram that has been dramatically successful. Don't take my word for \nit, don't take any politicians' word for it, look at the life \nexpectancy for senior citizens since we passed Medicare in the 1960s. \nSenior citizens can live independently, with more confidence, and live \nlonger because of Medicare.\n  We know we have to make changes in this program, but let's do it in \nthe spirit of preserving the basic benefit structure of Medicare. That \nis essential, and the President has made that clear too. Those on the \nRepublican side who support the Congressman Paul Ryan budget, which \nwould basically hand out vouchers to seniors and say good luck in the \ninsurance marketplace, ignore the reality that as people age they \nsometimes face medical challenges that others don't have, and they need \nthe benefit and protection of Medicare in years to come.\n  The President is committed to that. The Democrats are committed to \nthat. It should be a bipartisan commitment.\n  The same is true when it comes to Medicaid. This is a program across \nAmerica that is essential in New York and Illinois. Thirty-six percent \nof all the children in the State of Illinois rely on Medicaid for \nhealth insurance. More than half of the babies born in my State are \npaid for by the Medicaid Program, and 20 percent of Medicaid recipients \nin Illinois consume 60 percent of the money spent. Most of them are \nelderly people who are very poor, living on Medicare, relying on \nMedicaid to stay in a convalescent setting or a nursing home setting.\n  So Medicaid has to be protected as well. That is a challenge the \nPresident and those of us on the Democratic side accept.\n  The bottom line is, we can move this economy forward in a \ncoordinated, bipartisan effort; use the President's payroll tax cuts, \nthe business tax cuts that are fully paid for; make certain we are \ndedicated to rebuilding America's basic infrastructure; and make \ncertain, as well, that we take care of our own: the veterans returning \nfrom war, 10 percent of whom are out of work today. That is an \nembarrassment, and it is one that should come to an end immediately. We \nshould work on a bipartisan basis to encourage their being hired.\n  There is something else that worries me as we come to the end of this \nweek and face a recess for both the House and Senate. The Republican \nleader, Congressman Eric Cantor of Virginia, has suggested we may be \nfacing another government shutdown threat. It is just incredible that \nthe Republican leader would bring that up as one of the options as we \ngo into this week before recess.\n  We don't need this. We have faced two previous threats this year from \nthe tea party-dominated Republican House of Representatives. They \nthreatened to close down the government when we passed the continuing \nresolution. They threatened again to close down the economy when we \nfaced the debt ceiling.\n  At this moment, this perilous moment in America's economic history, \nwe should not face a government shutdown again, and the Republican \nleaders in the House should not be suggesting that as an alternative. \nWe need to work together.\n  The bottom line issue is disaster aid. I think the Senator from New \nYork\n\n[[Page S5797]]\n\nknows, as I do--in Illinois we have faced these natural disasters; 48 \nStates have this year. Hurricane Irene, I know, did tremendous damage \nin the State of New York. Earlier this year in the spring the flooding \non the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers did tremendous damage in my State of \nIllinois. We cannot predict when these natural disasters will come, and \nwe certainly cannot predict how much they will cost. Now the \nRepublicans in the House are insisting that we have to pay for every \ndollar of disaster aid.\n  What are their pay-fors? Take a look at it. It is a program we \ncreated to encourage the creation of manufacturing jobs in the United \nStates, making fuel-efficient vehicles. The Republicans say eliminate \nit, eliminate a program focused on putting Americans back to work in \ngood-paying jobs, building the vehicles of the future so we can be \ncompetitive not only at home but overseas? The Republicans say that is \nsomething government should not do.\n  It is a consistent pattern, whether it is their message to the \nFederal Reserve to do nothing when it comes to lowering interest rates, \nwhether it is their message to the President to do nothing when it \ncomes to payroll taxes to help middle-income families and business tax \ncredits to put people back to work or when it comes to paying for \ndisasters when they suggest eliminating a program that will create \nmanufacturing jobs in the United States. Time and again, the philosophy \nof the Republicans comes through: Stand by; do nothing.\n  We saw it as well when it came to making certain that General Motors \nand Chrysler survived the crises of the last several years. The \nRepublican position was: Do nothing.\n  There are many employees whose jobs are at stake when we talk about \nthe automobile industry--all across America. We often think of some of \nthe big names now that we see every day in the news. There are about \n3,000 employees of an operation known as Facebook. There are around \n30,000 employees of a company known as Google. There are 200,000 direct \nemployees of General Motors, not to mention the millions who are \nsuppliers and vendors of their products. To me, that is an indication \nof the shortsightedness of the Republican approach. Ignoring the \nreality of an automobile industry that needed a helping hand meant, if \nthe Republicans had their way, GM and Chrysler may not exist today. \nThank goodness they did not have their way. The President stepped in, \nmade the changes necessary, encouraged the management of these \ncompanies to restructure in light of the new economic realities, and \nthe companies survived.\n\n  In my home State of Illinois, in Belvidere, we are proud to have a \nChrysler facility. I talked to the CEO of Chrysler. He believes--and I \ncertainly concur--this facility has a bright future because the \ngovernment helped Chrysler through an economic crisis, and now they are \nrestructuring to build for the future. That is the kind of forward-\nlooking view of the economy that we need.\n  When the Republicans instruct the Federal Reserve Board to do nothing \nto help the economy, say to the President: Do nothing to help the \neconomy, and then threaten a government shutdown over paying for \ndisaster relief across America, that is shortsighted. It is not \nconsistent with the economic growth we need in this country to make \ncertain we are moving forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Earlier this week, I met with leaders in the Ohio \nJewish community about events that could happen as the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly convenes in the Presiding Officer's city, New York. \nOne of the leaders and a dear friend of mine and a dear friend of \nIsrael's told me these are tough times for Israel, some of the toughest \never. She took a deep breath, gathered her thoughts, and said, ``Until \nyour neighbors accept you, it will always be a tough time.''\n  Israel is accustomed to living in a tough neighborhood, but in recent \nmonths that has grown tougher. Confrontation with Israel is a new \ncenterpiece of Turkish foreign policy. Leaders in Egypt question \nEgypt's commitment to its peace treaty with Israel. Hezbollah has \nconsolidated its political hold on the Lebanese Government. Iran is \nprobably consistently the largest threat to peace in the Middle East as \nthey defiantly continue their unmistakable march to nuclear capability.\n  In the coming days, the next step in an escalation against Israel \nwill take place should the Palestinians seek recognition as a state \nfrom the United Nations. Instead of negotiating directly with Israel, \nas the Palestinians have often committed to do as far back as the Oslo \nagreement, they are about to seek to exclude Israel from any role in \ndeciding issues that are critical to achieving a permanent peace. That \nmust not occur. This action could set back the peace process for \ndecades to come. The Obama administration is assiduously attempting to \nstop this dangerous move.\n  Today, as it has done in the past, Congress must stand firm with \nIsrael. It must oppose any Palestinian action at the U.N. which would \ncircumvent its commitment to negotiate. Our support for Israel must be \nunited. We must speak with one voice--Democrat and Republican, House \nand Senate, Congress and the administration. The administration has \nsaid it will veto a Security Council resolution that would recognize a \nPalestinian state, and it must do that.\n  The U.N. rules for admission require that any applicant before the \nU.N. be ``peace loving'' and ``willing and able to carry out the \nobligations of the U.N. charter.'' The U.N. charter calls for ``faith \nin fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human \nperson.'' It calls on members to ``practice tolerance and live together \nin peace with one another as good neighbors.'' The PA is not there yet.\n  U.N. membership and statehood itself is not a gift. It is not a \nright. It is earned. There is a responsible path for the Palestinians. \nDirect negotiations with Israel are the only way to produce a \nPalestinian state and the only way to achieve a lasting peace, just as \ndirect negotiations produced peace between Israel and Egypt and Israel \nand Jordan.\n  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has called for direct talks to begin \nimmediately, as have President Obama and so many of our colleagues. Why \nshould the Palestinians be rewarded by the U.N. for refusing to \nnegotiate with Israel?\n  If the Palestinians have elected to pursue confrontation over \nnegotiation with Israel, we must rethink our efforts to support the \nPalestinians and the Palestinian Authority. Today, the Senate foreign \noperations subcommittee, of which I am a member, will be marking up the \ninternational affairs appropriations bill, which happens to be the same \nday the PA is considering making its plea at the United Nations. The \nbill is strong on holding the PA accountable should it attempt such a \nmisguided maneuver. We cannot reward unilateral acts. We cannot reward \nbad behavior borne of a clear rejection of the only proven path to \npeace.\n  Many of my colleagues and I understand that a great number of \nPalestinians want what we all want in this country--in New York and \nOhio and across our country--and what people want in Israel: a better \nlife for their children, a life of peace and prosperity between and \namong peoples.\n  I am confident the administration will veto any Security Council \nrecognition of a Palestinian state, but there are other options and \npossibilities before the U.N., such as seeking recognition from the \nGeneral Assembly as a nonmember state. While it is a different name and \ncomes by different procedures, it doesn't solve the Palestinians' \nfundamental problems of avoiding the tough negotiations and the \ninternal consensus-building that are essential for peacemaking to \nsucceed. That is why U.S. leadership is so important at this critical \ntime. That is why we must all speak with one voice and stand firm in an \nunbreakable bond\n\n[[Page S5798]]\n\nwith our ally Israel. Until we hold those who seek to destroy Israel \naccountable, it will always be a tough time for our closest ally.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there has been a lot of debate in the \npast week about the latest proposals coming out of the White House, \nabout whether the President's latest stimulus bill or the tax hikes he \nis proposing will help or hurt the economy. But based on what we are \nhearing from the White House this week, it is hard to see the point in \nhaving any debate at all.\n  I am referring, of course, to a comment by the White House \nCommunications Director who told the New York Times on Monday that the \nPresident had entered what he referred to as a new phase--a new phase. \nHe said the President may have worked with Republicans to avert a \ngovernment shutdown last spring and to raise the debt ceiling this \nsummer, but ``that phase is behind us.'' In other words, the White \nHouse isn't interested in actually accomplishing anything anymore. It \nis more interested in making a point than making a difference.\n  So here is my question: How do you explain to the 14 million \nAmericans looking for a job right now that you are more interested in \nmotivating campaign supporters than in motivating businesses to hire?\n  For the past week, the President has been running around the country \ntrying to set a record for the number of times he can say pass this \nbill ``right away'' in a 5-minute stump speech. Meanwhile, his \ncommunications director is telling people the President doesn't expect \nthe bill to pass. And the Democratic majority leader in the Senate is \ntreating it like a legislative afterthought. My friend the majority \nleader said yesterday he might take up this supposedly ``urgent'' bill \nnext month after he has had a chance to deal with a Chinese currency \nbill and a few others. As for the other Democrats in Congress, well, \nthey are not exactly rushing to get it in the queue either.\n  This so-called jobs bill seems to be about as popular as Solyndra, \nand I am just talking about among Democrats. Yet the President is out \nthere acting as though somebody is actually putting up a fight. So this \nwhole thing is a charade, and I think the American people deserve \nbetter. I think they deserve a President who realizes that governing \ninvolves working with a situation as it is, not as you would like it to \nbe. President Obama may think the best way to distract people from the \nchallenges we face is to stand near a bridge in a swing State and pit \none group of Americans against another and hope his critics look bad if \nthey don't go along with him, but I don't think he is fooling anybody. \nI don't think all the campaign stops in the world are going to convince \nmost Americans that the real cause of our problems lies anywhere other \nthan with the policies that are coming out of Washington these days or \nthat the single greatest obstacle to job creation in America today is \npolicies that punish the risk takers and the entrepreneurs and that \nstifle investment and private enterprise, rather than rewarding it.\n  When it comes right down to it, I think most Americans care more \nabout results than about rhetoric. Let's be honest. The results of this \nPresident's economic policies speak for themselves. After 2\\1/2\\ years \nof government spending, here is what we have: record deficits, chronic \nunemployment, median incomes going down, poverty rates going up, and \nthe first ever credit downgrade. This isn't exactly a record to be \nproud of. So I can understand the President wanting to change the \ntopic. It might make him feel better. It might energize his strongest \nsupporters. But here is something it won't do: It won't create jobs.\n  Look, if we can solve our jobs crisis and revive the economy by \npassing the hat at Warren Buffett's annual shareholders meeting, we \nwould have done it by now, but we can't. Why? Because that is not a \nreal solution. It is a campaign slogan.\n  The President said the other day the tax hikes he is proposing aren't \nclass warfare. He said they are math. Well, we can do math too, so \nlet's do the math. According to the IRS, if you doubled--doubled--the \ntax burden on everybody in America who earned more than $1 million in \n2009, you would cover the cost of about 3 months of deficit spending \naround here. If you doubled the tax burden on everybody in America who \nearned more than $1 million in 2009, you would cover the cost of about \n3 months of the deficit we are running around here. If you confiscated \nevery dime of taxable income from those the President refers to as \nmillionaires and billionaires--take it all--you wouldn't even cover a \nsingle year of deficit spending in Washington right now. Spending more \nmoney in Washington won't solve our spending problem, it will enable \nit.\n  How about the stimulus? One of the programs is the stimulus was \nsupposed to create 65,000 jobs. So far, it has created 3,500 at nearly \n$11 million per job--$11 million per job. Solyndra was supposed to \ncreate thousands of permanent jobs. Two years later, more than 1,000 \nSolyndra employees are out of work altogether, and the American \ntaxpayer is on the hook for more than $\\1/2\\ billion in loans to the \ncompany.\n  But here is the most important calculation: Not a single new job will \ncome about as a result of the tax hikes the President proposed this \nweek--not one new job. As the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness puts it:\n\n       New tax increases on America's biggest job creators are the \n     last thing this economy needs to get back on track.\n\n  What else do we need to know?\n  Republicans are ready to work with the President on turning this \neconomy around. We know what would work, and after the past 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, we have certainly seen what won't work. So my suggestion to the \nPresident is the same now as it has been for months. Put aside the \npolitical playbook and work with us on policies that will actually \nsolve the problems Americans care about the most. Let's work together \non policies that are aimed at motivating job creators, not your \npolitical base. It is time to change course.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a fundamental \nproblem of this body: the fact that Congress as an institution--and the \nSenate in particular--rarely engages in the process of authorizing \nprior to appropriating money for our government. As a result, a handful \nof senior appropriators and their unelected staffs dictate the spending \nof hundreds of billions of dollars, often in a manner that directly \ncontravenes the will of those committees that still authorize spending. \nIt is time this process be stopped.\n  The solution is simple. We should not authorize on appropriations \nbills, and any funding proposed for unauthorized projects should be \nsubject to the scrutiny and approval of the authorizing committees and \nreflect the will of their members.\n  We are all to blame for this problem. The fact is that routine \npassage of authorizing legislation simply doesn't occur as it should. \nFar too often, even routine passage of appropriations legislation has \ndevolved into passage of a\n\n[[Page S5799]]\n\nsingle omnibus bill. This also must stop.\n  A case in point is the appropriations bill to fund the Department of \nDefense that was reported out of the Appropriations Committee last \nweek. That legislation should reflect the will of the Defense \nauthorization bill but runs directly contrary to it in many areas. At a \ntime when we face a $14.7 trillion national debt that is mortgaging the \nfuture of our children and grandchildren, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee is proposing a Defense spending bill that uses a budget \ngimmick totaling over $10 billion to mislead the American people about \nthe savings the committee claims to achieve.\n  While the Department of Defense is struggling to find more than $400 \nbillion in cuts directed by the President, the Appropriations Committee \nis still conducting business as usual by rewarding special interests \nand funding pet projects that have little or nothing to do with our \nnational defense. In the bill reported out last week that purports to \ncut over $26 billion from the President's request by changes to 580 \ndifferent programs, somehow the Appropriations Committee still found \nmoney for over $2.3 billion in additional spending not requested by the \nDepartment of Defense and for items that are far from real defense \nrequirements.\n  I have here a list of the roughly 580 items changed by the \nAppropriations Committee which are differences from the bill adopted \nunanimously by the Senate Armed Services Committee in June in the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. This list is 45 pages long \nand represents $20 billion in changes.\n  For example, it is incredible to me the Appropriations Committee put \na priority on spending $33 million in operation and maintenance funds. \nThat money is used to maintain the readiness and combat capability of \nour troops. The $33 million is going to purchase schoolbuses, to build \na mental health substance abuse facility on Guam, and a repository for \ncultural artifacts. I am not making that up: $33 million for a \nrepository--oh, phase one of a repository for cultural artifacts, \nfunding for a mental health substance abuse facility, and the purchase \nof schoolbuses. All of this money, and $40 million more next year to \ncomplete these facilities, is, at least in theory, supposedly, to help \npromote Guam's cooperation as part of the plan to move 8,700 marines \nand 9,000 family members from their current bases on Okinawa to Guam.\n\n  I know the marines will enjoy being on Guam. I am not sure it is \nabsolutely necessary for them to have a repository for cultural \nartifacts. But the plan to move the marines, which will require \nspending between $18 billion and $23 billion on Guam to build up its \ncapabilities as a permanent base, is so much in doubt that both the \nArmed Services Committee and the Military Construction and Veterans' \nAffairs Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee have stopped \nfunding Guam military construction projects until the Department of \nDefense provides a master plan and considers alternatives that may \nprovide the needed marine forward presence at much less expense.\n  In fact, we simply cannot afford to carry out the plans as they were \noriginally envisioned. In the face of all the doubt about the scope and \ntiming of the eventual buildup, the Appropriations Committee put a \npremium on buying schoolbuses, an artifact repository, and a mental \nhealth clinic in Guam. That is not anybody's idea of defense priorities \nin the fiscal environment we face.\n  In some cases, the Appropriations Committee was well aware that the \nArmed Services Committee had, on a unanimous vote, reported out a bill \nthat denied funding for a program, but the appropriators funded the \nfull amount anyway. This is the case with the Army's Medium Extended \nAir Defense System, or MEADS. The Armed Services Committee cut the \nentire budget request of $406 million for this program because Army \nleaders have told the Senate they do not intend to ever buy or deploy \nthe system and because repeated technical reviews have determined that \nMEADS is behind schedule, over cost, and a high risk of technical \nfailure. The Appropriations Committee ignored the Armed Services \nCommittee's decision not to authorize further funding for MEADS and \ninstead appropriated the full amount of $406 million--even in the face \nof the fact of the need to cut defense spending by eliminating troubled \nprograms that are not effectively providing increased combat capability \nfor the troops.\n  Additionally, hundreds of millions of dollars in the fiscal year 2012 \nDefense appropriations bill have been allocated to things that were \nnever requested by the Pentagon, never authorized by the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, and which are simply not core defense priorities.\n  Example: There is $354 million added for medical research not \nrequested by the Pentagon, including $120 million for breast cancer \nresearch, $10 million for ovarian cancer research, $64 million for \nprostate cancer research, and $50 million for other medical research \nfor a laundry list of medical conditions. I am not questioning the \nmerits of medical research, but they do not have anything to do with \ndefending this Nation. They should be taken out of the appropriations \nof the Health and Human Services Subcommittee, not out of defense.\n  Again, I am not questioning the merits of medical research and the \nimportant role the Federal Government can play. I am saying it is time \nfor it to stop being taken out of national defense.\n  The Appropriations Committee adds even more unrequested funding for \nprograms such as $60 million for environmental conservation for ranges; \n$106 million for alternate energy research, whatever that means; $45 \nmillion for high-performance computing modernization--all of these, and \na long list of them, may be good programs; they are not authorized; and \nthe job of the Senate Armed Services Committee is to scrutinize these \nprograms and select those that are in most need of funding--$5 million \nfor the National Guard Youth Challenge Program; $4.5 million for the \nCivil Air Patrol.\n  Programs have some merit, but we have to look at these with an eye to \nthe fact that we have been tasked to cut $400 billion that the \nPresident has already ordered the Pentagon to undertake.\n  Despite the Appropriations Committee's desire to find $26 billion in \ndefense savings, they found money to add $240 million in unrequested \nfunding--the Pentagon and the President did not ask for them--for a \nnumber of congressional special interest areas, such as advanced \nmaterials research, $10 million; Industrial Base Innovation Fund--\nwhatever that is--$30 million; Defense Rapid Innovation Fund, $200 \nmillion.\n  In the procurement account, the Appropriations Committee added $675 \nmillion for items that were not requested by the Pentagon or authorized \nby the Armed Services Committee, including $120 million for advance \nprocurement of 12 Air Force C-130Js, $47.4 million for improved radars \nfor Air National Guard F-15s, $140 million for program increases to \nclassified programs--the list goes on and on.\n  Although the appropriators were looking for $26 billion in savings, \nthey chose not to follow the Armed Services Committee in making cuts to \nsome programs even when the justification for taking savings was clear. \nThese examples include $150 million for the Army Guided Multiple Launch \nRocket System; $495 million for Navy F/A-18E/F Hornets, which the Armed \nServices Committee pointed out were funded in the full-year Defense \nappropriations bill for the year 2011; $205 million for the Fleet \nSatellite Communications follow-on program, for which the Government \nAccountability Office and the Armed Services Committee noted that the \nfunding for the requested booster was too early.\n  In order to give the appearance of real savings to the taxpayer, the \nAppropriations Committee, again, incredibly, shifted over $10 billion \nin funding from the nonwar base defense funding budget to the ``off-\nbudget/emergency spending.'' For the benefit of the record, the \nOverseas Contingency Operations Fund does not count as part of the \nbudget, but it is for overseas contingencies, i.e., the wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  So what did the Appropriations Committee do? They took money that is \nsupposed to be for the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, and they \ntransferred over $3.2 billion to the account for\n\n[[Page S5800]]\n\noverseas contingency operations, $550 million for predator drones, $228 \nmillion for counterfire radars, $192 million for Fire Scout unmanned \naerial systems, $784 million for unmanned aerial systems.\n  In the operations and maintenance accounts, the Appropriations \nCommittee transferred over $6.2 billion for items that were requested \nin the base budget to the ``off-budget'' overseas contingency \noperations funding, including $3 billion for Army depot maintenance, \n$495 million for Navy depot maintenance--it goes on and on.\n  In the miliary personnel accounts, another $529 million was \ntransferred from the defense budget, where it was requested, to the \noverseas contingency operations budget so it would count as ``defense \nsavings.''\n  This is pure budget gimmickry. It is about time we got serious about \ncutting spending. Using budget gimmicks to shift over $10 billion from \nthe base defense budget to the emergency account we have set aside for \nsupport of overseas contingency operations is not saving the taxpayers \na dime. Cutting $10 billion from the President's request for the wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan, shifting over $10 billion in nonwar expenses, \nand then claiming in a press release--they had the gall in a press \nrelease--that the President's request for the warfighting accounts is \nfully supported is not only a gimmick, it is dishonest with the \nAmerican people. It is a disservice to the men and women of the \nmilitary who depend on that funding for critical warfighting equipment \nand support.\n  I have talked to many of our senior commanders in Iraq and members of \nthe Iraqi Government during repeated trips to Iraq this year. All of \nthem have recommended that the United States maintain at least 10,000 \nsoldiers beyond December 31, 2011. There is no money in the warfighting \naccounts for, if we have, additional troops. So because of the \nadministration's delay in any decision for any additional troops, \nunderstandably, that is not funded in these bills, which is required, \nobviously, by October 1, the end of the fiscal year.\n  What will also put our troops, our national security, and our Nation \nat grave risk is the specter of even more drastic defense cuts should \nthe recommendations of the joint select committee fail to gather enough \ncongressional support.\n\n  Secretary of Defense Panetta warned last week that the failure of \nlawmakers to agree on debt ceiling talks, which would trigger up to \n$600 billion in additional Pentagon budget cuts, could add 1 percentage \npoint to the Nation's jobless rate. He also called the impact of cuts \nof that magnitude ``devastating'' to our Armed Forces.\n  The citizens of my State--and nearly every other State in the \nNation--have been struggling through record unemployment rates and \nunprecedented fiscal pressures. Now, more than ever, they need strong \nleadership to make tough decisions to restore fiscal discipline and \nresponsibility in Federal spending. I am committed to using every power \navailable to me to ensure the Defense bill for 2012 provides spending \nfor only the most critical national security requirements, as proposed \nby the President and defense leadership. In this regard, the Defense \nappropriations bill that has been reported from the Appropriations \nCommittee is sadly lacking.\n  There is plenty of blame to go around. I do not fault just the \nappropriators. We have all failed to do our jobs. The answer to this \nproblem is to fix it. We must stop authorizing on appropriations \nlegislation without the agreement of the authorizing committee. The \nappropriations bills should reflect the will of the authorizing \ncommittees. I intend to work with my colleagues to remedy this problem \nso the will and wisdom of all Senators--not just a select few--is \nrepresented when we pass appropriations legislation.\n  A solution to this problem is long overdue, and I intend to fight to \nsee that it is solved.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment would authorize the \ncontinuation of trade adjustment assistance or TAA for 2 additional \nyears at the level of funding the program maintained prior to the 2009 \nstimulus package addition. Prior to the stimulus, passed by this body \nin 2009, the TAA Program cost taxpayers about $1 billion per year.\n  The passage of the stimulus package, which was advertised to be a \ntemporary injection into the economy--a temporary injection--the \nstimulus was increased and expanded to the program at a cost of about \n$2 billion in 2010; according to the Department of Labor estimates, \n$2.4 billion in 2011, if the stimulus expansions were allowed to remain \nin place.\n  I would remind my colleagues that with the stimulus package, these \nwere a one-time deal, and once the money was spent, then those programs \nlapsed. Apparently not so with the TAA Program. We do not yet have a \ncost score for the Reid substitute before us, but estimates indicate \nthe TAA agreement may lock in at least 65 percent of the 2009 stimulus \nexpansions for the next several years.\n\n[[Page S5801]]\n\n  That is approximately, in my calculation, at least a $600 million \nadditional cost per year to the taxpayers for maintaining 65 percent of \nthe stimulus level of TAA. Architects of the agreement will say these \nprovisions sunset at the end of 2014. But we all know sunsets can be \nfiction. So we are talking about 2012, 2013, and 2014. That is about, \nroughly, a minimum of $1.2 billion of additional spending on the \ndubious--at least in my mind dubious--benefits of the TAA Program.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle have long insisted that the \nprice of passing trade agreements in Congress is passing TAA and other \nprograms similar to it, domestic spending legislation geared to assist \nU.S. workers who have been adversely affected by foreign trade.\n  For this reason, in 2002, Congress passed the TAA legislation that \nprovided short-term temporary support for worker retraining and other \nassistance. Many Republicans, including myself, were skeptical about \nwhether this program and others like it achieved their goals. But we \nwent along for the sake of our national interests and expanding free \ntrade.\n  In 2009, without any action taken on our three pending trade \nagreements, the stimulus package dramatically increased the TAA Program \nas part of the stimulus bill and increased spending on this program \nannually by approximately $1 billion. In essence, a program that was \ndesigned to assist workers who had been adversely affected by free \ntrade was transformed into a domestic spending program for reasons that \nhad nothing at all to do with expanding free trade.\n  What is worse, after repeatedly claiming it supports the free-trade \nagreements with Colombia, Panama, and Korea, the White House earlier \nthis year announced that the cost of its support was reauthorization of \nthe new TAA with funding set not at the original 2002 level but the \n2009 stimulus level.\n  So we had a program that had been expanded from its original cost \nunder the dubious guise of a temporary economic stimulus, and then we \nwere told this temporary funding increase, which was designed to expire \nalong with the stimulus, should, in effect, be turned into a permanent \ndomestic spending program.\n  After much discussion and debate, there now appears to be a proposal \nto reauthorize TAA and fund it somewhere between the prestimulus and \npoststimulus levels. This proposal is contained in the substitute \namendment offered by the majority leader. Some would say this is a good \ndeal and Republicans should accept it. Others say trade adjustment \nassistance is ineffective and unproven and Congress should kill it \naltogether.\n  I am very dubious about the benefits of TAA. But I understand also \nwhat is doable around here and what is not. So I am offering this \namendment as a matter of principle. As I have said many times on the \nfloor of this body, I am not opposed to TAA nor do I seek to kill it. I \nread the same media reports as my colleagues, which suggest that the \nWhite House is holding hostage the trade agreements with South Korea, \nColombia, and Panama until Congress passes TAA.\n  Many of us do not like this. Many of us think this is contrary to our \nnational and economic interests. But it is a fact. So I recognize, as \nin the past, that Congress should reauthorize TAA. The question is, How \nmuch of the taxpayers' money should we spend to do it?\n  That is why I am offering this amendment. I believe Congress should \nreauthorize it because we are being compelled to do so, but I also \nbelieve we should reauthorize this program at its prestimulus funding \nlevels.\n  Let me explain why. The following are the temporary expansions to TAA \nthat were included in the stimulus, which cost about $2 billion in \n2010, and, according to the Department of Labor, was estimated to cost \napproximately $2.4 billion in 2011 if the 2009 stimulus expansions had \nstayed in place.\n  The stimulus expanded TAA to cover workers whose employers shifted \nproduction to any foreign country, not just those--as under prior law--\nwhose jobs were outsourced to countries with which the United States \nhas a free-trade agreement.\n  It expanded TAA coverage to the service sector and government \nemployees who lose their jobs because of trade.\n  It increased the tax credit available to cover private health \ninsurance premiums from 65 percent to 80. It increased the \nappropriations cap for training from $220 million to $575 million, a \n160-percent increase over the previous cap.\n  It created the Community TAA Program, which authorizes $230 million \nfor trade-affected communities to assist in strategic planning grants \nup to $5 million, sector partnership grants up to $3 million over a 3-\nyear period, and community college and career training grants up to $1 \nmillion.\n  It gave $17.5 million to States for employment and case management. \nIt lengthened the amount of time workers could receive trade \nreadjustment allowance assistance by 26 weeks.\n  Finally, it revived the TAA for farmers and the wage insurance \nprogram, estimated by CBO to total about $100 million for 2 years.\n  So we had a program that had been expanded from its original intent, \nwith benefits going to government employees, service sector employees, \nTAA benefits going to communities, TAA benefits going to farms, TAA \nbenefits going to firms, under the dubious guise of a temporary \neconomic stimulus.\n  This is what the White House and the other side in Congress were \ntelling us had to be reauthorized in order to pass the free-trade \nagreements. My amendment also addresses the claim made by some that the \nagreement in the majority leader's substitute amendment not only \nreduces TAA from stimulus levels but also much lower in several years.\n  However, according to a recent Heritage Foundation analysis, this may \nnot be accurate. This is important, so let me read this analysis at \nlength. This is from the Heritage Foundation report:\n\n       Instead of cutting TAA back to pre-stimulus levels, the \n     proposal restores and solidifies the most alarming aspects of \n     the stimulus expansion at a yet unknown cost.\n       It keeps the 2009 stimulus expansion for service sector \n     workers. TAA was originally intended to provide income \n     maintenance and job training to workers from the \n     manufacturing sector. The stimulus bill expanded eligibility \n     to include workers from the service and public sectors. This \n     expansion expired in February, but the proposal restores TAA \n     eligibility for service sector workers.\n       It restores stimulus expansion of benefits for job losses \n     unrelated to FTAs. The proposal retains the stimulus \n     expansion of providing TAA benefits to any workers who lost \n     their jobs to overseas production, not just TAA-certified \n     jobs that were lost to FTAs.\n       It reinstates the stimulus's 161 percent increase in TAA \n     for workers' job training spending. The proposal cements the \n     stimulus spending expansion of TAA for workers' job training \n     at $575 million per year from $220 million--an increase of \n     $355 million per year.\n       It continues the stimulus's creation of a new and \n     duplicative job training program.\n       The proposal keeps the TAA Community College and Career \n     Training Program, which has appropriations authorizations of \n     $500 billion per year from fiscal years 2011 through 2014. \n     This new job-training program is just one of the 47 \n     employment and training programs operated across nine \n     agencies by the federal government.\n\n  Let me repeat that. This is another proposal that spends $500 million \nfor job training, even though we already have 47 employment and \ntraining programs operated across 9 agencies by the Federal Government.\n\n       It partially reinstates the stimulus increase in Health \n     Coverage Tax Credit. . . .\n       It solidifies the wage subsidies for older workers as a \n     permanent program. The pre-stimulus Alternative TAA was a \n     temporary five-year demonstration program that paid 50 \n     percent of the difference between new and old wages of \n     displaced older workers. It subsidized the wages of older \n     workers earning less than $50,000 per year for up to $10,000 \n     over two years. After changing the program's name to \n     Reemployment TAA, the stimulus expansion increased the wage \n     subsidy to $12,000 over two years for displaced older workers \n     earning less than $55,000 and made the program permanent. \n     While the proposal reduces the wage subsidies to pre-stimulus \n     levels, it also cements into law the permanency of the wage \n     subsidy program.\n       It retains the stimulus expansion of the union VEBA \n     handout. Despite having nothing to do with international \n     trade, the stimulus expansion of TAA extended the HCTC to \n     Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Associations (VEBA). A \n     bankruptcy court can allocate a portion of an out-of-business \n     employer's assets to a VEBA, which assumes responsibly for \n     retirees' health coverage. This expansion primarily benefits \n     unions. Under the proposal, the federal government would \n     cover 72.5 percent of the cost of retiree health benefits at \n     bankrupt companies. This coverage occurs regardless of \n     whether the bankruptcies are related to free trade.\n\n\n[[Page S5802]]\n\n\n  Let's look at an example of excess created in the ``temporary'' \nstimulus expansion of the TAA Program that taxpayers are still on the \nhook for. According to a February 2011 study by Senator Coburn, \nentitled ``Help Wanted: How Federal Job Training Programs are Failing \nWorkers'':\n\n       Taxpayers may have a case of indigestion when they learn, \n     nearly two years after the stimulus was enacted, their money \n     is paying lobstermen, shrimpers and blueberry farmers $12,000 \n     each to attend job training sessions on jobs they are already \n     trained to do.\n       The stimulus reauthorized the Trade Adjustment Assistance \n     for Farmers program administered by the USDA, a program that \n     provides subsidies to producers of raw agricultural \n     commodities and fishermen so they can adjust to import \n     competition. Under the stimulus, TAA benefits were enhanced \n     to focus more on employment re-training.\n\n  While the Reid substitute includes a compromise to ``pare back'' some \nof the expansions in the ``temporary'' stimulus spending legislation of \n2009, it still expands TAA benefits and eligibility beyond the \nprestimulus levels--by approximately, by my calculations, at least $600 \nmillion a year.\n  I acknowledge that expanding trade temporarily puts some of our \nworkers at a disadvantage. I remember being roundly criticized during \nthe 2008 Presidential campaign when I had the audacity to tell Michigan \nworkers the truth--that many of the jobs that had left their State for \ncheaper labor markets overseas were never coming back. So I understand \nthat trade can create difficulties for some American workers. I am not \nopposed, in principle, to supporting those workers temporarily so they \ncan develop new skills and find new jobs. That said, let's look closer \nat how the Federal Government has been going about programs such as \nthis.\n  Earlier this year, the GAO released a study entitled ``Multiple \nTraining and Employment Programs: Providing Information on Collocating \nServices and Consolidating Administrative Structures Could Promote \nEfficiencies.'' Here is what the GAO reported on Federal employment and \nretraining programs, including the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program:\n\n       Based on our survey of agency officials, we determined that \n     only 5 of the 47 programs have had impact studies that assess \n     whether the program is responsible for improved employment \n     outcomes. The five impact studies generally found that the \n     effects of participation were not consistent across programs, \n     with only some demonstrating positive impacts that tended to \n     be small, inconclusive, or restricted to short-term impacts.\n\n  So not only are many of these worker employment and training programs \nduplicative, the GAO has found very little empirical evidence to \nsupport whether these programs are even accomplishing their intended \ngoals--and what empirical evidence they have they found is, I repeat, \n`` . . . small inconclusive, or restricted to short term impacts.'' TAA \nis among these programs.\n  This is bad enough, but what is worse, we have not even been told how \nmuch this expansion of TAA will cost the taxpayers. We are told the \nlegislation includes ``offsets,'' but we know they are not real. \nOffsets allegedly include: rates for merchandise processing fees, \nchanges to the ``time for remitting certain merchandise processing \nfees,'' unemployment compensation program integrity provisions to \ncreate a ``mandatory penalty assessment on fraud claims, prohibition on \nnon-charging due to employer fault, reporting of rehired employees to \nthe directory of new hires.'' That is supposed to come up with hundreds \nof millions of dollars.\n  I cannot say what most of these mean, but I can say they are not \nreal.\n  Even while extending the TAA prestimulus program, we need to analyze \nwhether the TAA Program is doing what it was intended to do. The \nfollowing are some of the questions and concerns we must consider:\n  Does the TAA Program provide overly generous benefits to a narrow \npopulation?\n  According to analysis from the Heritage Foundation, based on \nstatistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in the third quarter of \nfiscal year 2009, only 1 percent of mass layoffs were a result of \nimport competition of overseas relocation.\n  Is there evidence that TAA benefits and training help increase \nparticipants' earnings?\n  An analysis by Professor Kara M. Reynolds of American University \nfound ``little evidence that it (TAA) helps displaced workers find new, \nwell-paying employment opportunities.'' In fact, TAA participants \nexperienced a wage loss of 10 percent.\n\n  The same study found that in fiscal year 2007, the Federal Government \nappropriated $855.1 million to TAA Programs. Of this amount, funding \nfor training programs accounted for only 25 percent.\n  In 2007, the Office of Management and Budget rated the TAA Program as \n``ineffective.'' The OMB found that the TAA Program failed to use tax \ndollars effectively because, among other reasons, the program has \nfailed to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of achieving its goals.\n  Let me close by reminding my colleagues how we got to our current \npredicament. It is mid-September of 2011, 2\\1/2\\ years since President \nObama took office, and we still have not received these important trade \nagreements that were finalized half a decade ago--all because of the \nWhite House's insistence on making a ``temporary'' stimulus program--\nthe dubious extension of TAA--into a permanent domestic spending \nprogram.\n  This is how George Will summed it up, writing in the Washington Post \non June 8, 2011. The piece is as appropriate now as it was then:\n\n       President Obama is sacrificing economic growth and job \n     creation in order to placate organized labor. And as the \n     crisis of the welfare state deepens, he is trying to enlarge \n     the entitlement system and exacerbate the entitlement \n     mentality. . . .\n       On May 4, the administration announced that, at last, it \n     was ready to proceed with congressional ratification of the \n     agreements. On May 16, however, it announced they would not \n     send them until Congress expands an entitlement program \n     favored by unions.\n       Since 1974, Trade Adjustment Assistance has provided 104, \n     and then 156, weeks of myriad financial aid, partly \n     concurrent with the 99 weeks of unemployment compensation to \n     people, including farmers and government workers, and firms, \n     even whole communities, that can more or less plausibly claim \n     to have lost their jobs or been otherwise injured because of \n     foreign competition. Even if the injury is just the loss of \n     unfair advantages conferred, at the expense of other \n     Americans, by government protectionism.\n\n  This process should be appalling to the average American who is \nlooking for an improving economy, not special favors to certain special \ninterest groups.\n  At a time when our national debt has reached unsustainable levels, at \na time when Congress and the American people face some truly painful \nchoices about how to cut our Federal budget, at a time when some are \neven considering enormous and dangerous cuts to our defense spending as \na way to get our fiscal house in order, this is no time to throw more \nmoney than we did before the stimulus at a Federal program that, as the \nGAO points out, is duplicative and possibly ineffective.\n  I am prepared to reluctantly support TAA if it were funded at the \nprestimulus level, as a recognition of reality that some form of this \nprogram is required in order to pass our existing trade agreements. But \nwe should authorize it at prestimulus levels and not one dollar more. \nThat is what this amendment would do. I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I wish to address some of the points \nraised by our colleague from Arizona--just a couple areas; one is the \nquestion of the impact of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, \nwhich has been enhanced by way of the Recovery Act of 2009. I will talk \nabout some of the reforms as well and maybe address some of the cost \nquestions.\n  First, with regard to trade adjustment assistance prior to the 2009 \nperiod versus the period after that, I wish to submit for the Record--\nand then I will walk through some of this--this document entitled \n``Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance\n\n[[Page S5803]]\n\nAct (TGAAA) Worker Certification 5/18/2009-6/27/2011.'' This is a \nDepartment of Labor document.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE ACT (TGAAA) WORKER CERTIFICATIONS

41.54\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Let me go through, by way of summary, what this depicts. \nFirst of all, it is a document that has three columns; first is the \n``Estimated Total Workers Certified Under New Provisions,'' meaning the \nchanges made to TAA as a result of the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act of 2009; the second column is the ``Estimated Total \nWorkers Certified . . .''--meaning certified under TAA--`` . . . Under \nAll Provisions of TAA''; finally is the ``Estimated Percent of Workers \nCertified Under New Provisions'' as a result of the changes made. And \nwhat it shows is, if you look across the country, the estimated total \nworkers certified under all provisions is 447,235 people. Of that, the \nincrease--in essence because of the 2009 changes--is 185,783. And if \nyou look at the percentage, that is a 41-percent increase.\n\n  So the basic point here--after a long explanation--is very simple. \nBecause of the changes made in 2009, we were able to help--the U.S. \nGovernment, by way of TAA--41 percent more individuals. That is \nrelevant because it was helping folks to be retrained, helping them to \nget the skills they needed for a new career, a new job, at the time \nthey needed it--during the worst economic catastrophe in 100 years, \nother than the Great Depression. So if there were ever a time when we \nneeded to make sure that TAA worked--and it has worked--and, also, if \nthere were ever a time when we wanted to make sure that TAA was \nstrengthened and enhanced, it was during the last couple of years. That \nis the point, that the 2009 changes were made because we were in the \nthroes, the teeth, the grip of the worst economic downturn in 100 \nyears, other than in the 1930s.\n  Let me highlight a couple of States. For example, in my home State of \nPennsylvania, what all this means, if you look at the total number of \nworkers helped in this time period--again, talking about roughly the 2 \nyears between May of 2009 to June of 2011 in Pennsylvania--there were \n27,401 people helped. Workers helped, I should say. Of that, about 36 \npercent were helped solely because of the Recovery Act changes.\n  I know a good bit about the workers in our State. They needed that \nhelp. They needed the help that was provided as a result of the \nRecovery Act. So we have good evidence a lot of folks were helped, \ncertified, and then enrolled in programs to give them the skills they \nneeded.\n  The Presiding Officer is from the State of New York, and she knows \nhow difficult this recession has been on workers in New York. The total \nnumber of workers certified in New York in that 2-year time period was \n18,795. But half of that number, a little more than 50 percent, were \nhelped as a result of the 2009 changes that were made.\n  I say that to highlight and emphasize that the 2009 changes allowed \nmore workers to be retrained, to get the skills they needed to go back \nto work. I think that is what we are all about here. Democrats and \nRepublicans all say they want workers to get back into the workforce. \nThis is one of the ways we do it. It is very practical. In order to get \nfrom here to there--from unemployment to employment, and in a lot of \ncases to a new job or a new career--you need to be trained. That is \nwhat TAA does.\n  I will highlight two or three more States. Chairman Baucus, from the \ngreat State of Montana, his State was helped as well. Their increase, \nbased upon the 2009 changes, was close to 50\n\n[[Page S5804]]\n\npercent. So almost 50 percent more workers in the State of Montana were \nhelped as well to get the skills they needed.\n  Let me mention as well my colleague Senator Brown who has worked so \nhard on this. There were 7,706 more workers in the State of Ohio who \nwere certified to get the skills and training they needed because of \nthese changes.\n  And, finally, I will mention as well our colleague from Arizona. If \nwe look at the total number of Arizona workers certified, there were \n8,540 workers certified in total, but of that 8,540, the increase was \nsome 4,969. So in Arizona, the increase of workers who were helped or \ncertified for new training, there was a 58.16-percent increase. So the \nincrease in Arizona was even higher, and in some States it was even \nhigher than that.\n  The point here is that 2009 changes weren't just a couple of changes \nmade to enhance the program or expand it for the sake of expanding a \nprogram. I think the evidence shows we have certified more workers. \nThese workers have to go through a process to be certified in order for \nus to provide help by way of the Federal Government and other partners \nwho are helping us retrain workers. I think the evidence is pretty \nclear that has been a very positive change, giving more workers the \nskills they needed to compete.\n  Let me say as well about our colleague from Arizona that I appreciate \nwhat he said about TAA, and that he supports it. We may have a \ndisagreement about how to get there. He apparently doesn't want the \n2009 changes to be made part of any effort going forward, but I \nappreciate the fact he has expressed support for TAA. I also appreciate \nthe fact that when Senator Baucus, Senator Brown, I, and others in the \nlatter days of 2010 were trying to get an expansion of TAA, Senator \nMcCain worked with us to try to negotiate something. He was very \nwilling to talk and to work and to come together, and I appreciate \nthat, because we need that bipartisanship, we need that collegiality to \nmove this forward. So even though we have a disagreement about the \nchanges made, I appreciate his willingness to work with us back in \nDecember and to continue to work with us.\n  Let me make one or two more points. One basic point about reform. \nFolks will criticize programs and say programs aren't sometimes going \nthrough the kind of changes we hoped for in reforming them. But we \nshould note for the record that in 2008, the GAO released a study which \nhighlighted a number of issues with trade adjustment assistance. They \nset forth findings. That is why GAO is important. We shouldn't allow \nprograms to go on for years without some sort of reporting, \naccountability, performance measures, or whatever you wish to call it.\n  GAO pointed out problems they believed could be the subject of reform \nfor TAA, and those recommendations were the foundation for some of the \nchanges in the 2009 Recovery Act we are debating here on the floor, and \nwe are debating as a result of Senator McCain's amendment. Here is what \nthey are. I will highlight them quickly. Here is what we are talking \nabout.\n  The amendment we are considering, or the effort we are working on to \nexpand TAA, does a number of things we should highlight. In addition to \nmaking more workers eligible for training, it does a couple of things. \nFirst of all, it consolidates administration--that is important to \nhighlight--it consolidates case management, and it consolidates job \nsearch and relocation funding under the new dollars for job training. \nThe amendment also eliminates separate funding streams that were in \nplace before, but it also allows States the flexibility to use a \nportion of the training funds for administration and for case \nmanagement costs. States must prioritize these funds for training and \ncase management, but administrative costs are capped at 10 percent of \nthe funds and States can also use these funds to pay for 90 percent of \nthe cost of job search and relocation up to $1,250.\n  Finally, the amendment includes 30 new performance metrics and \naccountability measures across all TAA programs.\n  So what is the point? The point is very simple. We had a GAO study in \n2008 that recommended changes to TAA. We had a Recovery Act introduced \nand enacted for a variety of reasons, some of which spoke directly to \nTAA in 2009. The reforms from the GAO study were incorporated in the \n2009 changes. So if we stay with the original non-2009 provisions, we \nwon't have these reforms built in. GAO had pointed out some issues we \nshould address, they were addressed in 2009, and that is another good \nreason why we should support the amendment that would include those \n2009 changes.\n  Finally, on the question of costs or offsets, the 10-year cost for \nTAA is now $962 million over 10 years. That is cut way back. In fact, \nit has been cut by as much as half. We will talk about them more in the \nrecord, but there are three offsets. The first, so-called ``merchandise \nprocessing fee,'' raises $1.77 billion; the second, on unemployment \ninsurance, accounts for $320 million; and then finally, the Medicare \nquality improvement organizations raises another $330 million. So there \nare offsets--three in number--and the total cost is now $962 million \nover 10 years. I think it is a reasonable price to pay for the \nsubstantial training and retraining that TAA provides for our workers \nwho are living the horrific nightmare of job loss and the destruction \nof their careers, and, frankly, in many cases, the destruction of their \nfamily.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all time in \na quorum call be divided equally.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 641\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise in support of my amendment No. \n641. As I explained yesterday, this amendment really is about \nfundamental fairness.\n  The President wants TAA and has held hostage three free-trade \nagreements to get it. Well, most of us want these free-trade agreements \nand think it is wrong for TAA to move forward while the FTAs languish. \nMy amendment will ensure that all four legislative ships arrive in port \nat the same time.\n  It is time for the entire trade agenda to move forward. In August, as \nhe toured the Midwest, the President repeatedly called upon Congress to \ntake the agreements up ``right now'' to help create jobs. This hollow \ncall for action typifies the President's approach to the trade agenda. \nBy calling upon Congress to act, he appears to be embracing the \nagreements and pushing for their quick approval. But, like so many of \nthe President's trade initiatives, his words do not match his deeds.\n  In reality, Congress cannot take up these agreements ``right now.'' \nPresident Obama is relying upon a trade law called trade promotion \nauthority to protect each of these agreements from being blocked or \namended by Congress. In order to take advantage of this statutory \nauthority, it is not Congress but the President who must take the first \nstep and submit each agreement for consideration. If the President does \nnot submit these agreements, Congress cannot act under the trade \npromotion authority. The President and his team know this. In fact, \nhere is a chart which outlines the TPA process, called ``How a Trade \nAgreement Moves Through Congress Under Trade Promotion Authority.'' \nThis was taken directly from the Web site of the Office of the U.S. \nTrade Representative. It clearly shows that Congress cannot act\n\n[[Page S5805]]\n\nuntil the President submits the agreements.\n  But why take responsibility for moving the agreements when it is much \neasier to blame their continued delay on Congress? The fact is, the \nPresident wants all the benefits of trade promotion authority but none \nof the responsibility.\n  Once they were called out on the mismatch between their words and \ntheir deeds, the administration finally reined in their rhetoric but \nprovided little guidance as to what their actual plans are. In the \nmeantime, Republicans continued to push for consideration of the three \npending FTAs. Back in July, a group of Republican Senators signed a \nletter vowing to help the administration achieve its objective of \ngaining approval of trade adjustment assistance in exchange for \nsubmitting the FTAs. Now, despite a clear path forward, the President \nremains silent to this day.\n  As the President continues to delay, our country cedes each of these \nthree free-trade agreement markets to our foreign competitors, and they \nare taking them over because we are dilly-dallying here instead of \ndoing what is right.\n  Our economy and our workers are suffering under horrific levels of \nunemployment. Almost 1 in 10 American workers are out of a job under \nthis administration, and we can't afford to throw away any opportunity \nto create jobs. Yet this is precisely what the President is doing. The \nPresident himself has said these three trade agreements, once put into \nlaw, will amount to 250,000 new jobs, and that is not something to \nsniff at.\n  While our economy remains troubled and while the rest of the world \nwatches in bewilderment as the United States lets other countries take \nover our export markets, we hear nothing but silence from the \nPresident. A case in point: The European Union's exports to South Korea \nincreased almost 45 percent in the first 20 days since that agreement \nwent into force on July 1. Their share of Korea's import market \nincreased from 9.5 percent to 10.3 percent in just 3 weeks. Meanwhile, \nthe U.S. share of Korea's import market dropped from 10.5 percent to \n8.4 percent. Unless we act quickly, these trends are likely to \ncontinue.\n  In an open letter to the President and Congress, over 120 food groups \nand companies wrote:\n\n       If there is any doubt about the seriousness of the problem \n     for U.S. agricultural exports, one need only consider the \n     damage that has already been done by the delay in \n     implementing the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. Argentina and \n     Brazil have negotiated trade agreements with Colombia that \n     have given them preferential access. As a result, U.S.-\n     produced corn, wheat, and soybeans have been hit hard, with \n     the combined share of Colombia's imports for these products \n     falling to 28 percent from 78 percent since 2008.\n\n  That is a big drop, mainly because of the dillydallying on this trade \nagreement.\n  On August 15, 2011, an agreement between Canada and Colombia entered \ninto force, which will only make the problem worse for U.S. exporters \nand our farmers. The fact is that each of these agreements is \ncritically important to our economy. For my home State of Utah and for \nworkers across the country, they mean more opportunity and jobs. It is \na slam dunk for the President to create jobs by getting these \nagreements up here and getting them passed.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers estimates that U.S. workers \nlose $8 million in wages and benefits every day these agreements are \ndelayed. I for one stand ready to continue to fight for their \nconsideration and approval. We have come a long way this year, but we \nare not yet done.\n  I hope the President will heed my call and submit these agreements to \nCongress so we can approve them, but history has shown this President \nwill not act unless he is forced to. This amendment I am offering will \ncontinue to put pressure on him to act, and act soon, and I encourage \nmy colleagues to support it. The time for dithering and deliberation is \nover. Let's adopt my amendment and ensure that our work in moving TAA \nforward leads to the promised result--submission of three pending free-\ntrade agreements by the President and their quick enactment into law.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, it is my understanding there will be two \nvotes at approximately 12:30. One is on the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Utah, Senator Hatch, and another by the Senator from \nArizona, Senator McCain. I wish to explain, in a few minutes, why I \nthink it is advisable for the Senate to not adopt either of those two \namendments. Let me first address the amendment offered by my good \nfriend from Utah, Senator Hatch.\n  There are a lot of people looking for work. Today, about 14 million \nAmericans are looking for work. More than 6 million have been out of \nwork for at least 6 months. These Americans are looking to put in a \ngood day's work and looking to provide for their families. At the same \ntime, many employers cannot find enough skilled workers to fill the \njobs that are open. It is very difficult, because employers need people \nwith specialized skills. This is becoming more and more true with each \npassing year. We need workers who are good at math. We need workers who \nare good with their hands, who are trained in high-tech manufacturing. \nThe bottom line is, employers need an educated and skilled \nworkforce. Trade adjustment assistance can help bridge this gap. Trade \nadjustment assistance can train workers and connect them with employers \nwho are looking to grow their businesses.\n\n  Let me mention a fellow who has been a big beneficiary who has been \nhelped by this program. His name is Kris Allen. Kris lost his job at \nMontana Tunnels in Jefferson City, MT, in 2009. Because of trade \nadjustment assistance, he was able to go to school at Helena College of \nTechnology. He wanted to be a diesel mechanic. He made the dean's list \nmost of the semesters. In May of 2011 he graduated. In fact, he got his \ndegree on a Friday and started work the very next Monday. His new job \nat a trade company in Belgrade earns him $18 an hour. Kris has not \nstopped there. He continues to hone his skills at Montana Resources \nkeeping up to date on the latest technology and machinery.\n  In this fast-paced globalized economy, human capital is the key to \nour country's competitiveness and economic vitality. Americans such as \nKris know the benefits of a good day's work, and he could not have done \nthis without trade adjustment assistance. That is why I must oppose the \nHatch amendment. The amendment would withhold trade adjustment \nassistance benefits to this bill until a free-trade agreement with \nSouth Korea and Colombia and Panama is approved. It would delay \nAmericans such as Kris from getting the help they need to find good-\npaying jobs, and the amendment would delay businesses such as New \nHolland Trade Company from hiring employees and growing their company.\n  The Senate is here this week to consider the GSP trade adjustment \nassistance bill. It is my hope the Senate will pass it in short order \nand will send the bill to the House, which is expected to pass it \nshortly.\n  We have an agreement, and that is an agreement between the leadership \nof both the House and Senate, an agreement on how the Congress will \nconsider trade adjustment assistance and also how to consider free-\ntrade agreements. There is no need to legislate this process. In fact, \ndoing so could substantially delay the process and disrupt \ndisagreements, not just disrupt trade adjustment assistance but disrupt \npassage of free-trade agreements.\n  I might add that there is a difference between the legislative \nprocess with respect to trade adjustment assistance and free-trade \nagreements. Trade adjustment assistance is legislation. It goes through \nthe usual legislative process. It can be delayed. There is no \nrequirement that it be voted on.\n  That is not true with free-trade agreements. Once the President sends \nup a free-trade agreement, it enjoys a certain fast-tack process under \nwhich there must be a vote in both bodies after a certain period of \ntime. It is not imperative between the legislative process in one and \nthe special fast-\n\n[[Page S5806]]\n\ntrack process for the other. It is why the agreement was reached \nencouraging trust on both sides for the trade adjustment assistance \namendment to be passed by both bodies first before the President can \nsend up the free-trade agreements. He has indicated he will do so.\n  I have very strong assurance from the White House that is the case. \nIn fact, that is the agreement with the leadership, that if the trade \nadjustment assistance passes, then the free-trade agreement will come \nup and be voted on and passed in the House and then voted on and passed \nin the Senate.\n  The best way to support our trade agenda and the best way to support \nfree-trade agreements is to not accept the amendment as offered by my \ngood friend from Utah so we can get both passed very quickly.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 625\n\n  Virtually, the same is true with respect to the amendment offered by \nSenator McCain. I oppose Senator McCain's amendment. He wants to go \nback and undo some of the progress that was made in trade adjustment \nassistance. Let's start with the 2002 trade adjustment assistance law. \nThat made important changes in trade adjustment assistance. In fact, I \nhelped write that law.\n  In 2002 trade adjustment assistance covered manufacturing workers, \nand it covered workers whose jobs shifted to countries with which we \nhad a free-trade agreement. So it covered workers who were in \nmanufacturing who lost their jobs, and then it covered workers whose \njobs were shifted to countries with which we had a free-trade \nagreement. Other aspects of American employment, such as services, did \nnot cover the jobs that shifted to countries with which we did not have \na free-trade agreement.\n  That 2002 law not only covered manufacturing workers and workers \nwhose jobs shifted to countries with which we had a free-trade \nagreement, it also doubled training funds. Doubled it. Training is so \ncritical. It also provided a new tax credit to help Americans better \nafford health insurance for themselves and their families. That is no \nsmall item. We all know how hard it is to get health insurance \nespecially for individuals in small firms. We are not talking about big \ncompanies. We are talking about individuals who have lost their jobs. \nWe also know how expensive health care is; therefore, there is a great \nneed for health insurance. Again, that 2002 change of the trade \nadjustment assistance doubled training funds. Training is so important \nin today's modern society, and it provided a new tax credit to help \nAmericans better afford health insurance.\n  Our economy has changed since 2002. America's strength in \nmanufacturing expanded to include a robust services sector, which is \nnow 80 percent of our economy. Madam President, 80 percent of our \neconomy today is services. It is all different facets. It is call \ncenters, insurance, and everything you can think of that is \ncharacterized as services. America's trade with foreign nations has \nexpanded to countries such as China and India, big countries with which \nwe do not have free-trade agreements. The service sector has expanded \njust since 2002, and we have trade with other countries with which we \ndo not have free-trade agreements.\n  I believe trade adjustment assistance should cover workers both in \nmanufacturing and services. It should cover workers whose jobs move to \nany country, especially China, whether it is an FTA country--free-trade \nagreement country--or not.\n  These changes in realities have prompted me and my colleagues to \nupdate that program, to update it from what it was in 2002. It was \nupdated in 2009. When they updated it in 2009 the law brought trade \nadjustment assistance more fully to the 21st century by providing \nAmericans with training for the new economy. Unfortunately, those \nexpanded provisions expired in February. They are gone. That had a big \nimpact. Thousands of workers were denied access because the expiration \nof the expansion of trade adjustment assistance.\n  For example, more than 1,000 service sector workers in both Texas and \nVirginia were denied TAA benefits when the 2009 law expired earlier \nthis year. These workers likely will be eligible under the trade \nadjustment assistance compromise I negotiated with Chairman Camp. \nChairman David Camp, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, \nand I and our staffs spent a lot of time getting an agreement on trade \nadjustment assistance, what the provisions should be, how far the \nexpansion should go, and how it should be paid for. It was an \nagreement, a bipartisan agreement. There is not much of that around \nhere, but we worked hard and got the job done.\n  I must say, however, under Senator McCain's amendment, these service \nworkers I mentioned would remain shut out. They would not qualify. I \nthink it is time to bring us into the modern world. It is time to \nprovide equal access to all Americans regardless of whether they work \non a factory floor or a call center. It should not matter. If you lose \nyour job on account of trade, you should get trade adjustment \nassistance benefits regardless of whether the job moves to Mexico, a \ncountry with whom we do have a free-trade agreement or if the job moves \nto a country such as China, a country with whom we do not have a free-\ntrade agreement.\n  I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose the McCain amendment. I \nthink it is unwise. I might also add that if either of these two \namendments pass, guess what. It gets all gummed up over in the House. \nThe House, therefore, cannot take up the clean trade adjustment \nassistance amendment. We have to go back all over again, amend it \nagain, back and forth.\n  Do you know what that is going to do? It is going to do two things: \nThat is going to jeopardize passage of then updated trade adjustment \nassistance. Guess what else it is going to do. It is going to \njeopardize passage of free-trade agreements. I think a vast majority of \nthe Members of this body and in the other body, together, want both of \nthese matters passed.\n  I must say if we had amendments here, despite them being defective on \nthe merits, if amendments are added, it is going to delay the process \nfurther. The House will have to amend it again, send it back over here, \nand it is going to very much delay both the trade adjustment assistance \nand the free-trade agreements. For those reasons I urge that those \namendments not be agreed to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, nothing of the sort is going to happen. \nThe fact is, we have had nothing but delays by the President. Just a \nfew weeks ago he was accusing us of not passing the free-trade \nagreements when he knows we cannot even consider them. There have been \na lot of games played with us.\n  I remember last spring in our committee when the Trade Representative \nsaid: We have a few more things we have to work out on Panama and \nColombia, and we will definitely send these free-trade agreements \nbefore the August recess.\n  We got near the August recess, and they said: Well, we need one other \nthing. We need trade adjustment assistance.\n  Now, if they need trade adjustment assistance--and I have no doubt \nthat is going to pass in the Senate if there is a fair process. I do \nnot believe there is any doubt it will pass in the House. The agreement \nworked out by the distinguished chairman and Chairman Camp over in the \nHouse probably will be voted on. I have to vote against it.\n  The fact is, all my amendment--it does evidence some distrust in this \nprocess. All my amendment does is say: Look, we are not going to allow \ntrade adjustment assistance to go into effect until these three trade \nagreements are sent by the President and passed. Both bodies can pass \nthe trade adjustment assistance on this bill, and that is fine with me. \nMy amendment says TAA does not go into effect until the President \nsubmits these three treaties, and they are passed and become law. Then \ntrade adjustment assistance goes.\n  That is a very fair way of doing this. It is a way of saying to \neverybody: Let's get rid of the mistrust. Let's do this in a straight-\nup way. Let's do it so everybody knows what is going to happen. Trade \nadjustment assistance will ultimately come into effect, but only after \nthe administration lives up to submitting these trade agreements and \nthey are passed.\n  Why would we want trade adjustment assistance to pass if these three \ntrade\n\n[[Page S5807]]\n\nagreements do not pass? It is just another big cost to the government. \nKeep in mind the people who are out of work are getting unemployment \ninsurance. Trade adjustment assistance adds payments on top of that to \ntheir unemployment insurance. Why would we do that if we are not going \nto have these three trade agreements become law? It just makes no \nsense. Mine is a practical amendment.\n  It says let's get rid of the game playing. We will do this if you do \nthis. Frankly, the President promised to do it, and we are still \nstanding here waiting for the three trade agreements to be sent here. \nTo me, it is hard to imagine why the President is not doing this.\n  By the way, on the trade adjustment assistance a little less than 7 \npercent of our nongovernment workers are unionized. Yet one-third of \nthese payments will go to union members. I do not blame my colleagues \non the other side for wanting to help anybody who is out of work or \nanybody who belongs to a trade union. But do we always have to do it in \na slanted way that helps one small sector of the workers in this \ncountry and not the rest of them? It is a problem. We have unemployment \ninsurance to take care of people who are out of work. We should do \nthat. It is important we do that. Trade adjustment assistance is just \nadding some more payments on top of that.\n  There is a real question whether we should do it here because I asked \nthe representatives of the administration in the committee what jobs \nare going to be lost as a result of these three agreements. They could \nnot come up with one. There will be, according to the administration, \n250,000 new jobs that will occur, or at least jobs that will occur and \nwill be sustained by these three trade agreements once they are enacted \ninto law.\n  Just yesterday my friends on the other side voted down trade \npromotion authority. I cannot imagine why any President would not want \ntrade promotion authority.\n  It is mind-boggling to me that this President doesn't want it. It is \nthe only way we are going to be able to get free-trade agreements done. \nOtherwise, we are going to have to do it through other legislative \nprocesses, which is much more arduous, much more difficult, and does \nnot come up with just an up-or-down vote. There is a reason for this \nprocess, and that is to be able to do free trade in this country. Yet \nevery time we turn around there is another roadblock thrown up by the \nother side, as though they don't want free trade. I understand that for \nsome unsubstantiated or ridiculous reason the unions don't like free-\ntrade agreements, even though they are going to, according to the \nadministration, create 250,000 new jobs--or jobs, anyway. Why wouldn't \nthey like those? They have an opportunity to unionize companies that \ncome into existence.\n  By the way, even under the stilted, one-sided National Labor \nRelations Board that currently exists that is running away with our \nresponsibilities and legislating from the regulatory bench--even with \nthat board, unions win 60 percent of union elections--contested \nelections. It is not as though they are being picked on or are not \nbeing treated fairly.\n  By the way, I would be one of the first to make sure they are treated \nfairly. I am one of the few people in this whole body who earned a \nunion card. I worked in the building and construction trade unions for \n10 years. I acknowledge the distinguished Presiding Officer sitting in \nthe chair earned a union card. I am not sure we can call that a union, \nworking with the--just joshing. The entertainment industry unions are \nnot like the AFL-CIO. We are tough as nails. On the other hand, I have \nto retract that because I have seen some people in the entertainment \nindustry as tough as nails, and the Presiding Officer is one. No \nquestion about it. I have great admiration for him. But he ought to be \nwith me on this. He ought to be with me because all we are saying is, \nlook--and the most that would happen is a few days, enough to get the \nfree-trade agreements passed in the House.\n  So what I am saying is, first of all, let's get the President to do \nwhat he has blamed us for not doing; that is, to send these three free-\ntrade agreements with these countries that are so important to us and \nwe are important to them. We are losing business every day because this \nis being dragged out for so long. Send them so we can vote on them. TAA \nwill pass here, and I believe it will pass over there with the process \nwe have.\n  All I am saying is it doesn't become effective because we shouldn't \nbe paying for people when we don't have free-trade agreements that are \nthe basis for paying people. All I am saying is they don't come into \nexistence--the TAA doesn't come into existence until after these free-\ntrade agreements are ratified, are voted up or down, and become law--\nvoted up and become law. That is fair. It is an intelligent approach to \nit. It ends the mystery. It ends what some people think is a convoluted \nprocess. It ends what some people think is not a good-faith process. It \ndoes it in a way that doesn't hurt anybody, and it just says: Look, \nlet's do it straight up so there is no more arguing or moaning or \ngroaning or accusations that one side is not being fair to the other. \nLet's just do it this way.\n  So I am calling on my colleagues on the other side to vote for my \namendment. They don't lose a doggone thing. In fact, it will help this \nprocess along, and that is one reason I brought it up.\n  I am personally not sure trade adjustment assistance will pass \nwithout my amendment. That is one reason I brought it to the Senate \nfloor--because it is a fair, decent, honorable way of saying, OK, let's \nget rid of the mysteries. Let's get rid of the arguments. Let's get rid \nof the partisanship. Let's vote on these three free-trade agreements--\nor excuse me, the trade adjustment assistance--which is going to add a \nlot of money to the cost of this government, and let's vote on them. \nWhen they are both voted through by the House and the Senate, then \nlet's bring up the three free-trade agreements which should pass \nreadily in both Houses. Once they become law, trade adjustment \nassistance comes into being.\n  That is a fair, responsible way of doing this in a way that does away \nwith the mystery, does away with partisanship, does away with \nDemocratism and Republicanism and gets this process down the road.\n  For the life of me, I can't understand why anybody would argue with \nthis. I am calling on my Democratic friends and saying: Let's be \nbipartisan about this. Let's send a message to the President that we \nwant those doggone trade agreements up here. He controls that process. \nI just found it astounding when he came out and said: I wish they would \npass the three free-trade agreements when he knows we can't until he \nsends them.\n  This agreement is not only fair, it is the right thing to do. It may \nbe the only way we are going to get these three free-trade agreements \ndone. I would like to hear a good argument against them, but there \nisn't any. With these free-trade agreements, I believe there will be \nthousands of jobs created. I am not sure there will be 250,000 as the \nadministration claims, but I believe there will be many jobs at a time \nwhen we need jobs.\n  Trade adjustment assistance--there are a lot of sincere people in \nthis body and in the other body who believe it is absolutely essential, \neven though there was not one shred of evidence as far as I heard that \nany jobs would be lost as a result of these two free-trade agreements. \nBut I am willing to understand there may be some loss, and therefore--\nand even if there aren't, to get these three free-trade agreements \nthrough, the other side says we have to pass TAA. Fine. Let's pass it \nthrough both bodies. Let's make it subject to getting the three free-\ntrade agreements passed into law because it should be subject to that.\n  There is no reason in the world why we would add more spending from a \ntrade adjustment assistance standpoint unless we have these three free-\ntrade agreements. That is the argument for the trade adjustment \nassistance that our colleagues on the other side and some on our side \nare making. I have a feeling this is the way to get this done. It is \nthe smart way to get it done. It is the honorable way to get it done. \nIt is the truthful way to get it done. It is the bipartisan way to get \nit done.\n\n  I think people know I have a reputation for being able to bring both \nsides together from time to time, and that is what I am trying to do. \nThis is not a political game as far as I am concerned. I do want these \nthree free-trade\n\n[[Page S5808]]\n\nagreements because I know it would be great for our country. We are \nlosing business. We have gone down from 74 percent agricultural exports \nto Colombia to 28 percent. Anybody with brains would say we shouldn't \nhave allowed that to happen, and it wouldn't have had we passed these \nthree free-trade agreements, or at least the Colombia one, last year. \nBut Korea is such a big, even greater trading partner than Colombia--\nalthough, when I look at what President Uribe and what President \nSantos, the current President, have done to straighten out that country \nand get rid of the terrorists and to bring down the violence against \nunion members and so forth, they deserve our support. They deserve \nthese agreements.\n  When I look at Korea and what an important partner they are in our \ntrade--and we are losing trade to them now; others are taking it away \nfrom us because we haven't passed the Korean agreement--my gosh, it \ndoesn't take any brains to realize we are not acting like friends to \nKorea.\n  Then look at Panama. Panama is one of the financial centers of this \nhemisphere. It is a great nation. It is important to us, above all \npeople. It is dishonorable for us to not pass the Panamanian Free Trade \nAgreement that they worked out with us and which we had to add labor \nlanguage in each one of these agreements that wasn't there before \nbecause of this administration's fealty to organized labor. Fine.\n  Why don't we do what has to be done to pass these three free-trade \nagreements and to get the support for TAA for those who believe that is \nthe right way to go and get rid of any kind of concerns that one side \nor other would not live up to its share of the battle. My amendment \nwill do that.\n  I hope it is not just a partisan vote. I hope we have some Democrats \nwho will vote for my amendment. If we do, I think it will push this \nwhole process forward in a way that makes sense.\n  Mr. President, let me just dwell a few minutes on one of the things I \nwould like to get across. People ask me why I spent years working \ntoward a leadership position on the Senate Finance Committee. It is \npretty simple. The Finance Committee has jurisdiction over issues that \nmatter not only to the people of Utah but to everybody: the bloated Tax \nCode we have, the inheritance taxes, health programs such as Medicare \nand Medicaid, Social Security, issues that go to the heart of \ninternational trade such as customs duties, tariff, and import quotas, \nand free-trade agreements. I could go on and on. It is a very important \ncommittee.\n  Sixty percent of all spending in this government comes through the \nFinance Committee. Being the lead Republican on the Finance Committee \ngives me a unique platform to shape all of these policies in a way that \nworks best for my home State of Utah, and I hope the Nation as a whole.\n  Today I wish to focus on international trade and why I am so \npassionate about opening new markets to our goods and services. It gets \nrepeated ad nauseam that 95 percent of our potential customers live \noutside of the United States, and there is no doubt that trade is vital \nto America's competitiveness. But trade has immediate and particular \nimportance to jobs and the economy in my home State of Utah as well as \nevery other State.\n  Last year alone companies in Utah shipped over $13 billion in \nmerchandise exports to international markets--$13 billion--supporting \nnearly 93,000 jobs in our State. Think about that: $13 billion and \nclose to 100,000 jobs thanks to products Utah companies sold outside \nthe borders of the United States. My State is only one State. I think \nevery State can tell a similar story. That doesn't even include our \nservice providers, who similarly take advantage of opportunities across \nthe globe. Companies in Utah exported to over 190 foreign markets; \ncompanies such as Varian Medical Systems, which produces cutting-edge x \nray products that assist with various cancer treatments and industrial \nsecurity screening and which provides over 700 people with good-paying \njobs in our State.\n  By removing barriers to trade, free-trade agreements level the \nplaying field for our companies operating in markets abroad. This has \nan immediate and observable impact on trade. Following the \nimplementation of every U.S. bilateral or regional free-trade \nagreement, Utah has increased its exports to partner countries.\n  Let me give two examples. Utah's exports to Morocco experienced \ngrowth of over 2,000 percent after the United States implemented a \nfree-trade agreement with them, and Utah's exports to Singapore \nincreased by over 800 percent after we implemented that FTA.\n  Listening to some of the pundits, it would be easy to draw the \nconclusion that exports in free trade are only important to large, \nmultinational companies; but nothing could be further from the truth. \nIn 2008, the most recent year for which we have statistics, 86 percent \nof Utah's exporting companies were small or midsized companies. For the \nentrepreneurs who lead these small and midsized companies, \ninternational trade is their lifeblood. But exports are only part of \nthe story.\n  Thanks to low taxes, family-friendly values, and a well-educated, \nmotivated, and internationally savvy workforce, Utah is a place where \npeople want to live and work. And it is not just the greatest skiing in \nthe world, although that certainly is a draw.\n\n  When foreign companies look to grow their operations or gain a \nfoothold in the U.S. market, they increasingly look to Utah to site \ntheir operations. These companies invest significant amounts of capital \nto open or expand facilities in our State every year.\n  Foreign-owned companies employ over 34,000 workers in Utah. That is \nmore than 3 percent of all Utah employees in the private sector. These \nare well-paying jobs. U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies pay an \naverage compensation of over $68,000 per year. And let's not forget all \nof the spending by international visitors to our world-class colleges \nand universities, ski resorts, and parks.\n  That is why I have been pushing so hard to get the three FTAs with \nSouth Korea, Panama, and Colombia passed and implemented. It is not the \nonly reason, but it is certainly a reason. These agreements have been \nsitting idle for far too long. They were negotiated during the \nadministration of President Bush. They were wrapped in a bow for \nPresident Obama, ready to go the day he took office. His own \nadministration has made some changes in them that these three countries \nhave agreed to. Yet President Obama still has not sent them to Congress \nfor a vote, which is astounding to me. The President himself says these \nthree agreements will create 250,000 new jobs. His failed stimulus, his \nburdensome overregulation of business, his penchant for taxing and \nspending to ``redistribute wealth'' all rubbed salt in the wounds of a \ndifficult economy. We are now left with an unemployment rate of 9.1 \npercent. You would think the President would be eager to do something \neveryone agrees would actually create real jobs, and not just real \njobs, great jobs. But the FTAs with South Korea, Panama, and Colombia \nremain on his desk.\n  While the President stands still, the world continues to forge ahead. \nChina continues to pursue policies that boost its growth at our \nexpense. Other countries around the world continue to negotiate trade \nagreements that exclude the United States, putting Utah exporters at a \nserious disadvantage, as well as other States. The consequences of this \nadministration's trade paralysis are real.\n  By way of example, the U.S. share of Colombia's agricultural imports \nhas already fallen from nearly 44 percent in 2007 to 21 percent in \n2010. The EU and Canada swooped in to fill this vacuum. Both have now \nnegotiated free-trade agreements with Colombia.\n  During President Bush's Presidency, we passed trade agreements with \n14 countries, providing a significant boost to the U.S. economy. By \ncontrast, President Obama has not submitted a single trade agreement to \nCongress.\n  It certainly does not help that the President has refused to spend \nany political capital to seek trade negotiating authority from \nCongress. The need for it is obvious: Without it, we cannot pass good \nagreements to open foreign markets for our exports. That is why every \nPresident since FDR has sought this authority. Why doesn't this \nPresident? I think it is a lack of experience, personally. He is smart \nenough to understand this.\n  Every President but one has sought it. The only one who has not is \nour current President. But whether he seeks it\n\n[[Page S5809]]\n\nor not, I am going to work to see that he gets it. And when he does, \nyou can be sure it will be designed to shape his negotiating objectives \nso that the resulting agreements embody high standards that best serve \nthe economies of the United States and, in particular, my home State of \nUtah.\n  It is vital that future trade agreements--such as the proposed Trans-\nPacific Partnership Agreement between the United States and six other \nnations--protect the intellectual property of our innovators and \ncontent creators, level the playing field for our companies which are \noften forced to engage in lopsided competition with state-owned \ncompanies and national champions, enable modern day integrated global \nsupply chains, and enhance market access for both goods and services \nproviders.\n  In the months and weeks ahead, we have the opportunity to shape the \neconomic future of our great Nation and my own great State of Utah. I \nam going to do my part to ensure that trade plays a central part in \nthat equation.\n  I hope everybody in this body realizes how important this is and that \nwe should not keep playing these games because we have political \nopportunism. Then again, that is another reason for my amendment. My \namendment says the games will be over. Both sides will vote on TAA. The \nPresident will have to submit the agreements. Once the agreements are \npassed and made into law, TAA comes into existence. And it should not \ncome into existence until after these agreements become law.\n  What it says to everybody is: Look, the games are over. This is the \nway to do it. This is the fair way to do it. This is the bipartisan way \nto do it.\n  Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could get these free-trade agreements \npassed? Wouldn't it be a wonderful achievement for all of us here--a \nbipartisan achievement, with the President getting lots of credit for \nit? I think it would be a good thing. If we cannot do this, then you \ncan imagine what this place is going to become in the future. My \namendment is the way you get there.\n  I am hoping my colleagues on the other side listen to this. I hope \nthey pay attention. I sure hope they vote for this amendment because if \nthey do not, I question whether we will ever have these free-trade \nagreements.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order requiring 60 votes for the adoption of \nthis amendment, the amendment is rejected.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 625 to Amendment No. 633\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \namendment No. 625, offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain. \nThere will be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to the vote.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the stimulus passed in 2009 was purported \nto be temporary. As part of that massive piece of legislation, we made \na significant expansion and added at least $600 million a year to the \nTrade Adjustment Assistance Program. This amendment would cut back to \nthe prestimulus number of the TAA.\n  It is pretty simple. It would save at least $600 million per year on \nquestionable programs of questionable effectiveness. But the point is, \nthe stimulus was supposed to be a temporary increase in spending and \nnot a permanent one. The Reid package makes most of it--at least 65 \npercent of it--permanent. The least we can do is cut it back to \nprestimulus levels, which is supported by the National Taxpayers Union. \nI know that will be very persuasive to my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this country has an extremely high \nunemployment rate. We all know a lot of people are losing jobs and some \nare losing jobs on account of trade. The world has changed, even as \nrecently as 2002. In 2002, the law said: OK. If a person loses a job on \naccount of jobs going to a free-trade country, they are eligible for \ntrade adjustment assistance, but it has to be a manufacturing job.\n  That was changed in 2009 because the country has changed. There are a \nlot of countries with which we trade that are not FTA partners--China, \nIndia. It makes eminent sense, if someone loses a job on account of \ntrade with any country, that person should be eligible for trade \nadjustment assistance and not just with FTA countries.\n  Secondly, we expanded that to services. Eighty percent of the workers \nin our country are in the services sector, not the manufacturing \nsector. That addition was also provided for in 2009.\n  For technical reasons also, if this amendment passes, it jeopardizes \nboth TAA as well as FTA because everything has to be renegotiated. So I \nurge this amendment not be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we are talking about trade, how we create \nmarkets for what Americans grow or build and sell abroad, which creates \njobs here at home. But I wish to talk about a rather specialized area \nof trade, and that has to do with foreign military sales, and \nparticularly I wish to talk about a topic Senator Menendez and I \nintroduced a bill on last week called the Taiwan Air Power \nModernization Act of 2011. This bill requires the U.S. Government to \nrespond to the request of the Government of Taiwan for the sale of at \nleast 66 F-16 C/D fighter aircraft to Taiwan.\n  That sounds like a mouthful and a big subject, and it is, but let me \ntry to put some meat on the bone and explain why I think this is so \nimportant.\n  Support of the people of Taiwan has been a bipartisan priority for \ndecades. Democrats and Republicans supported the Mutual Defense Treaty \nwith Taiwan, signed by President Eisenhower in 1954. Democrats and \nRepublicans came together and passed the Taiwan Relations Act, which \nwas signed by President Carter in 1979, and which remains the law of \nthe land today. The Taiwan Relations Act states that the United States \nwill provide to Taiwan the defense articles necessary to enable Taiwan \nto maintain sufficient self-defense capabilities in furtherance of \nmaintaining peace and stability in the western Pacific region.\n  What does sufficient self-defense capabilities mean? President \nReagan, in a memorandum he dictated dated August 17, 1982, laid it out. \nThis is about the time the third communique between Communist China and \nthe United States was formally adopted, because the Chinese wanted to \nknow exactly what this meant. Were arms provided to Taiwan a threat of \naggressive weaponry or purely for defensive purposes? According to \nJames Lilley, who was America's top representative in China at the time \nand who later served as Ambassador to China under George Herbert Walker \nBush, that is what this was designed to do, to crystalize what the \nnature of the weapons sales to the Taiwan Government would be used for. \nThis memorandum from President Reagan in August 17, 1982 laid it out:\n\n     . . . it is essential that the quantity and quality of the \n     arms provided Taiwan be conditioned entirely on the threat \n     posed by the People's Republic of China. Both in quantitative \n     and qualitative terms, Taiwan's defense capability relative \n     to that of the PRC will be maintained.\n\n  This is strictly for giving Taiwan the ability to defend itself \nagainst potential Communist actions by Communist China. It was directly \nproportional and reciprocal to the threat posed by the People's \nRepublic of China.\n  But Ronald Reagan was not alone in this interpretation. In fact, both \nDemocrats and Republicans over the years have supported numerous arms \nsales to the Government of Taiwan, including the current request for 66 \nF-16 C/D advanced fighter aircraft.\n  So far this year, 47 Republicans and Democrats have signed a letter--\nthese are Senators--to the administration in support of this sale. In \nAugust, 181 Members of the House of Representatives, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, wrote to the administration endorsing this same sale.\n  Why is Taiwan asking for these aircraft and why do so many Democrats \nand Republicans join together in a bipartisan way on this issue when \nthe parties seem to be so polarized by so many other issues? The answer \nis simple and straightforward: Taiwan's air defense capabilities are \nnearly obsolete, while China's military capabilities are growing at an \nalarming rate. This chart demonstrates the problem.\n  On the right in the red you will see that China has 2,300 operational \nmilitary combat aircraft, while Taiwan has 490 operational combat \naircraft. But air defense is not just a numbers game. Quality of those \naircraft matters a lot--just as much as quantity. So what about the \nquality of Taiwan's existing forces?\n\n[[Page S5811]]\n\n  According to our own intelligence services, the Defense Intelligence \nAgency, in an unclassified report last year, said that ``many of \nTaiwan's fighter aircraft are close to or beyond service life, and many \nrequire extensive maintenance support.''\n  China's capabilities, on the other hand, are clearly newer and \nclearly growing and clearly focused on intimidating Taiwan and the \nUnited States. China's official press agency reported in March that the \nPeople's Republic of China will increase its military budget this year \nby 12 percent, after an increase last year of 7.5 percent. But the \nPentagon estimates that China's official military budget of about $90 \nbillion they disclose, is actually far less than the $150 billion they \nactually spend. In other words, they only disclose part of their \nexpenditures on national security and not the full amount, which is \nsome $150 billion. The question is, who does China intimidate with this \ngrowing military power?\n  Here is what the Pentagon had to say in its 2011 report to Congress, \ncalled ``Military and Security Developments Involving the People's \nRepublic of China.'' The Defense Department observed that China \ncontinued modernizing its military in 2010, with a focus on Taiwan \ncontingencies.\n  The Pentagon also noted that China's air force will remain primarily \nfocused on ``building the capabilities required to pose a credible \nmilitary threat to Taiwan and U.S. forces in East Asia.''\n  Let me repeat that. The Pentagon noted that China's air force will \nremain primarily focused on ``building the capabilities required to \npose a credible military threat to Taiwan and U.S. forces in East \nAsia.''\n  Some say the United States should not look at our policy with Taiwan \nin a vacuum, that we should consider the context of our larger \nstrategic relationship with China. I could not agree more, because the \nstrategic situation with China these days is very troubling. Many of \nChina's neighbors are concerned about its military buildup and \nterritorial ambitions. Last year, China claimed the South China Sea as \na ``core interest,'' which unsettled Vietnam, the Philippines, \nIndonesia, and other nations in the region. China also renewed a long-\nrunning dispute with India over the borders of the Arunachal Pradesh \nregion.\n  China continues to be an enabler of the nuclear ambitions of the \nregime in North Korea. This summer, Google publicly reported that a \nChinese entity has been targeting the personal e-mail accounts of U.S. \nand South Korean government employees, and Pakistan's defense minister \npublicly discussed the possibility of China building a naval base at \nGwadar, Pakistan, which is already home to a new strategically \nimportant port at the mouth of the Gulf of Oman.\n  China, we know, has also escalated its rhetoric aimed at the United \nStates, and particularly the U.S. Senate. A number of my colleagues \nvisited Beijing last April where they reportedly received a lecture \nfrom Chinese officials on fiscal policy. Just last week, more to the \npoint of this topic, China's top official newspaper used a lot of \nunnecessary and bellicose rhetoric on the subject of the proposed U.S. \narms sales to Taiwan. This official newspaper of the Communist Party in \nChina said that those of us on Capitol Hill who support Taiwan are \n``madmen.'' They said we were ``playing with fire.'' They said we could \npay a ``disastrous price'' if we continued to support our ally Taiwan, \nas we are obligated to do by the Taiwan Relations Act.\n  I suggest the United States should not give in to this intimidation \nand these threats, and that we should instead pass this legislation to \nsend a clear message to China that respects only strength, not \nweakness; that the real madmen are those who think America will abandon \nour friends and allies and our principles and our longstanding \nstrategic interest in the stability of East Asia.\n  Supporting this legislation would also greatly reassure our allies \nand friends around the world. Many remember what happened when \nPresident Clinton deployed two aircraft carrier battle groups during \nthe Taiwan Strait crisis in 1996. That crisis developed when China \ntried to intimidate Taiwan on the eve of its first free Presidential \nelections by conducting a series of military exercises that included \nthe firing of missiles a few miles north of Taiwan. President Clinton \nresponded by ordering the largest U.S. military force since the Vietnam \nwar to deploy to the region, including carrier battle groups led by the \nUSS Nimitz and the USS Independence.\n  America's show of strength and resolve under President Clinton's \nleadership did not escalate the crisis, it defused it, and it sent a \nwelcome signal to our friends and allies in the region. According to an \narticle in the current issue of Washington Quarterly, following the \ncrisis, ``the region's confidence in the United States soared.''\n  `` . . . Japan, Singapore, the Philippines and other nations all \nbolstered their security ties with the United States.'' The Taiwan \nStrait crisis was one of the real foreign policy success stories of the \nClinton administration. But the authors of this same article conclude \nthat ``forsaking Taiwan [now] would likely have the opposite effect.''\n  This bill deserves bipartisan support of the majority of Members of \nthe Senate based on our longstanding bipartisan consensus on policy \ntoward Taiwan, the growing gap in military capabilities between the \nPeople's Republic of China and the Government of Taiwan, China's \naggressive behavior toward its neighbors and toward the United States, \nand America's credibility with our allies and with free peoples \neverywhere.\n  I conclude by pointing out perhaps something that is obvious, but \nmaybe it is not so obvious to everyone. Since we are talking about \ntrade, what we grow and we sell to people abroad creating jobs at home, \nit is worth mentioning that selling F-16 aircraft to Taiwan creates \njobs and exports for the U.S. economy and does not cost 1 penny of \ntaxpayer money. This map demonstrates all the States in which direct \nand indirect employment from which the export sales of F-16s to Taiwan \nis projected to be at least 60 person years of employment, which is the \nequivalent of 10 American workers employed full time for 6 years.\n  As you can see from this map, 32 States will have that level of job \ncreation or more as a result of the sale of these F-16s, making the \nsale of the F-16s to Taiwan a coast-to-coast job engine. In fact, \naccording to the Perryman Group, the requested sale of F-16C/Ds to \nTaiwan ``would generate some $8.7 billion in output; and directly \nsupport more than 23,000 jobs.''\n  As I pointed out earlier, these jobs do not cost the American people \none cent. These are private sector jobs paid for with money coming in \nfrom overseas because this is an export-driven industry. The only thing \nthe U.S. Government needs to do is get out of the way and let these \nAmericans continue to stay on the job and collect an estimated $768 \nmillion in Federal tax revenues. Yes, not only will we be selling these \naircraft, creating jobs, we will be generating revenue for the Federal \nTreasury in the process, generated by this private sector, export-\ndriven economic activity.\n  I wish to thank the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Menendez, for \nintroducing this legislation with me, and I thank my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle who have agreed to cosponsor it. I hope more \nSenators will join us, and I hope we will pass this bill soon. I hope \nwe can help American workers continue building these aircraft to \nstrengthen our friends, the people of Taiwan.\n  Mr. President, let me just close on this comment: This is standalone \nlegislation I discussed here today, but I will be offering, in due \ncourse, an amendment to the pending bill that would mandate this sale. \nSo I would ask my colleagues to please join us in a bipartisan way of \nshowing our support for our friends and allies in Taiwan and generating \njobs right here at home.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                          Disaster Assistance\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, my State of Vermont has been hit very \nhard by Hurricane Irene. Widespread flooding caused a number of deaths, \nthe loss of many homes and businesses, and hundreds of millions--\nperhaps $1 billion--in damage to property and infrastructure. I have \nvisited many of the most hard-hit towns, and I have been shocked and \nmoved by the extent of the damage I saw. Irene will go down in history \nas one of the very worst natural disasters ever to hit the State of\n\n[[Page S5812]]\n\nVermont. Let me share a few facts with you about the extent of the \ndamage.\n  Already, more than 5,200 Vermonters have registered with FEMA. \nRemember, we are a State of only 630,000 people and approximately \n200,000 households, and yet more than 5,200 Vermonters have already \nregistered with FEMA.\n  More than 700 homes were severely damaged or completely destroyed--\n700 in a State which has about 200,000 households.\n  Between 1,500 and 2,000 families have been displaced, their housing \nuncertain as we approach Vermont's brutally cold winter season. It is \nbeginning to get cold in Vermont.\n  More than 73,000 homes were left without electricity--one-third of \nall of the homes in our State. Tens of thousands of Vermonters lost \ntheir phone service, and in some areas these services still have not \nbeen fully restored.\n  More than 2,000 roads were badly damaged--2,000 roads--including 135 \nsegments of State highways. More than 300 bridges--300 bridges--were \ndamaged. Hundreds of roads and bridges remain closed, while many others \nare only open to emergency vehicles today. Some towns still have \nlimited access because the roads and bridges that link them to the \noutside world were destroyed.\n  Further, dozens of town libraries, townhalls, and municipal and \nvolunteer fire departments have been damaged or destroyed. Ninety \npublic schools could not open on time. The last one is just now opening \nfor the year.\n  Hundreds of businesses and more than 360 farms with more than 15,000 \nacres of farmland have been damaged, tearing at the fabric of our rural \neconomy.\n  Our Amtrak and freight services were completely suspended, as \nrailbeds literally washed into rivers. One Amtrak line is still down \ntoday.\n  The largest State office complex was completely flooded and is closed \nuntil further notice. Mr. President, 1,600 State employees cannot go to \nwork in that building. Important files and computer systems have been \nruined, disrupting the ability of the State to deliver critical State \nfunctions.\n  I know that, as in times past, we will pick up the pieces in Vermont \nand restore our homes and businesses. And I have to tell you that if \nthere is any silver lining out of that disaster, it is the fact that in \ncommunity after community, people came out, worked together, and \nparticipated in cleanup efforts, supported each other. People from the \nnorthern part of the State, which was hit less severely, came down to \nthe southern part of the State to help. Strangers helped strangers. It \nwas an extraordinary effort of people coming together. But the simple \nfact is, if a State such as Vermont has communities that are \ndevastated, a State such as New Jersey has communities that are \ndevastated, we cannot do it alone. The scale of this disaster is too \noverwhelming for a State of the size of Vermont.\n  The Federal Government has long played an important role in disaster \nrecovery. That is something we have known for many years and we have \nseen time after time after time. When our fellow citizens in Louisiana \nand the gulf coast suffered the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, \npeople in Vermont were there for them, and I can tell you how many \npeople told me we have to do everything we can to protect the people \nwho were devastated by Katrina. When the citizens of Joplin, MO, were \nhit by deadly tornadoes, people on the west coast were there for them. \nAnd, of course, when terrorists attacked the United States on 9/11, we \nwere all there for New York City. That is what being a nation is about.\n  The name of our country is the United States of America--``united,'' \nu-n-i-t-e-d--and if that name means anything, it means when disaster \nstrikes one part of the country and communities are devastated, people \nare hurt, bridges and roads are out, farmers cannot produce the food, \nwe as a nation rally together to support those communities. That is \nwhat States impacted by Irene expect from Congress because that is what \nbeing a nation is about. Disaster relief, funded on an emergency basis, \nis what Congress has done for decades, and it is what Congress must do \nnow.\n  The Senate did the right thing in quickly passing a $6.9 billion \ndisaster relief supplemental appropriations bill, and I wish to thank \nall of the people active in that, from Senator Reid, to Senator \nLandrieu, to Senator Leahy--all of the people who made that happen. \nThey did a great job.\n  Does that bill have everything I would like to see in a disaster \nrelief bill for the State of Vermont? No, it does not, quite frankly. \nBut it is a very good bill. It is an urgently needed bill. It is an \nimportant step forward in the right direction. I commend, again, all of \nthose Senators who played an active role in moving that bill along, \nincluding 10 Senate Republicans.\n  Disaster aid should not be a partisan issue, but it seems the House \nRepublicans are intent on making it one. The disaster funding the House \nis likely to pass this week is totally inadequate and will not address \nthe magnitude of the damages inflicted by Hurricane Irene or the \nbacklog in FEMA funding that existed before it.\n  To my mind, it is an outrage that for the first time in modern \nAmerican history House Republicans want to have a budget debate over \ndisaster assistance. They threaten to block urgently needed aid unless \nthe cost of that help is offset by cuts in other needed programs. They \nwant to use Hurricane Irene as another excuse for a budget fight. And \nthink about the precedent that sets. What happens if tomorrow there is, \nGod forbid, a disaster in New Mexico or a disaster in Colorado? Does \nthat mean we should be cutting education or environmental protection in \norder to pay for help to New Mexico or Colorado or California? If there \nis a major earthquake someplace in this country and communities are \ndevastated, do we cut back on the needs of the children? Do we cut back \non Medicare and have that huge debate in order to pay for disaster \nrelief?\n  Historically, the U.S. Congress has said--and what they said was \nright--that when disaster strikes, we as a nation come together and we \nprovide the support to those communities which have been hurt to get \nthem back on their feet. That is what we have done in this great \ncountry, and I am offended that some of my Republican colleagues in the \nHouse suddenly start thinking we need a major budget debate for every \ndisaster that is hitting this country. That is wrong. That is \nextraordinarily bad public policy. That is, frankly, unpatriotic and \nnot what the United States is about. Yes, of course, we must continue \nto address our deficit problem but not on the backs of communities in \nVermont, New Jersey, North Carolina, or other States that have been \ndevastated by Hurricane Irene. For those States and communities, we \nmust get them emergency help, and we must get it to them as quickly as \npossible.\n  Amazingly--I must say this--this talk about budget offsets for \ndisaster relief comes from some of the same people who repeatedly and \nconveniently ignore their own actions when it suits them. Congress \nprovided $800 billion to bail out Wall Street banks. I did not hear any \ndiscussion about offsets when it came to bailing out Wall Street. \nCongress extended huge tax breaks and loopholes for the wealthiest \npeople in this country, driving up the deficit. I did not hear any call \nfor offsets when we gave tax breaks to billionaires and large \ncorporations. The United States is spending today $10 billion a year on \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, including billions to rebuild those \ncountries. I did not hear any call for offsets when it came to the wars \nin Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Let me conclude by saying this: This country has its share of \nproblems. We all know that. But if we forsake the essence of what we \nare as a nation; that is, we stand together when disaster strikes, if \nwe forgo that, if we no longer live up to that ideal, I worry very much \nabout the future of our great Nation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            disaster relief\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last week the Senate passed three important \npieces of bipartisan legislation. It was really quite a productive \nweek. We reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration, which kept \n80,000 workers, including safety inspectors, on the job. We passed a \nhighway bill that\n\n[[Page S5813]]\n\nkeeps 1.8 million people at work building roads and bridges and dams. \nWe reached a bipartisan agreement to rush relief to communities \ndevastated by floods, tornadoes, and wildfires. So I was hopeful, as \nthis week began, that it would be productive. I thought Congress might \nbe able to set aside party politics to accomplish the important work of \nthis Nation. Instead, the tea party has taken over again. The tea party \nRepublicans have once again allowed partisanship to rear its ugly head.\n  Now House Republicans, obsessed with pleasing a group of radicals--\nthe tea party, they are called--are refusing to give the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency the funding it needs to reconstruct ravaged \ncommunities across this great country, and they are threatening to shut \ndown the government if they do not get what they want.\n  It is bad enough that we cannot agree that victims of floods and \nfires should get the help they need without delay.\n  We cannot even agree on what we have already agreed to. We spent \nmonths this spring and summer negotiating a deficit reduction agreement \nthat allowed Congress to appropriate more than $11 billion in disaster \naid for next year. After an earthquake, weeks of wildfires, and a \nhurricane that slammed the eastern seaboard, we are asking to free up \n$6.9 billion in emergency funds to help Americans in need.\n  There is a reason we have agreed in the past that disaster funding \nshould be set aside from the regular budget process. There is a reason \nwe agreed, as part of July's deficit reduction agreement, it should be \nset aside once again. Farmers who have lost their crops to floods, \nfamilies who have lost their homes to hurricanes should not be used as \npawns in a budget-bidding war.\n  Over the last two decades, almost 90 percent of the money Congress \nhas authorized for disaster relief has been done outside the regular \nbudget process. Why? Because we cannot determine what Mother Nature is \ngoing to do. We do the best we can. But who would have ever dreamed \nIrene would hit when it did, with the devastation it did. Who would \nhave ever dreamed a tornado would level the town of Joplin, MO?\n  We have done the best we can. I ask my Republican colleagues: Why \nshould today be any different than the past? FEMA is running out of \nmoney. That is the bottom line. On Monday, they will be broke. The \nPresident declared emergencies in 48 of the 50 States this year. We \nhave had 10 disasters already that have cost more than $1 billion each. \nIt has been 30 years since we have had so many large natural disasters.\n  As of this morning, FEMA's disaster fund had almost nothing left. It \nwill be broke on Monday. The agency that rushes to help when disaster \nstrikes will be out of money in just a day or two--I repeat, Monday. We \nare still in the middle of the hurricane season. Turn on the Weather \nChannel and see why it is so important that we get FEMA the resources \nit needs to react quickly to whatever Mother Nature sends our way.\n  FEMA has already halted reconstruction projects in 40 States to free \nfunds to react to immediate needs of communities affected by the most \nrecent disasters. Because of these delays, FEMA will take longer to \nrebuild bridges in New Hampshire and schools in Missouri and homes in \nTexas, all because of Republican stubbornness.\n  I am stunned. We have Senators from States that have been devastated \nby these disasters--one State, thousands of fires, 2,000 homes burned. \nWhy wouldn't people vote to help people who have had such devastation? \nAll politics.\n  FEMA has been there for people when crops they have planted and \ncounted on to make a living were drowned by floods. The Federal \nGovernment has always been there to help Americans in their hour of \ngreatest need, when their homes where their children were raised, spent \nholidays, and made memories had burned to the ground or been washed \naway or blown away.\n  But because of the delays, FEMA will no longer be able to rebuild the \nbridges, for example, in the State of New Hampshire. I just heard my \nfriend, the junior Senator from Vermont, talk about Vermont. Vermont \nhas had almost 200 bridges washed away--gone. Texas has had those \nfires. FEMA has been there when schools studied in and bridges driven \non have been rocked by earthquakes or blown away by tornadoes. Never \nbefore has Congress tried to nickel and dime the victims of these \ndisasters.\n  Americans have watched all they had go up in smoke or be washed or \nblown away. That is what Republicans are doing today. They are \nshortchanging communities that can least afford the delays of partisan \ngridlock.\n  Senate majority leader George Mitchell said: ``Bipartisanship means \nyou work together to work it out.'' American families and communities \nare relying on us to work together to work it out and holding out hope \nthat we will not disappoint them.\n  Go back a month. We were struggling, struggling hard, to work out an \nagreement that in years past has been simple. We were going to just \nraise the debt limit in this country on bills we had already \naccumulated. It took 3 months. But we got it done. One of the things we \ndid was we said we will no longer have fights during this next fiscal \nyear on funding the government. We agreed on the numbers.\n  What the House could not do in good conscience directly they are \ndoing indirectly. They are sending us a short-term continuing \nresolution to fund the government until the middle part of November. \nBut because they have all these extremists in the Republican majority \nin the House, they could not do that. They could not do that. They \ncould not send us what they had already agreed upon.\n  In fact, they put an addition on the bill, a so-called rider on the \nbill, saying the Senate is only going to be able to raise the debt \nceiling if it agrees on their number on emergencies, recognizing that \ntheir number will only last a few weeks. Here is what they did also \nthat was so mean-spirited. As I have outlined in detail, we have not \npaid for these disasters because they are emergencies. They are not in \nthe normal budget process.\n  But the House took money for more efficient vehicles--they took that \nmoney and said: We are going to pay for $1 billion for the year 2011. \nThe year 2011 ends--fiscal year ends--the end of this month, just a few \ndays from now.\n  Everyone has said, we just need a few million dollars to take care of \nit until the end of this month. As I have indicated, we have enough \nmoney until Monday. But that is all. The end of the month is not \nMonday. They took $1 billion, when only a little bit was needed, and \nstripped our ability to create jobs.\n  I spoke to Steny Hoyer in the House. He said they are taking away \n52,000 jobs from the American people by doing this. They take $1 \nbillion and pay for this. But just to show further meanness, they take \n$\\1/2\\ billion and rescind it. It does not go toward the debt. It does \nnot go for anything. They just rescind it.\n  Then, of course, the year 2012, they put in an amount of money that \ndoes not go very far with all these disasters, a few weeks' worth. So \nwe will be back having the same fight again, which is so senseless, so \nunnecessary. I would hope the House of Representatives--there will be a \nvote today around 4 or 5 o'clock. I know it will be a close vote. But I \nhope people in the Senate will understand how important this vote is. \nWe are going to have a vote, as we have indicated, on the continuing \nresolution to strip out the mean-spirited amendment they have in it, \ntake it out and put in what has already passed here by a substantial \nmajority.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 642\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, earlier, I sent an amendment to the desk. \nThis amendment will constrain the growth of this domestic spending \nprogram. My amendment is fairly simple. It tightens the nexus between \nTAA benefits and actual jobs lost because of trade. It does this by \nchanging the eligibility criteria from one that only requires that \ntrade ``contribute importantly'' to job loss to a more restrictive \ncriteria that the job loss be ``substantially caused'' by trade.\n\n[[Page S5814]]\n\n  Under the current program, the worker only has to demonstrate that \nimports from or shifts in production to a foreign country--what many \nfolks would call the ordinary course of business--``contributed \nimportantly'' to their job loss.\n  So what does ``contributed importantly'' actually mean? The TAA \nProgram holds that the contributed importantly standard is met if trade \nis a cause, which is important but not necessarily more important than \nany other cause of the job loss.\n  That does not sound like a tight nexus to me, certainly not a tight \nnexus to trade to me. Believe me, these fears are not theoretical. Let \nme give a real-life example. I am sure, by now, everyone is familiar \nwith Solyndra, the now-bankrupt solar firm that was lauded by President \nObama as the poster child for his stimulus and green jobs plans.\n  It turns out, now that Solyndra is in bankruptcy, many of its \nemployees are applying for job-training benefits through TAA. To fully \nunderstand this lunacy, let's take a look at recent history.\n  Here is how Vice President Biden described the administration's ill-\nconsidered plan to direct over one-half billion taxpayer dollars for \nloan guarantees for Solyndra:\n\n       The Recovery Act is working and you're going to see it work \n     right on that site. The loan to Solyndra will allow you to \n     build a new manufacturing facility and with it almost \n     immediately generate 3,000 new well-paying construction jobs. \n     And once your facility opens, there will be about 1,000 \n     permanent new jobs here at Solyndra and in the surrounding \n     business community and hundreds more to install your growing \n     output of solar panels throughout the country.\n\n  Well, that didn't quite happen. Instead, the firm failed, potentially \ntaking over a half billion taxpayer dollars with it. Those ``permanent \nnew jobs''? Well, not quite. The workers are all unemployed because \ntheir ``permanent'' jobs no longer exist.\n  It gets worse. According to the Wall Street Journal, the stimulus \nloans themselves were a major cause of Solyndra's bankruptcy. Here is \nthe headline on the chart: ``Loan Was Solyndra's Undoing.''\n  In selling the half billion dollar loan to Solyndra, Vice President \nBiden made it clear that these were the jobs of the future, saying:\n\n       We are journeying, in a sense, closer and closer to the \n     sun, to a more solar-powered America. And as we do, we're \n     leaving a shadow of a less efficient, more damaging past \n     behind us.\n\n  We all know--or should know--what happened to the arrogant Icarus \nwhen he flew too close to the Sun.\n\n       Despite the Vice President's exhortations, what happened to \n     Solyndra? Solyndra is set to become an even bigger drain on \n     our taxpayers.\n\n  How is that possible? Through the magic of TAA, of course. It turns \nout that the now-unemployed former Solyndra employees have applied for \ntrade adjustment assistance. The irony here is profound. The \nadministration is now considering whether to grant these Solyndra \nworkers TAA benefits because competition from China ``contributed \nimportantly'' to their job loss. That is ridiculous, frankly.\n  Here is another Wall Street Journal article, entitled ``Solyndra Was \nAlways Likely to Fail.'' You can see in the photo what a beautiful \nplant it was--with all of your taxpayer dollars.\n  In a letter to the editor of the Wall Street Journal, the CEO from \nanother solar company--tenKsolar--explained that everyone in the solar \nbusiness knew Solyndra's business model would not work and their solar \ntechnology was too costly.\n  That didn't stop the White House from giving this company a $535 \nmillion taxpayer loan--money that is basically gone now. This was \ndespite the fact that the government's own analysts had predicted \nmonths ago that Solyndra would fail in September. Well, it did.\n  Again, look at the photo of that beautiful building that was built \nwith taxpayer dollars. It is pretty hard to not admire it, to be honest \nwith you.\n  The fact that TAA benefits are even being considered for Solyndra \nshows how tenuous the nexus between job loss and trade can be--and \nworkers can still get these expanded benefits, on top of unemployment \ninsurance.\n  How can Solyndra workers get TAA, when the business collapsed due to \na bad business plan and an ill-conceived loan of taxpayer money? That \nwas the cause of Solyndra going under. China imports, under the current \nTAA program, however, might be construed by ambitious Department of \nLabor bureaucrats to have ``contributed importantly'' to Solyndra \nshutting down--despite the fact that the primary cause was the business \nmodel and the government's intervention.\n  This needs to stop. We can do better. If we are going to continue to \nfund this domestic spending, let's at least make sure its benefits go \nto those workers whose job loss is actually caused by trade. That is \nwhat this amendment will do. It will return the TAA threshold standard \nto the ``substantial cause'' level. It would require that trade would \nhave to be a ``substantial cause'' of the work dislocation. This \nstandard was included in reforms advocated for by President Reagan that \nwere included in the bipartisan Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981. \nThat deficit reduction act included the largest package of spending \ncuts in history--at that time. President Reagan had noted the \nunfairness of treating one class of workers who lose their job due to \nforeign competition better than their neighbor, who lost his job due to \ndomestic competition, so he tightened the threshold criteria to be \neligible for the TAA Program.\n  By returning to the narrower TAA threshold, this amendment would put \nreasonable constraints on the program to prevent it from expanding into \nanother out-of-control spending program.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment because I think it \nmakes sense. There is no question it will save taxpayer dollars and \nmake people act more honestly with regard to the use of taxpayer \ndollars and, in the end, I think it will work better than the current \napproach that my friends on the other side wish to have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                              Disaster Aid\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am here to speak about disaster aid and \nthe acute need we have in my State for assistance to deal with a \ndisaster that occurred earlier this summer in Minot, ND.\n  These are pictures from the valley in Minot, ND. Minot is constructed \non two hills, with a valley in between, with the Souris River flowing \nthrough. We have just had the worst flood ever in history, by a long \nmargin. The Corps of Engineers was in yesterday to see me. They \ncalculate that this was a 430-year flood. A flood of this magnitude \nwould only come every 430 years. Certainly, it is beyond anything we \nhave ever seen in recorded history. They say the volume in this flood \nwas three times the previous record; the volume of water was three \ntimes the previous record.\n  These are just a handful of the homes in Minot that were inundated; \nand 4,000 families lost their homes. These are modest, middle-class \nfamilies, and the homes averaged $160,000 or $170,000 in value. Yet \nthey are devastated, because all they are eligible for is FEMA \nassistance.\n  As the occupant of the chair knows well, FEMA was never designed to \nbe a stand-alone program to recover from disaster. FEMA was designed to \nwork in concert with insurance programs--homeowner's insurance, flood \ninsurance. In this case, with a flood, homeowner's insurance doesn't \nhelp you at all. You get nothing on your homeowner's insurance. Then \nthe burden falls to flood insurance. In this entire town of 40,000 \npeople, there were less than 400 flood insurance policies. Some may \nsay, why didn't they have flood insurance?\n  That is a reasonable question to ask. The answer is very simple: No \none thought they needed flood insurance. Flood insurance was not \nrequired because they were behind a levee that was supposed to protect \nagainst a hundred-year flood event, and actually something more than \nthat. In addition, new dams, since the last major flood, have been \nbuilt in Canada to prevent such flooding--dams that were, in part, paid \nfor by the United States.\n\n  There was no reason for people to believe they needed flood \ninsurance. As a result, very few had it. The bottom line is that the \nmost these people, who have had their homes destroyed, can get--and \nbelieve me, these homes are destroyed. Most of the 4,000 families who\n\n[[Page S5815]]\n\nlost their homes had 10 feet of water on their homes for weeks. I have \nbeen there. I have seen these homes, and I have smelled them. It is \nhorrific. To restore these homes, you have to take them down to the \nstuds and start over again--with $30,000 at the most.\n  If you are a young couple starting out, and you have a $170,000 home \nand a $140,000 mortgage, and the house is destroyed, and it costs \n$140,000 to rebuild, and you have $30,000, you have a big problem. \nMaybe you are like my cousin and her family, who had just sold their \nhome, and then it was flooded--but it flooded before closing. So guess \nwhat. They had gone and bought a new home because they sold their \nexisting home. Then their existing home was flooded and, of course, the \nperson never goes to closing. So now they have two homes, two \nmortgages. This is a neighborhood of middle-class and lower middle-\nclass families. They are devastated.\n  The question is, are we going to help? In the past, we have. In \nKatrina, we not only provided FEMA disaster funding, we also provided \nCDBG additional emergency funding. That is precisely what we did in the \n1997 flood in Grand Forks, ND, a 500-year flood. We provided additional \nCDBG funding. For that town alone, we provided over $170 million of \nCDBG emergency funding to help deal with the catastrophic situation \nthere. We have provided much more than that to Katrina victims.\n  What we are asking here is not unprecedented, and it is not something \nthat hasn't been done before. It is absolutely needed.\n  This is the headline from the Fargo Forum, the biggest newspaper in \nour State, about what is happening in Minot, ND: ``11,000 People Forced \nOut of Their Homes.'' It may not sound like many in a State such as \nCalifornia or New York, but in North Dakota that is one-sixtieth of the \nentire State's population. That is over a quarter of the population of \nthis city, Minot, ND. ``The Rising Souris Moves Up Evacuation Time.'' \nEleven thousand people were forced out of their homes. When they came \nback, they found an absolutely unmitigated disaster.\n  This ran in the Minot Daily News this year: ``Projection: \nDevastation. Minot Residents Evacuate as Historic Rise in Souris River \nApproaches.''\n  This shows some of the preparation. The people tried to get out of \ntown and out of these homes before it hit.\n  Then we have this headline from June 21: ``It's a Sad Day.'' It is a \nsad day because the crest was increased, in 48 hours, by 10 feet. In \nother words, the city was protected to a certain level, and then Canada \nlost control of their major reservoir. Their Premier told our Governor \nthat the floodgates are wide open, there is a wall of water coming your \nway. Indeed there was. They increased, in a 48-hour period, the \nprojection of how high water levels would be by 10 feet.\n  There is no way humanly possible to build up defenses by 10 feet in \n48 hours. It cannot happen. There is no possible way. With miles and \nmiles of levees, can you imagine trying to build that up 10 feet in \njust a matter of hours? It was a sad day, Mr. President.\n  Here is the result--massive flooding, flooding that represented an \nunusual flood in the sense that usually when you have a flood, the \nwater comes and goes. In this case, the water came and the water \nstayed.\n  This is downtown Minot, ND. This is home, by the way, to one of the \ntwo Air Force bases that are home to the Nation's B-52s. It is also the \nhome to 150 Minute Men III missiles, which are an important part of the \ndeterrence of the United States.\n  You can see that this downtown area was devastated by floodwaters. \nThe flood came--and stayed and stayed and stayed and stayed. Here you \ncan see rooftops, in a picture taken by Brett Miller of the North \nDakota National Guard while flying over Minot, ND. I have been to the \nschools that have been flooded, and two of them were absolutely \ndestroyed. They have to be rebuilt. You can't possibly rehab them in \nany kind of cost-effective way.\n  In many cases, all you see are roofs here, because a majority of the \n4,000 homes that were destroyed had 10 feet of water on them. For weeks \nand weeks, many of these homes had 6 to 10 feet of water on them. \nAnybody who knows what water can do when it sits and is there for \nweeks. When you come back, you have mold everywhere. The only possible \nway to get it out is to take the house down to its studs.\n  Mr. President, let me just close on this photo from June 24 of this \nyear. Again, the Minot Daily News headline: ``Swamped.'' Indeed, we \nwere absolutely swamped. Water starts to inundate the valley. ``The \nCorps Says Souris Flows to Double by Saturday.'' These are the \nheadlines people were coping with in Minot, ND.\n  This devastation will not be addressed for months to come. People are \nalready moving in to temporary FEMA trailers. Those FEMA trailers--\nwhich are welcome because without them people would have no shelter--it \nshould be understood, are going to be tough to live in during a North \nDakota winter. The people living in those trailers are going to have a \ntough time in a North Dakota winter. So we need help.\n  Yes, we need to replenish the FEMA fund, absolutely. But more than \nthat, we desperately need additional emergency CDBG funding. That is \nwhat was used effectively for Katrina, and that was used effectively in \nthe horrible flood that hit Grand Forks, ND, 1997. So we are asking our \ncolleagues to do what we have done for them in disaster after disaster. \nWe stood with them, we joined with them, we supported them, and we are \nasking that for our people at this time.\n  Senator Hoeven and I have an amendment for $1 billion of CDBG \nfunding. We have a markup occurring in the Appropriations Committee \nthis afternoon, and I understand they are going to agree to $400 \nmillion. But that is nationwide. The need in North Dakota alone is $235 \nmillion, according to our State's Governor. The need for emergency CDBG \nfunding in my State alone is $235 million, and the Appropriations \nCommittee is about to agree to a level of funding nationwide of $400 \nmillion.\n  Mr. President, there is a chasm--a chasm--between the need and the \nresources available. We are going to have to do better than this, or \nthese 4,000 families in North Dakota who have had their homes destroyed \nare going to have a pretty miserable Christmas and a pretty miserable \nnew year. We are better than that. We have proven so repeatedly. I hope \nwe are able to prove it again.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we charge \ntime during the quorum call equally between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair, and again I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I will be speaking \nto in just a moment.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial in the Arizona \nRepublic from September 21, by Robert Robb, the subject of which is \nPresident Obama's debt-cutting plan fails to tell the whole story, be \ninserted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the amendment I will be talking about has \nbeen filed. It is amendment No. 645. But before I describe that \namendment--which I believe and hope we will be able to vote on when we \nhave our series of votes later on this afternoon--I want to respond to \none thing the leader said in his remarks after lunch.\n  He was talking about the continuing resolution, which we believe will \nbe coming over from the House of Representatives later on today. That \ncontinuing resolution, of course, has funding for the various disasters \nwhich\n\n[[Page S5816]]\n\nhave befallen various parts of our country.\n  I think the leader has indicated that he is going to be attempting to \namend that House product with an increase in that spending. He asked \nthe question rather rhetorically: Why aren't those Senators who have \ndisasters in their States willing to vote for my increased spending \namendment? Then he answered his own question, saying it is all \npolitics.\n  Mr. President, first of all, as you know, we are not supposed to ever \nquestion the motives of fellow Senators. I am sure that isn't what the \nleader had in mind, but I would suggest to the leader it is not \npolitics that causes people to vote against his amendment. If it were \npolitics, they would be voting for his amendment. Those Members who \nhave disasters in their States would say, surely, they want even more \nmoney so they can be sure to cover all those disasters. So if it were \npolitics, they would probably be voting yes.\n  I suggest the reason they are voting no is because of principle. \nFirst of all, because there is plenty of money in the House continuing \nresolution to cover all of the disasters that have already occurred and \nthose that could be anticipated over the course of the next 7 or 8 \nweeks, which is the period of time covered by the bill; and, secondly, \nwe should never spend more money than necessary. I will stand corrected \nif I am wrong, but I do not believe the majority leader's amendment has \na calculation of why all of the money he proposes is necessary based \nupon emergencies or disasters that have occurred.\n  So I just wanted to make sure my colleagues appreciate if and when \nsuch a vote occurs, at least for those people with whom I have spoken, \nthey are going to be voting on principle and on the fact there is \nplenty of money for disasters. There is no reason to put in more money \nthan is needed, especially in our time of a very difficult deficit \nsituation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From Real Clear Politics, Sept. 21, 2011]\n\n                   Obama's Duplicitous Debt Proposal\n\n                            (By Robert Robb)\n\n       President Barack Obama's debt reduction plan could be \n     titled, The Audacity of Duplicity.\n       According to Obama, he is proposing $4 trillion in debt \n     reduction over the next 10 years, with there being $2 in \n     spending cuts for every $1 in tax increases.\n       Where to begin?\n       Half of the president's claimed debt reduction comes from \n     policies already in place. Obama says $1 trillion will be \n     saved by winding down the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In \n     other words, Obama wants credit for reducing debt that was \n     never going to be incurred.\n       Another $1 trillion is from the agreement that was reached \n     to increase the debt ceiling. But that agreement didn't \n     really reduce the debt by $1 trillion. It simply adopted \n     future spending caps that would have that effect. However, \n     there were no new laws adopted that would actually reduce \n     spending. The caps are unenforceable promises to do something \n     unspecific in the future.\n       Obama is actually only proposing $2.1 trillion in new \n     stuff. Of that, nearly $1.6 trillion is increased taxes. So, \n     he's actually proposing $3 in tax increases for every $1 in \n     spending cuts.\n       But that still doesn't tell the real story. The ``spending \n     cuts'' aren't really all spending cuts. They are just things \n     other than tax increases, and there's over $135 billion in \n     fee increases. Those may be warranted, but they aren't \n     spending cuts.\n       So, Obama actually is proposing over $1.7 trillion in \n     additional federal revenue, making the ratio $4 in increased \n     taxes and fees for every $1 in spending cuts.\n       But that still doesn't tell the whole story. Obama, of \n     course, is purposing increased stimulus spending now. Net, \n     Obama is only proposing to decrease actual federal spending \n     by about $245 billion over 10 years. So, the real ratio is $7 \n     in increased taxes and fees for every $1 in actual spending \n     cuts.\n       In short, Obama has proposed a massive tax increase while \n     doing very little to control federal spending.\n       The bulk of the tax increases, $1.2 trillion, fall on \n     individuals making over $200,000 a year. Supposedly, their \n     tax treatment would only be returned to the levels prevailing \n     during the Clinton prosperity, but that's another bit of \n     duplicity.\n       Obama proposes that the top two tax rates be returned to \n     Clinton-era levels, but doesn't stop there. He would also \n     limit the deductions they take, which wasn't the case during \n     the Clinton bliss. And his health care bill already socked \n     this group with an increase in payroll taxes of nearly 1 \n     percent on wage income and an investment income tax increase \n     of nearly 4 percent.\n       In short, Obama is advocating tax rates for those earning \n     more than $200,000 a year much higher than the Clinton-era \n     rates, which Bill Clinton himself described as too high.\n       This is supposedly so millionaires and billionaires pay \n     their fair share. According to the Tax Policy Center, the top \n     1 percent of tax filers has 16 percent of the country's \n     income, but pay 24 percent of all federal taxes and 35 \n     percent of federal individual income taxes.\n       According to Obama mythology, millionaires and billionaires \n     pay lower tax rates than average Jacks and Jills. According \n     to the Tax Policy Center, the top 1 percent pays 18 percent \n     of their income in federal income taxes. The middle quintile \n     pays less than 3 percent. Those below that actually get more \n     money back than they pay in.\n       Obama seems really worked up over the fact that investment \n     income is taxed at a lower rate than wage income. But that's \n     not really the case. Dividends are taxed at the corporate \n     level before they are distributed to individuals, when they \n     are taxed again. Capital gains are taxed on their nominal \n     value, ignoring the effect of intervening inflation.\n       If Obama were truly interested in a bipartisan down payment \n     on debt reduction, he could have anchored his proposal in the \n     recommendations of his debt commission. The debt commission, \n     however, recommended about half of what Obama proposes in \n     additional federal revenue and raised in a way that lowers \n     rates across the board, including for millionaires and \n     billionaires.\n       Obama's interests, however, clearly lie elsewhere.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 645 to Amendment No. 633\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the amendment, as I said, is numbered 645, \nand I will be discussing the contents of the amendment and why I think \nit should be addressed. But let me precede that with this point.\n  I think the bill before us, the TAA bill, actually deserved greater \nscrutiny than the process allowed. There was an opportunity for some \nmore fundamental changes in the TAA Program than occurred. The only \nchanges are pretty rudimentary, and I don't think anyone can contend \nthey will save substantial amounts of money or represent fundamental \nreform. The process of putting this all together was by people who \nsupported TAA, not people like me who have a real problem with TAA. So \nit is probably no surprise the program isn't substantially reformed.\n  Specifically, on the TAA training, which is part of what I am \nfocusing on, no work was done to reform the training funding to reflect \nthe fact there are already over 40 programs dedicated to worker \ntraining. One of our colleagues, Senator Coburn, has done some great \nwork in this area to highlight the problem. Instead, the substitute \njust increases overall training funding and does very minimal reform.\n  More broadly, there is little evidence the TAA programs are actually \neffective. That is what I will speak to with regard to the piece I will \nbe eliminating, hopefully, with the amendment I am proposing. We are \ngoing to spend over $1 billion on the so-called enhanced TAA provisions \nin the substitute and another $7 billion on the baseline program. So $1 \nbillion on the enhanced provisions, $7 billion on the baseline program, \nand we don't even know whether it actually helps our citizens.\n  I have filed other amendments that I may or may not bring up, \ndepending upon what our schedule is, but at a minimum I hope the word \nof the TAA supporters can be relied upon as we move forward. For \nexample, the substitute is intended to terminate baseline TAA after \n2014. But due to CBO scorekeeping, CBO estimates that Congress could \nactually spend another $7.4 billion for the years 2015 to 2021--years \nafter all the TAA is scheduled to be terminated. So I plan to work with \nthe CBO to ensure these savings are actually extracted from the \nbaseline.\n  This amendment I speak of repeals the TAA for the Firms Program. It \nwould repeal that as of October 1, 2011--in other words, the end of the \nfiscal year. The amendment would only save about $16 million a year, \nbut I think it serves as a test of one's real commitment to reform. I \npropose eliminating this small piece of the TAA that President Barack \nObama proposed be eliminated in his budget.\n  The President's budget recommendations for this year specifically \nrecommend termination of the TAA for Firms Program, and I thought--\nsince we have all talked about how our constituents keep telling us \nthey want us to come back and work together to get things done--here is \nan opportunity where a Democratic President and a Republican Senator \nhave proposed something, and it is an opportunity for colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to get together and say, yes, there is at least \none program--it is a small one,\n\n[[Page S5817]]\n\n$16 million--that ought to be eliminated.\n  What are the reasons for the President's request this program be \ndropped? According to his ``Termination, Reductions and Savings''--this \nwas submitted as part of the fiscal year 2012 Federal budget--the first \npoint is the resources would be better spent elsewhere. Here is what \nthe President's budget says:\n\n       The administration believes it is more effective to direct \n     EDA's funding towards programs that make investments to \n     promote globally competitive regions, rather than to assist \n     specific firms that have been harmed by trade.\n\n  The budget also made the point the centers are too expensive and they \nare poorly selected. Here is what the President's budget said:\n\n       The non-profit Trade Adjustment Centers that administer the \n     program are chosen non-competitively and have high overhead \n     rates.\n\n  So the first point is the President's budget says: Let's get rid of \nthis program. It is not run well, and it is not centered properly on \nwhere we should be centered. The second reason for elimination of this \nproposal is the EDA's own budget request to Congress for fiscal year \n2012 clearly shows other programs are more effective and less costly \nthan this program--TAA for Firms--and I will quote them directly:\n\n       The Economic Adjustment Assistance program, which is the \n     most flexible tool in EDA's toolbox and provides a wide range \n     of technical, planning, and public works and infrastructure \n     assistance and can get money out more quickly and with far \n     lower overhead costs, meaning more help for the communities \n     that need it.\n\n  The third reason I propose eliminating this small program is the TAA \nfor Firms Program doesn't require any kind of significant trade impact \nfor eligibility. In fact, according to the program's own Web site that \noutlines frequently asked questions, here is what it says:\n\n       Question: Are only firms seriously affected by imports able \n     to participate? Answer: No. We work with a variety of \n     manufacturers and, for some, imports represent only a minor \n     challenge. Regardless of the degree of impact, a firm may be \n     eligible if it experienced sales and employment declines at \n     least partially due to imports over the last two years.\n\n  So that is the third problem. The fourth problem: Obviously, there \nare always bound to be some success stories, but the program's 2010 \nannual report raises serious questions about its effectiveness. For \nexample, this annual report--by the way, it was required by the \nstimulus bill--highlights that only 56 percent of firms in 2010 \nactually completed the program. That means a whopping 44 percent quit \nfor various reasons.\n  The annual report also shows that firms that started the program in \n2008 had little marketed success. After 1 year, firms that completed \nthe program had average employment decrease by 10 percent and an \naverage productivity increase of 11 percent, which is only slightly \nbetter than the Bureau of Labor Statistics' national average for the \nmanufacturing industry of a decrease in employment of 13 percent and an \nincrease in productivity of 4 percent. After 2 years, program \ngraduates' average employment dropped by 16 percent and average \nproductivity increased by 3 percent, while the national average for \nmanufacturing firms saw employment drop only 12 percent and average \nproductivity increase by 6 percent. In other words, after 2 years, \nfirms not in the program were doing better than firms in the program \ndespite all the money we are spending on it.\n  The fifth reason. While it is just authorization language here, \nrepeal does save money. The TAA for firms centers will close and their \nemployees will be reassigned.\n  We have to reduce the cost and reach of government if we are going to \nprevent fiscal collapse, and that is the primary reason I am focused on \nthis program. It is not a huge amount of money. Under the substitute, \nthe program would be continued at 2002 levels or, in other words, about \n$16 million a year. But that is money we don't have to spend, as the \nPresident's own budget said, because this program doesn't work well and \nin effect, as I am saying, wastes taxpayer money.\n  So if we can't eliminate a program such as this--a program the \nadministration wants to terminate, one EDA says could be done better \nwith other programs, that doesn't require any great connection or \nimpact by trade imports, that has a questionable track record with high \nfailure rates and outcomes at least no better than firms that don't \nparticipate--then I am greatly discouraged about the Senate's ability \nto effect any kind of actual reform.\n  I urge my colleagues' attention to this. I know some will say we \ncan't make any amendment to this whatsoever or it won't be accepted by \nthe House. You ask my House colleagues whether they would support this \namendment. My guess is they would say they would be happy to support \nthis amendment. I hope we will be able to vote for it this afternoon \nand that my colleagues will support amendment No. 645.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be made \npending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. KYL] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 645 to amendment No. 633.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor and join \nmy colleagues who were here just a few minutes ago talking about the \nimportance of robust funding and immediate funding for disaster relief \nin our country.\n  Leader Reid came to the floor to explain the importance of this \nissue, followed by the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, who has \nhelped lead portions of his State back literally from the brink of \ndestruction several times. So when a Member like Senator Conrad speaks, \nwe really should listen. He has been through--excuse me--hell and back \nin parts of his State, and he really does understand what is at stake, \nand some Members who think they know about disasters and have not \nreally quite experienced them in their State would be well advised to \nlisten to his plea to get this done right now.\n  I wish to address three specific statements that have been made on \nthe floor of the Senate by my friends on the other side of the aisle \nthat are, with all due respect, patently false.\n  Leader McConnell came to the floor either last night or this \nmorning--because it was reported in the Washington Post--and said we \ndon't have to worry because Congress always does what is appropriate \nwhen it comes to disasters.\n  I don't even know where to begin to say how false that statement is. \nAnd I know the leader didn't mean to mislead anyone; he just made a \ncomment: We don't have to worry about this; we always do the right \nthing. I was there for Katrina and Rita. This Congress did not always \ndo the right thing. There are still things Congress should have done in \nthe aftermath of Katrina and Rita that have not yet been done, and \nthere is a whole list of things that were done by this Congress but 2 \nyears too late or 3 years too late. So let me be very clear with people \nfollowing this debate. Congress does not always do the right thing when \nit comes to disasters, and we are about ready to make another mistake, \nand it is so unnecessary and so unfortunate.\n  No. 2, there is a disagreement going on about whether this is \npolitics or principle. And I know our side has said and we believe \nthere has to be politics involved because there is no other reason to \nexplain why the House Republican leadership continues to throw a wrench \ninto this when it is completely unnecessary. What is the principle they \nare fighting for, if it is a principle? The only principle I can think \nof is the principle of, when things are going smoothly, blow it up, \nbecause that is what they are doing.\n  What do I mean by that? Let me take a minute to explain. As the \nRepublican House leadership knows full well, the Senate and the House \nhave already agreed--we agreed 30 days ago. Before Hurricane Irene, \nbefore Tropical Storm Lee, before these storms ever happened, the \nRepublican and Democratic leadership agreed, in the big fight we had \nover the whole meltdown--not of the government but of the shutdown, \nalmost, of the economy--we remember that, Mr. President, don't we, that \nbig fight we had--in that negotiation, the leadership of both Houses, \nRepublicans\n\n[[Page S5818]]\n\nand Democrats, already agreed--in anticipation that we would be running \nshort of FEMA money because we have been running short of FEMA money \nnow for 8 months, in anticipation of that, they said in that agreement: \nWe are going to carve out an $11 billion approximate pot of money or \ncap adjustment so that when we come to ask for disaster aid, we won't \nhave to fight again.\n  Why do we like to fight so much? I mean, I can fight, I do fight, but \nI choose not to. What is the principle the House Republicans are \nfighting for? It must be ``when things are going smoothly, let's blow \nit up.'' That is why I am so frustrated. It is an unnecessary fight to \nbe having. Again, we have already made provision for $11 billion. So \nthe leader puts in $6.9 billion--well within the range of this $11 \nbillion allowance--and lo and behold the House leadership says: \nAbsolutely not. We are not doing that. We are not even going to \nconsider the $6.9 billion. What we are going to do is just continue \nlast year's level of funding, which was inadequate then. That is why we \nhave run out of it.\n  So they are going to take the inadequate level we had last year \nbefore all these storms happened and extend it for 6 weeks and claim \nvictory and then come back after the fact and require, for one of the \nfirst times--not the first time in history but one of the few times in \nhistory--to then grab back and say: To finish the disaster money for \n2011, you have to go gut a program that is very important to some \nMembers--more important to some than others but an important program.\n  The House is insisting that we gut $1.5 billion of a program that is \ncreating jobs in Michigan and other parts of the country. So why are we \ndestroying jobs when we don't have to? Again, it must be the principle \nof, when things are going smoothly, when things are working, when the \nleadership has actually agreed, the House Republican leadership will \njust throw a wrench and really mess things up.\n  Thank goodness there are 10 Republican Senators in this Chamber who \ndon't follow that principle of throwing a wrench when things are going \nsmoothly. They follow the principle of common sense and compassion and \nbeing forward-leaning when it comes to helping Americans who need our \nhelp. Senator Blunt, Senator Rubio, Senator Snowe, Senator Collins, \nSenator Murkowski, Senator Brown from Massachusetts, Senator Heller \nfrom Nevada, Senator Hoeven from North Dakota, Senator Toomey from \nPennsylvania, and Senator Vitter from Louisiana--many of them have \nexperienced disasters in their States in the past and remember those \nterrible days or they are experiencing them now, and they said: We \ndon't follow the ``throw the wrench in the gears'' principle. We are \ngoing to follow the ``let's get it done'' principle. Let's get the work \ndone. Let's move forward. Let's stop fighting. Let's provide immediate \nand robust funding to help our communities.\n\n  So they voted across party lines. I have done that before. I have \nbeen elected now three times. I mean, you can sometimes cross party \nlines to do the right thing, find middle ground. So they did. They \nfound middle ground, and we came up with the $6.9 billion package.\n  Now, let me say, to answer specifically the Senator from Arizona, for \nwhom I have a lot of respect, we did not pull this sum out of the air. \nThis $6.9 billion, which is much more robust than the $2.6 billion the \nHouse wants to provide, is a much more accurate estimate based on \nactual numbers given to the Appropriations Committee, which is the \ncommittee of authority here, by the agencies that are in charge of the \ndisasters, from Agriculture, from the Corps of Engineers. So our \nnumber, the 6.9 that is being ridiculed as just being pulled out of the \nair--no, contraire--it was given to us by the agencies. The number that \ncame from absolutely nowhere, that has no bearing on any sense of \nreality today, is the number the House pulled up, which is last year's \nnumber, which was the estimate before the storms even hit. So if you \nwant to argue which number is more accurate, please put your money on \nour number because you will lose this bet.\n  Our number is based on actual estimates that have already been made \nof disasters that have already occurred. In fact, it doesn't even--our \nnumber--because we don't have the estimates in, we don't even have the \nestimates yet for Tropical Storm Lee or for Irene. It was too early. It \ntakes a while for these numbers. So when I say the 6.9 is much better \nthan the 2.6 and more accurate, that is true. Is it the real, actual \nnumber that might take us through next year? Even I can't say that and \nI am the chairman of the committee. I have more information than \nanybody in here on this. But I can tell you one thing: It is much \nbetter than 2.65, it is much more accurate, and at least it is based on \nrealistic estimates.\n  So when people on my side say: We don't even understand what the \nRepublicans in the House are fighting about, it is the truth. They \npicked a fight they didn't need to pick. They are arguing over \nsomething that was already decided. They are rejecting their own \ngovernment estimates of what these disasters cost because of what? On \nprinciple? What is the principle? The only thing I can think of--and I \nhave said it five times, and I am going to say it six--it must be the \nprinciple of, let's throw a wrench when things are working well, and I \nthink the American people are tired of it. It is exhausting.\n  So we now have projects--I would like to show the projects that are \nstopped. We have a list that is literally too thick to put into the \nRecord, and I am not going to ask for it to be put in the Record \nbecause somebody will have to stay here for days and type it in, and I \nam not going to ask the clerks to do that. But I am going to hold it up \nso people can see. These are pages and pages of projects that are \nstopped right now.\n  I want to say directly to the House Member from Alabama, Mr. \nAderholt, who is the chairman, my counterpart, there are pages of \nprojects here in Alabama, in his own district, that are stopped, and he \nis not helping by supporting last year's numbers for this year's \ndisasters. I hope he will rethink and start arguing not for his party \nbut for his State. Sometimes we have to put our parties aside and fight \nhard for our districts and our State. I have done that before. I think \nit is the right way to do it.\n\n  These are pages and pages of projects that have been stopped. They \nare finished. They are not finished forever, we hope, but they are \nstopped--roads, libraries, bridges. Talk about jobs, most of these are \ndone by small businesses, as we know. There is not any government \nagency that swoops in to do these projects in small towns. They are \nlocal contractors that get contracts with FEMA or the Corps of \nEngineers for the work. They are issuing pink slips for these projects \nright now. One would think that would motivate people. If compassion \ndoesn't motivate them, if the morality of the situation doesn't \nmotivate them, maybe thousands of jobs would motivate them. It seems \nnone of those are working. I am running out of enticements.\n  All these projects have been stopped. Will the $2.6 billion the House \nis offering start these projects again? Yes, it will--their offer they \nput on the table, that they are pushing us to accept, against which we \nare fighting hard. We do not want to accept it, but we will not shut \nthe government down over this. We are pushing back as hard as we can \nwithout shutting the government down because over there they keep \nholding the economy hostage, then holding the government hostage. But I \nam saying, yes, these projects will get started again. They will go for \n6 weeks, and then we will be back where we are right now, which is no \nplace.\n  When we have a chance to fix a problem, there is already an agreement \nit should be fixed, already the leadership has agreed how to fix it, \nand there is an allocation of the money set aside--we still cannot do \nit? Why? Because we want to come back in 6 weeks and have this fight \nagain? How much time is wasted.\n  Do you know what Tom Ridge said about this--a Republican, the first \nguy who ran Homeland Security, the first Secretary? He said:\n\n       Never in the history of the country have we worried about \n     the budget around emergency appropriations for natural \n     disasters and, frankly, in my view, we should not be worried \n     about it now . . . we are all in this as a country. And when \n     Mother Nature devastates a community we may need emergency \n     appropriations and we ought to just deal with it and then \n     deal with the fiscal issues later on.\n\n\n[[Page S5819]]\n\n\n  That is a former Secretary of the department that was in charge of \nthis.\n  Governor Christie, I spoke with him yesterday on the phone. He said \nlast week:\n\n       You want to figure out budget cuts, that's fine . . . you \n     expect the citizens of my State to wait? They are not going \n     to wait, and I am going to fight to make sure they don't do \n     it. Our people are suffering now and they need support now. \n     We need the support now here in New Jersey. This is not a \n     Republican or Democratic issue.\n\n  That is from Gov. Chris Christie, a very popular Republican, I might \nsay.\n  Then Gov. Bob McDowell, from Virginia, another Republican:\n\n       My concern is that we help people in need. For the FEMA \n     money, that's going to flow, it's up to them how they get it. \n     I don't think it's the time to get into that (deficit) \n     debate.\n\n  Why are we fighting over this? Why does the House Republican \nleadership think last year's number that was inadequate last year is \ngood enough for this year when, as my staff just reminded me, we have \nhad 10 disasters, each one over $1 billion this last year? This is \nMother Nature. This wasn't caused by some conspiracy of the Democratic \nParty; this is just what happened. Why do they want people to have to \nworry whether help will be there when we can so easily fix this? On \nwhat principle are they standing? It cannot be fiscal responsibility; \nit is already provided for in the budget.\n  If this is conservatism, I don't think America likes that. I don't \nthink they will accept that. It is not their vision of conservatism, it \nis their vision of foolishness.\n  I also think, as Patrick Leahy, Senator from Vermont, has said many \ntimes, many people are starting to think, why is it some people in \nCongress rush out to fund programs in Afghanistan and Iraq and never \nwanted to debate when we went to war how we were going to pay for that. \nWe literally did it in 30 days. Nobody even questioned how we were \ngoing to pay for it--literally. I was here. Maybe a few people raised \nthe issue this is going to be expensive, but nobody on the other side \ndid--to go to war, twice. Yet after a hurricane, a tornado, we now have \nto have a knock-down, drag-out, full-fledged debate on how we are going \nto pay for every single penny before we can give a green light to these \nGovernors and mayors and county commissioners. I think it is \noutrageous, it is unnecessary, and it is so terribly unfair.\n  I don't know what is going to happen because we sent a bill over to \nthe House that has $6.9 billion. It, as I said, may not be enough, but \nit is much better than $2.65 from last year that was not sufficient \nthen. We sent a bill over. It is a stand-alone bill. The House, if they \ndo not think the number--if they think the number is too high, take it \ndown a little bit or tell us they do not think this item is worth \nfunding--say something. We could negotiate on that number. It is not \nwritten in the scripture, but it is the best estimate we had of what we \nactually need right now.\n  No, they will not even look at the bill. They just send us $2.6 \nbillion on a continuing resolution. So, basically, Senate, take our \nold, tired, inadequate number and we are going to go home and then you \ncan shut the Government down if you don't like it. What kind of way is \nthat to treat disaster victims? It is no way at all.\n  Senator Hagan just told me--she got out of a meeting today--some of \nher people are living literally in tents. I know, when I went down to \nCameron Parish, some of my people were sleeping in the open air, on \nconcrete. I know what these scenes are. They roll in my head. \nUnfortunately, I have lots of memories about people sleeping on the \nstreet, 500 people sleeping under an overpass waiting for the Federal \nGovernment or the State or local government to set up a trailer or \nrental unit.\n  Again, if we did not have the provision for this already decided, if \nthis was not the way we had operated in the past, I could understand \nit, but everything moves us: the agreement that has already been \nraised, the precedent of history, the accurate estimates of disaster. \nYet the Republicans want to fight about it. I think it is a bad fight \nfor them to have, let me just say. It is a shame. But we are going to \ndo our best to get immediate and full funding, and if we cannot, we \nwill be back in 6 weeks talking about it again, which is very \nunfortunate because we cannot rebuild Tuscaloosa, AL, and Joplin, MO, \nand parts of North Dakota, Minot, ND, and small towns in Alaska and \nAlabama 6 weeks at a time. We cannot do it. When we have the money, we \nhave the provision, we have history and precedent on our side and the \nneed is so great for the Republican leadership to throw a wrench just \nbecause they like to keep things stirred up, it is a shame.\n  That is where we are. We are going to do our best. This is what \nRepublican leaders say. This is what the pictures look like on the \nground. When it is not on CNN every night, people don't think it is \ntruly happening, but the fact is the fires are burning, there is rubble \nin town that looks like this, the water may have receded from this \nparticular farm, but the damage is still there. The water I am sure has \nreceded from this scene, but this family is still wandering around \ntheir lot looking for spoons and forks and things that might remind \nthem of what they once had, and Republicans have decided, for whatever \nreason, to throw a wrench in this whole thing and make a big fight, \nwhen it is absolutely not necessary.\n  We are going to keep working and see what we can do to bring relief \nto a lot of this misery.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Constitution Day And Justice Antonin Scalia\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, September 17 was an anniversary with double \nsignificance for our country. On September 17, 1787, delegates to the \nConstitutional Convention in Philadelphia held their final meeting and \nsigned the Constitution they had crafted. And on September 17, 1986, \nthis body voted unanimously to confirm Justice Antonin Scalia's \nappointment to the Supreme Court of the United States. Today, 25 years \nlater, he is the senior member of the Court.\n  These two events are profoundly related because Justice Scalia is \nliterally helping us rediscover the real Constitution. His approach to \ndoing the work of judges is helping us to rediscover the Constitution \nthat America's Founders gave us--the Constitution that is powerful and \nsolid; the Constitution that belongs to the people, protects our \nrights, limits government, and makes liberty possible.\n  Antonin Scalia was born in Trenton, NJ, on March 11, 1936. After \ngraduating first in his high school class, valedictorian from \nGeorgetown University, and magna cum laude from Harvard Law School, he \nembarked on a legal career that would include stints in private \npractice, government service, the legal academy, and, finally, the \njudiciary.\n  President Reagan nominated then-Professor Scalia to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit in July 1982. He appeared before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee on August 4, 1982--another date with \nconstitutional significance. The hearing began just minutes after the \nSenate voted 69 to 31 to approve a balanced budget constitutional \namendment, the only time this body has done so, at least so far. I was \nan original cosponsor of that amendment. I mention that because Justice \nScalia's approach to the Constitution means that the people, and the \npeople alone, have authority to change it through the amendment process \noutlined in the Constitution. The Senate's vote on that balanced budget \namendment was part of that process.\n  Professor Scalia told the Judiciary Committee that, if he were \nappointed to the bench, his days of being able to comment on the wisdom \nof laws enacted by Congress would be ``bygone days.'' The sense that \njudges are doing something fundamentally different than private \ncitizens, fundamentally different than legislators, defines his \njudicial philosophy.\n  The same theme dominated his confirmation hearing 4 years later, when \nPresident Reagan nominated Judge Scalia to be an Associate Justice of \nthe Supreme Court. As that hearing opened, I quoted from the Chicago \nTribune that the nominee was determined ``to read the law as it has \nbeen\n\n[[Page S5820]]\n\nenacted by the people's representatives rather than to impose his own \npreference upon it.''\n  When Justice Scalia took the oath of judicial office, President \nReagan said that the judiciary must be independent and strong but \nconfined within the boundaries of a written constitution.\n  Public officials must swear to uphold and defend this written \nConstitution. It declares itself to be the supreme law of the land. \nMore than 90 percent of Americans say it is very important to them. But \nwhat exactly is it and what are judges supposed to do with it? The \nanswer to that question defines Justice Scalia's career and its lasting \nimpact on all of us.\n  The Constitution is a document, the oldest written charter of \ngovernment in the history of the world. Professor Steven Calabresi, who \nteaches at Northwestern University Law School and once clerked for \nJustice Scalia, writes that when Americans think of liberty, they think \nof documents, especially of the Constitution.\n  Three statements at the turn of the 19th century tell us what we need \nto know. First, the Supreme Court, in 1795, literally asked the same \nquestion: What is the Constitution? Here is their answer:\n\n       The Constitution is fixed and certain; it contains the \n     permanent will of the people, and is the supreme law of the \n     land; it is paramount to the power of the legislature, and \n     can be revoked or altered only by the authority that made it.\n\n  Second, President George Washington echoed this theme a year later in \nhis Farewell Address. He said:\n\n       The basis of our political systems is the right of the \n     people to make and to alter their constitutions of \n     government. But the Constitution which at any time exists, \n     till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole \n     people, is sacredly obligatory upon all.\n\n  Third, the Supreme Court, in its 1803 decision Marbury v. Madison, \nwrote that through the Constitution, the people established certain \nlimits for the Federal Government.\n\n       [A]nd that those limits may not be mistaken or forgotten, \n     the Constitution is written.\n\n  There you have it. The Constitution is the means by which the people \nexpress their will and set limits on the government. The people alone \nhave authority to change the Constitution and, until they do, it is \nfixed and certain. One obvious way to alter the Constitution is to \nchange its words. But a more subtle, and even more effective, way to \nalter the Constitution is to change its meaning. Words themselves are \njust the form, but the meaning of those words is the substance. The \nreal Constitution is its words and their meaning together. Whoever \ncontrols the meaning of the Constitution controls the Constitution \nitself. When we say that only the people may alter the Constitution, \nthat simply must mean that only the people can change the words or \ntheir meaning. For the Constitution to be what it is supposed to be, \nboth its words and their meaning must remain fixed and certain until \nthe people choose to change them.\n  Justice Scalia delivered the 1997 Wriston Lecture at the Manhattan \nInstitute. Its title was simply ``On Interpreting the Constitution.'' \nHe described his topic as ``what in the world we think we're doing when \nwe interpret the Constitution of the United States.'' This is why it is \nso important to clarify what the Constitution is in the first place, so \nwe know what judges are supposed to do with it.\n  Justice Scalia believes the only proper way to interpret the \nConstitution is to find the meaning it already has, the meaning given \nto the Constitution by the people who alone had authority to establish \nit. Justice Scalia calls this approach originalism.\n  In his Wriston Lecture, he said that the Constitution ``means what it \nmeant when it was written.'' No one is more candid than Justice Scalia \nthat this approach is not easy, but no one is more certain than Justice \nScalia that this approach alone is legitimate. This approach alone \npreserves both the people's control of the Constitution and the \nConstitution's control of judges.\n  In 2005, Justice Scalia delivered a speech at the Woodrow Wilson \nInternational Center for Scholars titled ``Constitutional \nInterpretation the Old Fashioned Way.'' He described originalism as \nbeginning with the text and giving it the meaning that it bore when it \nwas adopted by the people. With all due respect to Justice Scalia, he \ndid not invent this approach, but he is helping us to return to those \nprinciples.\n  In his service on the Court, in his speeches and writings, Justice \nScalia is helping us rediscover what America's Founders told us to do \nfrom the start. I have to emphasize that Justice Scalia has for 25 \nyears implemented the very same approach that he described in his \nhearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  Vice President Biden was the ranking member at the time, and his very \nfirst question was about original meaning as a means of interpreting \nthe Constitution. Justice Scalia explained later in the hearing that \nthe starting point is ``the text of the document and what it meant to \nthe society that adopted it. . . . I am clear on the fact that the \noriginal meaning is the starting point and the beginning of wisdom.''\n  This body knew Justice Scalia would take this approach when we \nunanimously confirmed him, and he has stayed true to his word \nthroughout his judicial career. In addition to instructing us about the \nprinciples we should once again follow, Justice Scalia has been \nsounding the alarm about failing to do so. He condemns as ``power \njudging'' the modern trend of judges substituting their own \nconstitutional meaning for that of the people. This amends the \nConstitution as surely as changing its very words.\n  Judges continually find creative ways to mask their power judging. \nThey think of deeply impeded social or cultural values, evolving \nstandards of decency, and what the Constitution should mean in our \ntime.\n  One of Justice Scalia's former colleagues even said that the \nConstitution is ``a sparkling vision of the supremacy of the human \ndignity of every individual.'' All of these evolving standards and \nsparkling visions are different ways of saying the same thing: that \njudges have taken control of the Constitution by controlling what it \nmeans.\n  Justice Scalia will have none of it. In a 1996 dissent, he rejected \nthis for what it really is; namely, the Court's Constitution-making \nprocess. He wrote:\n\n       The court must be living in another world. Day by day, case \n     by case, it is designing a Constitution for a country I do \n     not recognize.\n\n  One of the many things I like about Justice Scalia is that he applies \nhis principles across the board. He has often pointed out that judges \namend the Constitution by changing its meaning in ways that liberals \nlike, but also in ways that conservatives like. All of it, he says, is \nwrong.\n  Judges have no authority to design a new constitution no matter what \nit looks like. Sometimes I wonder how anyone could think otherwise. How \ncould anyone believe that unelected judges may take the Constitution \nthat opens with the words, ``We the People,'' and turn it into \nsomething else? Why would anyone tolerate judges who change the very \nConstitution that judges are supposed to follow?\n  Justice Scalia believes no one should, and he challenges us to live \nup to the principles that define our system of government and that make \nour liberty possible. The real Constitution is solid and fixed. It was \nestablished and can be changed only by the people. That Constitution, \nthe real Constitution, is strong enough to limit government and protect \nliberty.\n  But that Constitution is being replaced by a very different one. \nSince about the 1930s, the real Constitution controlled by the people \nhas been replaced in some measure by a fake constitution controlled by \njudges. The Constitution is weak, pliable, and shifting, according to \nthem. It morphs and modifies. It shivers and it shakes.\n  This Constitution is a figment of the judicial imagination, and it is \nwritten in disappearing ink. Thomas Jefferson warned that if judges \ncontrol what the Constitution means, it would become ``a mere thing of \nwax in the hands of the judiciary which they may twist and shape into \nany form they please.''\n  Doing so, Jefferson said, would make the Constitution nothing but a \nblank paper. This is not just an academic exercise. If you think the \nlatest judicial mood swing is strong enough to limit government, think \nagain. If you think that a lump of wax or a piece of blank paper is \nfirm enough to protect your liberty, think again.\n\n[[Page S5821]]\n\n  A constitution that can be changed by nothing more than a judge's \nimagination is no constitution at all. This struggle over what the \nConstitution is affects not only what judges do with it but also how \njudges are chosen in the first place. If judges can change the \nConstitution by changing its meaning, then the judicial selection \nprocess will inevitably focus on the Constitution a judicial nominee is \nlikely to create. It will inevitably focus on the form into which a \njudicial nominee can be expected to shape and twist the Constitution.\n  Speaking at the State University of New York School of Law in 2002, \nJustice Scalia warned that if the Constitution's meaning is determined \nby judges rather than the people, the selection of those judges becomes \n``a very political hot potato. Every time you need to appoint a new \nSupreme Court Justice, you are going to have a mini-plebiscite on what \nthe Constitution means.''\n  In a 2007 speech at the Jesse Helms Center, Justice Scalia similarly \ncompared the judicial confirmation process to a miniconstitutional \nconvention. If judges may write a new constitution through their \nrulings, he said, the process will be about finding a nominee who will \n``write the Constitution that you want.''\n  Justice Scalia is also affecting how we do things in the legislative \nbranch. The more that judges are willing to do our work for us, the \nless of it we are likely to do ourselves. On the other hand, if judges \ninsist that we legislators say what we mean and mean what we say, then \nwe are likely to draft laws differently. The law that we enact, after \nall, is the text of our statutes and not the speeches, reports, \ncomments, thoughts, or other things that consume the legislative \nprocess.\n  Knowing that judges who have to interpret and apply our statutes will \nlook only at the law is an incentive for us to make sure if it is to be \nthe law, it must be in the statute. That approach is more transparent, \nmore accountable, and more reliable. We have Justice Scalia to thank \nfor pushing us in that direction.\n  Justice Scalia seems to be the Justice liberals love to hate. If this \nwere a Harry Potter movie, liberals would put Justice Scalia on a \nwanted poster as ``Undesirable No. 1.'' Yet they just cannot seem to \nlook away. The principles upon which he stands are so compelling and \nhis way of winning them so powerful that whether you love him or hate \nhim you simply must deal with him.\n  Those who think judges may just make it up as they go along have a \nhard time figuring out Justice Scalia because he does not follow their \ngame plan. Only a few months into his first term on the Supreme Court, \nthe Washington Post reported that though Justice Scalia was expected to \nbe a hard-changing conservative, he was voting with liberal Justice \nWilliam Brennan almost two-thirds of the time.\n  Several weeks later another Post headline read: ``Newest Reagan \nAppointee Joins Liberals,'' and the percentage of agreement with \nJustice Brennan seemed to be going up.\n  Conservative George Will's column at the end of the 1986-1987 Supreme \nCourt term bore the title, ``Good Grief, Scalia!''\n  Not to worry, though, because a Post headline just 1 year later read: \n``Scalia May Be Successor as Conservatives' Chief Advocate.'' The real \nway to know Justice Scalia, you see, is to know his principles. They \nare principles drawn directly from America's founding from the nature \nof limited government under a written constitution. No one works harder \nto articulate and apply those principles day in and day out than \nJustice Scalia.\n  Research in the last several years has demonstrated that he is the \nfunniest Justice in oral argument and the most cited in law reviews and \njournals. His lectures around the country are consistently standing \nroom only. His interview on the University of California's ``Legally \nSpeaking'' television program has been viewed at least six times as \noften as any other guest.\n  No doubt some of this popularity, this buzz, comes from his engaging \npersonality, his wit, and his sense of humor. People enjoy being with a \nperson like him. But it also comes from the substance, the sheer \nmagnitude of the message he delivers in that unique way. People like a \nwitty, engaging person. But they also respect powerful principles and a \nmessage that weighs more than a passing intellectual fad.\n  I have so far spoken today about Justice Scalia, the jurist; I cannot \nclose this tribute, however, without a few comments about Antonin \nScalia, the man. The hearing on his Supreme Court nomination 25 years \nago took place in the Judiciary Committee's regular hearing room, which \nis much smaller than where we hold such hearings today. His hearing \nlasted just 2 days, including testimony by witnesses.\n\n  I can still remember that Justice Scalia's family occupied more than \none row in the audience. As Justice Scalia introduced them, including \nall nine of his children, he said, ``I think we have a full \ncommittee.''\n  Media cameras went crazy every time his youngest daughter Meg would \nlean her head on her mother's shoulder. Meg was just 6 years old then. \nBut as I remember, she held up very well as we lawyers talked about all \nsorts of jurisprudential minutiae.\n  That sight impressed on me Justice Scalia's deep love for family and \nthe sacrifice that family makes when someone like him is so devoted to \npublic service. He is also a man of deep faith and love for our country \nand the values on which it was founded.\n  Five years ago, I marked Justice Scalia's 20th anniversary in a \nspeech on the Senate floor. At that time I put into the Record letters \nfrom some of his former law clerks. I want to do the same today.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record after my \nremarks letters from some of the following former law clerks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. HATCH. Edward Whelan, who clerked during the October 1991 term \nand later served as my counsel when I was ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, and is now president of the Ethics in Public \nPolicy Center; Paul Clement, who clerked during the October 1993 term \nand later served as Solicitor General of the United States, and he is \nnow a partner in the Bancroft law firm; Mark Phillip, who also clerked \nduring the October 1993 term and later served as a U.S. district judge, \nand is now a partner at Kirkland & Ellis in Chicago; Brian Fitzpatrick, \nwho clerked during the October 2001 term and is now an associate \nprofessor at Vanderbilt Law School; and Brian Killian, who clerked \nduring the October 2007 term, and is now an associate at the Bingham \nMcCutchen law firm in Washington.\n  In closing, all Americans owe Justice Antonin Scalia a deep debt of \ngratitude. Every day he serves on the Supreme Court Justice Scalia \ngives a gift to all of us. He is reintroducing us to the principles and \nto the document that make our liberties possible. He invites us, in the \nwords of the Kellogg's Corn Flakes commercial, to try it again for the \nfirst time.\n  I return to the scene of his first judicial confirmation hearing in \n1982. The constitutional amendment process was underway that day, but \nit was rightly happening on the Senate floor rather than in the \nconfirmation of a Federal judge. Keeping clear the principle that only \nthe people have authority to change the Constitution will give us, as \nJustice Scalia often puts it, an enduring rather than an evolving \nconstitution. We must step up and govern ourselves rather than look to \njudges to do it for us.\n  I hope we see this opportunity for what it is, following Justice \nScalia's lead, grasping again the principles of liberty and resolving \nnever to let them go.\n  Finally, I have been around here a long time. I have had a role with \nregard to every current member of the U.S. Supreme Court and a number \nof those who have gone on. I have to say that one of the most respected \nmen in this country is Justice Scalia. I count him as a friend. I count \nhim as a mentor. I count him as a teacher and professor. I count him as \none of the all-time greatest Supreme Court Justices, a man who, without \nquestion, is as good a person as you can find.\n  He is a terrific human being. His life has been a life of service to \nhis fellow men and women. His wife is a terrific person, and as far as \nI know the kids are all great too.\n  We have been fortunate that he has been willing to serve as he has. \nWe are\n\n[[Page S5822]]\n\na greatly strengthened country because of Justice Scalia. There are a \nnumber of Justices in the history of this country we have to look up \nto. He is one of them. I think we should revere all of them, but he is \none of the greatest. I suspect that he will be quoted, he will be \nwritten about, he will be talked about for a long time because of the \ngenuine intellect of the man, the tremendous personality he has, the \nbrilliant mind that we see on display every time he writes an opinion \nor gives a speech or lectures to us or gives a talk.\n  This is one of the truly great people in our country today. I do not \ncare whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, a liberal or a \nconservative or somewhere else, this is a man we ought to all respect \nwith every fiber of our beings, and his family as well.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                        Ethics and\n\n\n                                         Public Policy Center,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2011.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Thank you for commemorating the 25th \n     anniversary of the Senate's unanimous confirmation of Antonin \n     Scalia to the Supreme Court in 1986--fittingly, on \n     Constitution Day. As someone who has had the special \n     privilege of working both for you and for Justice Scalia, I \n     am particularly grateful to you for inviting me to take part \n     in this celebration.\n       Over the past twenty-five years, no one has done more than \n     Justice Scalia to promote fidelity to our Constitution. As \n     the most prominent proponent of the interpretive methodology \n     of ``original meaning,'' Justice Scalia has forcefully argued \n     that genuine fidelity to the Constitution requires that its \n     provisions--including, of course, its amendments--be \n     interpreted in accordance with the meaning they bore at the \n     time they were adopted. His intellectual triumph over \n     advocates of the so-called ``living Constitution'' approach--\n     under which judges are free to look to their own values or \n     sense of empathy in determining what the Constitution means--\n     has been so devastating that his opponents have largely \n     abandoned the term ``living Constitution'' and some have even \n     tried to rebrand their positions as originalist.\n       Justice Scalia's clear ideas are made all the more potent \n     by his distinctive writing, which combines a sparkling prose \n     and a logical rigor in a manner that is especially accessible \n     and appealing.\n       Time has a way of vindicating Justice Scalia's judgments. \n     Virtually everyone, for example, now recognizes the soundness \n     of Justice Scalia's brilliant solo dissent in Morrison v. \n     Olson, the 1988 case in which the Supreme Court ruled that \n     the independent-counsel statute did not violate the \n     Constitution's separation of powers. Precisely because \n     Justice Scalia's jurisprudence reflects the genius of the \n     Framers and an abiding faith in, and fidelity to, American \n     constitutional principles, there is ample reason to expect \n     that his wisdom on other hotly contested issues of the era \n     will ultimately prevail.\n       I am personally grateful to Justice Scalia for the \n     opportunity to serve as his law clerk for a year, for all \n     that I learned about the law and about legal reasoning from \n     working with him, and for his friendship and support during \n     my ensuing career. But, like all Americans, I am also deeply \n     indebted to him for his years of tremendous service on the \n     Court. May he enjoy many, many more!\n           Sincerely,\n     M. Edward Whelan III.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                     Bancroft,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 2011.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Thank you for taking the Senate Floor \n     to mark the 25th anniversary of the beginning of Justice \n     Antonin Scalia's distinguished tenure on the Supreme Court of \n     the United States. Thank you also for inviting me to send you \n     a letter offering a few thoughts of my own on this important \n     anniversary.\n       I have had the privilege both of serving as a law clerk to \n     Justice Scalia and of arguing over 50 cases before him. I \n     count both experiences as high professional honors. What is \n     perhaps most remarkable about the opportunity to clerk for \n     the Justice is how much of the interaction with the Justice \n     is oral. To be sure, the opportunity to watch the Justice \n     work through drafts of an opinion is a remarkable experience. \n     But his writing style is inimitable, and the clerks are \n     relegated to the sidelines. The most valuable aspect of the \n     clerkship is the opportunity to discuss the Court's cases \n     with the Justice. Before every sitting, he had a session with \n     his law clerks that resembled nothing so much as an oral \n     argument. With 25 years of service, the Justice has now had \n     roughly 100 law clerks. As a reflection of the Justice's own \n     remarkable career, his law clerks have gone on to distinguish \n     themselves in academia, executive branch service, and the \n     judiciary. The key to their success, I believe, is that once \n     you have mixed it up with the Justice in an argument in \n     Chambers, very few subsequent professional experiences have \n     the capacity to intimidate.\n       Perhaps the only experience that can hold a candle to those \n     in-Chambers debates is to argue a case before the Justice and \n     his colleagues. Justice Scalia clearly changed the dynamic of \n     Supreme Court oral arguments. One only needs to listen to the \n     audio recording of arguments before Justice Scalia joined the \n     bench to appreciate his impact. Advocates used to hold forth \n     at length with only occasional questions from the Justices. \n     The Justice arrived and began asking questions in rapid-fire \n     succession. His colleagues did not want the newest Justice to \n     steal the show and began asking more frequent questions, and \n     as subsequent Justices joined the Court, they too joined the \n     fray. I do not believe it is an accident that the Solicitor \n     General's office only formalized its practice of holding moot \n     courts after Justice Scalia joined the Court.\n       Justice Scalia's impact on the Court has extended well \n     beyond oral argument. He has had a profound impact on the way \n     the Supreme Court, and all Judges, decide cases. The impact \n     is most obvious in the area of statutory construction. He has \n     fundamentally changed the way the Supreme Court approaches \n     the interpretation of congressional statutes. Coming from a \n     former law clerk, this could be dismissed as being less than \n     objective. But I have a much better source for this \n     observation: Justice John Paul Stevens. A few years ago, the \n     Supreme Court held argument in Arlington Central School \n     District v. Murphy, a case involving the question whether \n     expert fees were recoverable under a statute that allowed for \n     the recovery of attorneys' fees and costs. There was a pretty \n     good textual argument--which the Court ultimately adopted--\n     that expert fees were neither attorneys' fees nor costs. \n     There was also a pretty good argument based on the conference \n     report that the conferees thought that expert fees would be \n     recoverable. At oral argument, Justice Stevens suggested that \n     the latter view should carry the day because ``the rule that \n     you cannot look at legislative history didn't really get any \n     emphasis until after 1987'' and the statute at issue was \n     enacted earlier. To be clear, 1987 was not the date of some \n     watershed Supreme Court opinion about legislative history; it \n     was Justice Scalia's first full year on the Court.\n       It would be a mistake to think that Justice Scalia's \n     influence is limited to statutory as opposed to \n     constitutional interpretation, just as it would be a mistake \n     to pigeonhole his views as conservative or pro-Government. \n     Perhaps no opinion better illustrates both points than his \n     opinion for the Court in Crawford v. Washington. That \n     decision worked a fundamental reconsideration of the Court's \n     Confrontation Clause jurisprudence. With a classic \n     Scaliaesque focus on text, rather than purpose, the Court \n     rejected prior Supreme Court's decisions which considered the \n     underlying purpose of the Confrontation Clause--reliable \n     evidence--in favor of what the text actually guarantees: an \n     absolute right to confront witnesses. As he wrote for the \n     Court, the Sixth Amendment ``commands not that evidence be \n     reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular \n     manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.'' In \n     the years that have followed Crawford, few areas of the \n     Court's constitutional jurisprudence have been more dynamic \n     and no criminal defendant has had a better champion in a \n     Confrontation Clause case than Justice Scalia.\n       Justice Scalia's impact has extended beyond the Court in \n     one more important way. An entire generation of law students \n     has now learned the law by reading Justice Scalia's opinions. \n     Even Justice Scalia's critics acknowledge the power of his \n     prose. I have had numerous law students--left, right and \n     center--confide that whenever there is a case with a Scalia \n     opinion, even a dissent or concurrence, they always read the \n     Scalia opinion first. And who can blame them? Who would want \n     to read about a three-pronged doctrinal test, when instead \n     you can read about 60,000 naked Hoosiers or even just nine \n     people selected at random from the Kansas City phone book. \n     And Justice Scalia's colorful prose can have serious \n     consequences--I am not sure the Court's Lemon test has ever \n     fully recovered from being compared to a B-movie ghoul.\n       Finally, the most commendable thing about your decision to \n     mark this anniversary is that it does not require us to wait \n     for the end of Justice Scalia's service to celebrate his \n     tenure. I can assure you that from an advocate's perspective, \n     Justice Scalia appears to be a vibrant young man up on that \n     bench. At the same time we mark his twenty-five years of \n     service, we can look forward to his continuing service to his \n     country and his Court.\n           Most sincerely,\n     Paul D. Clement.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Kirkland & Ellis LLP\n\n\n                                  and Affiliated Partnerships,\n\n                                  Chicago, IL, September 15, 2011.\n     Sen. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Thank you very much for honoring \n     Justice Scalia on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his \n     confirmation to the United States Supreme Court. It is an \n     honor to contribute a letter to your effort.\n       I suspect that many of Justice Scalia's colleagues in the \n     federal judiciary, his former colleagues from the legal \n     academy, and many of my colleagues in the Scalia law clerk \n     family will write about the Justice's\n\n[[Page S5823]]\n\n     vast intellect and his profound contributions to the law. \n     Their comments will certainly be on the mark. Justice Scalia \n     is one of the smartest people one will ever encounter. And he \n     has indelibly influenced many areas of the law. He not only \n     has written landmark opinions concerning numerous areas of \n     constitutional and statutory law, he has, even more broadly, \n     focused debate about the proper methods of interpreting the \n     Constitution and federal statutes. He also has made key \n     contributions to the debate about the proper role of the \n     federal judiciary within our system of government. Not \n     everyone agrees with his views, of course, but I suspect most \n     everyone would agree that he has been, and remains, one of \n     the most important voices in these key discussions.\n       If I may, however, I am going to leave the accounting of \n     Justice Scalia's jurisprudential contributions to others far \n     more scholarly and intelligent than me. Instead, let me \n     please briefly address an aspect of Justice Scalia that \n     sometimes receives less public attention--namely, just how \n     nice and decent a person he is on a human level.\n       It is commonly said within the Scalia law clerk family that \n     the Justice was the nicest boss any of us has ever had. He \n     is, first and foremost, a teacher at heart, and he routinely \n     would take time, despite his workload and responsibilities, \n     to help us become better thinkers and lawyers. He also \n     treated us with the utmost professionalism and respect, and \n     with concern for our personal lives as well as our \n     professional ones. That concern has remained in the years \n     since we clerked for him--as he has shared our joys, with the \n     birth of our children, and our sorrows, with the deaths of \n     loved ones.\n       Justice Scalia's generosity with his time and attention is \n     not limited to his law clerks. I recall one time, in the \n     early summer when I was clerking, when Justice Scalia had \n     been working particularly hard for quite a stretch of time. \n     Notwithstanding those demands, he agreed to meet with a group \n     of school children who were touring the Court--as I recall, \n     somewhat unexpectedly within his schedule. Despite the \n     sixteen hour days he had been putting in for some weeks, he \n     engaged the kids at length, and fielded their many questions, \n     for well over an hour. There were no historians to record his \n     deeds, nor camera crews, but he did it just because he is a \n     generous and decent person. He entertained the kids (he is \n     quick to laugh, and quick to joke as well) but he also made \n     them think about important issues, and he took the time \n     necessary to do that, notwithstanding the long hours he had \n     been putting in for many weeks.\n       Justice Scalia will be ranked among the most important \n     jurists in American history because of his vast professional \n     contributions. He also is a model of a dedicated public \n     servant, who works earnestly to discharge his duties to the \n     American people, that can be emulated by judges throughout \n     the nation. But he also is an exceedingly kind and decent \n     person. Being a nice person is not everything, but it is \n     quite important indeed, and in that regard, he is also a gem.\n       In closing, let me please add one final thought. Any \n     recognition of Justice Scalia's twenty-five years of service \n     on the Supreme Court would be incomplete without a \n     recognition of his wife, Mrs. Maureen Scalia. Serving on the \n     Supreme Court is certainly a huge honor, but serving in that \n     role imposes substantial demands on any person and those \n     around them. I am quite confident, because I have heard \n     Justice Scalia say it many times, that he could not have \n     served on the Supreme Court without the support of his lovely \n     wife over his many years in the federal judiciary. She too is \n     owed recognition and thanks.\n       Thank you again for your efforts to recognize the twenty-\n     fifth anniversary of Justice Scalia's confirmation to the \n     Supreme Court. And thanks for your continuing service to the \n     Nation as well.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mark Filip.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Vanderbilt Law School,\n\n                                 Nashville, TN, September 9, 2011.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: This month marks the 25th anniversary \n     of the United States Senate's confirmation of Justice Antonin \n     Scalia to the Supreme Court of the United States. On \n     September 17, 1986, the Senate confirmed Justice Scalia by a \n     vote of 98-0, and, on September 25, he received his \n     commission.\n       I hope that the Senate will find an appropriate moment \n     sometime in the coming weeks to honor Justice Scalia for this \n     important milestone in his service to the American people. I \n     realize that some members of the Senate are more fond of \n     Justice Scalia's jurisprudence than are others, but, no \n     matter where one stands on that question, I think it has to \n     be acknowledged that Justice Scalia has been one of the most \n     influential legal thinkers in modern American history--\n     indeed, perhaps in all of American history.\n       In an age where much judicial decision-making is ad hoc, \n     Justice Scalia distinguishes himself by following coherent \n     judicial philosophies known as ``textualism'' and \n     ``originalism.'' Although these philosophies may have \n     predated Justice Scalia in some form, I think it is fair to \n     say that he brought them to life, and, in doing so, forever \n     changed the way lawyers, judges, and public officials talk \n     and think about the law.\n       This is not mere conjecture; it can be demonstrated \n     empirically. Several years ago, a student note was published \n     in the Harvard Law Review called Looking it Up: Dictionaries \n     and Statutory Interpretation, 107 HARV. L. REV. 1437 (1994). \n     The author examined how often the Supreme Court cited \n     dictionaries in its opinions. The author found that citations \n     dramatically increased after Justice Scalia brought his \n     textualist approach to statutory interpretation to the Court \n     in 1986. And it was not only Justice Scalia who was citing \n     the dictionary: all of the Justices were doing it. In short, \n     whether or not one agrees with Justice Scalia's philosophies, \n     nearly everyone acknowledges their power and nearly everyone \n     understands they must be grappled with.\n       Consider as well how often Justice Scalia appears as the \n     subject of law review articles. I asked a research assistant \n     to tally how often his name appeared in the title of a law \n     review article compared to the 17 other Justices who have \n     been his colleagues. Although it turns out that this is more \n     difficult to do than it sounds--Justices with common last \n     names generate many false positives--after eliminating the \n     most common false positives, my research assistant reported \n     what I had long suspected: law professors write many more law \n     review articles about JusticeScalia than about any of his \n     colleagues (including, strikingly, Thurgood Marshall, the \n     first African American on the Court, and Sandra Day O'Connor, \n     the first woman). My research assistant found 220 articles \n     about Justice Scalia, well ahead of the 150 or so for his \n     closest competitors (and many of the articles found for his \n     closest competitors were false positives not easily \n     eliminated). In short, love him or hate him, nearly everyone \n     feels the need to reckon with him.\n       Justice Scalia's influence is a result not only of the \n     strength of his ideas, but also of his rhetorical skills. Few \n     judges have ever turned phrases as colorfully as he does. I \n     witnessed firsthand the pleasure he takes from writing, and \n     it is an investment that has served him well. The reason he \n     was the thinker that brought textualism and originalism to \n     life may very well have been because he was the writer that \n     could not go unread.\n       Justice Scalia's long public service and his extraordinary \n     influence on the law deserve recognition and respect. The \n     Supreme Court is a much richer place today than it would have \n     been had the Senate not elevated Justice Scalia there 25 \n     years ago. It would be a nice gesture of bipartisanship to \n     take a few minutes this month to remember him.\n           Sincerely,\n     Brian Fitzpatrick,\n       Associate Professor of Law, Vanderbilt University; Law \n     Clerk to Justice Scalia, 2001-2002.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 17, 2011.\n     Senator Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch, as one of Justice Antonin Scalia's \n     former clerks, I'm delighted that you are commemorating the \n     25th anniversary of the Senate's September 17, 1986 vote to \n     confirm him as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of \n     the United States.\n       In hindsight, it is a wonderful coincidence that Justice \n     Scalia was confirmed on the 199th anniversary of the signing \n     of the Constitution. (The bicentennial would have been even \n     more fitting, but we're all grateful the Senate didn't wait a \n     year for it.) Over the last 25 years, his name has become a \n     synonym for ``originalism,'' the view that the Constitution \n     of the United States has only one, unchanging, original \n     meaning--the meaning that prevailed when it was adopted. He \n     has authored some of the most significant originalist \n     opinions the Supreme Court has ever issued, including \n     opinions on the accused's Sixth Amendment right to confront \n     the witnesses against him (Crawford v. Washington) and on our \n     Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms (District of \n     Columbia v. Heller).\n       Justice Scalia believes that judges must be originalists \n     because the United States is a nation ruled by law, not by \n     judges. The whole point of writing out a constitution \n     (indeed, of writing out any law), he observes, is to prevent \n     rules from being changed. As he has famously quipped, the \n     rule of law is a law of rules.\n       For Justice Scalia, these words aren't just rhetoric. They \n     are principles he strives to follow in all his judicial \n     tasks, even the most insignificant ones. My favorite example \n     of this illustrates the depth of his commitment to rules.\n       In the Supreme Court, a party can ask the justice assigned \n     to his or her circuit to postpone a filing deadline. \n     Applications for an extension of time are not exciting work, \n     particularly compared to everything else going on at the \n     Court. As a result, they aren't paid much attention. As a \n     further result, the vast majority of the applications are \n     granted--except, it turns out, in Justice Scalia's circuit. \n     Whereas the other justices tend to deny only a handful of \n     extension applications each year (less than 20%), Justice \n     Scalia grants only that many. Why does he take a solitary \n     stand over insignificant procedural motions?\n       Barely three months on the job, Justice Scalia gave his \n     answer. He had received one\n\n[[Page S5824]]\n\n     of his first extension applications. The attorney generically \n     claimed that the case presented ``important questions under \n     the Constitution of the United States which were determined \n     adversely to the petitioner by the court below'' and that the \n     attorney, therefore, needed ``additional time to research and \n     prepare the [petition for a] Writ of Certiorari.'' This was \n     the legal equivalent of a form letter, mailed in with the \n     expectation that it was a technical formality, as if five \n     minutes of copying a prior application plus the price of \n     postage were all that someone needed to get an extra 60 days \n     to file a petition.\n       To the attorney's surprise, Justice Scalia denied the \n     request and wrote a short explanation for his decision, \n     making an example of the seemingly routine case (Kleem v. \n     INS). The Supreme Court's rules say that a party must \n     demonstrate ``good cause'' for an extension, and they \n     admonish that extension requests are ``not favored.'' If \n     needing more time to prepare the best possible petition was \n     ``good cause,'' everyone could honestly claim good cause. \n     Then, the Court's pronouncement that extension requests are \n     ``not favored'' would serve only to deter inexperienced \n     attorneys who, not being part of the savvy club, didn't know \n     that the rules don't really mean what they say.\n       Of course, the easy decision always is to grant an \n     application. But what is easy isn't always right, and what is \n     right isn't always easy. We expect judges to do what is \n     right, no matter how hard it is. Justice Scalia fulfills our \n     expectations in all he does.\n       Twenty five years ago, what was right was also easy: the \n     Senate should be proud that it unanimously consented to give \n     Justice Scalia a lifetime appointment to the highest court in \n     the land. His commitment to the rule of law is unflagging, as \n     strong today as it was the day he was confirmed.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                 Bryan M. Killian,\n                          Law Clerk to Justice Scalia (2007-2008).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, my hope is that we are moving into the \nhomestretch, in terms of being able to pass the trade adjustment \nassistance legislation.\n  I strongly support efforts to promote more exports. The President has \nset a laudable goal of increasing exports. We know that in the export \nsector, there is an opportunity to make things here, to grow things \nhere, to add value to them here, and then ship them around the world. \nTo promote these export markets and generate the economic growth our \ncountry wants, we have to make sure our workers have the latest, most \nupdated skills to make sure they can get those jobs and exports and get \nAmerican products around the world.\n  As I indicated yesterday, there is no doubt that the American brand \nis a hit around the world. Ninety percent of the consumers are outside \nthe United States, and they want our products. My hope is, as I have \nindicated, that we are moving toward being able to pass this \nlegislation, the trade adjustment assistance, to increase our exports. \nBecause some pretty astonishing comments have been made with respect to \nthe Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, I wish to take a few minutes \nthis afternoon and make sure we can get some facts out to combat some \nof the rhetoric.\n  For example, one comment I have heard repeatedly is that the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance Program is a sop to organized labor. The argument \nis that the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program is just a giveaway to \nlabor unions and that they are the people who want the program; that it \nis something that is part of the labor priority list. I can tell the \noccupant of the chair--and I am sure she hears the same thing I do at \nhome--that folks who are members of labor unions don't come up to us \nand say what they want in the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. They \nsay: Senator, I want to have a good-paying job. I want a job where I \ncan support my family and where I have a living wage. That is what I am \nconcerned about right now.\n  What I am concerned about is China, for example, with their low-\ninterest loans. In some areas, such as solar manufacturing, which I \nhave written the Obama administration about, they are undercutting our \nsolar manufacturers because they are basically giving out free money \nnow. That is what workers come up to Senators and say: Senator, I want \na good job, one I can make sure that when I go to bed at night, I will \nknow when I wake in the morning, I will be able to support my family. \nLabor union folks don't walk up and say: This is what I want from the \nTrade Adjustment Assistance Program.\n  The fact is, it has been documented by Mathematic Policy Research \nthat less than half the participants in the TAA were members of a \nunion. Let me repeat that. Less than half of those who participated in \ntrade adjustment assistance were members of a union. In fact, this is a \nprogram that is available to all American workers who qualify. When we \nare talking about applying, in effect, a trade adjustment assistance \npetition can be filed by any of the following groups: a group of three \nor more workers, an employer, a labor union, a State workforce \nofficial, a one-stop operator or partner or any other person who is \ndesignated a duly authorized representative.\n  This is, to me, the bottom line. In 2009, more than 9 out of 10 \npetitions for trade adjustment assistance relief were filed by nonunion \nfirms or groups. I will repeat that because we have heard so frequently \nthis is somehow a giveaway to labor or a sop to the labor unions. In \n2009, more than 9 out of 10 TAA petitions were filed by nonunion firms \nor groups. More than two-thirds of the eligible population for the \nTrade Adjustment Assistance Program were not members of a union.\n  I hope that, at this point in the debate, we can make it clear, we \ncan make it understandable that TAA is not a program only available to \nlabor unions. That is not true. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Program \nis not only available to labor unions. TAA is for all Americans. As \nthis debate continues and, as I indicated, hopefully moves into the \nhomestretch, I hope Senators remember that in 2009 more than 9 out of \n10 TAA petitions were filed by nonunion firms or groups.\n  The second area I wish to touch on, in terms of trying to rebut some \nof these criticisms about the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, is \nthe argument that there is no need to extend eligibility to those in \nthe service sector. In 2009, Congress expanded the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program so service workers who are displaced by trade would \nbe eligible for assistance. There has been criticism of this expansion, \nand I wish to make sure, again, that Senators and those listening to \nthis debate actually get some of the key facts.\n  It is important to remember that 82 percent of employment between \n2006 and 2010 was in the service sector. To argue that workers in \ncomputer programming, finance, accounting, and insurance do not face \nforeign competition is simply to put our heads in the sand.\n  A forthcoming paper by Bradford Jensen finds that Americans employed \nin businesses and professional services face more international \ncompetition than workers in the manufacturing sector. Again, when \nSenators hear this argument that there is no case for extending trade \nadjustment assistance eligibility to service workers, I hope they will \nthink through the implications of the international competition our \nworkers face in this sector because those in computer programming, in \nfinance, in accounting, and in insurance are important workers in the \nAmerican economy. They have played a big role particularly in the \nexport sector. I think to arbitrarily say they should not be eligible \nfor the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, given what many of them \nare facing in terms of international competition, isn't right.\n  The third argument I would like to take on directly is the argument \nthat, in some way, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program is almost a \nduplicative program. Again, the facts show this argument doesn't stand. \nA Mathematic Policy Research report from last year makes clear that \nworkers who lose their job due to increased imports--surging imports is \nthe way we ought to appropriately characterize it--those folks who are, \ntherefore, eligible for the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program because \nof surging imports tend to be older, often have less education, and \nhave higher prelayoff earnings compared to other unemployed Americans.\n  That is why the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program is different than \nthe unemployment insurance program. It is tailored to meet the distinct \nneeds of a critical portion of the labor force. The workers are older, \nand often they have less education. The transition, as the occupant of \nthe chair knows, can be gut-wrenching because a lot of these \nindividuals, before their layoffs, were\n\n[[Page S5825]]\n\nmaking good wages. Now they are wondering how they are going to be able \nto get the skills and how they are going to be able to pick up the \nknowledge to tap the latest opportunities that are available in \nAmerican business that is looking to export.\n  This is a program that doesn't duplicate any other. It is a program \nthat is designed to serve a unique population. I am sure we are going \nto continue through the rest of the discussion about trade adjustment \nassistance and see a lot of back and forth between Senators with \nrespect to the merits of the program.\n  I continue to believe we ought to start, as we analyze it, by \nremembering this has always been a bipartisan program, No. 1; No. 2, \nTAA petitions have been approved by Labor Departments in both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations. This has roots in the \nbipartisan effort to support expanded trade. One study after another \nshows that expanded trade--particularly tapping export markets--can \ngenerate hundreds of thousands of jobs. But there is no question that, \nas we try to make sure we don't lose a single job in America--even \nshort term--some workers can end up needing some help during a \ntransition from one job to another, and if they have been harmed by \nsurging imports, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program is there for \nthem. That is why we ought to reauthorize it.\n  I think we also ought to recognize it is knitted together with the \neffort to pass the free-trade agreements because the free-trade \nagreements are about more exports. To have all the workers we need for \nthe potential export markets, we have to make sure workers who have \nbeen laid off have a chance to upgrade their skills.\n  We will come back to this topic, I am certain, but I hope, in the \nlast few minutes, I have been able to at least offer some concrete, \ndocumented facts that make clear that the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram is not a sop to organized labor, since, in 2009, the vast \nmajority of those granted relief had nothing to do with a labor union; \nsecond, that we have made the case for why service workers, facing \naggressive international competition, ought to be eligible for the TAA; \nthird, I hope we have been able to lay out how this program doesn't \nduplicate any others because this is a unique group who \ndisproportionately uses the program, who is older, often with less \neducation, and the transition can be particularly gut-wrenching because \nvery often they have higher prelayoff earnings compared to other \nunemployed Americans.\n  I think we understand the biggest challenge for this Senate is \ncreating more good-paying jobs. In my State, about one out of six jobs \ndepends on international trade. The trade jobs tend to pay better than \ndo the nontrade jobs. That is why I considered it such an honor when \nChairman Baucus asked me to chair the Finance Committee's Subcommittee \non International Trade. I saw this as an opportunity to grow the Oregon \neconomy and to grow good-paying family wage jobs. Oregon has a very \ngood record in terms of manufacturing. We face a whole host of dramatic \nchallenges right now. For example, I am particularly concerned about \nwhere our country is headed in terms of manufacturing in the renewable \nenergy sector. The Chinese are engaged in very aggressive and \nquestionable practices with respect to the Chinese Development Bank. In \neffect, they are giving free money to companies that can manufacture \nand undercut the American market. I have asked the Obama administration \nto investigate this. If they do not, I am certainly going to be looking \nlegislatively at pursuing trade remedies.\n\n  Much of what we are faced with in terms of the renewable energy \nsector, particularly generating jobs in manufacturing in that sector, \ndeals with making sure we have a rules-based trading system. We enjoy \nthe fact that China is a trading partner. Our State gets a significant \namount of jobs from exporting goods to China. But the Chinese, like \neverybody else, have to comply with the rules, and there is a \nsubstantial amount of evidence that the rules aren't being complied \nwith as they relate to manufacturing in the solar sector.\n  That is why I am using my position as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nInternational Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness to get on top \nof that. We have already lost some solar manufacturers and we shouldn't \nsit idly by and lose more. That is the kind of challenge we ought to be \nworking on together on a bipartisan basis; not coming to the floor of \nthe Senate and blocking a piece of legislation that gives our workers \nan opportunity to get ahead--to get ahead in the private sector, to get \nahead in the export market, and to be in a position to get the good-\npaying jobs that are going to be available in the years ahead if we \npass legislation to remove trade barriers.\n  The reality is that in virtually all of these areas, our tariffs are \nlow, which means that around the world countries get to send their \nproducts to us and get almost totally free access to our market. Yet, \naround the world, when we try to ship our products to them, we face \nvery substantial tariffs. That is what we are trying to change here on \nthe floor of the Senate--to level the playing field. Because if we \nlevel the playing field, our workers get more out of it than do the \nworkers of other countries. And that, to me, ought to be particularly \nappealing to Senators now when our folks are hurting and when there is \nso much pain in communities across this country.\n  When I am home, I am consistently seeing workers who are walking an \neconomic tightrope--balancing their food bills against their fuel bills \nand their fuel bills against their medical costs. They go to bed at \nnight wondering if they are going to have a good-paying job in the \nmorning, given what is being reported every day in the newspapers in \nterms of layoffs and the kinds of challenges our companies are facing \nin these tough global markets. That is why legislation to promote \nexports makes sense. It is an opportunity to provide a new measure of \neconomic security to hard-working American families--to tap those \nexport markets. We have to make sure our workers, all of our workers, \ncan get the skills and those kinds of opportunities so they can qualify \nfor those export markets.\n  This legislation--passing trade adjustment assistance--is a key \ncomponent of our ability to generate more jobs in the private sector \nthrough exports. I certainly hope we are in the homestretch of being \nable to pass this legislation and then to move on to the agreements, \nmove on to the opportunity to generate more exports, because that means \nmore work--good-paying work--for our people.\n  Madam President, with that, I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I also believe profoundly that increasing \nour exports, improving our trading opportunities for businesses in this \ncountry can do a lot to get Americans back to work. It employs a lot of \npeople across this country today, and it is important we get these \ntrade agreements done. I couldn't agree more with what my colleague \nfrom Oregon had to say about that in terms of its impact on the \neconomy.\n  What is unfortunate, in my view, is the fact we have had to wait so \nlong to get where we are. We have had trade agreements now that have \nbeen teed up, literally signed back in December of 2006 for Colombia, \nPanama, and South Korea, in 2007, and it strikes me that at the least \nwe have lost a tremendous amount of opportunity and a tremendous amount \nof market share as a result of the delay.\n  I would have hoped yesterday we would have passed trade promotion \nauthority, because that allows us at least to be at the table to \nnegotiate trade agreements in the future. We have been basically locked \nout of that since trade promotion authority lapsed back in 2007. This \nis a global economy, and the world is passing us by. Every single day \nwe are not engaged, that we are not out there negotiating trade \nagreements with countries around the world somebody else is, and every \nsingle day we are losing opportunities for American business to export \nand to grow our economy and to create jobs here at home.\n  What I want to speak to today is an amendment I filed earlier this \nafternoon that deals with what I believe is a very important topic, and \nthat is the high cost of delay when it comes to the pending free-trade \nagreements. Much attention has been paid in this debate to the pros and \ncons of trade adjustment assistance, and that is certainly\n\n[[Page S5826]]\n\na debate we ought to have. But we should not overlook the fact there \nhas been a real cost to America's economy and American business \nassociated with the President's strategy to link passage of the free-\ntrade agreements to the renewal of an expanded Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program--very unfortunate, especially considering what even \nthe White House acknowledges, which is that passing the trade \nagreements is one of the best things we can do in the short term to \ncreate jobs.\n  According to the Business Roundtable, the passage of the trade \nagreements will support 250,000 American jobs. The U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce estimates this figure could be as high as 380,000 U.S. jobs. \nYou would think passage of these trade agreements, which were signed in \n2006 and 2007, would have been a priority, and an early priority, for \nthe Obama administration. Yet here we are, more than 2\\1/2\\ years into \nthis administration, and the President still has not made a commitment \nto sending us the trade agreements so we can consider them.\n  I hope what we are doing today puts in place a process whereby that \nwill happen. But as of right now, we have yet to see those trade \nagreements, notwithstanding the President's assertions he is committed \nto growing trade and to getting these trade agreements passed. That \ncan't happen until they are submitted to the Congress for ratification. \nI am hopeful the trade bill before us now will allow us to get to a \nfull and fair debate on the trade adjustment assistance and, in so \ndoing, we will finally get to where we have removed what I hope is the \nlast obstacle blocking passage of the three free-trade agreements.\n  My amendment is very simple. Under the current trade promotion \nauthority procedures, the International Trade Commission must prepare a \nreport that is submitted to Congress no later than 90 days after a \ntrade agreement is signed. However, there is currently no requirement \nthe ITC conduct a study to assess the negative impact on U.S. \nbusinesses when we delay implementation of an agreement, as we have \nwith Korea, Colombia, and Panama. My amendment would simply require \nthat the International Trade Commission assess the negative impact to \nU.S. businesses if a trade agreement is signed but has not been \nconsidered by Congress within 2 years.\n  The ITC study would focus on lost U.S. exports, how the delay has \nimpacted U.S. trade objectives, as set forth under TPA, as well as how \nthe delay impacts the protection of U.S. intellectual property \noverseas. The study would also estimate the impact on U.S. employment \nif the trade agreement in question continues to languish. And, finally, \nthe ITC would be required to update this study in every year subsequent \nthat the trade agreement is not considered by Congress or if it is not \nentered into force.\n  My amendment follows a basic principle: If the President believes a \ntrade agreement is in America's national and economic interest, he \nneeds to submit it to Congress. The three pending trade agreements, \nwhich hopefully will be considered soon, are a good case in point. \nConsider that U.S. companies have paid more than $5 billion in tariffs \nto Colombia and Panama since the trade agreements with these nations \nwere signed more than 4 years ago. That is $5 billion American \ncompanies have had to put out in the form of tariffs to these countries \nbecause these trade agreements--which were signed more than 4 years \nago--haven't entered into force.\n\n  More importantly, U.S. businesses have lost countless business \nopportunities in Korea, Colombia, and Panama. Without trade agreements \nto ensure similar treatment for our exporters, American businesses will \ncontinue to face high tariff and nontariff barriers abroad. Consider \njust one example: the market for agricultural products in Korea, which \nis the world's 13th largest economy. Korea's tariffs on imported \nagricultural goods average 54 percent compared to an average 9-percent \ntariff on these imports into the United States. Passage of the Korea \nFree Trade Agreement will level this playing field. Yet the \nadministration continues to delay sending these agreements to Congress.\n  At a time of near record unemployment and slow economic growth, this \ndelay is unacceptable. This ongoing delay is having a real impact on \nAmerican businesses and it will only get worse. The Colombian market \nfor agricultural products is another good example of the high cost of \ndelay. In 2010, for the first time in the history of U.S.-Colombia \ntrade, the United States lost to Argentina its position as Colombia's \nNo. 1 agricultural supplier.\n  Consider the story of the three main crops we grow in South Dakota--\nsoybeans, corn, and wheat. The combined market share in Colombia for \nthese three U.S. agricultural exports has decreased from 78 percent in \n2008 to 28 percent in 2010--a decline of 50 percentage points.\n  We are living in a global economy. America cannot afford to stand \nstill and to stay on the sidelines when it comes to trade. In 1960, \nexports accounted for only 3.6 percent of our entire GDP. Today, \nexports account for 12.5 percent of our GDP. Exports of U.S. goods and \nservices support over 10 million American jobs. It is long past time \nfor us to get back in the game by passing the three pending trade \nagreements and then to work aggressively to make sure our \nadministration is in a position, with trade promotion authority, to \nnegotiate new agreements that will open new market opportunities for \nAmerican business. America's manufacturers, America's farmers, and \nAmerica's service providers cannot afford to wait any longer.\n  What this amendment does, very simply, is require us to weigh and to \nevaluate and analyze the impact of delay when it comes to implementing \nthese free-trade agreements. We have seen in these examples of Colombia \nand Panama and South Korea with great clarity the economic impact--the \nloss of market share--that has occurred to many of our exporters as a \nresult of this delay. It is important we know, that American business \nknow, that the American people know what we are losing when we delay \nthese agreements, as has happened here with these three particular \nagreements.\n  It is a straightforward amendment, and I offer it to raise what I \nthink is an important issue, which is that when we get signed \nagreements, we need to take action on those. They need to be submitted, \nto be ratified and enacted by the Congress, or we are going to continue \nto lose out on critically important opportunities for American \nexporters.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, before he leaves, I simply want to say to \nthe distinguished Senator from South Dakota, who is the ranking \nRepublican on our subcommittee, that I very much enjoy working with \nhim. I have listened carefully to his remarks, and it seems to me what \nwe ought to be addressing in the Senate is our country's opportunities. \nThis is about opportunities. Trade agreements present an opportunity \nfor more exports, something--as the Senator from South Dakota touched \non--that is particularly promising for areas such as agriculture. I \nknow in South Dakota and Oregon these are huge opportunities. America \nis about exports, and free-trade agreements are about opportunities to \nexport.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance Program is about opportunities for \nour workers to update their skills. In a sense, American business is \nonly as competitive as its workers. That is why, in my view, we have \nalways had this tradition--a bipartisan tradition which I have tried to \nhighlight this afternoon--of making sure we look at every possible \nopportunity to advance trade.\n  Before the Senator came to the floor, I think I talked about--and he \nand I have talked about this--the fact that our tariffs have \nhistorically been low compared to the rest of the world; they have big \ntariffs. We have trade agreements that level the playing field, and our \nside gets more out of it than everybody else. It has been part of the \nbipartisan approach to trade. It seems to me we have the chance--and I \nhope we are heading into the home stretch, because I think the Senator \nfrom South Dakota has correctly noted it is certainly time to get this \ndone--to get this to the President's desk; that we can resolve this by \nsaying this is an opportunity to see Congress--the Senate--at its best.\n  Because we can be in the opportunities business, trade agreements \ngenerating opportunities for exports that are\n\n[[Page S5827]]\n\nclear winners for the American economy when we have unemployment, \neconomic insecurity, surging imports from Japan.\n  We need opportunities for our businesses to export, but we also need \nopportunities for our workers, and I hope that as we move into the home \nstretch of this discussion, we can see that trade adjustment assistance \nis an opportunity for our workers to update their skills. As they \nupdate their skills, that is going to make American businesses--\nparticularly our exporters--more competitive because they will have \nworkers who can take the jobs.\n  I wish to express my appreciation to the Senator from South Dakota. \nHe and I have worked very closely on a whole host of issues, in fact \nsome that I think are going to be a big part of the future debate. The \nSenator from South Dakota and I want to make sure those who manufacture \ndigital goods in our country and offer digital services get treated \nfairly in international markets. This is also a promising opportunity: \ndigital goods--software, for example--digital services such as cloud \ncomputing. Under the legislation the Senator from South Dakota and I \nhave offered, we can break down some of the barriers to those kinds of \nproducts. I am looking forward to working with him on that and a number \nof other issues.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I just want to say I thank the Senator \nfrom Oregon. He and I have worked together on a number of issues, not \nthe least of which is some of these trade issues, and I look forward to \ncontinuing that collaboration. I do believe the Senator from Oregon is \nsomeone who really understands the value of opening export \nopportunities for American businesses and has worked and advocated on \ntheir behalf in his time in the Senate.\n  I think the Senator would also understand the frustration some of us \nhave expressed, and perhaps is felt even by him and others, that these \nthings have languished for so long. I understand the issue of trade \nadjustment assistance is very important to him and many other Members \non his side of the aisle, as well as some on our side, but it strikes \nme at least that we could have been at this a lot sooner and not have \nrelinquished and given up so many of the lost market opportunities I \nmentioned in my remarks. It certainly impacts an agricultural State \nsuch as mine and many other Members who represent agricultural areas of \nthis country.\n  If you look at the loss of market share that has occurred in just \nthese last few years since we have sort of been locked out and other \ncountries have moved in to fill that vacuum, it is very frustrating to \nmany of us to have witnessed that. That is why this amendment sort of \ngets at the idea that we need to know what the economic impacts are \nwhen these trade agreements don't get dealt with. One way or the other, \nthese agreements need to get dealt with, and here we are, almost 5 \nyears later with regard to Colombia and over 4 years later with regard \nto Panama and South Korea. That is way too long for us to be out of the \ngame, so to speak, and it has cost us mightly. So I hope we can get \nthese done.\n  He is right, we have a process in place that I hope will enable us to \nfinally accomplish this. But we ought to make sure that doesn't happen \nagain in the future.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, we are prepared to vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 642\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Under the previous order, the \nquestion occurs on amendment No. 642 offered by the Senator from Utah, \nMr. Hatch, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of my amendment No. 642. \nIt is fairly simple. It tightens the nexus between TAA benefits and \nactual jobs lost because of trade by requiring a stricter standard to \nreceive TAA benefits. The expanded TAA benefit offered by my friends \nacross the aisle continues the ``contributed importantly'' standard \nthat says if trade is a cause which is important, but not necessarily \nmore important than any other cause of the job loss, TAA benefits can \nbe provided. That is not a tight nexus.\n  As a result, many workers are eligible for TAA benefits even if their \njob loss was not caused by trade. My amendment requires that trade \nwould have to be a ``substantial cause'' of job loss for TAA benefits \nto be available. This standard was established by President Reagan when \nhe constrained spending on TAA.\n  By returning to the stricter TAA standard, this amendment puts \nreasonable constraints on the program to stop it from expanding into \nanother out-of-control spending program.\n  I ask my colleagues to help the American taxpayers and constrain TAA \nspending by supporting this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Hatch \namendment. In a time of surging Chinese imports, high unemployment, and \nwidespread economic pain, the Hatch amendment would make it harder for \nworkers, companies, and farmers to obtain trade adjustment assistance \nin order to be able to compete in the global economy. Specifically, the \nHatch amendment would take Congress back to a standard for qualifying \nfor TAA benefits that was a demonstrated failure in the early 1980s.\n  Chairman Baucus and Chairman Camp have put together a reasonable TAA \nagreement. It is bipartisan. That bipartisan agreement ought to be \npreserved, which is why the amendment by the Senator from Utah should \nbe rejected.\n  I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, the question occurs \non amendment No. 645, offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, \nwith 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It eliminates \none small piece of the TAA Program called TAA for Firms.\n  Now, why would I do this? Strictly for bipartisan reasons, to \ndemonstrate my agreement with President Obama, who also supports the \nrepeal of this particular piece of the TAA. In his budget submission of \nthis year, it specifically recommended the elimination of this program. \nIt is only $16 million a year, but it is inefficient. As the \nPresident's budget pointed out, it does not achieve its objectives as \nwell as other programs do.\n  Measured against other programs, the firms that are supposedly helped \nactually fail at a bigger rate than other firms that are not in the \nprogram. As a result, I decided I would support one of the elements of \nthe President's budget: to eliminate this TAA for Firms Program.\n  Friends, if we are serious about any kind of reform for TAA, surely \nwe can agree upon a clearly bipartisan proposal of the President of the \nUnited States, which is supported by Republicans in the Senate. I ask \nfor your support for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Kyl \namendment. It is an antismall business amendment. There is a lot of \ntalk around here about government getting out of the way of job \ncreators, but let's be clear. Firms using TAA are those job creators. \nThey are small businesses such as RBB Systems in Wooster, OH, CB \nManufacturing in West Carrollton, and auto and truck suppliers in \nBolivar.\n  In my State alone, 96 percent of companies assisted with TAA for \nFirms--this program that Senator Kyl wants to eliminate--96 percent of \nthose companies that were in business in 2006 are still in business.\n  When a job creator goes out of business because of an unfair trade \ndeal, we know what happens. Workers lose their jobs, communities lose \nrevenues, funds for schools are cut, funds for public services.\n  TAA is a lifeline not just for workers, but this program for firms, \nTAA for Firms, is a lifeline for small businesses and community schools \nand all of that which matters to our tax base and our communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Kyl amendment.\n  Mr. KYL.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Moldova\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the original Jackson-Vanik amendment was \noffered to the Trade Act of 1974, and it was led in this body by the \ngreat Democratic Senator of Washington, Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson. That \namendment prohibited the United States from entering into Permanent \nNormal Trade Relations with any country that placed restrictions on the \nfreedom of emigration and other human rights of its people. This law \nwas later expanded to cover countries with non-market economies. The \nmajor impact of the Jackson-Vanik restriction was that it prevented the \nUnited States from granting ``most-favored nation'' trading status to \nthe Soviet Union, which at the time was placing awful restrictions on \nthe ability of its Jewish citizens to emigrate and flee the persecution \nthey experienced behind the Iron Curtain.\n  Jackson-Vanik applied to Moldova when it was part of the Soviet \nUnion, and it remained in place following Moldova's independence 20 \nyears ago. This made sense at the time, because the country continued \nto be ruled by communist governments, which ensured an unfortunate \ncontinuity with Moldova's Soviet past at a time when the country's \nneighbors were reaping the benefits of liberation.\n  But Mr. President, the situation in Moldova is now fundamentally \nchanged. In August 2009, a coalition of democratic and reformist \nparties managed to win power in what international organizations deemed \na free and fair election. For the first time in two decades, Moldova \nhad a noncommunist government, and with it, the potential for real \nreform. The goal of this coalition is reflected in the name that they \nhave given themselves: the Alliance for European Integration. Their \nplatform is to deepen Moldova's democratic institutions, pursue free \nmarket reforms, fight corruption, and work on integrating Moldova into \nEuro-Atlantic institutions. This is a new generation of leaders, and \nthey represent the great hopes of their citizens.\n  I visited Moldova in June. I met at length with their Prime Minister \nand other senior leaders, and I can tell you firsthand this government \nis committed to leading Moldova toward a future of political and \neconomic freedom.\n\n[[Page S5829]]\n\nYes, major challenges remain to the realization of this vision, but for \nthe first time in Moldova's history as an independent nation, its \ncurrent government is on the right track. They are pursuing the right \ngoals and policies. Their intentions are good and admirable.\n  In the face of continued opposition from elements in Moldova that \nwant to drag the country back to its troubled past, the current \ngovernment is trying to move the country forward. They are taking on \nthe hard challenges. When I asked how we in the United States could \nbest support their efforts, all they asked of me--all they asked of us \nin Congress--is one thing: It is not additional foreign assistance. It \nis not more of our taxpayers' dollars, although that assistance is \nimportant too. It is the repeal of Jackson-Vanik, so Moldovans can \ndevelop their own country, grow their own economy, and deepen their own \nfree market reforms through normal trading relations with the United \nStates. Nothing we could do would provide greater moral and material \nsupport for Moldova's reformers.\n  I wish to thank Senator Baucus for his continued support of the \npeople and the country of Moldova. I understand that any amendment to \nthe legislation that is pending would be harmful to the progress of the \ntrade agreements, and I appreciate that fact and hope the chairman can \nperhaps--hopefully before the end of the year--take up the repeal of \nJackson-Vanik as it applies to the country of Moldova, a country that \nis very much in need of it.\n  I want to read a statement made by Vice President Biden during his \nvisit to Moldova this year.\n  He said:\n\n       We will work with the Congress and with your government to \n     lift the Jackson-Vanik amendment and establish permanent \n     trade relations. We believe that will be good for Moldova and \n     for the United States.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the National Council on Soviet Jewry concerning Moldova.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                               National Conference\n\n\n                                              on Soviet Jewry,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 2010.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of NCSJ, I want to state our \n     support for the graduation of the Republicof Moldova from the \n     Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Moldova has satisfied the \n     requirements of the two areas central to the Amendment's \n     intent: Jews are free to emigrate, in accordance with the \n     Helsinki Final Act and established principles of \n     international law; those who choose to remain in Moldova can \n     practice Judaism and participate in Jewish culture and \n     language without reservation.\n       Jewish community life has flourished since the dissolution \n     of the Soviet Union. Synagogues, community centers and \n     schools serve the community without government interference.\n       While incidents of popular anti-Semitism and intolerance \n     still take place in Moldova, NCSJ has been working with the \n     Moldovan government through a variety of avenues, including \n     the OSCE, to address these issues. In January, when Prime \n     Minister Filat met with the American Jewish community and \n     testified before the U.S. Helsinki Commission, he committed \n     to reforming Moldova's law on preventing and combating \n     discrimination.\n       Moldova has been admitted to the WTO but still falls under \n     the strictures of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. We hope that \n     you will find an appropriate legislative vehicle to graduate \n     Moldova from Jackson-Vanik.\n       If you or your staff have any questions, please contact me \n     at your convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mark B. Levin,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I again thank the chairman for his consideration and for \nhis continued support for the people of Moldova.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much thank my friend for bringing \nthis up. Moldova is a country which joined the World Trade Organization \nin 2001, and for various reasons--basically, it is Jackson-Vanik or the \nrelic of Jackson-Vanik--Moldova has not been granted PNTR. But Moldova \nhas made huge, successful strides in its government, in its political \nand economic reforms. I am very impressed with Moldova. It is a friend \nto the United States.\n  Although we cannot deal with that issue on this bill, I want to make \nit very clear to my friend from Arizona that we will take up \nlegislation this year to ensure that Moldova is granted PNTR status and \nbecomes a full member in the world community. I make that pledge to my \nfriend from Arizona to get that done this year.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the chairman. I know he has an incredibly heavy \nschedule, with the legislation before us today and other matters before \nthe committee, but I also know he knows--and I want to assure him--when \nthe people of Moldova hear of his commitment, this will be a happy day \nin Moldova. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. And I thank the Senator for standing for the people of \nMoldova.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senate is in consideration of trade \npolicy this week with an extension of the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nProgram. TAA is the main way we help American workers cope with the \nnegative effects of our globalized economy. It is a crucial program in \nboth good times and bad, and it must be renewed.\n  TAA helps workers who have lost jobs through no fault of their own, \nbut rather because of increased competition from imports or because of \noffshoring. TAA provides workers with critical income support, job \ntraining, job search and relocation assistance, and assistance with \nhealth insurance premiums. TAA relieves some of the hardship these \nworkers face--helping them get back on their feet and back into jobs.\n  Trade adjustment assistance is designed to help these workers with \nunique needs. Workers who qualify for TAA are mostly older workers--\nmore than half are over age 45--and they often have a hard time getting \nback into the workforce. Unfortunately, we have all heard many sad \nstories about workers in their fifties or sixties spending years \nlooking for new work. Many have been at their jobs for decades. They \noften do not have education beyond high school. For these workers \nespecially, the job training and other services offered by TAA are a \nway for workers to gain new skills and enter into new and growing \nindustries or occupations.\n  We have watched the middle class struggle over the last several \ndecades. We see that incomes are stagnating, health insurance and other \ncosts are skyrocketing, good jobs are disappearing. There are many \nreasons for this, but unfair trade agreements and the failure to \nenforce our trade laws are certainly among them. When cheaper imports \ncome in to the U.S., American workers making competing goods or \nproviding competing services can lose their jobs as their companies \nlose business. We have watched manufacturing companies and \nmanufacturing jobs disappear, and now jobs in the service sector are \nbeing offshored as well.\n  So there is no question that TAA must continue. The thousands of \nworkers who have been laid off as a result of trade are depending on \nus, as will the thousands more who could lose jobs in the future.\n  We also have to restore improvements to the program that were \nincluded in the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, but which \nexpired earlier this year. These improvements updated TAA to respond \nbetter to our changed economy. The provisions made sure that more \nresources were available for workers to go back to school and get \ntraining in a new field. They also extended TAA to workers in the \nservice sector--in addition to manufacturing workers already covered. \nThey also ensured that the program was available to workers whose jobs \nhave been shipped to any country, like China or India, even where the \nUS does not have a free trade agreement.\n  This expansion has been very successful. More than 4 out of 10 \nworkers--nearly 200,000--who qualified for TAA from the passage of the \nRecovery Act until those provisions expired earlier this year, \nqualified because of the Recovery Act provisions. In my State of Iowa, \na third of the 4,100 workers that qualified in that time period did so \nunder the new provisions. Some of the workers who have participated in \nthe TAA program had worked at companies that are well known in my \nState: 1,100 workers from Electrolux alone were certified eligible for \nTAA.\n  My State of Iowa has suffered many layoffs as jobs have been shipped\n\n[[Page S5830]]\n\nabroad, especially in the manufacturing sector. I have received many \nletters from Iowans who have been able to take advantage of TAA. One \nperson who was laid off from her factory job went back to school to \nbecome a licensed practical nurse, and she hoped to go on to become a \nregistered nurse. Another Iowan wrote of how important the health care \ntax credit has been to her and her husband, who was one of 300 people \nlaid off from his company. Another Iowan wrote about how her job was \nbeing shipped to China; she was thinking of using TAA services to go \nback to college.\n  A related program, the TAA Community College and Career Training \nGrants Program will be extremely beneficial to workers through the \ncommunity college system in Iowa and other states. I am thankful that \nthis program will soon move ahead, and I understand that grant \nrecipients will be announced next week.\n  This grant program will provide to community colleges in every State \nfunds they desperately need to build capacity and meet training demands \nfor 21st century jobs. The funds will total $500 million a year for 4 \nyears, a huge and necessary injection of funds into the community \ncollege system. The grants will enable local leaders from the \neducation, workforce, economic development, and business communities to \nwork together to develop and expand programs as they help workers \nsucceed in acquiring the skills, degrees, and credentials needed for \nhigh-wage, high-skill employment while also meeting the needs of \nemployers for skilled workers. Community colleges and their partners \ncan use the funds to develop innovative programs or replicate evidence-\nbased strategies.\n  The advanced manufacturing and health care sectors are among the \nlargest and fastest-growing sectors in the Iowa economy, and recent \nprojections indicate that employers in these sectors will continue to \nneed workers with advanced skills to fill vacancies. TAA training \ngrants support the training of these workers. Iowa Central Community \nCollege, for example, has developed an entrepreneurism and business \ndevelopment program to respond to regional needs. Iowa Lakes Community \nCollege has started a wind turbine program--one of the first of its \nkind in the country--that prepares workers for ``green-collar'' jobs \nand ensures that graduates have the skills that area employers need.\n  I am very hopeful that we will reauthorize TAA this week. When we \npass this legislation, we will ensure that a wider range of workers can \ncontinue to access TAA benefits and services, and that resources are \navailable so that workers are prepared for high-skill jobs with family-\nsustaining wages. We owe American workers nothing less.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, by sad coincidence, America lost two women \nthis past weekend women we had watched grow from little girls into \naccomplished women. Kara Kennedy and Eleanor Mondale Poling were both \nmembers of this Senate family.\n  Kara was the daughter of Senator Edward Kennedy and his wife Joan. \nEleanor was the daughter of former Senator and former Vice President \nWalter Mondale and his wife Joan. Both women fought brave, against-the-\nodds battles against cancer in recent years.\n  Ted and Joan Kennedy named their first-born Kara, a name that means \n``dear little one'' in the old Irish language--and that is what she \nalways was to her parents. Like the rest of her famous family, Kara was \ncommitted to helping those less fortunate than herself. After \ngraduating from Tufts University, she worked as a filmmaker and was \nactive in a number of causes.\n  In 2002, she was diagnosed with lung cancer. Her doctors gave her 1 \nyear to live. But Kara and her family refused to give up. She underwent \nsurgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Her father accompanied \nher to her chemotherapy treatments.\n  It seemed that Kara had beaten cancer. But Friday night, she \ncollapsed after her usual workout at the gym. Her brother, former \nCongressman Patrick Kennedy, said that cancer surgery and years of \ngrueling chemotherapy and radiation treatment had taken a devastating \ntoll on his sister's strength and her heart simply gave out.\n  In addition to her mother Joan and stepmother Vickie, Kara leaves \nbehind three brothers and a sister, a multitude of cousins and nieces \nand nephews, and her two beloved children, Max, 14, and Grace, who \nturned 17 yesterday.\n  Eleanor Mondale Poling was just 4 years old when her father was \nappointed to fill the Senate seat vacated by Hubert Humphrey, who had \njust become Vice President of the United States. Like Kara Kennedy, she \ngrew up in this Senate and in the public eye. She was 17 when her \nfather became Vice President of the United States.\n  As a young woman, Eleanor Mondale made her own career in \nbroadcasting, beginning with a job as a radio D.J. in Chicago. She \nwould go on to work for a number of TV organizations. In 2005, Eleanor \nMondale married Chan Poling. The couple lived on a farm in Prior Lake, \nMN, surrounded by animals, which Eleanor loved.\n  That same year, 2005, Eleanor was diagnosed with an aggressive form \nof brain cancer. The next 6 years would bring multiple surgeries, \nchemotherapy and radiation, and at least twice apparent remissions. But \nthe cancer came back in 2009. Eleanor Mondale Poling died at home on \nher farm early Saturday.\n  In addition to her parents, Eleanor leaves her two brothers, Ted \nMondale, a former Minnesota State senator, and William Mondale, the \nformer assistant attorney general of Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/21/senate-section/article/S5830-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5830-S5831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING HARRY ``BUS'' YOURELL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I previously filed committee allocations \nand budgetary aggregates pursuant to section 106 of the Budget Control \nAct of 2011. Today, I am adjusting some of those levels, specifically \nthe allocation to the Committee on Appropriations for fiscal year 2012 \nand the budgetary aggregates for fiscal year 2012.\n  Section 101 of the Budget Control Act allows for various adjustments \nto the statutory limits on discretionary spending, while section 106(d) \nallows the chairman of the Budget Committee to make revisions to \nallocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments. \nThe Committee on Appropriations reported three bills last week that are \neligible for adjustments under the Budget Control Act. Consequently, I \nam making adjustments to the 2012 allocation to the Committee on \nAppropriations and to the 2012 aggregates for spending by a total of \n$117.885 billion in budget authority and $59.677 billion in outlays. \nThose adjustments reflect the sum of $302 million in budget authority \nand $136 million in outlays for funding designated for disaster relief \nand $117.583 billion in budget authority and $59.541 billion in outlays \nfor funding designated as being for overseas contingency operations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the \nchanges to the allocation to the Committee on Appropriations and the \nbudgetary aggregates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as

Mr. President, earlier this month, Vermont's Governor \nPeter Shumlin appointed Sydney Lea to serve as Vermont's new Poet \nLaureate. This honor has been bestowed to Vermonters whose poetry \nmanifests a high degree of excellence since Governor Kunin \nreestablished the position of Poet Laureate in 1988. Sydney Lea is \ncertainly deserving of this honor.\n  A resident of Newbury, VT, Sydney has written a number of poetry \ncollections including Young of the Year, Ghost Pain, Pursuit of a \nWound, and The Floating Candles to name a few. His pieces have been \npublished in the New York Times, the New Yorker, the New Republic, \nSports Illustrated, and many others. In 2000, his poem, Pursuit of a \nWound, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for poetry. In 1998, he \nwas a cowinner of the Poets' Prize, one of the nation's highest honors \nfor a single collection of poems.\n  Sydney has taught at Dartmouth, Wesleyan, and Middlebury College as \nwell as the University of Vermont and Yale University. He has also \nspent time teaching at the Franklin College in Switzerland and the \nNational Hungarian University in Budapest. His dedication to and love \nfor the written word has inspired hundreds of students in Vermont and \naround the globe. As a Central Vermont Adult Basic Education board \nmember, he continues to see education as a lifelong process.

Mr. President, September marks the start of a month-long \ncelebration of the Hispanic community's contributions to America's \nexceptionalism and the strength of the common values that unite our \nNation.\n  We celebrate a community whose accomplishments and stories remind us \nthat the American Dream is as alive today as it has ever been.\n  During this same time, our Nation faces an unemployment rate of 9.1 \npercent, and the Hispanic community struggles with a rate over 11 \npercent. Now more than ever, we must fight for pro-growth policies that \nwill allow my generation to continue the great tradition of leaving our \nchildren a stronger and more prosperous America than the one we \ninherited from our parents.\n  Hispanic Heritage Month is a time to celebrate the American dream. We \ncelebrate people like my parents, who came from Cuba, worked hard and \nopened doors for their children that were closed to them. We celebrate \na community where the number of young adults enrolling in college has \ngrown by 349,000 in the last year. We salute the many Hispanic men and \nwomen fighting for our freedom in our armed forces. We also remember \nhow lucky we are to live in a country where success is not limited by \nthe circumstances of one's birth.\n  I am proud to be an American of Cuban descent, and today I would like \nto celebrate the many Hispanic Americans whose talents, \naccomplishments, and cultures have strengthened America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/21/senate-section/article/S5832-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRESS CAN LEARN FROM TOM EVANS' DAY\n\n  Mr. COONS.

The \n     automaker continued operations, paid off the loans that had \n     been guaranteed by U.S. taxpayers, and repaid $350 million to \n     the U.S. Treasury, rewarding taxpayers for the risk that was \n     taken.\n       Another direct benefit for Delawareans was that the Newark \n     assembly plant remained open for 28 years.\n       The Coastal Barrier Resources Act stopped federal subsidies \n     and assistance for the development of fragile coastal barrier \n     areas. The act was initially opposed by both Democratic and \n     Republican members of Congress, reflecting the opposition of \n     major land developers.

Mr. President, as a member of the Congressional \nCoalition on Adoption Institute, I have the honor and privilege each \nyear to recognize a West Virginia family for efforts to promote \nadoption. This is an exceptional program that highlights how policies \nand programs can change a child's life. In 1997, I worked on the \nbipartisan Adoption and Safe Families Act which sought to increase \nadoptions and improve foster care. Much work remains, but real progress \nhas been made in encouraging adoptions.\n  While policy can help, the real angels are the families who open \ntheir hearts and homes to vulnerable children. There are many wonderful \nstories but in 2011 I have nominated Nick and Jorun Picciano as Angels \nin Adoption.\n  These caring parents already have teenage children, and they have \nincredibly hectic, fulfilling lives as paramedics. But they noticed \nthat some of the children they met on the job were victims of abuse or \nneglect. As paramedics, they sadly saw a parent who was more interested \nin returning to a party than taking care of her burned child. According \nto their story, this was a turning point for them. They sought \ninformation about foster parenting, and they worked to find a program \nthat would accommodate their challenging schedules.\n  Nick and Jorun were approved and welcomed a toddler into their home \nin 2009. They honestly admitted it had been a long time since they had \ncared for such a young child, and he already had challenging problems \nof nightmares, being separated from his siblings, and recovering from \ncontact with his biological parents. This 3-year-old had already been \nplaced in four different homes. But kindness, patience and love make a \nhuge difference.\n  In 2011, after his parents decided to voluntarily relinquish their \nparental rights, the Picciano family was able to adopt their son, \nJoshua Nicholas Picciano. Joshua joins his older siblings, Jacob Hively \nwho is 16, Michaela Hively who is 14, Jacynda Hively who is 13, and \nLucia Picciano who is 13. And\n\n[[Page S5833]]\n\nthis extraordinary family continues to welcome vulnerable children \nincluding two foster girls, ages 7 and 9, into their hearts and home. \nThis is a special family, and they deserve our admiration.\n  I believe their willingness to see the tragedy of abuse and neglect \nin their challenging work as paramedics and their decision to make a \npersonal difference by opening their own home and family to vulnerable \nchildren is a remarkable, inspiring story that has earned them the \ndistinction of Angels in Adoption.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/21/senate-section/article/S5833-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CHILD AND FAMILY SERVICES IMPROVEMENT AND INNOVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my strong \nsupport for the Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation \nAct that the Finance Committee approved yesterday. This is an important \nbipartisan and bicameral bill that deserves to pass and become law. I \nam proud to be a cosponsor and I congratulate Chairman Baucus and \nRanking Member Hatch for their leadership on the important issue of \nadoption and prevention services for vulnerable children.\n  Over the years, I have been proud of the Finance Committee's \nbipartisan work to encourage adoption and improve child welfare \nservices for our most vulnerable children, those who are at risk of \nabuse and neglect in their own homes. It is inspiring to know that, \neven now, members can come together to work on such critical issues. \nBipartisan bills like this one may not attract headlines, but the \npolicies and programs can change the lives of children and families.\n  This package continues previous investments in children and families, \nand it makes improvements on what lessons have been learned over the \npast 5 years. I am proud that the legislation continues to invest in \nthe court improvement program that is making such a difference in West \nVirginia, and the country. Our judges are an essential partnership in \nthe child welfare system because they decide when a child can return \nhome safely or if adoption is the better permanency plan for a child. \nIt is a difficult decision to make. Judges deserve specialized training \nin child development and trauma to help in their decision because this \nis not always provided at law school, but it is a critical factor in \nsuch cases. I am proud of our State training on trauma. The bill also \ncontinues the competitive grant program to combat substance abuse and \nto evaluate the grants so we make wise investments in the future. The \nbill invests in caseworker visits because such visits are the basics of \ngood practice and essential for child safety and care.\n  As a former Governor, I support providing waiver authority for states \nto continue to try innovative programs. Under previous waivers, it \nbecame clear that kinship care was a good option for many children in \nthe foster care system. I hope that our States will be creative in \nusing this new opportunity to provide guidance for additional child \nwelfare reform that is truly needed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/21/senate-section/article/S5833-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNIZING OHIO'S GLENN RESEARCH CENTER\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the men and \nwomen of NASA Glenn Research Center in my home State of Ohio for their \nachievements in the design, build, and test of the new space \nenvironmental test capability for the Space Power Facility at Plum \nBrook Station. These new capabilities will advance the human \nexploration of space, ensure the safety of our astronauts, drive \nscientific advances and technology development, and enrich the lives of \nall people and inspire our next generation of explorers throughout the \nUnited States and the world.\n  Seventy years ago, during World War II, the United States sought \nsites for ordnance facilities to help defeat totalitarianism. In quiet \nErie County, OH, between major highways and acres of farmland, the Army \nCorps of Engineers created Plum Brook, a facility that would first be \nhome to a munitions factory, and for the last 50 years, Plum Brook \nStation has continued to serve our Nation as a one-of-a kind facility \nthat has ensured the success of our Nation's space program.\n  Throughout its history, Plum Brook remained vital to our Nation's \nsecurity and our Nation's exploration of space. The National Advisory \nCouncil for Aeronautics, NACA, the predecessor to the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, built a facility to test \nthe nuclear power sources for airplanes and spacecraft that would be \ndesigned at Lewis Field--later to be NASA Glenn Research Center--in \nCleveland, OH.\n  When President John F. Kennedy announced that the United States would \npush the boundaries of science and innovation to explore the heavens, \nPlum Brook Station became a world-class test site for the new \nspacecraft. A thermal vacuum chamber, called the Space Power Facility, \nwas built to simulate the harsh space environment. At 100 feet wide and \n122 feet high, it remains the largest thermal vacuum chamber in the \nworld.\n  In 2007, as NASA began to develop a new path for human space \nexploration, the men and women of NASA Glenn at Lewis Field and Plum \nBrook Station rose to the challenge to develop a test capability that \nwould push the boundaries of spacecraft testing. The new spacecraft \nwill continue the United States' legacy of carrying American pioneers \nbeyond Earth's orbit, but will experience launch and space environments \nthat never before have been experienced. The Space Environmental Test \nFacility will allow NASA to test its new spacecraft to these new \nextremes--ensuring the safety of our Nation's astronauts and the \nsuccess of our space exploration mission.\n  To keep our crews safe, the test capabilities of Plum Brook Station \nwere expanded beyond that of the largest thermal vacuum chamber in the \nworld. These include: a state-of-the-art sine-vibration table that has \nthe largest capacity for payload size and weight in the world, the \nlargest electromagnetic reverberant chamber in the world, and the most \npowerful acoustic facility in the world capable of simulating launch \nenvironments for developmental spacecraft. This facility is now the \ncrown jewel of NASA's test capabilities.\n  I have had the privilege to meet many of the scientists, engineers, \nand technicians who made this achievement possible. They are dedicated \nand compassionate, and guided by the scientific patriotism that \ndisplays a Nation's pursuit in understanding the world in which we all \nlive.\n  These pioneers of NASA Glenn will continue to push the boundaries of \nspaceflight--fueling technology advancements and inspiring our children \nto follow in the footsteps of great Ohioans like Neil Armstrong and \nJohn Glenn. The scientists and engineers of NASA Glenn will ensure the \nsuccess of the next generation of pioneers.\n  Our Nation is defined by the spirit of discovery, the pioneers who \npushed westward on land, navigated the oceans, and are now sending \nhumankind into what was once a mere vision seen only through Galileo's \neye. We are a nation of pioneers. And we all have a responsibility to \nsafeguard that defining American spirit and to inspire a new generation \nof American explorers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/21/senate-section/article/S5833-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5833-S5834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REMEMBERING ERNEST HOUSE, SR.\n\n Mr. BENNET.

The Honorable Ernest House Sr. served more than 30 \nyears in tribal leadership, including four terms as tribal chairman of \nthe Ute Mountain Ute Tribe in southwest Colorado. He was first elected \nto the Ute Mountain Ute Tribal Council in 1979 and elected chairman in \n1982. Throughout his long tenure as a tribal council member and \nchairman, he actively and effectively worked for the betterment of the \nUte Mountain Ute Tribe.\n  Mr. House Sr. was an unassuming, yet forceful leader on many issues \nimportant to the people of his tribe, including natural resources \ndevelopment, law enforcement and support for tribal business \nenterprises. His leadership on water issues helped to complete the \ncritical Dolores and Animas-La Plata water projects in southwest \nColorado that benefited not only his tribe, but also the entire region. \nHe was a strong\n\n[[Page S5834]]\n\nadvocate for keeping the Ute Mountain Tribal Park in pristine and \nundeveloped condition.\n  As the grandson of Chief Jack House, the last traditional chief of \nthe Ute Mountain Ute Tribe, Ernest House Sr. was raised from a young \nage to be a leader of his tribe. And he proved himself equal to the \ntask. In his years of leadership, he was widely respected for his \nability to bring people together and get results for his tribe and the \ngreater Four Corners community. Ernest House Sr. worked his entire life \nto move his tribe forward while still maintaining its traditional \ntribal identity and heritage.

The C-130E team \nsnagged the Best Overall Maintenance Team award, Best Team Overall--\nMaintenance and Operations--Best Overall Aircrew Team.\n  This outstanding crew, led by COL Mark Czelusta, excelled during the \ninternational air rodeo competition which draws the ``Best of the \nBest'' from air forces around the world. More than 40 teams and 2,500 \npeople from the U.S. Air Force, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, \nand selected foreign countries participated in this competition.\n  The group put in hours of hard work and deservedly earned these \nawards. In true Arkansas spirit of teamwork COL Czelusta acknowledges \nthis couldnt have been done without the help of the 19th Airlift Wing \nand the community.\n  The 19th Airlift Wing also took home accolades. Members of the team \nwere recognized as the Best C-130 Airdrop Aircrew.\n  What is even more amazing is that these crews accomplished this after \nhaving a major destruction to the Little Rock Air Force base in late \nApril when a tornado damaged three C-130 planes and blew roofs off and \ndamaged buildings in the base's flight line area.\n  I am proud to represent the 314th Airlift Wing Air Mobility RODEO \n2011 team and the 19th Airlift Wing for all of their accomplishments. \nWe are grateful for their service and thank them for their dedication \nto success and the sacrifice they make to protect our freedoms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/21/senate-section/article/S5834-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KEITH OLSEN\n\n Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, today I recognize Keith Olsen for \nthe dedicated leadership he has provided for Nebraska agriculture.\n  Through his involvement in various State and national organizations, \nKeith has brought a renewed focus on supporting youth in agriculture. \nHe has taken an active role in ensuring that the views of farmers and \nranchers are communicated to policymakers in both Lincoln and \nWashington, DC.\n  Keith has been integral in the development of a vision for the \nUniversity of Nebraska, the State's land-grant university. And, he has \ntaken a leadership role in educating the public about modern \nagriculture practices.\n  Internationally, Keith has represented Nebraska farmers on trade \nmissions around the world. He has promoted our food and agriculture \nexports in a number of countries, including Japan, Russia, Turkey, and \nBrazil.\n  Keith Olsen was born in Imperial, NE and was raised on the family \nfarm near Venango. In high school, Keith was involved in FFA, and his \nchildren have been involved in 4-H and FFA. He served as a 4-H leader \nfor 30 years. He graduated from Grant High School and the University of \nNebraska at Lincoln, where he majored in agricultural economics.\n  After college, Keith returned to Perkins County to farm with his \nfather. He married his wife Doris in 1969, and, at the age of 24, Keith \nand Doris took over the family farm. The Olsens have three sons--Craig, \nJeff and Curtis. They are also the proud grandparents of seven. Now in \nits fourth generation, the Olsen farm is a no-till, dryland operation \nraising certified seed wheat, wheat, dry peas, and corn.\n  Keith has served on the Nebraska Farm Bureau Board of Directors since \n1992 and was elected to the American Farm Bureau Federation Board of \nDirectors in 2004. He was elected as first vice president of the \nNebraska Farm Bureau Board in 1997 and has served as president since \n2002.\n  Keith has been widely recognized for his support of agriculture, \nincluding youth and young farmers and ranchers. He received the 2010 \nAgricultural Youth Institute Award of Merit, the 2011 Nebraska FFA \nHonorary State FFA degree, and in 2004, he was elected to the Nebraska \nHall of Agriculture Achievement.\n  As great of an ambassador as Keith has been for Nebraska agriculture, \nhe is an even better man. His principled approach coupled with his \nkindness and compassion for others has earned him the respect of many--\nincluding me. I congratulate Keith on completing a very successful \ntenure as Nebraska Farm Bureau president and wish him and his family \nthe very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/21/senate-section/article/S5834-3", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5834-S5835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RICH WILSON\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, just a few days ago I received a \nspecial gift from a consummate mariner, Rich Wilson of Marblehead, MA, \nthe skipper of the Great American III. The gift was a U.S. Yacht \nEnsign, the red, white and blue flag used to identify American licensed \nyachts since 1848. What made this particular Ensign so special is that \nRich flew it aboard the Great American III on December 10, 2008, in the \nsolo, nonstop, around-the-world sailing race known as the Vendee Globe.\n  Rich flew the Ensign on his 31st day at sea from France, just as he \nwas entering the Indian Ocean bound for Cape Horn. Ninety days later, \nRich and the 60-foot Great American III completed their 28,000-mile \nglobal trek from France to France, ninth among the 11 finishers of a \nrace that began with 30 boats. Rich was the only American entry, the \noldest skipper in the fleet at 58 years of age, and only the second \nAmerican ever to finish the Vendee Globe in its six quadrennial \nrunnings.\n  The Vendee Globe is widely regarded as the Mount Everest of the seas. \nBut, in fact, it is even a greater challenge than climbing Mount \nEverest. Consider the fact that while 3,000 people have climbed Mount \nEverest, Rich was only the 46th person ever to sail alone around the \nworld nonstop. Consider, too, the fact that some 500 astronauts have \nflown in space, and that further underscores just how rare and special \nRich's accomplishment in the Vendee Globe truly is.\n  The Vendee Globe is like no other event on this earth. It is a \ngrueling contest largely unsullied by hype and commerce, a competition \nof men and women against each other but mostly against the ceaselessly \nmoving sea, sometimes playful, sometimes terrifying, an immense power \ninspiring admiration, caution and, above all, respect.\n  But in the hands of Rich Wilson, the Vendee Globe also became a \nlearning experience for students and newspaper readers throughout the \nworld. As with his earlier long-distance ocean voyages, Rich shared his \nVendee Globe experience through the online company he founded, \nwww.sitesalive.com, a nonprofit that has produced 75 live, interactive, \nfull-semester programs linking K-12 classrooms to adventures and \nexpeditions worldwide. During the 2008-2009 Vendee Globe, \nsitesalive.com shared Rich's 15-part weekly series, written at sea from \nthe Great American, with 250,000 students and 7 million readers.\n  Rich's goal was to excite students and engage students by connecting\n\n[[Page S5835]]\n\nthem to a live ocean expedition. As Rich explains it the reasoning \nbehind sitesalive.com: ``Excite a kid with dolphins, flying fish, and \ngales at sea, or with snakes, bugs, and bats in the rainforest, and \nthey will pay attention, not knowing what will happen next. Then the \nscience, geography, and math flow freely.''\n  Anyone who enjoyed high seas adventure novels like Moby-Dick and \nTreasure Island or anyone who marveled at National Geographic \nexpeditions or the adventures of Jacques Cousteau on the Calypso can \nunderstand how Rich is making the world come alive for students. And \nanyone who has sailed, even within sight of the shore, or who has run a \nmarathon or has hiked a mountain range can appreciate the skill, \nconditioning, and discipline it took for Rich to complete Vendee Globe.\n  I thank Rich for the Ensign, the memento from his great adventure, \nand I congratulate him, not only for completing his great voyage but \nalso for sharing it online with millions of people around the world. \nAnd as he considers whether to enter the Vendee Globe again in 2012, I \nurge him to once again climb aboard the Great American III and set \nsail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/21/senate-section/article/S5835-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING PRESENTATION COLLEGE\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Presentation \nCollege in Aberdeen, SD, as it celebrates its 60th anniversary on \nSeptember 23 and 24.\n  Presentation College is an independent Catholic educational \ninstitution that has been sponsored by the Sisters of the Presentation \nof the Blessed Virgin Mary since 1951. The school, which is located on \na scenic 100-acre campus in northern Aberdeen, originally started with \nfemale-only nursing and health sciences programs. In 1968, the \ninstitution became co-educational. Presentation College encourages its \nstudents to develop an understanding of life at all stages. The \nChristian environment of the school focuses on the principles and \nteachings of the church, while welcoming students from all faiths.\n  This small but proud school is also a division III member of NCAA \nathletics, and 2011 is an exciting year for the school as it marks the \ninaugural season for the first football team in the school's history. \nIn both its athletic programs as well as with the general student \npopulation, Presentation College places a strong emphasis on developing \ntheir students into capable, active leaders who have the ability to \naffect positive change throughout the world.\n  Presentation College has experienced a number of changes over the \nyears. From its inception as a nursing school to the community force it \nhas become today, the school has built an impressive reputation over \nthe last 60 years. As it celebrates this landmark event, I commend \nPresentation College on its commitment to improving the community of \nAberdeen, providing academic excellence to students across the country, \nand standing as a pillar for the State of South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/21/senate-section/article/S5835-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5835]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \n PERSONS WHO COMMIT, THREATEN TO COMMIT, OR SUPPORT TERRORISM THAT WAS \n   ESTABLISHED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13224 ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2001--PM 23\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to require the Secretary of Commerce to establish a \nClean Energy Technology Manufacturing and Export Assistance Program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Tom Udall to \nintroduce the Clean Energy Technology Manufacturing and Export \nAssistance Act of 2011. Recently, the United States Council for \nInternational Business, which represents America's top global \ncompanies, joined with an array of leading U.S. business groups in \nurging ramped-up efforts to promote U.S. clean energy exports.\n  Global demand, particularly in rapidly-growing markets such as \nBrazil, China, India and Russia, will be especially critical in \nexpanding America's clean energy technology industries and driving U.S. \nleadership of a 21st Century clean energy economy. According to a \nreport by the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with \nChina in clean energy products more than doubled from 2008 to 2010 and \nwas estimated to cost more than 8,000 U.S. jobs in 2010.\n  The purpose of the bill is to authorize the Department of Commerce \nInternational Trade Administration to establish a Clean Energy \nTechnology Manufacturing and Export Assistance Program to ensure that \nUnited States clean energy technology firms, including clean energy \ntechnology parts suppliers and engineering and design firms, have the \ninformation and assistance they need to be competitive and create clean \nenergy technology sector jobs in the United States.\n  The Commerce Department is the leading agency to promote clean energy \nexports for the President's newly established Trade Promotion \nCoordinating Committee within his National Export Initiative. \nSpecifically, the bill requires the International Trade Administration \nto assist U.S. Clean Tech firms with export assistance to help them \nnavigate foreign markets to export their goods and services abroad, \nenhance U.S. Clean Tech Manufacturing firms by requiring ITA to promote \npolicies that will reduce production costs and encourage innovation, \ninvestment, and productivity in the clean energy technology sector, and \nto develop and implement a National Clean Energy Technology Export \nStrategy.\n  Arkansas is becoming a national leader in clean energy technology. \nSeveral companies--LM Windpower, Nordex, and Mitsubishi Power Systems--\nhave established wind turbine manufacturing plants in Arkansas. \nArkansas Power Electronics International, Inc. is a small business \ndedicated to developing and marketing state-of-the-art technology in \npower electronics systems, electronic motor drives, and power \nelectronics packaging. BlueInGreen, a Fayetteville company, makes \nenergy efficient products to improve and maintain water quality. \nSilicon Solar Solutions, an Arkansas-based startup, is commercializing \nits large grain polysilicon technology company. All of these companies \nwill benefit by having a focused clean energy trade and export program \nestablished within the International Trade Administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/21/senate-section/article/S5840-2", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 644.

The \n     Philippines holds enduring political and security \n     significance to the United States. The 2 countries have \n     partnered very successfully in combating terrorism in \n     Southeast Asia.\n       (2) The United States and the Philippines maintain a fair \n     trading relationship that should be expanded to the mutual \n     benefit of both countries. In 2010, United States exports to \n     the Philippines were valued at $7,375,000,000, and United \n     States imports from the Philippines were valued at \n     $7,960,000,000.\n       (3) United States textile exports to the Philippines were \n     valued at just over $48,000,000 in 2010, consisting mostly of \n     industrial, specialty, broadwoven, and nonwoven fabrics. The \n     potential for export growth in this area can sustain and \n     create thousands of jobs.\n       (4) The Philippines' textile and apparel industries, like \n     that of their counterparts in the United States, share the \n     same challenges and risks stemming from the end of the \n     textile and apparel quota system and from the end of United \n     States safe-guards that continued to control apparel imports \n     from the People's Republic of China until January 1, 2009.\n       (5) The United States apparel fabrics industry is heavily \n     dependent on sewing outside the United States, and, for the \n     first time, United States textile manufacturers would have a \n     program that utilizes sewing done in an Asian country. In \n     contrast, most sewing of United States fabric occurs in the \n     Western Hemisphere, with about two-thirds of United States \n     fabric exports presently going to countries that are parties \n     to the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Dominican \n     Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement. \n     Increased demand for United States fabric in Asia will \n     increase opportunities for the United States industry.\n       (6) Apparel producers in the Western Hemisphere are \n     excellent at making basic garments such as T-shirts and \n     standard 5-pocket jeans. However, the needle capability does \n     not exist to make high fashion, more sophisticated garments \n     such as embroidered T-shirts and fashion jeans with \n     embellishments. Such apparel manufacturing is done almost \n     exclusively in Asia.\n       (7) A program that provides preferential duty treatment for \n     certain apparel articles of the Philippines will provide a \n     strong incentive for Philippine apparel manufacturers\n\n[[Page S5843]]\n\n     to use United States fabrics, which will open new \n     opportunities for the United States textile industry and \n     increase opportunities for United States yarn manufacturers. \n     At the same time, the United States would be provided a more \n     diverse range of sourcing opportunities.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to encourage higher levels of trade in textiles and \n     apparel between the United States and the Philippines and \n     enhance the commercial well-being of their respective \n     industries in times of global economic hardship;\n       (2) to enhance and broaden the economic, security, and \n     political ties between the United States and the Philippines;\n       (3) to stimulate economic activity and development \n     throughout the Philippines, including regions such as Manila \n     and Mindanao; and\n       (4) to provide a stepping stone to an eventual free trade \n     agreement between the United States and the Philippines, \n     either bilaterally or as part of a regional agreement.\n\n     SEC. __03. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Classification under the hts.--The term \n     ``classification under the HTS'' means, with respect to an \n     article, the 6-digit subheading or 10-digit statistical \n     reporting number under which the article is classified in the \n     HTS.\n       (2) Dobby woven fabric.--The term ``dobby woven fabric'' \n     means fabric, other than jacquard fabric, woven with the use \n     of a dobby attachment that raises or lowers the warp threads \n     during the weaving process to create patterns including, \n     stripes, and checks and similar designs.\n       (3) Entered.--The term ``entered'' means entered, or \n     withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, in the customs \n     territory of the United States.\n       (4) HTS.--The term ``HTS'' means the Harmonized Tariff \n     Schedule of the United States.\n       (5) Knit-to-shape.--An article is ``knit-to shape'' if 50 \n     percent or more of the exterior surface area of the article \n     is formed by major parts that have been knitted or crocheted \n     directly to the shape used in the article, with no \n     consideration being given to patch pockets, appliques, or the \n     like.

The visa issued is in the standard 9-digit format \n     required under the Electronic Visa Information System (ELVIS) \n     and meets all reporting requirements of ELVIS.\n       (2) The Philippines is implementing the Electronic Visa \n     Information System (ELVIS) to assist in the prevention of \n     transshipment of apparel articles and the use of counterfeit \n     documents relating to the importation of apparel articles \n     into the United States.\n       (3) The Philippines is enforcing the Memorandum of \n     Understanding between the United States of America and the \n     Republic of the Philippines Concerning Cooperation in Trade \n     in Textile and Apparel Goods, signed on August 23, 2006.\n       (4) The Philippines agrees to provide, on a timely basis at \n     the request of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and \n     consistently with the manner in which the records are kept in \n     the Philippines, a report on exports from the Philippines of \n     apparel articles eligible for preferential treatment under \n     this section, and on imports into the Philippines of yarns, \n     fabrics, fabric components, or components knit-to-shape that \n     are wholly formed in the United States.\n       (5) The Philippines agrees to cooperate fully with the \n     United States to address and take action necessary to prevent \n     circumvention as provided in Article 5 of the Agreement on \n     Textiles and Clothing referred to in section 101(d)(4) of the \n     Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(4)).\n       (6) The Philippines agrees to require Philippines producers \n     and exporters of articles eligible for preferential treatment \n     under this section to maintain, for at least 5 years after \n     the date of export, complete records of the production and \n     the export of such articles, including records of yarns, \n     fabrics, fabric components, and components knit-to-shape and \n     used in the production of such articles.\n       (7) The Philippines agrees to provide, on a timely basis, \n     at the request of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, \n     documentation establishing the country of origin of articles \n     eligible for preferential treatment under this section, as \n     used by that country in implementing an effective visa \n     system.\n       (8) The Philippines is to establish, within 60 days after \n     the date of the President's certification under this \n     paragraph, procedures that allow the Office of Textiles and \n     Apparel of the Department of Commerce (OTEXA) to obtain \n     information when fabric wholly formed in the United States is \n     exported to the Philippines to allow for monitoring and \n     verification before the imports of apparel articles \n     containing the fabric for which preferential treatment is \n     sought under this section reach the United States. The \n     information provided upon export of the fabrics shall \n     include, among other things, the name of the importer of the \n     fabric in the Philippines, the 8-digit HTS subheading \n     covering the apparel articles to be made from the fabric, and \n     the quantity of the apparel articles to be made from the \n     fabric for importation into the United States.\n       (9) The Philippines has enacted legislation or promulgated \n     regulations to allow for the seizure of merchandise \n     physically transiting the territory of the Philippines and \n     that appears to be destined for the United States in \n     circumvention of the provisions of this title.\n       (h) Customs Procedures.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Penalties for exporters.--If the President determines, \n     based on sufficient evidence, that an exporter has engaged in \n     transshipments as defined in paragraph (2), then the \n     President shall deny for a period of 5 years all benefits \n     under this section to such exporter, any successor of such \n     exporter, and any other entity owned or operated by the \n     principal of the exporter.\n       (B) Penalties for importers.--If the President determines, \n     based on sufficient evidence, that an importer has engaged in \n     transshipments as defined in paragraph (2), then the \n     President shall deny for a period of 5 years all benefits \n     under this section to such importer, any successor of such \n     importer, or any entity owned or operated by the principal of \n     the importer.\n       (2) Definition of transshipment.--For purposes of paragraph \n     (1) and subsection (g), transshipment has occurred when \n     preferential treatment for an apparel article under this \n     section has been claimed on the basis of material false \n     information concerning the country of origin, manufacture, \n     processing, cutting, or assembly of the article or of any \n     fabric, fabric component, or component knit-to-shape from \n     which the apparel article was cut and assembled. For purposes \n     of this paragraph, false information is material if \n     disclosure of the true information would have meant that the \n     article is or was ineligible for preferential treatment under \n     this section.\n       (i) Proclamation Authority.--The President shall issue a \n     proclamation to carry out this section not later than 60 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this title. The President \n     shall consult with the Committee on Finance of the Senate and \n     the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives in preparing such proclamation.\n\n     SEC. __05. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title shall apply to articles entered, or withdrawn \n     from warehouse for consumption, on or after the 15th day \n     after the date on which the President issues the proclamation \n     required by section __04(i).\n\n     SEC. __06. TERMINATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The preferential duty treatment provided \n     under this title shall remain in effect for a period of 7 \n     years beginning on the effective date provided for in section \n     __05.\n       (b) GSP Eligibility.--The preferential duty treatment \n     provided under this title shall terminate if and when the \n     Philippines becomes ineligible for designation as a \n     beneficiary developing country under title V of the Trade Act \n     of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2461 et seq.).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 654.

Res. 17\n\n       Whereas the Convention on International Civil Aviation, \n     signed in Chicago, Illinois, on December 7, 1944, and entered \n     into force April 4, 1947, approved the establishment of the \n     International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), stating \n     ``The aims and objectives of the Organization are to develop \n     the principles and techniques of international\n\n[[Page S5846]]\n\n     air navigation and to foster the planning and development of \n     international air transport so as to . . . meet the needs of \n     the peoples of the world for safe, regular, efficient and \n     economical air transport'';\n       Whereas, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n     2001, the ICAO convened a high-level Ministerial Conference \n     on Aviation Security that endorsed a global strategy for \n     strengthening aviation security worldwide and issued a public \n     declaration that ``a uniform approach in a global system is \n     essential to ensure aviation security throughout the world \n     and that deficiencies in any part of the system constitute a \n     threat to the entire global system,'' and that there should \n     be a commitment to ``foster international cooperation in the \n     field of aviation security and harmonize the implementation \n     of security measures'';\n       Whereas, the 37th ICAO Assembly in October 2010 adopted a \n     Declaration on Aviation Security largely in response to the \n     attempted sabotage of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 on \n     December 25, 2009, which established new criminal penalties \n     for the use of civil aircraft as a weapon, the use of \n     dangerous materials to attack aircraft or other targets on \n     the ground, and the unlawful transport of biological, \n     chemical, and nuclear weapons and related materials, along \n     with extradition arrangements that facilitate cooperation \n     among nations in apprehending and prosecuting those who have \n     undertaken these and other criminal acts;\n       Whereas, on October 8, 2010, the Department of State \n     praised the 37th ICAO Assembly on its adoption of the \n     Declaration on Aviation Security, but noted that ``because \n     every airport offers a potential entry point into this global \n     system, every nation faces the threat from gaps in aviation \n     security throughout the world--and all nations must share the \n     responsibility for securing that system'';\n       Whereas the Taipei Flight Information Region, under the \n     jurisdiction of Taiwan, ROC, covers an airspace of 176,000 \n     square nautical miles and provides air traffic control \n     services to over 1,350,000 flights annually, with the Taiwan \n     Taoyuan International Airport recognized as the 8th and 18th \n     largest airport by international cargo volume and number of \n     international passengers, respectively;\n       Whereas exclusion from the ICAO since 1971 has impeded the \n     efforts of the Government of Taiwan to maintain civil \n     aviation practices that comport with evolving international \n     standards, due to its inability to contact the ICAO for up-\n     to-date information on aviation standards and norms, secure \n     amendments to the organization's regulations in a timely \n     manner, obtain sufficient and timely information needed to \n     prepare for the implementation of new systems and procedures \n     set forth by the ICAO, receive technical assistance in \n     implementing new regulations, and participate in technical \n     and academic seminars hosted by the ICAO;\n       Whereas the United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy \n     Review, clearly declared its support for the participation of \n     Taiwan in appropriate international organizations, in \n     particular, on September 27, 1994, with the announcement by \n     the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific \n     Affairs that, pursuant to the Review and recognizing Taiwan's \n     important role in transnational issues, the United States \n     ``will support its membership in organizations where \n     statehood is not a prerequisite, and [the United States] will \n     support opportunities for Taiwan's voice to be heard in \n     organizations where its membership is not possible''; and\n       Whereas ICAO rules and existing practices have allowed for \n     the meaningful participation of noncontracting countries as \n     well as other bodies in its meetings and activities through \n     granting of observer status: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) meaningful participation by the Government of Taiwan as \n     an observer in the meetings and activities of the \n     International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) will \n     contribute both to the fulfillment of the ICAO's overarching \n     mission and to the success of a global strategy to address \n     aviation security threats based on effective international \n     cooperation;\n       (2) the United States Government should take a leading role \n     in garnering international support for the granting of \n     observer status to Taiwan in the ICAO for the purpose of such \n     participation; and\n       (3) the Department of State should provide briefings to or \n     consult with Congress on any efforts conducted by the United \n     States Government in support of Taiwan's attainment of \n     observer status in the ICAO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/09/21/senate-section/article/S5846-1", "month": "09", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5846-S5848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTING FRAUD PREVENTION ACT OF 2011\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Small Business be discharged from further consideration of S. 633 \nand the Senate proceed to its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 633) to prevent fraud in small business \n     contracting, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Department of \nVeterans Affairs' role in S. 633, the Small Business Contracting Fraud \nPrevention Act of 2011.\n  As introduced, S. 633 contains a provision that would require the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, through its Center for Veterans \nEnterprise, to verify the status of any small business seeking to be \nregistered as a veteran-owned or service-disabled veteran-owned small \nbusiness. S. 633 would also require the head of each Federal agency to \nconfirm the status of any service-disabled veteran-owned small business \nbefore permitting that business to compete for Federal sole-source or \nset-aside contracts.\n  I agree that governmentwide verification of veteran-owned and \nservice-disabled veteran-owned small business status is an important \nstep towards fraud prevention. But we must ensure that enactment of S. \n633 does not add to the backlog of veterans currently awaiting \nverification of their small businesses, and that veterans' businesses \nare not unfairly delayed in their ability to compete for contracts.\n  I am pleased that Senators Landrieu and Snowe have agreed to my \namendment to S. 633. Under my amendment, the verification provisions in \nS. 633 would not take effect until the Department of Veterans Affairs \nfirst certifies it possesses the necessary resources and capacity to \nundertake the new requirements imposed by S. 633. This means that the \nDepartment gets to set the timeline for implementing the provisions so \nthat implementation is done right.\n  Mr. REID.
