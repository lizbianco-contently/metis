Madam President, this afternoon there will be a critical \nvote that will take place on the Senate floor. It is one of the most \ncontroversial, business-oriented votes that we have faced. Leading up \nto this vote has been one of the most heated debates and exchanges that \nmany of us in the Senate have seen in our time. It relates to an issue \nthat affects almost every American family, and certainly all American \nbusinesses, and the financial community. It is a basic question that \nneeds to be resolved on the Senate floor.\n  My friend and colleague from Montana, Senator Jon Tester, is offering \nan amendment, which I oppose. I have the highest respect for Jon. We \nhave discussed this, and our friendship remains strong throughout this \ndebate.\n\n[[Page S3572]]\n\nWe just see this differently. Whatever the outcome of the vote, I \ncertainly am going to continue my strong friendship with Jon and be a \nfan of what he brings to the Senate and what he does for the State of \nMontana.\n  Joining him in this amendment is Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee. I \nhave the same high regard for Senator Corker, and any remarks that I \nmake today are no reflection on them at all. I think they are both \nhonorable people who are standing tall for their point of view, with \nwhich I happen to disagree. But I want to make it clear that I think \nthis is a historic vote, a threshold vote in terms of whether the \nSenate, the Congress, and the Government of the United States will step \ninto a situation that has created a fundamental unfairness. And this is \nthe unfairness.\n  When we use debit cards, or plastic, to pay for a transaction, there \nis a fee that is collected. It is a fee that is paid to banks and, of \ncourse, paid to the issuing credit card network. The merchant or \nretailer that accepts that plastic, that debit card, has no voice in \ndetermining what that fee will be, and it is invisible.\n  Just one floor below us in the Capitol is a carryout. I went there \nthis morning to pick up a little breakfast, and there was a young \nlady--a Capitol Hill policewoman--in front of me. She took a package of \nchewing gum and put it on the counter and handed her debit card to the \ncashier. The chewing gum cost $1.20. The average fee paid by the \nmerchant--in this case, the proprietor of the carryout--is 44 cents on \nthat transaction, more than one-third of the cost of the pack of \nchewing gum. The owner of the carryout had no voice in that fee. It is \na fee that has been imposed on that merchant by the credit card network \nthat issued the debit card.\n  A year ago, we took up this issue and asked, Is it fair or \nreasonable? The reason I think we need to take a look at this is, in \nthe United States of America the so-called swipe fee is dramatically \ngreater than in virtually any other country in the world. The same \nnetworks, Visa and MasterCard, charge, on average, 1.14 percent on \nevery transaction using a debit card. If one goes to the European \nUnion, the average debit interchange fee is .2 percent, less than one-\nfifth of what is charged in the United States by the same credit card \nnetwork. Then, of course, take a look at Canada, just north of the \nUnited States, where there is no--zero--interchange fee charged on \ndebit card transactions.\n  Why is the United States, through its consumers, small businesses, \nand large retailers alike, paying so much more? These credit card \nnetworks, through their issuing banks, are charging this because they \ncan. There is no restraint whatsoever--at least there wasn't until last \nyear.\n  We had a debate on the floor of the Senate, and we asked--on behalf \nof consumers, small businesses, retailers, and merchants all across \nAmerica--should we establish a reasonable fee for the use of a debit \ncard? We voted, with 64 votes, to do that. The fee is to be established \nby the Federal Reserve.\n  Most everyone would concede two things. First, the Federal Reserve is \nnot partisan. It is going to make this judgment based on the economics \nof the marketplace, in terms of what the fee should be. Second, if \nthere is any bias at the Federal Reserve, it is not toward consumers. \nThis is not a consumer protection agency. No one has ever called it \nthat. It is an agency which, by and large, is more comfortable in the \nboardrooms of major banks. So we gave them this responsibility.\n  What the Federal Reserve came up with, after 5 or 6 months of \ninvestigation, was a startling discovery; and that was the interchange \nfee being charged on debit card transactions in the United States, on \naverage, was 44 cents--that is what the 1.14 percent translates into, \n44 cents a transaction--and the actual cost to the debit card network \nissuing banks was in the range of 12 cents.\n  What is being charged to consumers and small businesses all across \nAmerica is more than three times the reasonable and proportional cost \nof the transaction. At that point, the Federal Reserve said: We are \ngoing to sit down as instructed by this law passed by Congress and \nsigned by the President and come up with a reasonable interchange fee. \nThey confessed--Chairman Bernanke and others said it was a challenge, \nand it is. But they said they were going to do it, and do it right, and \nthey needed more time. Chairman Bernanke called me and said: I need an \nadditional 6 to 8 weeks to do that. I said I was sorry to hear that.\n  They had more than 11,000 comments posted to the Federal Reserve \nabout what this debit fee should be, what is a reasonable fee. They are \nabout to announce, before the end of this month, what it is going to \nbe. I don't know what their report will say. I suspect it will be \nsomewhere between 12 cents and 44 cents, with many other provisos \nincluded. That is where we stand.\n  Under the law passed last year, this new debit card interchange fee \nrule would go into effect July 21. Well, needless to say, it has \ngenerated a lot of controversy, particularly among the card networks, \nVisa and MasterCard, and the issuing banks that issue these debit \ncards. They don't like this at all.\n  As Senator Dale Bumpers of Arkansas--who used to sit right back \nthere--used to say: They hate this interchange fee regulation ``like \nthe devil hates holy water.'' They have done everything in their power \nto stop the Federal Reserve from issuing a rule that would bring down \nthis 44-cent charge on every swipe of our plastic debit cards. Of \ncourse, they want to do it before the Federal Reserve issues their \nrule.\n  Today on the Senate floor, at 2 o'clock this afternoon, the banks and \ncredit card companies get their chance to stop the Federal Reserve from \ncoming forward with this new approach to the interchange fees.\n  As you can imagine, it is a titanic struggle because of all the \nretailers and merchants in the United States. From Walmart, on down to \nthe corner bodega in Manhattan, or the corner store in Chicago, they \nare all involved. When I get into the car that picks me up at O'Hare to \ntake me to my apartment in Chicago, my driver says: We are pulling for \nyou. Every time somebody gives us a debit card, we end up paying more \nand more because of it.\n  I think the reach of these charges may surprise a lot of people. Here \nis a letter that we received yesterday from Tom Gordy, president of the \nArmed Forces Marketing Council. He writes and says:\n\n       On behalf of the member companies of the Armed Forces \n     Marketing Council, I want to offer our sincere appreciation \n     for your efforts to curb the skyrocketing costs to retail \n     business through debit card fees.\n       Our particular concern about debit card fees is the adverse \n     impact the fees are having on the pocketbooks and the quality \n     of life of military families through the military exchange \n     systems.\n       As you are aware, the military exchanges provide a non-pay \n     compensation benefit to military families and support \n     military families' financial readiness by offering name brand \n     products at an average savings of over 20 \n     percent. Additionally, the profits generated by the \n     military exchanges are given back to the military \n     community through dividends that support quality of life \n     programs on military bases, including childcare centers, \n     movie theaters, gyms and swimming pools, to name a few.\n\n  Let's bring it back to the Senate floor now, and here is what he \nwrites:\n\n       Currently, the three military exchange systems--Army-Air \n     Force Exchange System, Navy Exchange Command and the Marine \n     Corps Exchange--are having to pay well over $100 million per \n     year combined in interchange fees and interchange fees are \n     the fastest growing uncontrollable expense to the military \n     exchange system.\n       As interchange fees continue to increase, the military \n     exchange systems must either absorb the costs, thus reducing \n     the dividends that support essential military quality of life \n     programs, or they must pass the cost of the fees on to the \n     military family by raising prices. Either way, military \n     families lose because of interchange fees.\n\n  That is just one example, but an example that should hit close to \nhome to us because it is an example that reflects on the quality of \nlife of people we care for very much--military families--who sacrifice \nfor this Nation. A system which is designed to help them is paying over \n$100 million a year to the issuing banks for the Visa and MasterCard \ndebit fees. Is $100 million reasonable? If next year it is twice that, \nis that amount reasonable?\n  Most people would argue, if you believe in a free market system, you \nbelieve in two things: transparency, so people know what the rules of \nthe game are--the actual prices and cost--\n\n[[Page S3573]]\n\nand competition. The honest answer is there is no competition here. \nVisa and MasterCard literally dictate these fees that are collected. \nWhat choice does a merchant have? Could you stay in business today and \nnot take plastic? I guess some people do, but not many. The reality is \nmore and more people are using plastic to buy things as basic as a pack \nof chewing gum for $1.20, which I saw this morning.\n  That is what this debate comes down to. The question is whether we \nwill let the Federal Reserve issue this rule, take a close look at it, \nwatch its implementation, and then respond, if needed. I don't know if \ntheir rule will be excellent or need help. I am prepared to stay the \ncourse with it. If we need to address it in any aspect with further \nlegislation, I want to do that.\n  I particularly want to address my friends--at least those friends I \nhave left--in the banking community. I am not going to stand here in \ndefense of Wall Street. I think they have had quite a bit of friendship \nand love thrown their way by this Congress over the last few years. I \nam going to say, though, when it comes to community banks and credit \nunions, I think they deserve an exemption. It was included in the law. \nIf we need to provide any other reassurances after the rule is issued, \nI will be there. I believe I can speak for the merchants and retailers, \nthat they will be there as well. They have never disputed this issue of \nthe community banks and credit unions being treated differently than \nthe big banks.\n  But I do want to make it clear what is going on here in terms of the \nbiggest banks that issue these debit cards. There is $1.3 billion a \nmonth collected in debit card interchange fees--$1.3 billion--which is \nmore than $15 billion a year. Three banks--Bank of America, Chase, and \nWells Fargo--control 50 percent of the debit card market, and they will \ncollect nearly $7 billion in fees this year off of these debit cards. \nAs I mentioned, the merchants and retailers have no voice in this. They \npay what they are told they have to pay and they collect it from \nconsumers.\n  Jamie Dimon is a person I have known. He is the CEO of Chase Bank. I \nworked with him when he was in Chicago. I had many conversations with \nhim when he moved back to New York. I respect him for his business \nacumen. But he has been particularly pointed in going after this \nregulation of interchange fees. He has called it idiotic, in letters to \nshareholders and his customers. Chase has written to all of their debit \ncard customers across the United States and said this so-called Durbin \namendment--incidentally, it isn't an amendment anymore, it is a law--\nwill mean that Chase will have to raise fees on the people holding \ndebit cards because they will collect less from debit card interchange \nfees.\n  That seems to make sense, doesn't it? If less revenue is coming in, \nthey will have to make it up some way. But I want to call to the \nattention of those who are following this debate to this fact: The \nbonuses distributed by the banks on Wall Street last year amounted to \n$20.8 billion. If they lost every nickel in interchange fees on debit \ncards, it wouldn't even get close to the amount they paid out in \nbonuses to their executives.\n  So before Mr.--before the Chase Bank--I don't want to be personal \nabout this--threatens its customers about increased fees and reduced \nbenefits, let them be honest with their customers about the bonuses \nthat are being paid. That bank--Chase--if I am not mistaken, had an \nincrease in annual earnings of 48 percent this year. They are doing \nquite well, thank you.\n  And for the record, let me remind those who are following this debate \nthat the taxpayers of America were asked to stand by these banks in one \nof their darkest hours when we faced this recession. Many of us believe \nit was brought on by some awful practices on Wall Street and among \nother banks, insurance companies, and financial institutions around the \nworld. But in their darkest hour, when things were toughest, where did \nthey turn for help? Not the good old free market system, but the \nTreasury of the United States of America. So in the end we gave--we \ngave--$25 billion to the Chase Bank. We gave $45 billion to Bank of \nAmerica and $25 billion to Wells Fargo to help them through their time \nof need.\n  Oh, sure, they survived and they paid us back. But what was their \ngratitude? How was it reflected? It was reflected by these banks, after \nreceiving taxpayer money to get them out of the hole they dug for \nthemselves, turning around and awarding bonuses to their executives \nright and left. That is not an expression of gratitude where I come \nfrom. Now they come to us and say, we want you to continue this \ninterchange fee subsidy, 50 percent of which goes to the three largest \nbanks in the United States of America.\n  I think it is time for us to say no. I think it is time to stand for \nconsumers and small businesses across America who have no voice, no \npower, and deserve our help in making this system fairer, more \ntransparent, and more competitive.\n  The amendment before us is one I want to address specifically. \nBecause instead of letting the Federal Reserve issue their rule at the \nend of this month--measuring whether its impact is as we had planned, \nresponding, if needed, to changes--what the banking community and the \ncredit card networks want to do is to kill this rule literally in the \ncradle before it has a chance to be issued, before it has a chance to \nbe implemented. I think that is plain wrong.\n  Right now, I hear my colleagues who come to the floor offering this \namendment--both Senator Corker and Senator Tester--saying this is a \ncompromise. This is a compromise.\n  This is not a compromise. A compromise involves sides with differing \nviews sitting down together and working out their differences. I wasn't \ninvited to any meeting to come up with this so-called compromise. The \nmerchants and retailers and businesses across America were not \ninvited--not at all. There were no representatives of consumers in \nthese meetings for this grand compromise. This was a compromise between \nthe biggest banks, the medium-sized banks, and the small banks. So it \nis a bankers' compromise for bankers' benefit. That is what it comes \ndown to.\n  In the last 2 days alone, letters opposing this amendment have been \nsent by consumer groups--military exchanges, as I mentioned, 11 \ncolleges and university associations--because, incidentally, our kids \nat college bookstores, using debit cards, are actually paying more for \ntheir books because of these fees as well--308 national and State \nmerchant trade associations and 6,500 small businesses. They are all \nopposing this so-called compromise amendment, though it isn't a \ncompromise.\n  Secondly, this amendment is described as a 1-year delay of the \ninterchange rulemaking. Actually, it is an open-ended delay. The \nbankers who wrote this very carefully crafted it. The amendment \nrequires the Federal Reserve's rules to be rewritten in 1 year, but it \ndoesn't set an effective date for the revised rules. There is no \ntelling when, if ever, these rules will go into effect. This delay \ncould be significant, and from the banks' point of view, the longer the \ndelay, the better, because it is worth $1.3 billion a month for every \nmonth they can delay it. And how long would they like to delay it? \nForever.\n  Then there is this idea of needing a study after the Federal Reserve \nput 12 months into reviewing this issue, considering thousands of \ncomments to promulgate this rule. The amendment sets up a study of the \ninterchange system that only takes into account the views of the \nbanking regulators. Search the amendment--the Tester-Corker amendment--\nfor one indication there will be anyone sitting in the room \nrepresenting the consumers or small businesses of America for this \nstudy. They are not invited. Not welcome. Not part of the conversation. \nIs this another compromise--a compromise that just involves banking \nregulators sitting down to decide what is in the best interest of \nconsumers? Would you want your fate left to their hands as a consumer? \nNot me.\n  The study, incidentally, is loaded--the so-called triggers in the \nstudy, if you take a look at them. If the bank regulators deem that any \nof the triggers are met, they have to throw out what the Federal \nReserve has done and start over. Well, guess what, the triggers are \nwritten in a way that this is a foregone conclusion. These triggers \nwill be met. As each trigger mirrors public statements the public \nregulators have already made about the Fed's\n\n[[Page S3574]]\n\ndraft rules, this is loaded. There is nothing objective or unbiased \nabout this whatsoever.\n  The amendment essentially mandates a complete rewrite of the Federal \nrules by the banking regulators for the banking industry in favor of \nthe banks.\n  Let me mention something else I think is outrageous about this. What \nthe banks have said is, we don't want to measure the reasonable and \nproportional cost of a debit transaction to establish the fee we are \ngoing to impose. We want to include every variable and incremental cost \nwe can consider. This amendment goes on for more than a page with all \nthe possibilities.\n  The amendment provides the Fed must rewrite the rules under a very \ndifferent standard than the law which currently exists. The new \nstandard is one the big banks have been begging for. The Durbin \namendment says the fee set by Visa and MasterCard, on behalf of the big \nissuing banks, has to be reasonable and proportional to the costs \nincurred that are ``specific to a particular electronic debit \ntransaction.'' The Tester-Corker amendment would require the Fed to let \nVisa and MasterCard fix fee rates to cover bank costs that are not \nspecific to any debit transaction. The Tester-Corker amendment requires \nthe Fed to allow interchange fees to cover ``all fixed and incremental \ncosts associated with debit card transaction and program operations, \nincluding incentives.''\n  This is a truck-size loophole the banks are begging for, because they \nknow they can get up to 44 cents and beyond if they can add everything \nin from the cost of an ATM machine to executive compensation and \nexecutive bonuses. So honestly, are we going to stand here and say we \ncannot protect small businesses across America, struggling to survive, \nfrom outrageous price-fixing by the credit card companies so we can \nreward the issuing banks with bonuses? Is that what this is about? If \nit is, it is a pretty stark choice.\n  This amendment is a big bank windfall. The amendment has been \ndescribed as an effort to help small banks, but it would undoubtedly be \na windfall for the Nation's largest banks. It would give them a free \npass to continue their anticompetitive practices for at least another \nyear, and then it would require the Fed to write rules in a way that \nwould enable big banks to justify the fees they are charging today. It \nis a no-change amendment.\n  If you believe, as a Member of the Senate, the current system is fair \nto businesses across America and we shouldn't change it, then voting \nfor this amendment will guarantee your position will be enshrined in \nlaw. This proposed amendment is a gift to the big banks that will keep \non giving and deny swipe fee relief to small businesses and consumers \nwho desperately need it.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord these three letters I have received from the Armed Forces \nMarketing Council, the American Council on Education, and Public \nCitizen U.S. PIRG.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Armed Forces Marketing Council,\n\n                                       Manassas, VA, June 7, 2011.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Durbin: On behalf of the member companies of \n     the Armed Forces Marketing Council, I want to offer our \n     sincere appreciation for your efforts to curb the \n     skyrocketing costs to retail business through debit card \n     fees.\n       Our particular concern about debit card fees is the adverse \n     impact the fees are having on the pocketbooks and the quality \n     of life of military families through the military exchange \n     systems.\n       As you are aware, the military exchanges provide a non-pay \n     compensation benefit to military families and support \n     military families' financial readiness by offering name brand \n     products at an average savings of over 20%. Additionally, the \n     profits generated by the military exchanges are given back to \n     the military community through dividends that support quality \n     of life programs on military bases, including childcare \n     centers, movie theaters, gyms and swimming pools, to name a \n     few.\n       Currently, the three military exchange systems--Army-Air \n     Force Exchange System, Navy Exchange Command and the Marine \n     Corps Exchange--are having to pay well over $100 million per \n     year combined in interchange fees and interchange fees are \n     the fastest growing uncontrollable expense to the military \n     exchange systems.\n       As interchange fees continue to increase, the military \n     exchange systems must either absorb the costs, thus reducing \n     the dividends that support essential military quality of life \n     programs, or they must pass the cost of the fees on to the \n     military family by raising prices. Either way, military \n     families lose because of interchange fees.\n       The debit card interchange fee restrictions that you \n     authored will help save the military exchange systems tens of \n     millions of dollars per year, reducing the adverse impact \n     that interchange fees are having on the pocketbooks and \n     quality of life of military families.\n       We are hopeful that you will be successful in maintaining \n     the law that you authored to curb debit card interchange fees \n     and preventing any delays in its implementation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Tom Gordy,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Office of the President,\n\n\n                                American Council on Education,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2011.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I write on behalf of the higher education \n     associations listed below to oppose the Tester Amendment, \n     which would significantly delay regulatory implementation of \n     the debit card swipe fee reforms enacted last year in the \n     Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \n     (``Dodd-Frank Act''). We reiterate our support for these \n     needed reforms, which will provide real relief to students, \n     their families and colleges and universities across the \n     country, and urge that they be implemented in a timely manner \n     consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act.\n       Debit card swipe fees are a hidden expense for students and \n     families paying for college for which they receive no \n     benefit. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Federal \n     Reserve's proposed rule, we believe colleges and universities \n     will see reduced debit card costs which they will be able to \n     pass on to students through lower costs as well as increased \n     resources for institutional grant aid and student services. \n     In addition, implementing this reform will create an \n     opportunity for institutions to offer discounts to students \n     for payments made with checks and debit cards.\n       During this time of economic insecurity, steps like those \n     undertaken in swipe fee reform will help students and their \n     families manage the costs of college with increasingly \n     strained budgets.\n       We urge the Senate to reject the Tester Amendment and stand \n     with students and the colleges and universities that serve \n     them by ensuring that these debit card swipe fee reforms be \n     fully implemented in a timely manner.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Molly Corbett Broad,\n                                                        President.\n       On behalf of: American Association of Collegiate Registrars \n     and Admission Officers; American Association of Community \n     Colleges; American Association of State Colleges and \n     Universities; American Council on Education; Association of \n     American Universities; Association of Community College \n     Trustees; Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities; \n     Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities; National \n     Association of College and University Business Officers; \n     National Association of College Stores.\n                                  ____\n\n         Public Citizen, U.S. PIRG, Federation of State PIRGs,\n                                                     June 6, 2011.\n     Re Opposition to Tester, S. 575, To Delay Swipe Fee Reform.\n\n       Dear Senator: We, the undersigned consumer groups, write to \n     reinforce our continued support for the Durbin amendment to \n     reform debit card swipe fees that passed as part of the Dodd-\n     Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. \n     The Federal Reserve Board of Governors has conducted enough \n     research and has adequate authority to issue a fair final \n     rule in this matter without the delays that would be imposed \n     by Senator Tester's proposal, S. 575, no matter how it might \n     be modified for the floor.\n       All consumers, whether they pay with cash or plastic, pay \n     more at the store and more at the pump due to the current \n     non-transparent interchange fee system, which is tantamount \n     to a wealth transfer from the poor to the rich. Recent \n     Federal Reserve research has shown that lower-income cash \n     consumers subsidize the rewards cards of more affluent \n     customers. Yet, retail is a highly-competitive industry where \n     cost savings are routinely passed along to consumers. There \n     is no reason to expect that retailers, in a marketplace where \n     numerous sellers routinely compare and change their prices on \n     a daily basis, would fail to pass along the savings from the \n     unfair anticompetitive interchange system. Yet, as the non-\n     profit and non-partisan American Antitrust Institute said in \n     a recent letter to Congress:\n       [The Durbin amendment] limits the amount of fees that can \n     be charged through a price-fixing network regime and allows \n     banks to charge unregulated fees if they simply compete on \n     their prices rather than set them centrally. If the limits \n     set by the Fed are low, that aids competition by giving a \n     large incentive for banks to actually compete by lowering \n     their fees. Banks with less than $10 billion in assets would \n     not have to compete, however, because they are exempt. \n     Certainly, banks with more than $10 billion in assets can \n     compete in the free markets by\n\n[[Page S3575]]\n\n     setting their own prices rather than hiding behind the cartel \n     process overseen by Visa or MasterCard. What the Fed is doing \n     is to substitute competition for administered prices. (March \n     14, 2011)\n       As Senator Tester's legislation to delay implementation of \n     the Durbin amendment and the final Federal Reserve \n     regulations comes up for a vote on the Senate floor, we urge \n     your opposition to it or other efforts to weaken or delay the \n     Durbin amendment through Congressional action. Thank you for \n     your consideration of our views. If you or any of your staff \n     have any questions, please contact Ed Mierzwinski at U.S. \n     PIRG (202-461-3821 or edm@pirg.org).\n           Sincerely,\n     Public Citizen,\n     U.S. PIRG.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the groups that stand behind me on this \neffort know what we are up against. When we take a look at the most \npowerful special interest groups in Washington, we have to put the \nbanking industry near the top, if not on the top, of the ladder. \nThroughout my career I have tackled them on the floor. I can recall \nmany years ago, brandnew to the Senate, when I said we ought to change \nthe banking laws so we would put an end to the so-called subprime \nmortgages. I was in a debate with Phil Gramm of Texas, who said at that \ntime that if the Durbin amendment passed, it would be the end of the \nsubprime mortgage business. I lost by one vote. If I would have \nprevailed, history might have been a little different. The subprime \nmortgage mess created an economic downturn from which we still suffer.\n\n  I stood up as well when it came to this foreclosure crisis and said \nthat at some point these banks have to be reasonable. You just can't \ntake homes away from people, board them up, and watch them deteriorate \ninto nothing. You have to give people a fighting chance to stay in \ntheir homes. I said at the end the bankruptcy court should have the \nlast word on that. The banking industry, the credit unions, the \ncommunity banks opposed me. Take a look across America today at the \nforeclosed homes, in Chicago, in Aurora, in Springfield, all across my \nState, and across this Nation. The outcome, years after I lost that \nbattle, certainly does not speak to a stronger America because of these \nforeclosures. The banking industry beat me on that.\n  Last year, fighting for these small businesses, retailers, I stood up \nand said: Somebody has to step up here and argue that there ought to be \nfairness in the fees they charge to businesses and consumers across \nAmerica. We rallied 64 Senators--a bipartisan group--in support of \nthat.\n  The banks want a second run at this. They want to take this game into \novertime. They want to come back today and count their friends here and \nhope they can come up with 60 in the hopes that if the big banks and \ncredit card companies can win this battle, we will leave them alone, we \nwill not ask hard questions about the interchange fees that are \ncharged. I am asking my colleagues in the Senate not to give the banks \nthis overtime, extra-time victory. Give the victory to consumers. They \nhave precious few on the floor of the Senate. Stand up for small \nbusinesses that do create jobs across America, and give them a chance \nto create jobs in this country by not being overcharged by the credit \ncard networks and the biggest banks in America.\n  How many of us have come to the floor and said small business is the \nkey to economic recovery? If you believe it, if you mean it, vote \nagainst the Tester-Corker amendment. That amendment is a blow to small \nand large businesses alike, large retailers and merchants alike, all \nacross America. They stand in support of my effort to have a reasonable \ninterchange fee on debit card transactions and to make sure they have a \nfighting chance to be profitable, to expand their businesses, and to \nhire more employees. That would be good for economic recovery. A vote \nfor the Tester-Corker amendment unfortunately would be a win for the \nbanks at the expense of an economy that desperately needs our help and \nsupport today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/08/senate-section/article/S3575-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, yesterday and the day before, I came \nto the floor and noted the many troubling signs of a persistently weak \neconomy and how I believe the actions of Democrats here in Washington \nare seriously undermining the recovery Americans desperately want. I \nproposed some things that could be done about it right now.\n  The President says he wakes up every morning asking himself what he \ncan do to create jobs and help businesses succeed. Let me offer a few \nsuggestions. It is not that difficult, really. I am sure the job \ncreators and the workers the President meets with are telling him the \nsame thing they tell all of us every day. Most people think Washington \nis too intrusive, that it imposes too many job-stifling regulations and \nsends too many mixed signals today for anybody to plan for tomorrow. We \nknow that many who would hire right now are actually holding back \nbecause they do not know what else to expect in terms of regulations, \nin terms of taxes, in terms of mandates, and in terms of fees. In fact, \nwe just learned that a significant percentage of businesses plan to \ndrop their employee health coverage--something the administration \nassured us repeatedly people did not have to fear. Unexpected jolts \nsuch as these are causing confusion and anxiety, and they are freezing \njob creators and entrepreneurs in place.\n  Beyond that, many Americans are also seriously concerned about a \ngovernment in Washington that spends trillions more than it takes in \nand a national debt that this year will exceed our entire national \neconomy. Many people are also understandably outraged by the fact that \nthe party that occupies the White House and runs the Senate has not \neven taken the time to put together a budget or any other kind of plan \nto get our Nation's fiscal house in order. After all, if the government \ndoes not plan ahead, how can job creators? If the White House does not \nhave a plan to pay down the debt or preserve entitlements, why should \npeople have any confidence that something will be done?\n  None of this is news to the President or to the Democrats in \nCongress. The fact is, the President and Democrats in Congress know as \nwell as I do what employers and workers need to prosper and to create \nprosperity and jobs. They just don't seem to want to do it, and that is \nthe problem. To be blunt, people wonder whether the President is really \nfocused on jobs when so many of his policies seem to be aimed at \ndestroying them and where there is so much he can do right now to \ncreate tens of thousands of good American jobs.\n  Yesterday, I spoke about trade and how, even though the President \nadmits that pending trade agreements with South Korea, Panama, and \nColombia have the potential to create tens of thousands of new jobs and \nboost American businesses, he refuses to move on them in an apparent \nfavor to his union allies.\n  This morning, I would like to focus on the two sides of the \nPresident's energy policy in which he publicly claims to support \ngreater domestic production and the jobs that come with it even as he \nseems to do everything he can behind the scenes to block production and \nto kill energy-related jobs right here at home.\n  The President says he is a proponent of domestic energy production, \nbut, let's be honest, he has not shown it. This should not surprise \nanyone. This is an administration, after all, that appointed an Energy \nSecretary who, a month after the President's election, said, ``Somehow \nwe need to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels \nin Europe.'' Since then, the administration's policies have helped us \nget there. Not only have gas prices skyrocketed, but the \nadministration's policies are also hindering the creation of thousands \nof good private sector jobs that so many Americans desperately need. \nLet's look at just a couple.\n  Everyone knows that in the aftermath of the oilspill in the gulf last \nyear, the President imposed a 6-month moratorium on new deepwater \ndrilling. We can dispute the wisdom of a temporary ban for purposes of \na safety and\n\n[[Page S3576]]\n\nenvironmental review. What we cannot dispute is that the impact on jobs \nand the Nation's economy has been quite severe, nor can we deny that \nthe White House has effectively continued the ban even after its time \nwas up and the review was complete. It was only after the courts got \ninvolved and months of political pressure from both Democrats and \nRepublicans that the administration reluctantly began issuing new \npermits months after the ban was supposedly lifted. And even as gas \nprices hover around $4 a gallon, permitting is still well below \nprespill levels and energy production in the gulf is expected to slow.\n  Senator Vitter tells us that the administration's anemic permitting \nin the gulf for domestic energy production threatens nearly 100,000 \njobs every year in addition to the many thousands of jobs that could be \nlost every year in industries that are related to or are dependent on \nenergy. Senator Vitter has also told us about one estimate suggesting \nthat 23 wells per month are needed just to maintain current production \nlevels in the shallow waters of the gulf and that even after the \nmoratorium was supposedly lifted, the administration has averaged fewer \nthan 2 per month.\n  As for deepwater drilling, the administration has issued a grand \ntotal of two new deepwater permits--just two. The other 13 have been \nfor work that was already permitted prior to the moratorium.\n  The administration's lack of support for energy production in deep \nwater has led to five rigs simply pulling up stakes over the past year \nand moving their tax dollars and their workers elsewhere in the world. \nThis is just one of the ways the administration is holding back job \ncreation in the energy industry. This is to say nothing of the \nadministration's actions with respect to Alaska's Outer Continental \nShelf, which, according to one estimate, could create an average of \n54,700 new jobs annually for decades, adding billions in pay and tax \nrevenue.\n  Let's not forget that the administration's impact would be even worse \nif it had its way and raised taxes on energy producers, which would \nhave only served to strengthen foreign competitors, raise gas prices \neven more, put energy independence further out of reach, and kill more \nAmerican jobs. By one estimate, the energy tax Democrats still want to \nimpose on energy producers could cost 154,000 jobs and $68 billion in \nlost wages.\n  For 2\\1/2\\ years, Democrats in Washington have paid lipservice to the \nidea of job creation even as they have pursued an agenda that is \nradically opposed to it. We can see this when it comes to trade, as I \nindicated yesterday, and we can see it when it comes to energy, as I \nhave discussed this morning. Unless Democrats change their priorities \nand their policies, the threats of a downgrade will not go away. The \ndebt will not get any smaller and businesses will not create the kinds \nof jobs Americans need. The President can talk all he wants about the \neconomy, but it is time he starts looking at the impact of his own \npolicies on the economy.\n  We need to change course, and a good place to start is with trade and \nwith energy. American businesses want to expand and want to hire. Here \nare two areas where we can help them do it right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/08/senate-section/article/S3576-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3576-S3577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                THE EPA\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise today to talk about something \nthat is on the minds of our agricultural producers. In meetings in my \nhome State, across Nebraska, it seems the first question is always \ngoing to be or the second question is always going to be something \nrelated to the EPA. Most of the time, the question goes like this: What \nis going on at the EPA? Why are they trying to put me out of business?\n  In response to this growing concern, which I am confident the EPA has \nheard, they have taken to the road with a good old-fashioned charm \noffensive. The problem is, what the EPA is selling publicly to farmers \nand ranchers--what they are trying to sell--just doesn't match up with \nreality. They say one thing on the road while the regulatory train just \ncontinues to barrel forward, right here in Washington. In fact, the EPA \nAdministrator is touring the country, community after community, saying \nnot to worry; there is no need for ``. . . fear in rural areas that EPA \nis coming after you.'' Yet the regulations continue to come after our \nNation's farmers, ranchers, and small businesses, and those regulations \nare coming fast and furious. Even the Regional Administrator with \nresponsibility for Nebraska and Iowa and Kansas and Missouri has joined \nthe charm offensive. In a recent speech to the Agricultural Business \nCouncil of Kansas City, he has said that he does not ``see where this \nadministration is doing anything new.''\n  But, quite simply, the EPA's charming rhetoric does not match up with \nits rule-by-rule intent. If I might, let me illustrate what I mean. \nLet's talk about dust--not the stuff you find on your bookshelf but the \nstuff a truck kicks up or a tractor kicks up when it is going down a \nfield or farm lane. Earlier this year a bipartisan group of 33 Senators \nwrote to the EPA. We were worried. We were worried that the EPA had \nplans to regulate farm dust. Don't get me wrong. Clean air is a good \nthing. We need clean air, but dust is also unavoidable in farm country. \nFarming without kicking up dust is like asking a carpenter to cut and \nframe a house without creating sawdust. Well, it just doesn't happen. \nThe two things do not go together. Not to worry, says the EPA, message \nNo. 1 in the charm offensive; the EPA does not have any plans to do \nanything as silly as regulating farm dust. In fact, on March 10, \nAdministrator Jackson noted that EPA has, and I am quoting, ``no plans \nto do so.'' He went on to explain:\n\n       EPA staff is conducting meetings to engage with and listen \n     to farmers and ranchers well before we propose any rule.\n\n  My goodness, that sounds reasonable. Well, except that the response \nletter that the 33 Senators received from the EPA contained an entirely \ndifferent story. That letter, written by Assistant Administrator Gina \nMcCarthy, simply said that the source of the dust does not matter and \nthat EPA cannot consider costs when it sets the standard.\n  Here is how she put it: National air quality standards ``are not \nfocused on any specific category of sources or any activity including \nactivities related to agriculture or rural roads.''\n  McCarthy further noted that ``the Agency is prohibited from \nconsidering costs.'' The letter leaves my Nebraska producers and \nproducers all across this great Nation wondering, what happened? What \nhappened to the EPA Administrator saying she wasn't going to regulate \nfarm dust? This letter sends the exact opposite message. The answer is \nthere is a public relations effort, and then there is a whole separate \neffort called the charm offensive effort, and then there is regulatory \nreality.\n  Here are some more examples. On water quality, on April 20, the Des \nMoines Register headline blared message No. 2 of EPA's charm offensive: \n``EPA chief has no plans to regulate farm runoff.''\n  Well, EPA was addressing another worry in the farm community that EPA \nwould shift from the current State-based approach to a more heavyhanded \n``Federal Government knows best'' approach. It will be our-way-or-the-\nhighway Federal Government type approach.\n  So, again, after reading the headline, farmers and ranchers hoped \nthat maybe the EPA was taking a turn for the more reasonable. But a \nMarch 16 letter from EPA to their regional offices once again tells a \nvery different story. The letter lays out a very specific framework how \nEPA wants States to regulate runoff. While the headline says the EPA \nwill not initiate regulation of farm runoff, in reality they are \naggressively prodding States to do it for them.\n  If that weren't enough, the agency is also trying to expand their \nauthority literally to every irrigation ditch, every low-lying area, \nand they even want to regulate your farm pond. The law is very clear \nthat EPA does not have authority over these waters. After\n\n[[Page S3577]]\n\nCongress refused to enact this expansion of their authority, the EPA \ndecided, well, let's plow ahead anyway regardless of congressional \nintent. Does that sound familiar with this administration?\n  To make matters worse, they are not doing this through a full \nrulemaking process with those pesky public comments and such. Instead, \nthe EPA sat down with the Corps of Engineers, the Department of \nInterior, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and issued a so-\ncalled guidance document. That happened in May. EPA claims this \napproach includes exemptions for agriculture, but the whole story is \nnot told.\n  Instead, it says irrigated areas, stock tanks, and low-lying areas \nare ``generally not waters of the U.S.'' Generally? What do you mean by \ngenerally? Well, that word ``generally'' produces a tremendous amount \nof uncertainty. It creates fear. It creates confusion and gives farmers \nand ranchers zero peace of mind. You see, they do not trust the EPA.\n  Further, the guidance shifts the burden of proving exemption from \nregulation to our producers. Instead of EPA or State regulators being \nforced to explain why on Earth agricultural producers should be \nsubjected to such regulations, producers will now have to explain why \nit is ridiculous to regulate their stock tanks in irrigated areas under \nrunoff regulations. This will result, of course, in increased \npermitting costs, paperwork, and other redtape, and it is far from \nfarmer friendly.\n  Yet the FDA exemptions for agriculture do not end there. Let us not \nforget EPA's backdoor energy tax where EPA is promising farms and \nranches an exemption. EPA is once again lulling farmers to complacency \nby sending this message: do not worry; we are not going to force you to \nbuy permits. To quote the EPA Administrator, ``EPA is proposing \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions in a responsible, careful manner and \nwe have even exempted agricultural sources from regulation.''\n  Producers, quite justifiably, heard the words ``exempted \nagriculture'' and may have thought: we are going to be OK here. The \nreality is far different and very definitely a course has been set that \nshould concern every single farmer, rancher, small business person in \nthis great Nation.\n  The American Farm Bureau put it best in testimony to the House Energy \nand Commerce Committee. I am quoting:\n\n       Any costs incurred by utilities, refiners, manufacturers to \n     comply with the greenhouse gas regulatory requirements will \n     be passed on to the consumers of these products including \n     farmers and ranchers. As a result, our Nation's farmers and \n     ranchers will have higher input costs--namely fuel and energy \n     costs--to grow food and fiber and fuel for our Nation and the \n     world.\n\n  So picture this: A Nebraska farmer gets the electric bill, calls up \nthe power company and says, whoa, wait a minute here. EPA told me its \nclimate change efforts were not going to target me. In fact, they said \nI was exempted. So why am I paying so much more?\n  Unfortunately, they are going to have the same conversation with the \ndiesel supplier, their fertilizer retailer, and the local gas station \nwhere they fill up the pickup and truck.\n  The EPA promise of exemption will, unfortunately, meet the reality of \ndramatic increases in input costs. EPA's reassuring words about an \nexemption will turn out to be absolutely empty, misleading, and \nabsolutely 100 percent unhelpful when the electricity and diesel bill \ncome due. But the public relations effort and charm offensive marches \non. It even includes an Executive order titled ``Improving Regulation \nand Regulatory Review,'' issued by the President in January. Isn't that \nenticing?\n  The directive instructs each Federal agency to consider ``how best to \npromote retrospective analysis of rules that may be outmoded, \nineffective, insufficient or excessively burdensome.''\n  According to the order, ``our regulatory system must protect public \nhealth, welfare, safety and our environment while promoting economic \ngrowth, innovation, competitiveness and job creation.''\n  My goodness, that is all of the right words. Once again, it sounded \nas though we are headed in the right direction. But then, in April, an \nEPA official stated that the Agency--this is remarkable--the Agency was \nunaffected by the President's Executive order because they do not \npropose rules where costs exceed the benefits. However, the same \nofficial admitted that the Agency does not consider direct job impacts \nin its economic analysis. Can anybody figure that out?\n  These two statements obviously conflict. EPA's actions in drafting \nseveral of these costly, excessive burdensome regulations fail to meet \nthe goals of the Executive order issued by the President of the United \nStates, but their public relations campaign speeds forward.\n  Back home in Nebraska, as in other States in this great country, we \nmake agreements on a handshake, because we believe if you shake \nsomebody's hand, you can trust them. That is the way it works. \nUnfortunately, within the bureaucratic walls of the EPA, that is not \nthe case. Instead of spouting charming verbiage about the benefits of \nincreased regulation, EPA should be looking for ways to work with \nfarmers and ranchers and small businesses to find solutions to \nenvironmental challenges while creating jobs for Americans who are out \nof work.\n  After all, the men and women who depend on the land to feed their own \nfamilies and to feed us are responsible stewards of the environment. \nUnfortunately, based on what we have seen over the past couple of \nyears, EPA used agricultural producers as offenders, not partners. \nEPA's shift into campaign mode to appear farmer friendly is \ndisingenuous. They rolled out this charm offensive to make it sound as \nthough they were farmer friendly.\n  Let me wrap up by saying, why not just do it? Be job friendly, farmer \nfriendly, agriculture friendly.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/08/senate-section/article/S3577-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3577-S3579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate my colleague's remarks \nabout the agricultural community. I am certainly hearing that, and one \nof the very real factors in our inability to create jobs in America is \nthe surging regulations that burden the private sector including the \nagricultural community. Mr. Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, was asked about that yesterday. He said no study had been done \nabout it, talking about the banking regulation primarily. We need to do \nmore about that and face the reality that that is so. Last week's \neconomic numbers were not good. They were very troubling. We saw an \nincrease in unemployment. We saw a decline in consumer confidence. We \nsaw a decline in manufacturing in the Midwest--a key area of our \ncountry for manufacturing. A number of factors were noted during that \nperiod which were not good. I guess it is part of an accelerated \ndecline in the stock market, which is down 5 percent, maybe 6 percent, \nafter 5 consecutive weeks of decline, and the Senate has gone 770 days \nwithout passing a budget. It is a fundamental responsibility of this \nbody, required by statute, that we pass a budget. The date is April \n15--and April 1 to commence hearings in the Senate--and we have not met \nthat responsibility. In fact, we haven't even had a markup in the \nBudget Committee to commence considering a budget. Our Democratic \nleader, Senator Reid, the majority leader in the Senate, has stated it \nwould be foolish to pass a budget. By that he means politically foolish \nfor the Democrats because they are enjoying trying to attack the House \nMembers who passed a responsible, long-term budget that changes the \ndebt trajectory of America. Instead of trying to do the same thing, \nthey just attack the House budget and produce nothing of their own.\n\n  The American people are rightly worried about our debt. They are \nworried about our economy. They are worried about overregulation. They \nare worried about the lack of jobs.\n  This week, Austan Goolsbee, the senior economic adviser to the \nPresident, announced he would be resigning his post this summer. His \ndeparture is just the latest in a trend of top economic advisers \nabandoning the administration over the course of the 2-plus years since \nthe passage of the failed $820 billion stimulus package, every penny of \nwhich was borrowed. The idea was to send out money and somehow \nartificially create a stronger economy. It\n\n[[Page S3578]]\n\nfailed, and many predicted it would fail.\n  The President's first Director of the Office of Management and \nBudget, Peter Orszag, left in July of last year. Christina Romer, the \nPresident's first Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, left last \nSeptember. Larry Summers, the former president of Harvard, former \nDirector of the National Economic Council for the President, left last \nDecember after less than 2 years.\n  As a result of the failed stimulus and other debt we have accrued, we \nare in much deeper debt, but Americans know it has not made them better \noff. In fact, increased debt has further eroded the economic confidence \nthat is necessary for a spirited recovery and has made our situation \nworse. Many say we have to borrow money to spend it and that is how we \nget the economy on a sound footing. Thoughtful economists and others \nhave said that this not so. I believe history has proven them to be \ncorrect; that borrowing to spend does not make us better off.\n  The last deficit before the President took office was $450 billion--\nfar too high. The year before that, the deficit was $162 billion. This \nyear, the deficit will be $1.5 trillion, the third consecutive \ntrillion-dollar deficit. Yet the President and some on his economic \nteam have promised that their spending program would keep unemployment \nfrom rising above 8 percent, but more than 2 years later unemployment \nnow stands at 9.1 percent, after having increased again last week.\n  The economic numbers released Friday show this to be the most \ndisappointing economic recovery in 70 years. Only 54,000 jobs were \ncreated in May, marking the worst jobs report in 8 months. The \nPresident asserts he is responsible for adding 2 million jobs since he \ntook office. But the percentage of our working age population that is \nemployed--and we have had an increase in the working age population--\nhas declined to 58.4 percent. We have to go back to October of 1983 to \nfind such a low number.\n  Nearly half the unemployed--45.1 percent--are now classified as long-\nterm unemployed, meaning they have been unemployed for 27 weeks or \nmore. While the official unemployment rate increased from 9 percent to \n9.1 percent, adding those who are underemployed--meaning those who \ncan't find full-time work or those who are so discouraged by the job \nmarket they have given up trying to find work--would boost the \nunemployment rate to 16.1 percent.\n  But perhaps most alarming of all, as pointed out in the June 4 lead \neditorial by Alan Abelson in Barrons, is that actual private sector \nemployment today is now 2 percent below where it stood 10 years ago. \nTwo percent fewer people are working today than were working 10 years \nago.\n  Citing Philippa Dunne and Doug Henwood of the Liscio Report, Mr. \nAbelson notes:\n\n       Job losses over a 10-year period is unprecedented since the \n     advent of something resembling reliable tallies began in \n     1890. So far, they point out somewhat grimly--\n\n  He is talking about Mr. Dunne and Mr. Henwood--\n\n     we've regained just 1.8 million jobs lost in the Great \n     Recession and its aftermath, or about one in five.\n\n  So the policies we are following are not working. We have to get this \neconomy moving. We added only 54,000 jobs, a net decline in percentage \nin terms of employment. We have to get jobs created, and 54,000 is way \nbelow what we need to have to stay level. About 180,000 a month need to \nbe added.\n  I would suggest that it is no wonder the President's top economic \nteam is leaving the administration.\n  But rather than recognizing the need to change course, the President \ndoubled down with the budget he submitted to Congress. He told the \nAmerican people his budget would ``not add to the debt'' and that it \nwould allow us to ``live within our means.'' But the Congressional \nBudget Office analyzed that budget and found otherwise--dramatically. \nIn fact, CBO said that the budget the President submitted to this \nCongress in February would double our debt over the next 10 years.\n  Meanwhile, economists are warning that if we don't change our debt \ntrajectory--and soon--our debt could stifle the very economic recovery \nthat is already moving far too slowly.\n  This is the important point, and it goes right to the heart of the \nargument that we have to artificially stimulate this economy by \nborrowing money from our children so we can spend it today and that \nthis is going to make us more healthy. A study by Carmen Reinhart and \nKen Rogoff titled ``Growth in a Time of Debt'' in American Economy \nReview (2010) shows that economic growth is 1 percent lower, on \naverage, in countries with gross debt above 90 percent of GDP--90 \npercent of their economy. It is 1 percent lower. If we want growth, we \nhave to look at how big our debt is. If it gets over 90 percent of GDP, \nthen we show an average of a 1-percent reduction in growth.\n  When asked about this study while testifying before the Budget \nCommittee earlier this year, Treasury Secretary Geithner called the \nReinhart and Rogoff study excellent, adding that ``in some ways . . . \nit understates the risks.'' In other words, it creates greater risks of \neconomic and financial spasm that could put us back into a recession. \nStephen Roach, chairman at Morgan Stanley and lecturer at Yale, was \nrecently asked on CNBC--yesterday, I believe--about what is happening \nwith the economy, why we see the disappointing results. This is what \nMr. Roach, a professional economist and player in the world financial \nmarkets, said:\n\n       I come down on it as Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart do, in \n     their analysis of post-crisis economies. This is the way it \n     is. When you have such a massive buildup of debt pre-crisis, \n     when you hammer the consumers the way we did in this crisis, \n     the economy is going to sputter.\n\n  America's debt stands now at 95 percent of GDP. It is set to exceed \nthe entire economy by the end of this year, and the President's own \nTreasury Secretary and widely respected economists are saying this \ncould have a negative impact on the economy and jobs. It could cause a \n1-percent decrease in economic growth, according to Rogoff and \nReinhart.\n  According to the Council of Economic Advisers, a 1-percent decrease \nin growth could cost about 1 million jobs--not 54,000 but 1 million. If \nwe had less debt, we would be seeing more than the anemic 1.8-percent \ngrowth in the first quarter as we come out of this recession. We would \nhave probably had 2.8 percent growth, if this study, which Mr. Geithner \nconsiders to be excellent, is accurate. Certainly, debt pulls down \neconomic growth. Common sense tells us so. Numerous experts agree this \ndebt is dangerous. It threatens our fragile economic recovery. Growth \nis what we need for jobs and it brings in more tax revenue and helps us \nbalance our budget.\n  But in response to the debt threat, what do we see? We got a budget \nfrom the President that would double the Nation's Federal debt in 10 \nyears. When that budget was released it received immense criticism, so \nthe President gave us a speech that suggested some changes. He called \nit a framework. Members of the Budget Committee wrote to the President \nand said: Well, put this in budget language. Send us a new budget then. \nIf you are changing, if people didn't like your first one, let's see \nthis one in detail. But they refused to do that. Recently, we voted on \nthe President's budget in this Senate. It was brought up and voted on. \nNot one Senator, Republican or Democratic, voted for that budget. It \nwas utterly rejected.\n  Meanwhile, our Democratic leadership in the Senate, which has the \npower to call the committee hearings that would commence a budget \nmarkup and eventually pass a budget, hasn't offered a budget this year. \nIndeed, they haven't passed a budget in the last 770 days. At least one \nwas brought out of committee last year but never brought up by Senator \nReid on the floor to be voted on, so we didn't have a budget last year. \nThis year, they didn't even bring the budget to committee to be marked \nup. The majority leader said it would be foolish for us to have a \nbudget. It would be foolish to have a budget in a time of the largest \ndeficit the Nation has ever incurred, which will occur this year--\napproximately $1.5 trillion in deficits. We bring in $2.2 trillion, and \nwe are spending $3.7 trillion this year. Forty cents of every $1 we \nspend is borrowed, and we don't even have a budget. What do we do? The \nmajority leader calls up the House budget, a responsible, historic \nalteration of the unacceptable debt path we are on, putting us on the \nright path.\n\n[[Page S3579]]\n\n  You can argue about some of the things that are in it, fine. But it \ncourageously and honestly changed the trajectory of America's debt path \nand was widely praised in that regard. The majority leader brought it \nup so he could vote it down and attack it, producing nothing on his \nown. So I brought up the President's budget. It got zero votes.\n  The failure of this body to produce a spending plan to tackle our \nNation's debt only creates more uncertainty in the economy. Doubt and \nfear are driving away jobs, stifling growth and investment. That is a \nfact.\n  For nearly 3 years, the White House has been seduced by the vision of \ngrowth through artificial means, including trillions in fiscal stimulus \nspending and so-called investments. Indeed, in a time of dramatic \nfiscal irresponsibility, the budget the President submitted to us \ncalled for a 10-percent increase in the Department of Education, a 10-\npercent increase in the Department of Energy, a 10.5-percent increase \nin the State Department, and a 60-percent increase in rail and \ntransportation spending. We do not have the money.\n  That budget reflected utter confusion and a detachment from reality.\n  Are our cities, are our counties, are our States increasing spending \nby 10.5 percent? Aren't most of them actually reducing spending? That \nis reality. That is what is happening in the rest of the world. The \nBritish reduced some of their spending recently--far more than we have. \nSome people there did not like it, and they complained that it was too \ndifficult and too tough. But the International Monetary Fund, in a \nrecent report, said: Stand to your guns. Get your debt under control. \nIn the long run, the International Monetary Fund said, this is the way \nto build a strong economy, and we have been going in the other \ndirection.\n  The Keynesian siren call to spend did not lead us to prosperity. We \nhave restored only one-fifth of the jobs lost in the recession. As a \npercentage of our population fewer are working today than during the \nso-called worst period of this recession, and we are experiencing the \nweakest recovery in modern history. Unemployment is back up again, and \nthe housing market is back down. Bad housing numbers came in last week \nalso.\n  Our fast-rising debt and our unwillingness to adopt a credible budget \nplan--and we can do that--is shattering economic confidence and \njeopardizing our future. But our Democratic leadership in this Senate \nrefuses to put forward a budget plan to confront the debt that they \nhave themselves increased so greatly.\n  We are told the President has not involved himself personally in \ndiscussions over the debt limit. That has been turned over to the Vice \nPresident. One report says he no longer receives daily economic \nbriefings. What signals do these actions send to our out-of-work \nAmericans, to struggling industries and businesses, and the anxious \nfinancial markets throughout the world?\n  Instead of stonewalling a budget, the Senate should be working \ntogether, Republicans and Democrats, to produce a budget that puts us \non a sound path and makes our economy as robust and as dynamic as \npossible. That is so basic. Blocking a budget under these economic \ncircumstances is simply unthinkable. There is no quick fix, no \naccounting gimmick, no political trick that will solve these problems. \nWe have a potentially healthy, growing economy. Our American businesses \nhave never been leaner or more efficient, as the Dallas Federal Reserve \nGovernor, Mr. Fisher, said the other day on one of these interview \nprograms. We have never had a more efficient, competitive business \nenvironment in America.\n  But in the long run--and that is what we must focus on--sound \nprinciples, common sense, spending restraint, less regulation, and more \ncommitment to the free markets will, if allowed, lift us out of this \nmalaise in which we find ourselves. To put America back to work, the \nSenate needs to get back to work.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I will yield to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, and then I will make my statement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Montana for \nyielding and also for bringing this issue before the Senate. I am \nreluctantly opposing my dear friend but doing so on the principles that \nare inherent in what we have tried to accomplish in the Dodd-Frank \nlegislation; that is, to provide for transparency in the pricing of \nfinancial products. With that as a starting point, I will begin.\n  One aspect I think we have to consider is not just this specific \namendment but the growing attempt to undermine the ability to implement \nthe reforms incorporated in the Dodd-Frank legislation, which are \nactually critical not just to protecting consumers but also to \nproviding a foundation for an effective financial system in the United \nStates, which is the foundation, I believe, of a growing and thriving \neconomy.\n  So this debate is not just about interchange fees; it is about \ncomprehensively dealing with the problems we saw manifest themselves in \nthe financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, where market discipline \ncollapsed, where some great institutions failed and some were on the \nverge of failure. If they had failed, then the ramifications would not \nbe simply restricted to Wall Street; they would have been felt on Main \nStreet, and we would be in a worse financial position than we are \ntoday.\n  But this specific amendment deals with the interchange fees or swipe \nfees. The first issue I think we have to recognize is these are hidden \nfees. They are charged in each transaction a consumer makes using a \ndebit card. Every time you swipe the card--which serves as an \nelectronic check--there is a fee. But the consumers do not see this \nfee. So basically you have a disguised price. If the price is \ndisguised, then the consumer does not have a real indication of the \ncost. If he does not know the cost, then that affects the rational \neconomic decisions we assume consumers are making every time they make \nan economic decision.\n  But at the end of the day, despite the fact that the consumer is \nunaware of these fees, he or she ends up paying them in higher prices \nfor gas, for milk; in fact, they have been paying these higher prices \nfor the privilege of using a debit card for years and years and years.\n  Debits cards are used more than checks today, more than credit cards \nto pay for everyday purchases. These secret fees--in a sense, you might \neven describe them as hidden taxes on consumers--add up to billions of \ndollars a month. The Durbin interchange provision of the Dodd-Frank \nWall Street reform law sought to make these interchange fees \ntransparent and public for\n\n[[Page S3580]]\n\nthe very first time. It requires that for transactions involving debit \ncards issued by banks with assets over $10 billion--the largest banks, \nnot the community banks, not the credit unions but the largest banks--\nthat these interchange fees set by a card network on behalf of its \nissuing banks must be reasonable and proportional to the amount it \ncosts the issuer to conduct the transaction.\n  This is the law of the land. The Federal Reserve was given the \nresponsibility of implementing the law through regulations, and they \nare on the verge of publishing those regulations.\n  Senator Durbin proposed this provision because businesses such as, in \nmy home State of Rhode Island, Cumberland Farms--the old convenience \nstore chain that I grew up with and the quintessential small business, \na family-owned business--pays almost as much in these hidden fees as it \nearns each year in profits. These fees roughly equal their profit.\n  Interchange fees are Cumberland Farms' second largest expense. It is \nnot the milk. It is not the gasoline. It is not a lot of things. It is \ntheir second largest expense. For example, despite the fact that the \ntotal number of gallons of gasoline they have sold has remained flat, \nthe interchange fees have increased 270 percent, from $13 million in \n2003 to a projected $48 million this year. Again, the number of gallons \nof gasoline they have sold has remained flat, but their interchange \nfees have gone up almost 270 percent.\n  Cumberland Farms' CEO calls this increase a ``runaway train.'' When \ngasoline was $2 per gallon, interchange fees were about 3 cents per \ngallon. Now that gas prices are about $4 per gallon, interchange fees \nhave increased to 5 cents a gallon. So for the same 15-gallon fill-up, \nthe hidden fees increased 63 percent. So the motorists, the local Rhode \nIslanders filling up at the local corner gas station, are paying for \ngreater interchange fees, on top of the increase in the price of \ngasoline.\n  The actual debit card services have not changed. But because the \nprice of gas increased, the fees almost doubled. That is a pretty good \ndeal for Visa and MasterCard and the banks. Unfortunately, as these \nfees continue to increase, they increase gas prices, they prevent \ninvestment, and they preclude new hiring. Indeed, the convenience store \nindustry reports that, overall, it pays more in these fees than it is \nearning in profits. That is overall across the board and across the \ncountry.\n  There is another example, a very local company, a very small \nbusiness: Chocolate Delicacy in East Greenwich, RI. It pays a swipe fee \non every piece of chocolate sold when paid by a debit or gift card, \nwhich amounts to 60 percent of their purchases. The owner, Marie \nSchaller, told me she feels like she has no choice but to pay the fee. \n``If I don't, I would lose over half of my sales.'' The growing swipe \nfees have meant a cutback in hiring for Marie.\n  At the Beehive Cafe, located in Bristol, RI, a cup of coffee costs \n$1.75. The swipe fee is 15 cents. Because card fees are hidden and \nthere is no ability to negotiate them, owner Jennifer Cavallaro said:\n\n       Visa and MasterCard have inserted themselves into every \n     single transaction that takes place--equating to a tax on \n     commerce. This is not free enterprise; the small business \n     person is trapped.\n\n  When consumers pay for some drinks with debit cards, 7-11 owners in \nRhode Island told me they lose money on every transaction. So why don't \nsupermarkets, drug stores, and other merchants negotiate to pay less? \nWell, they can't. The fees are set by Visa and MasterCard and the card \nnetworks. They have no bargaining power.\n  Most merchants in America are left with no choice but to accept the \ncards. They cannot play if they do not pay. In July 2010, we passed an \ninterchange provision so the Federal Reserve could study the fees and \ndecide whether they are reasonable. In fact, the Federal Reserve found \nthat they were not reasonable nor proportional.\n  The Federal Reserve found that the average swipe fee was 44 cents for \nevery purchase, but the processing costs were less than about 12 cents \nper purchase, giving them a 30-percent margin on their actual cost.\n  In December of last year, the Federal Reserve proposed rules to limit \nthe fee to reasonable rates. The Federal Reserve's top economists are \nreviewing and considering over 11,000 comments on their current \nreasonable fee proposal.\n  Chairman Bernanke has said they are committed to issuing a final rule \nby July 21 of this year. I believe they should be given the chance to \nstudy all the comments and complete the rule. Only by letting them do \ntheir work instead of disrupting it are we going to be able to see if \nthe new reasonable fee structure can open up this system and make these \nfees more reasonable and transparent.\n  Banks and card issuers that receive the fees have been vocal about \ntheir objections, preferring to keep the fees hidden and ever rising \nbeyond the current 44 cents. With such a large profit margin in this \nline of business most of us can understand why. MasterCard said in its \nAnnual Report to Shareholders:\n\n       We are devoting substantial management and financial \n     resources to the defense of interchange fees.\n\n  Visa told its shareholders that the rules ``may give retailers \ngreater ability to route debit transactions onto competitive networks \nwhich can reduce the processing fees we currently earn.''\n  So the credit card companies are very much aware that there could be \na better competitive environment for merchants and consumers if this \nlegislation goes through. That is what they told their shareholders.\n  Small banks, under $10 billion in assets, are exempt from the rules. \nA survey conducted by the American Banker found that an overwhelming \nmajority believe the law actually helps small banks. Small banks will \nhave a competitive advantage since their fees are not limited by the \nrule.\n  The United States is not alone in closely examining these fees. The \nEuropean Union, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Spain, South \nAfrica, and Switzerland already regulate swipe fees. In addition to the \never-increasing swipe fees merchants are forced to pay for, merchants \nalso bear the brunt of the cost of fraud, contrary to some of the \nassertions the industry has made.\n  It is my understanding that after fraud claims, networks typically \nraise interchange fees of the company that has been subject to the \nfraud and often engage in litigation against merchants to recoup fraud \nlosses. Of course, all of these costs--the merchant's costs and, I \nthink, also the interchange costs--are passed on to consumers.\n  Here are some examples: When criminals installed scanners to obtain \ncustomer account information at Michael's, a craft store, it was only \nthe latest theft of such consumer data. Community banks were quick to \nrespond and immediately issued new cards and returned stolen money. \nHowever, despite paying millions in interchange fees in the recent \npast, Michael's may have to reimburse Visa and MasterCard and the banks \nfor these replacement costs.\n  In another example, in December 2006, T.J.Maxx discovered that \ncomputer hackers had broken into their computer network and had stolen \ncustomer payment card data. In March of last year, a Federal judge \nsentenced one of the computer hackers responsible to 20 years in \nFederal prison.\n  Since 2006, T.J.Maxx has spent about $170 million in costs related to \nthis incident, including nearly $65 million to Visa and MasterCard to \ncompensate banks for the cost of the fraud.\n  This, of course, is in addition to continuing to pay their \ninterchange fees. The same hacker who hacked T.J.Maxx also hacked \nHeartland Payment Systems. That attack cost Heartland over $140 \nmillion, the majority of which was paid to Visa and MasterCard and \nother banks to compensate for the cost of the fraud. Heartland Payment \nSystems had to pay the banks and Visa and MasterCard for the computer \nfraud committed.\n  So the consumer pays for the data breaches, the consumer pays for the \ndebit card fraud, and the consumer pays more and more for interchange \nfees. I think any further delay in the rules to require reasonable \nswipe fees only harms small businesses and, in the end, the consumers.\n  The amendment before us provides for at least a 12-month delay in the \nrule, in addition to a 6-month study, and effectively a completely new \nversion of the proposed rule. I think it is unreasonable. There is no \nreason for delay. The Federal Reserve has what\n\n[[Page S3581]]\n\nChairman Bernanke characterized as, in his words, plenty of information \nfrom over 11,000 comments to the Federal Reserve's December 2010 rule \nproposal.\n  In addition, the Federal Reserve has done an enormous amount of \nsurveying of the industry, again in the words of Chairman Bernanke. I \nthink the proposal before us provides the banks another way to avoid \ntransparency in their operations.\n  The Federal Reserve should be allowed to finish their rules to \nestablish a reasonable fee for debit card services. Then we can work \nwith the banking regulators to make sure their rules do in fact work, \nand do in fact provide for a more transparent, competitive marketplace \nto the benefit of merchants and consumers.\n  Our market system only works well if merchants and consumers have the \ninformation they need to make informed choices, and that was what was \nat the heart of this provision in the Dodd-Frank Act. I believe that is \nwhat is at the heart of the Dodd-Frank proposal overall, which is to \nprovide better information, more transparency, whether it is credit \ncards or debit cards or complicated derivatives, because armed with \nbetter information individual consumers and individual merchants can \nmake better choices about economic decisions that will accrue to the \nbenefit of all of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, well, I want to thank Senator Reed for \nhis comments. Senator Reed is one of the leaders on the Banking \nCommittee. I appreciate his comments.\n  I do want to set the record straight on a couple of things though. It \nis not a 12-month delay plus a 6-month study. It is a 6-month study and \nthen implementation of the rules.\n  The Senator said Chairman Bernanke had plenty of information. The \nproblem is he does not have much information from community banks and \ncredit unions, and that is what this amendment is about.\n  The exemption that is in the amendment that we passed last year, \ncalled the Durbin amendment, every regulator at the Federal and State \nlevel has said they cannot make the exemption work because market \nforces will determine where the customers flow.\n  I am glad we are here to vote on the amendment that Senator Corker \nand Senator Hagan, Senator Crapo, Senator Bennet, and I have worked so \nhard on. This afternoon we are finally going to have an opportunity to \nvote for an amendment that has been crafted in the right way.\n  Senators Hagan and Crapo and Bennet came to Senator Corker and I \nabout a month ago to share their interests in fixing the unintended \nconsequences of that amendment that was passed in the Senate about a \nyear ago. The amendment directed the Federal Reserve to issue \nregulations limiting the cost that banks can charge retailers when \nconsumers use their debit cards to buy things. Based on the law, the \nFed intends to limit those costs to 12 cents, even though the actual \ncosts of these transactions may be higher.\n  The big Wall Street banks can handle that. They are not happy about \nit, but they can live with it. They have plenty of tools that will help \nthem make up the difference. The Main Street community banks and credit \nunions are a different story. These small guys, who had nothing to do \nwith the financial crisis, do not have that same flexibility the Wall \nStreet banks have. These are the banks in Montana. These are the folks \nI want to make sure have a fair shake. So folks from both parties came \ntogether and said: How can I fix this to make this protect the local \nbanks and credit unions since the original amendment does not?\n  Senator Corker and I suggested initially a 2-year delay, a study, and \nthen more legislating to fix any problems that were identified in the \nstudy. The Senators who are here today with me thought we could do \nbetter, and we could, and we did. After talking with our colleagues, we \nworked together to reduce the study period down to, as I said earlier, \n6 months.\n  At that point the Fed and other regulators will decide if the rules \ncan adequately prevent the small banks from getting hurt. I do not know \nwhat the study is going to find, and I do not think anybody knows. If \nthe agencies find that the rules consider all costs, that consumers \nwould not be harmed, and that the small issuer exemption--those that \napply to credit unions and community banks--if that exemption will \nwork, then the pending rules would move forward as passed. I would be \nthe first person in line to tell Senator Durbin that he was right about \nthe two-tiered system.\n  But if the Fed and the other regulators find that the changes must be \nmade to ensure that current rules do not include all costs or that \nsmall banks and credit unions and consumers might be harmed, then they \nwill have to issue new rules within 6 months, and every 2 years the Fed \nwould have to tell us in Congress whether these rules are still working \nfor the small banks and credit unions.\n  That is all we are asking. Before the Fed's new rules get \nimplemented, let's make sure we have them correct. Yesterday the good \nSenator from Illinois said this was not truly a compromise. But when \nyou sit down with folks who think you are on the wrong track and you \nwork together to find the middle ground, well, to me that is the \ndefinition of compromise.\n  Some other charges have been made about this amendment, and I would \nlike to take a moment to discuss those. Some say it is a favor to the \nbig banks. Well, it is not. In fact, this amendment corrects a very big \nproblem that only affects the community banks and credit unions. The \ngood Senator from Illinois said yesterday that he crafted this \namendment with awareness that a major reduction in interchange fees \nwould kill small banks and credit unions.\n  No one denies that small banks and credit unions would be deeply \nharmed if they are forced into a system where they can only charge 12 \ncents per transaction. No one denies that. This is why Senator Durbin \ntried to establish a two-tiered system. Under his proposal, big banks, \nthe Wall Street banks, could charge one rate, 12 cents per transaction.\n  The small banks, the community banks, credit unions, could continue \nto charge a percentage of a transaction, 44 cents on average. But there \nis a big flaw in the plan. The two-tiered system simply will not work. \nLet me repeat that. The two-tiered system simply will not work. I did \nnot make that up. Here is what the Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nsaid:\n\n       It is possible that the merchants will reject the more \n     expensive cards from smaller institutions, or because \n     networks will not be willing to differentiate the interchange \n     fee for issuers of different size. It is possible that the \n     exemption will not be effective in the marketplace.\n\n  That was Ben Bernanke saying that. He went on to say that because the \nexemption will not be effective, small banks could be hurt or even \nfail. Here is what the head of the FDIC said:\n\n       The likelihood of this hurting community banks and \n     requiring them to increase the fees that they charge for \n     accounts is much greater than any tiny benefit that the \n     retail customer may get.\n\n  Again, everyone agrees if the Fed's rules go into effect, the small \nbanks and credit unions will suffer because the exemption simply will \nnot work. So today we can stop and doublecheck to make sure that does \nnot happen or we can just flip a coin and hope for the best and watch \nas more small banks and credit unions fail, reducing consumer choice \nand reducing banking options, especially as they currently exist in \nrural America.\n  These small banks and credit unions are the ones that make the loans \nto small businesses in rural America. They are in places where folks \nare still willing to put their money. They are the ones that folks in \nMontana still trust. They do not trust the big Wall Street banks. We \nprobably will not lose too many banks in Washington, DC, or Chicago, \nIL, but we will in rural America. I do not want to see that happen.\n  Another good one that I have heard this week is the argument that the \namendment will allow banks and credit unions to factor executive \ncompensation into the cost of interchange fees. It will not. In fact, \nthe amendment specifically states that the Federal Reserve and other \nbanking regulators must look at the costs associated with debit card \ntransactions and program operations.\n\n[[Page S3582]]\n\n  We also know how dangerous it is to set a price for a product without \nunderstanding all of the costs that go into that product.\n  Home Depot would never allow the Federal Government to set the price \nof garden hoses simply by looking at the cost of manufacturing a garden \nhose.\n  No, Home Depot charges us for the cost of manufacturing it, shipping \nit, keeping it in stock, having someone tell you what aisle it is in, \nand on and on.\n  Likewise, if we are going to be regulating debit interchange fees, we \nneed to understand all of the costs associated with debit transactions \nand debit programs.\n  When we voted on this amendment last year, we thought we were voting \nto allow the Federal Reserve to consider all costs. However, the \nreality is that last year's interchange amendment limited the costs \nthat could be included. Some fraud costs were allowed to be included \nbut not others. Some technology costs were included but not others. If \nwe are going to be regulating this market, we need to be fair about it.\n  So the amendment directs the Fed to determine what is ``reasonable \nand proportional'' but it gives the Fed the discretion to look at all \nof the costs associated with debit transactions.\n  That does not mean executive pay. That does not mean a special \nrewards program.\n  All costs will still need to be justified, and if they cannot be \njustified they will not be considered. The Fed has been very clear with \nme--no executive pay, no bells and whistles.\n  But the decisions about the cost of routing networks, the costs of \nfraud and other technical details are much better left to the Fed than \ndecided by the U.S. Senate.\n  Finally, Madam President, some have said that this amendment hurts \nconsumers. It does not.\n  As someone who voted against the Wall Street bailout, who wrote part \nof the credit card reform act, and who voted for the Wall Street reform \nbill, I can tell you that if this amendment was somehow bad for \nconsumers, I would not offer it.\n  In fact, the amendment requires the regulators to certify that the \nFed's rules address consumer concerns.\n  The current law does not require anyone to look at the impact of \ninterchange fee regulation on consumers. They are out of the picture.\n  I am not aware of any specific plans by any retailers to lower prices \nor provide customer rebates if interchange fees are lowered. I know \nthat one large big box store held an earnings call at the beginning of \nthe year where a company executive called the proposal to lower \ninterchange fees a ``$35 million windfall.''\n  If I were a shareholder, that would have sounded pretty good to me. \nBut as a customer, it is not clear how I benefit.\n  I understand that there are some folks who wish the amendment could \ngo further to include additional consumer-oriented agencies such as the \nFederal Trade Commission as agencies that will conduct the study.\n  I would be happy to work with those Senators to see how we best \nprotect consumers in this process. But the only way to make that happen \nis to get this amendment adopted; otherwise, the Fed's rules go into \neffect on July 21 regardless of what any consumers think.\n  I am looking forward to today's debate because we have an opportunity \nto address the unintended consequences of the Durbin amendment. Make no \nmistake, those unintended consequences will be felt all over rural \nAmerica--and not for the better.\n  For the folks who think the two-tiered system will work, there is not \na regulator out there who will tell you that it will. Some folks will \ntell you the Durbin amendment has an exemption for community banks \nunder $10 billion and for credit unions under $10 billion. If they \nthink that will work, there is not a regulator out there who will tell \nyou that they can implement it and it will work because the free market \nsystem will drive it to the lower price. That is the way it is.\n  I am saying, let's slow down a little bit and make sure we get it \nright.\n  If we are going to create regulations, we are doing it in a way that \nis fair and consistent with the intent. Let's not try to solve one \nproblem and create three others.\n  And let's not take shots at the folks in my neck of the woods who \nwere not part of the financial meltdown.\n  That's all I am asking, and I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and ask unanimous consent that the time during the \nquorum calls until the vote be divided equally.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as one of \nthe opponents of the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to the Tester-Corker amendment No. 392 to the Economic \nDevelopment Revitalization Act.\n  The interchange fee debate is not a new one for the Senate. This is \nan old discussion with both sides--financial institutions and \nretailers--bringing their perspectives to the table.\n  I should note that I am a former small businessman and retailer. My \nwife and I owned and operated Enzi Shoes, a family retail shoestore in \nWyoming and Montana, for over 25 years.\n  Retail stores have been clamoring for a change for years and have \nalways felt ignored by the credit card and the big bank card companies. \nStores with small-priced items are forced to allow a sale to be put on \na debit or credit card. While some stores post signs requiring a \nminimum purchase, they are violating their service contract. If the \nfees were merely a percentage of the sale rather than a minimum amount \nor a percentage, whichever is larger, much of the argument would be \ngone. Without the percentage fees, small businesses have no leverage \nfor negotiation.\n  Soon vending machines will allow you to kind of point your cell phone \nat the vending machine and click, and you will get your snack or your \nsoda, and it will be billed to your debit card. But if the cost of \nmaking that purchase eats up the profits on the sale plus some money \nout of the vending machine owner's own pocket every time someone buys a \nsoda or snack, will the machines be available? No. You can't be in \nbusiness if you lose money on every sale.\n  Now, the vender has an option: They can charge as though every sale \nis a debit card sale and increase the cost of the item to cover \nwhatever cost the debit card company puts on your purchase. What you \nhave right now is this hidden fee that goes to a card company. The card \ncompany shares that fee with participating banks. Banks are now saying \nthat if they lose that fee, they will have to charge their customers in \nother ways. I am told the average bank will have to make up about \n$150,000 in hidden fees they are now receiving that customers have been \npaying on their purchases and don't know about them. Are hidden fees \nfair? I fight them every chance I get.\n  According to the Wyoming Retail Federation, retail stores, hotels, \nrestaurants, and small businesses in Wyoming consistently report that \ncredit-debit card fees have tripled in the last 10 years. These fees \nhave become a major cost, now surpassing other traditional costs of \ndoing business. This is a small business issue and small businesses \nparticularly because they do not have the leverage to do any \nnegotiating. Incidentally, in this case, neither do the big companies. \nBut the small businesses are paying two or three or four times, and \nsometimes more, for credit and debit charges.\n  When I recently traveled to Wyoming, a businessman compared his \nexpenses in the last 5 years to explain the effects of interchange fees \non his business. Gross sales between 2005 and 2010 were $5 million and \n$5.5 million a year. Percentage of sales made on credit-debit cards was \n15 percent in 2005 and 37 percent in 2010. Sales in the last 5 years \nincreased 10 percent and credit card\n\n[[Page S3583]]\n\nfees increased over 100 percent. Credit and debit card fees as a \npercentage of total sales were three-tenths of 1 percent in 2005 and 1 \npercent in 2010. So the fees tripled in just 5 years. The retailer has \nno control over that. It is a monopoly. When the bank raises fees, if \nyou know about it, you can change banks. The debit card business is \nlike a monopoly, so when the debit card companies increase their fees, \nthe only alternative is not to accept the cards as payment. But the \ncards have become a way of life, and the companies know it.\n  The profit margin of business is too narrow to sustain these \nincreases. This is why defeating the Tester-Corker amendment means \nsaving jobs in my home State of Wyoming and around the Nation. I \nbelieve increases in interchange fees are cutting into the resources \nthat could be used to provide more jobs.\n  During the financial regulatory reform debate last year, Senator \nDurbin offered an amendment that tasked the Federal Reserve--the Fed--\nwith studying the actual cost of debit card interchange costs versus \nfees being charged. I voted in favor of the Durbin amendment, hoping it \nwould create a dialog and a commonsense compromise on this issue. I was \ntrying to force this dialog clear back in my shoe-selling days. Card \ncompanies didn't pay any attention. I have tried ever since becoming a \nSenator. I have been ignored.\n  The Durbin amendment is the only thing that has gotten the debit \ncard-big banks' attention. But did they try to resolve it with the \nstores--the stores that were generating the sales and therefore \ncollecting their revenue? Again, a resounding no. They haven't met with \nthem at all. They have spent a fortune trying to convince the public \nthat their monopoly is OK and they shouldn't have to do anything about \nit; that they have always been right, they are still right, they are \ngoing to be right, and they do not have to talk to their customers, \nwhich are the stores.\n  I encouraged the banks to listen and to negotiate, but they chose to \nadvertise and message to make stores look like the bad guys. They have \nspent a small fortune advertising and messaging. One day, on my way to \nwork, I came by a place where they were giving out insulated coffee \ncups to give this message that the big banks were going to be put out \nof business by this amendment.\n  As we all know too well, dialog is occurring in the Halls of \nCongress, but that isn't going to rectify the problem. I agree that \ngovernment should not determine a set price on fees. I will say that \nagain. I agree the government should not determine a set price on fees. \nBut if a huge segment of the economy makes a case for redress, then it \nwill likely fall under what I call the probable legislation rule No. 3: \nIf it is worth reacting to, it is worth overreacting. It is not a good \nway to legislate, but unfortunately it happens a lot in Washington, and \nit may have happened in this case. I have worked for years to bring \nretailers and the big banks to the table to discuss and negotiate \ninterchange fees and make the system work better for both parties. It \nhasn't happened, and that is when we get to this reaction time.\n  Since passage of the bill last July, there has been ample time for \nthe banks and retailers to work out a solution. Dialog between the \nfinancial institutions and the retailers has to occur in order to find \nan immediate and a real solution to this problem.\n  The interchange fee provision is an important issue that deserves the \nfull attention and consideration of both intended and unintended \nconsequences, but our Nation's retailers and small businesses can't \nafford continued delays and studies because this kicking the can down \nthe road is to keep things the way they were, and it is what we will be \ngetting today if the amendment passes. Oh yes, it looks as though there \nis going to be some interaction there. If the big banks win today, the \ncustomers of stores lose.\n  Following the passage of the Durbin amendment, S. 575 was introduced \nthis year by Senators Tester and Corker as a stand-alone bill to delay \nimplementation of the Federal Reserve rules until the impact of those \nfees could be studied for another 2 years. That is the original bill \nwhere this amendment comes from. A similar House bill proposed to \ndelay-study the debit card interchange fee rule for 1 year. Now, \nsearching for votes, Senators Tester and Corker have changed their \namendment, so what we will be voting on today is a study and a year of \nkicking the can down the road. But even though it has been changed, it \nis still wrong.\n  My colleagues knew I was not willing to support the original 2-year \ndelay which would effectively bury progress made on the issue. A 2-year \nstudy was not just kicking the can down the road; it was making an \nindefinite delay on any changes and prohibiting dialog between parties.\n  I commend Senators Tester, Corker, Crapo, and others for working to \ndecrease the study timeline from 2 years to 12 months. As you have \nheard during this debate, the Tester-Corker amendment would allow for 6 \nmonths of studying the interchange fees, plus an additional 6 months \nfor the Treasury and Federal Reserve to draft a final rule. While this \nis a step forward in the resolution, more needs to be done to \naccelerate this process. Another full year without a solution is too \nlong for merchants and retailers.\n  There is another problem too. That is the Fed will still be making \nthe rule. We have to realize that banks work with the Fed all the time, \nso banks understand the Fed and the Fed understands the banks. \nRetailers don't work with the Fed. The Fed does not check on the \nretailers. So how do you think the rule the Fed will write will come \nout if we kick the can down the road another year? I think the banks \nwill have a big advantage.\n  What we need is for the banks to listen to their customers, the \nretailers, and come up with a workable solution. The Fed isn't the \nright place for that decision. The Fed just made a decision that the \nbanks decided they didn't like. Quite frankly, for some of the small \nbanks, there is a problem too because what was allowed for small banks \nto give them an edge isn't ever going to happen. People will shop where \nit is cheapest, which will be the big banks. So I think the Fed did get \nit wrong, and I don't think the banks will get it right unless there is \nsomething that is real to them.\n  On July 21, the current rule will go into effect. On July 21, they \nwill finally feel that it is real, and they ought to sit down with \ntheir customers, the retailers, and get it figured out. I don't think \nit is that tough. I know where the changes were that I would have liked \nto have seen, and I didn't represent the whole gamut, but there are a \nfew associations that would be viable to work this out. It doesn't need \nto be done through legislation. But if today we pass the Tester-Corker \namendment, there won't be any incentive for them to do anything for at \nleast another year because the problem still won't be real.\n  The banks don't think there is a problem. The retailers know there is \na problem, and the retailers' customers are beginning to understand \nthere is a problem. I just saw a survey from Montana, and 75 percent of \nthe people are opposed to the swipe fees that are currently in place--\n75 percent. America is figuring things out faster than Congress is, and \nwe have to be with the people. We have to take care of the problems \nthey see, especially when it is that huge a majority. I don't like \ndoing things based on polls, but I do like polls to give me an \nindication.\n  I go back to Wyoming almost every weekend, and I travel to a \ndifferent part of the State every weekend and talk to the real people; \nI just don't read it in the papers or read the studies. I can tell you \nthat 75 percent is probably just about right. I think it might be just \nslightly higher than that in Wyoming.\n  The banks and the retailers should get together and come up with a \nrule that will work for both of them but not one that maintains a \nmonopoly. When you sign on to one of these credit card agreements--and \nyou have to do one of those in order to be able to accept them and have \nthe money work through the system back to you--you are not given any \noptions. There isn't anything you can shop around for because all the \nagreements are the same. If you sign one of those agreements, you have \nto be willing to accept it no matter what the size of the purchase.\n  Now, if you are selling a soda for $1 and you are paying 44 cents, \nyou know the soda company isn't making enough to cover the 44 cents, so \nthey have to\n\n[[Page S3584]]\n\nraise their price, which gets passed on to the customer. They have to \nraise the price so that it covers the credit card, but it also has to \ncover the other sales because there is no way for them to distinguish \none from the other. They can't charge more for a credit card sale than \na debit card sale, and they shouldn't. So they build in a hidden fee \nthat you don't know you are paying. That fee is a huge fee, and it \ntakes away some of the profits on the small sales. That is one of the \nprimary areas that is driving this whole issue. There are other areas, \ntoo, but that is the simplest one that could be figured out.\n  Both sides on this issue need to have a hand in the negotiating. \nDefeating this amendment gives them both a hand, and that is why I \nstrongly believe two things need to occur to fix this problem. No. 1, \nany study should not be longer than 6 months total study time and \ndrafting of the rule and, No. 2, banks and credit unions must come to \nthe table with retailers and merchants to define some middle ground. It \nwould be more workable if bankers and retailers sat down and negotiated \nan agreement. They don't need a study. The retailers know what the \nproblem is. The banks know the problem better than the retailers. So \nall they have to do is skip the study, sit down, and work it out. I \nthink it could be worked out before July 21, although a deadline is \nalways good. So we really need to defeat that.\n  It is a tough issue for small business owners, merchants, and \nretailers because many of our community lenders have come to rely on \nthis interchange income. No good comes from pitting small businesses \nagainst lenders in Wyoming or otherwise, especially not in this \neconomy. Bankers already know what changes need to be made. If they had \nput more effort into forcing bank card fees to be more reasonable, the \nsituation could have been solved years ago. Clearly, it could have been \nwhen I was back in the shoe business. I can tell you, I am pretty \ndiscouraged that now that I am in the Senate they still are not \nlistening.\n  This bill has made them listen. So no more delays should occur. \nInterchange fee reform was overwhelmingly approved by Congress last \nyear. U.S. consumers do not need additional studies to tell them they \nalready pay the highest swipe fees in the world. Delaying these reforms \nwill delay urgently needed relief for American businesses and \nconsumers, relief that cannot wait longer during this fragile economic \nrecovery.\n  Today I ask my colleagues to side with the stores and their \ncustomers; otherwise, we will have just done another bailout for big \nbanks.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming. Our \nrelationship and friendship has been growing over the years. I respect \nhim so much as one of the real voices of retailers and small business. \nI had an opportunity to spend some time visiting China with him and his \nwife. We got to sit down and talk about their lives and what they have \nbeen through.\n  My colleague knows the small business side of this world better than \nanybody who sits in this Chamber. As I listened to him talking about \nthe solution to this problem, I could not help but nod affirmatively. \nThere is no reason we should have had to vote a year ago to establish \nthis interchange fee. It reflected the fact that retailers, small \nbusinesses, merchants, hotels, restaurants, and shopkeepers across the \nboard were literally given no seat at the table to discuss the fairness \nand propriety of these interchange fees. The point he made drives it \nhome. The credit card networks, working through the banks, are charging \nour businesses in America the highest interchange fees--that is the fee \ncharged every time someone swipes that plastic debit card--of any \ncountry in the world. The interchange fee in Canada is zero; in the \nUnited States, 44 cents on average on every transaction.\n  I could not agree with the Senator more. If the banks would come down \nout of their ivory towers on Wall Street and other places and sit down, \nroll up their sleeves with the folks running shoe stores and grocery \nstores and hotels and restaurants, and say all right, we are going to \ncome up with a fairer system--if it is zero in Canada and it is 44 \ncents here, there is a number in between that can make sense to both \nsides. If that were the case, the Senator and I would be working on \nsome other issues rather than this one.\n  But my colleague is so right. Today we have to defeat the Tester-\nCorker amendment; otherwise, we are sending a massive subsidy to the \nbiggest banks on Wall Street, up to $8 billion a year that they collect \nin these debit card interchange fees at the expense of small businesses \nand consumers all across America.\n  I thank the Senator for his support. I know later this afternoon at 2 \no'clock when we face this vote it is an important vote for every small \nbusiness in his home State and mine as well. I thank the Senator for \ntaking the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Tester-Corker \nvote which will take place at 2 o'clock today. I know there has been a \nlot of discussion about the Durbin amendment which occurred during \nDodd-Frank and where we are today.\n  I wish to spend a moment clarifying the fact that the Tester-Corker \namendment does not do away with the Durbin amendment. The Durbin \namendment will still be the law of the land and a huge victory during \nthe Dodd-Frank regulation--something I did not support but a huge \nvictory for the retail industry, in that for the first time in the \nhistory of our country, per the law that was passed, debit cards are \ngoing to be a regulated industry.\n  There is nothing about the Tester-Corker amendment that in any way \nchanges the fact that it is going to be a regulated industry. That is \ngoing to occur. What Tester-Corker does is to try to bring back into \nbalance how we look at this particular transaction. We are going \nthrough this period of time in our country's history where people have \nbeen very upset with financial institutions at many levels. It is \nalmost as if the Durbin language is an attempt to basically punish, be \npunitive, to community banks, rural banks, credit unions, mega banks \nall across our country for things that happened in the past.\n  There is no question many financial institutions made mistakes. There \nis no question that government made mistakes. There is no question that \nCongress has made mistakes. There is no question that consumers across \nour country, in many cases, have made a lot of mistakes. But we are at \na place in our country's evolution where what we need to do is \nreinforce economic growth in this country and make sure that regulation \nhas the right balance.\n  I feel the pushback against Tester-Corker is an attempt to continue \nto try to punish, stick a stick in the eye of, do whatever, to get back \nat the financial industry. Again, I think there has been a tremendous \nwin by the proponents of the Durbin amendment. You have a debit card \nindustry that is going to be regulated.\n  The question is, What is the fair way to regulate them as it relates \nto what are the allocated costs. So the Federal Reserve has told us the \nlanguage that exists in the Durbin amendment, which only allows \nincremental costs, is inappropriate. They are very uncomfortable with \nit. They are uncomfortable with what that is going to do to community \nbanks, rural banks, smaller banks all across our country.\n  The FDIC has said they are very concerned about the language because \nthe cost of the transaction is not going to be appropriately assessed. \nThey have shared that in public testimony. The OCC has done exactly the \nsame. State bank commissioners across this country have done the same.\n  I know the Presiding Officer is from Minnesota. I know he flies to \nWashington probably each week. The way the language is now written, it \nwould be as if the Presiding Officer got on a flight in Minneapolis to \nfly to Washington, the seats were mostly full, but a standby passenger \ngot on the plane at the last minute, sat down in an empty\n\n[[Page S3585]]\n\nseat, and the airline was forced to charge everybody who flew on their \nairline only the cost of what that one additional passenger--already \nthe trip was going to take place--what that one additional passenger \ncost the airline to travel from Minneapolis to Washington.\n  Obviously, that cost is almost negligible because all the \nreservations, the flight has been fueled, the flight attendants are \nthere, the pilots are there. All those costs are already there.\n  That is the way the Durbin amendment now reads. That is the way the \nlaw now is; that the Federal Reserve can only take into account, as \nthey regulate the debit card industry, what that incremental cost is, \nwhat adding one transaction to the system would cost.\n  Everybody knows--the retailers that are opposing our amendment know--\nthere is no way any of them could survive in the retail industry if \ntheir costs were only allocated to them on an incremental basis. So \neverybody knows this is flawed. I do not think there is any debate \nabout the fact that the way we are looking at regulating the debit card \nindustry is flawed.\n  But what people are doing--it is almost sort of a Venezuelan \napproach. We are angry at these folks, so even though we know that \nassessing the cost of debit cards and only allowing incremental costs, \neven though we know that is inappropriate and that no business in \nAmerica can survive, we are still going to do it because the banks were \ninvolved in TARP or the banks did this or the banks were involved in \nmortgages.\n  It is a policy that does not make sense. It is not an appropriate \nway, in my humble opinion, for a body such as ours--that hopefully \nstands above grudges, stands above trying to punish people but is here \nto put policies in place that will make our country stronger. So what \nwe have added--and I see the Senator from North Carolina who has been \nhighly involved in reaching the place we are--what we have said is: \nLook, Durbin should stand. Durbin should stand as it is. We should \nregulate the debit industry. OK. We understand that is going to happen. \nBut let's make sure that when the regulators look at regulating the \ndebit card industry, they are able to also look at the fixed costs, \nthose costs that should be appropriately considered in setting the \nrates.\n  My guess is the Presiding Officer has some regulatory boards in the \nState of Minnesota. Maybe they regulate electricity. Maybe they \nregulate water. Maybe they regulate natural gas. I do not know. We have \nsimilar types of things in Tennessee. When they look at regulating \nthose industries, they take into account those costs that are \nappropriate in regulating the industry.\n  I have not heard anybody debate, negatively, that it is \ninappropriate--that it is inappropriate--to allocate costs the way \nSenator Hagan, the way myself, the way others have talked about doing. \nIt has all been about the emotion of trying to do damage to financial \ninstitutions because people are upset with them. That is what their \nargument has been about. It has been an emotional argument about \nsaying: These institutions did some very bad things, and therefore we \nwant to punish them, even though we know the cost allocation is \ninappropriate.\n  We all know that what is going to happen is, not only are we going to \ndo damage to our community banks, our credit unions, our rural banks \nall across this country, but in the process of allowing the rules to \nstand as they are and the direction we give to the Fed to stand as it \nis, what is going to happen is we are going to have a constriction of \ncredit.\n  I mean right now in our country, we are watching a pause, a pause \ntaking place in economic growth. One of the driving factors--there is \nno question--is our financial institutions are out there. They are \nseeing in every way their ability to lend to be clamped down on. \nCapital requirements are changing. Some of these things were good \nthings that needed to happen, but this is just one more of those.\n  Lots of people have been involved in making this so we get back to \nthe middle of the road, that when we regulate debit cards, we do so \ntruly looking at the cost of the card itself.\n  If this amendment is defeated, it is just one more blow against our \neconomy as we continue to constrict lending in our financial \ninstitutions to communities and citizens all across our country. \nSomebody had a chart up yesterday looking at Canada and looking at \nEurope. One little detail--and they were talking about the lack of \ndebit charges or, in some cases, the fees were less than they are in \nour country.\n  One of the details they left out is, they do not have community \nbanks. In Canada, you have a handful of highly regulated almost \nutilities that are banks--under five. That is a very different scenario \nthan we have, where we have community banks all across the country that \nare out there lending to innovators, banks all across this country \nlending to innovators, a very different environment.\n  So, in Canada, they are able to actually generate fees in other ways. \nOf course, they do not have the community banking system and credit \nunion system that we have across our country. To me, what I hope will \nhappen at 2 o'clock--I know this has been a contentious issue, a vote \nthat candidly a lot of people would just as soon have go away because \npeople have friends who are retailers, people have friends who are \nbankers, and they hate to ``choose between their friends.''\n  But I hope what will happen at 2 o'clock is that when people come \ndown in the well to vote, they will look at the policies, and they will \nsay: You are right. The financial industry has been involved in some \nexcesses. You are right. We heavily regulated the financial industry 1 \nyear ago when Dodd-Frank was passed, and you are right; if we are going \nto set rates on debit cards, let's at least allow the Fed to consider \nall the appropriate costs--they do not have to take all the costs--but, \nlook, if a bank is offering bonus awards for people, that should not be \nincluded. We understand that.\n  But the Fed ought to be able to look at all those costs that are \nfair. I hope Members of this body will rise above the emotional aspect \nof this vote. I hope they will rise above the rhetoric. This is \nanything but another bank bailout. What this is allowing is the Fed to \nrightfully, as they have requested of the Senate, to rightfully be able \nto look at all the appropriate costs that go into a debit transaction.\n  Again, if Tester-Corker passes, if Tester-Corker-Hagan-Crapo passes, \nif it passes, it is a tremendous win for the retailers. They have a \nregulated debit card industry, something they wanted for a long time. \nBut it also strikes the balance of appropriateness as it relates to us \nas we look to move ahead with appropriate regulation of our financial \nindustry.\n  I know we are on the cusp. I know this is going to be a very close \nvote. I do hope our colleagues will look at the policy. If they have \nnot spent time yet with their staffers, look at the language. Durbin \nstill stands if Tester-Corker passes. Durbin stands. All it does is \nallow the regulators to appropriately--just as happens in every State \naround this country that regulates industries--allows the Fed to \nappropriately look at those costs that ought to be associated with a \ndebit card.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of Tester-Corker.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I, too, come to the floor in support of \nthe amendment by Senator Tester and Senator Corker from Tennessee.\n  Let me tell you, I threw myself into these negotiations many weeks \nago when I saw the great bipartisan work of my colleagues from Montana \nand from Tennessee. You just heard the Senator from Tennessee talking \nabout this. They have worked tirelessly on this issue. They have shown \ngreat leadership in their willingness to modify their approach.\n  What we have now is a bipartisan, balanced compromise amendment that \nis going to address the concerns raised by the regulators, small debit \ncard issuers, and many Senators, about the Federal Reserve's approach \ntoward a regulated interchange fee market.\n  The amendment does not repeal the debit interchange amendment \nchampioned by Senator Durbin last year. As the Senator from Tennessee \njust said, it does not repeal that. In fact, a number of Senators who \nsupported Senator Durbin's amendment, also support this\n\n[[Page S3586]]\n\ncompromise amendment. It is moderate. It is bipartisan. It is balanced. \nIt now gives the regulators the time and the tools they need to get \nthis rule right.\n  This is the type of commonsense compromise that Senators on both \nsides of the aisle can support. This bipartisan, balanced approach is \nhow the Senate should operate.\n  When the Senate added section 1075 to the Dodd-Frank Act last year, \nit required that interchange transactions fees charged by issuers be \nreasonable and proportional.\n  Importantly, the amendment also exempted banks with fewer than $10 \nbillion in assets. During the rule writing process, this exemption has \nbeen characterized as ineffective.\n  In February, during testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, \nFederal Reserve Chairman Bernanke, the person ultimately responsible \nfor writing these rules said that, ``it is possible that that exemption \nwill not be effective in the marketplace'' and that ``it is possible \nthat, in practice, community banks would not be exempt from the lower \ninterchange fee.' ''\n  FDIC Chairwoman Bair and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors \nechoed those concerns.\n  These are the people responsible for monitoring the safety and \nsoundness of our community banks and credit unions and they have \nexpressed serious doubts about the practical effectiveness of the small \nissuer exemption.\n  This is extremely concerning to me, a Senator from North Carolina, \nwhich has a strong presence of community banks and credit unions that \nserve my constituents across the State.\n  This legislation helps get the small issuer exemption right. It \nprovides two levels of protection for small banks and credit unions.\n  First, it considers the impact on small issuers up front as part of a \nshort 6-month study.\n  It directs the banking and credit union regulators to carefully \nreview the effectiveness of the small issuer exemption, which will be \ngoing to the community banks and credit unions.\n  And it directs the regulators to look at the exemption from a safety \nand soundness perspective. This is of particular importance at a time \nwhen community banks around the country are struggling to provide \ncredit to Main Street businesses.\n  Then, once the final rules are in place, it would require a review of \nthe effect of the rule on the market.\n  This approach gives regulators the time to look at small banks and \ncredit unions up front and an opportunity to point out any problems \nthat may occur in the future.\n  This is a sensible, balanced approach. It is a bipartisan approach. \nIt is one that I would urge my colleagues to support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nOregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to discuss the \nunderlying legislation, the Economic Development Administration bill, \nbecause I think, with the new numbers about the American economy--the \njoblessness and the trends--we are all looking for ways to encourage \ninvestment in the United States, and we are looking for ways to promote \nnew industries that will create family wage jobs.\n  The Economic Development Administration has helped to do that in my \nhome State and in other parts of the country. I want to take a few \nminutes and discuss that. I see the chairman of the Finance Committee. \nWe may have gotten a little backed up, and I am anxious to hear from \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee.\n  The area I want to talk about with respect to the Economic \nDevelopment Administration involves nanotechnology. This is, in effect, \nthe science of small stuff. We are seeing it pay off big in a whole \nhost of energy-related applications, and in health care particularly, \nin terms of drugs and new medical devices. It has made a big difference \nat the Pentagon in terms of their looking at and adding carbon \nnanotubes to a number of the products we need to protect our \nwarfighters.\n  The fact is, when we talk about this agency, we are seeing that a \nsmall public investment can leverage very substantial private sector \ninvestment in a way that is going to encourage jobs in the United \nStates, and particularly in what I call the sunrise industries. It is \nsure making a difference.\n  For example, Wired magazine recently talked about growth in a number \nof key sectors. They said nanotechnology, between 2006 and 2010, grew \nmore than 18 percent--one of our leading growth industries with jobs in \nthe United States.\n  I, for one, thought we were going to see growth in a number of \ninstances. We have seen bipartisan support for congressional efforts. \nThe 21st century nanotechnology legislation in particular, signed by \nGeorge W. Bush, is one piece of legislation I was especially proud of \nbeing part of because it encouraged research in this exciting field and \nhad bipartisan support. It laid the groundwork for the next steps.\n  The next steps in particular involve using at EDA some modest public \ninvestments to leverage very substantial private investments in \ninnovation. In my State, ONAMI, the Oregon Nanoscience and \nMicrotechnologies Institute, is on the cutting edge of nanotechnology \nresearch and application. It has been helped by the EDA agency.\n  Participants in ONAMI include Oregon's four largest public research \nuniversities, the National Science Foundation, the Departments of \nDefense, Energy, Commerce, and major corporations as well. What we have \nsought to do is to make sure in this extraordinarily exciting field we \ndon't fall behind China and other global competitors. So there is huge \npotential. Federal efforts can support private sector initiatives in \nthe nanotechnology field and together leverage U.S. advantages in \ninnovation and technology and particularly facilitate job growth.\n  The Chair knows of Intel, which is a large employer in his State as \nin mine. That is the kind of company we are looking at for the future, \nwhere they pay good wages. We are seeing substantial growth, and they \nare looking to try to target nanotechnology in particular as a sunrise \nindustry, as an area that is going to facilitate an opportunity for our \ncountry to lead.\n  America is in a fight for the future of nanotechnology. We are seeing \nChina and a lot of our global competitors making major investments in \nthis area. Our private sector is stepping up, but we ought to have the \ngovernment partner as well. That is why EDA's support of nanotechnology \nand the innovation economy is so critical. They have partnered with the \nNational Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health to \npromote innovative approaches in health and science.\n  I am proud to say, as part of a major economic challenge grant, the \nOregon Innovation Cluster, of which ONAMI is a part, was one of the \naward winners. My State is not the only place where nanotechnology \ninvestments are being made. The Economic Development Administration has \ninvested in nanotechnology throughout the country--in Colorado, the \nMid-Atlantic Nanotechnology Alliance; in Tennessee and in South \nCarolina with the Clemson University Research Foundation. These are \njust a few examples, from Oregon all the way to the east coast of the \nUnited States, where the Economic Development Administration has helped \nentrepreneurs work to create jobs in exciting fields such as \nnanotechnology and helped us commercialize leading-edge technologies.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this bill. I particularly commend \nthe chairman of the committee, Senator Boxer. Nanotechnology and EDA \nare a partnership where high-tech industries can help create good, \nhigh-paying jobs in America. I hope we will support this particular \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for S. \n782, the 5-year reauthorization of the Economic Development \nAdministration, which I am proud to have cowritten.\n  Abraham Lincoln said:\n\n       The legitimate object of government is to do for a \n     community of people whatever they need to have done but \n     cannot do at all, or cannot so well do for themselves, in \n     their separate and individual capacities.\n\n  That is what the Economic Development Revitalization Act of 2011 will \ndo. It authorizes and funds the EDA, a Department of Commerce agency, \nin order to help Americans achieve what they ``cannot so well do for \nthemselves.''\n  EDA is the only Federal agency charged solely with job creation. Each\n\n[[Page S3587]]\n\ndollar of EDA funding leverages nearly $7 in private sector investment.\n  From 2005 to 2010, during the administrations of Presidents from each \npolitical party, EDA awarded $1.2 billion in construction-related and \nrevolving loan fund projects. According to estimates, more than 314,000 \njobs resulted from those investments.\n  EDA programs are critical to my home State of Montana, a State with \nlower per capita income but great 21st century potential. When the \ntimber industry in the western part of the State suffered setbacks, we \npaired Federal EDA funding from the 2009 Recovery Act with State \ndollars to create an $11.7 million revolving loan fund. We enabled 34 \ncompanies to continue operating and supported nearly 2,000 jobs despite \nthe economic downturn.\n  In the eastern part of the State, we experience outmigration where \nthe problem is both people and jobs leaving the area altogether, which \nEDA can help us address in a new provision under this bill.\n  A key feature of this bill is the increased Federal share for areas \nthat demonstrate unusually severe economic distress and unique \ncircumstances.\n  For instance, in the event of a federally declared disaster, the \nFederal share is to be increased for 18 months. This applies to a \nnonweather event such as the September 11 attacks or a natural disaster \nsuch as we have experienced in Montana where we currently face severe \nflooding conditions.\n  Areas like Roundup, Lodge Grass, Harlem, Fort Peck, Rocky Boy's, \nLewistown and elsewhere are confronted with a crisis of biblical \nproportions. I was in Montana last week witnessing the challenges that \nconfront us. And I am working very hard to ensure that Federal \nresources will be available for those most in need, which is a \nlegitimate object of government, as Lincoln observed. This Federal \nshare provision is one more way to do that.\n  Also, we have established a minimum 75 percent Federal share under \nthis bill to help Indian tribes lacking sufficient resources to provide \nthe typical matching share--as is often the case in my home State of \nMontana.\n  I want to thank Chairman Boxer and Ranking Member Inhofe for their \nleadership and for working with me on this bill. I also commend and \nthank EDA Administrator John Fernandez for coming to Montana to meet \nwith my constituents in Missoula and Butte last September to discuss \nopportunities that would help our State and the country.\n  In closing, this is a good bill with backing from both sides of the \naisle. I urge my colleagues to support it. We talk a lot about helping \njob growth. Here is an opportunity to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Montana.\n  I was an original cosponsor of Senator Tester's bill, which forms the \nbasis for this amendment, because I am concerned about consumers, \ncredit unions, and the financial sector in Delaware. The Federal \nReserve's proposed rule on interchange regulation does not guarantee \nconsumers will benefit from reduced rates, and inadvertently creates a \nmechanism that could destabilize some of our small, community banking \ninstitutions. Because of these unintended consequences, I believe the \nFed should go back to the drawing board and rethink the way it is going \nabout setting interchange fees.\n  I know my friend, the Senator from Illinois, worked hard last \nCongress, bearing in mind the interests of all parties involved, to \nauthorize the Fed to make such a rule on regulating these fees. The \nDurbin amendment included a well-intentioned provision to protect small \nbanks by creating a carve-out exemption from certain interchange fee \ncaps.\n  Unfortunately, I believe the Fed issued its proposed rule in haste, \nand it is becoming clear that this carve-out exemption threatens the \ncompetitiveness of smaller banks, community banks, and credit unions. A \nbelief in the viability of this exemption was crucial in securing the \nvotes necessary to include Senator Durbin's amendment in the Dodd-Frank \nreform package.\n  When the Senator from Illinois wrote his amendment last year, I know \nhe had the best of intentions when he directed the Fed to establish a \ndebit rate that is ``reasonable and proportional'' to the \n``incremental'' cost of an individual transaction. These criteria, \nhowever, have tied the Fed's hands and, essentially, prohibit the Fed \nfrom considering all costs associated with debit operations when \nregulating debit interchange fees.\n  Additionally, the two-tiered interchange system proposed by Durbin's \nsmall bank exemption may be considered unworkable in practice and \nsubject to market forces. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben \nBernanke, admitted as much when he appeared before the Senate Banking \nCommittee in February. He noted that ``there is a possibility . . . \nthat, either because merchants wouldn't accept the more expensive cards \nor because networks would not be willing to have a two-tier pricing \nsystem, it's possible that in practice they would not be exempt from a \nlower interchange fee.''\n  I have met in recent months with a broad range of large and small \nbanks, credit unions, card networks, retailers, merchants, and other \nconcerned parties from Delaware and other States about the Fed's \nproposed rule. With their helpful input, and with our continued \neconomic recovery foremost in mind, I have joined with a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators in support of this amendment, which would direct the \nFed to study this issue further and come up with a rule that does not \nrisk harming the small banks and credit unions that play such an \nimportant role in our communities.\n  At a time when large banks have been reluctant to lend capital, more \nand more new businesses and ventures are being started through loans \nfrom smaller community banks and credit unions. We cannot afford to \nundercut their lending ability through the losses they are likely to \nincur if the Fed's proposed rule becomes final. The effect that would \nhave on our recovery could be harmful.\n  At a hearing held by the Banking Committee on May 12, Chairman \nBernanke was asked what the effect of the small bank exemption would be \nif the proposed rule were implemented. He answered: ``It's going to \naffect the revenues of the small issuers, and it could result in some \nsmaller banks being less profitable, or even failing.''\n  Furthermore, at the same hearing, Sheila Bair, Chairman of the FDIC, \nstated: ``I do think this is going to reduce revenues at a number of \nsmaller banks, and they will have to pass that on to customers in terms \nof higher fees.''\n  Above all, we must not do harm to consumers--especially when so many \nhave had to tighten their belts during the recession and are just \nstarting to get back on their feet. The same goes for proprietors of \nsmall businesses. Delaware is home to so many hard-working small \nbusiness owners, merchants who rely on the acceptance of debit card \npayments for daily transactions. I believe the Fed needs to create a \nrule that strikes a balance between supporting robust commercial \nactivity for small businesses and their consumers and safeguarding the \nviability of small banks and credit unions.\n  Senator Tester's amendment does just that. It calls on the Fed, the \nFDIC, the Comptroller of the Currency, and the National Credit Union \nAdministration to make a determination whether a proposed rule does not \ninclude all fixed and incremental costs, whether it might adversely \naffect debit card consumers, or whether the small bank carve-out would \nbe impractical.\n  This issue requires a closer and more careful look. Chairman Bair \nstated at the hearing in February that ``it was done very quickly,'' \nand ``who's paying for what, who's going to pay more, and who's getting \nto pay less under this is something that maybe wasn't dealt with as \nthoroughly as it might have been.''\n  This is why I am a cosponsor of Senator Tester's amendment and why I \nwill continue to work for interchange rules that are fair and do not \nharm a vital sector of our economy during these difficult economic \ntimes. We must continue to be relentless in our focus on economic \nrecovery and job growth, and the Tester amendment does just that.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to Senator \nTester's amendment on debit card swipe fees.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have received countless letters on this \nissue,\n\n[[Page S3588]]\n\nfrom consumers, financial institutions, retailers, labor unions, and \nother interested parties. As a Member of the Senate, I take very \nseriously our duty to ensure that the Nation's financial system \nfunctions fairly.\n  I am deeply concerned about protecting consumers and small banks from \nfinancial harm. This is a tough economy. I know that. I will do \neverything I can to make sure they are protected.\n  But my position on this issue has been unchanged from the beginning.\n  The Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule last December, and is in \nthe process of considering over 11,000 comments submitted on that rule. \nChairman Bernanke has said those comments have been informative, and \nthe Federal Reserve will soon issue a final rule that should take into \naccount concerns some have raised.\n  My position for a long time has been that we should not jump in the \nmiddle of that process. We should wait to see what the professionals at \nthe Federal Reserve come out with, and then evaluate whether or not the \nfinal rule is fair and equitable for merchants, banks, and especially \nconsumers.\n  It would be bad precedent for Congress to start cutting off that \nprocess in the middle. We don't want to go down that road.\n  The Federal Reserve is devoting substantial resources to this issue \nand are giving the comments careful consideration. We should let them \nfinish their work.\n  Senator Tester's legislation also is flawed in other respects.\n  The study it proposes only involves banking agencies. It excludes \nconsumer protection agencies, like the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau and the Federal Trade Commission.\n  The intent of existing law is to benefit consumers. If the law is \ngoing to be studied, consumer agencies should be involved too. We need \nto make sure consumers' interests are protected.\n  Senator Tester's legislation also requires that regulators evaluate \nwhether the proposed rule meets certain tests. As I see it, the tests \nare so easily met that the final rule is almost guaranteed to be thrown \nout without being considered.\n  This is a problem for me.\n  If a study is to be done, it should be fair, impartial, and consider \nthe interests of all affected parties.\n  The bottom line is that we don't know what the final rule issued by \nthe Fed will be. I have heard a lot of conjecture from both sides on \nthis issue, but no one has been able to convey any certainty.\n  I have heard from a number of constituents and national groups on \nthis issue. They have expressed their views passionately, and I am \ngrateful for their participation in this process.\n  I remain deeply committed to ensuring that small banks and consumers \nare protected. When the final rule is released, we should look at it \ncarefully. And we should conduct a fair study of the rule if we need to \ndo so.\n  But until that rule is released, we should allow the experts at the \nFederal Reserve to complete their work before we take any action.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I want to express my \nsupport for the amendment by Senator Tester.\n  Last year when Congress passed the debit interchange fee provision, I \nopposed the measure.\n  I was not convinced that the provision would work for small banks and \ncredit unions, and I was not convinced that the benefits would be \npassed on to consumers.\n  My thinking has not changed.\n  Throughout this debate many studies have been cited, but none of \nthose studies looked at the questions we have before us today--will a \ntwo-tier system work for small banks, credit unions, retailers and \nconsumers, and what will the impact be on debit card users?\n  I remain concerned about the debit interchange provision. As I \nsuspected last year, finding a workable solution is not easily or \nquickly accomplished.\n  As the Fed has worked on this issue and released its rule for public \ncomment, it has become clear that there are many concerns about the \nrule's impact on consumers, small banks and credit unions. Chairman \nBernanke and other regulators have voiced these concerns several times \nin recent months at hearings before the Banking Committee, which I \nchair.\n  While there may be a need for debit interchange reform, it should be \ndone right. This amendment by Senator Tester will give the Fed and \nother agencies more time to study this issue to find a workable \nsolution, especially the small bank exemption that is intended to allow \nthe community banks and credit unions to continue to serve consumers \nall across America. Let's be clear, the Tester amendment does not \nrepeal the debit interchange provision, it simply asks for more time to \nstudy and get it right.\n  I thank Senator Tester for his efforts to help produce a bipartisan \ncompromise that works for our community banks and credit unions. Just \nlike in his home State of Montana, the community banks and credit \nunions are important to my constituents in South Dakota.\n  As we saw in the last Congress, Senator Tester is an effective \nlegislator who does a great job building bipartisan consensus, and this \nlatest effort of his is another commonsense proposal that bridges the \ngap on a complicated financial issue.\n  Debit cards are important to consumers and to the retail industry. \nThis is not about picking sides--this is about creating a functioning \npayment system that works for all stakeholders. And I believe Senator \nTester's amendment will help us accomplish the goal of getting this \nright. I encourage my colleagues to support Senator Tester's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, let me take a moment here to clarify for \nmy colleagues the intent of this amendment. Not surprisingly, a number \nof groups have made a number of claims about what this amendment ``is'' \nand ``is not.''\n  In drafting any regulations required by the amendment, any agencies \ninvolved are required to not only abide by the letter of the law but \nalso the congressional intent of its authors.\n  Let me take a minute to try to make crystal clear what exactly the \nintent of this amendment is.\n  First of all, let me address some of the claims that have been made \nabout the implementation date of debit interchange regulations. My \namendment would direct the Fed to implement these provisions on a date \nof their determination.\n  Why was this language included in this way? The intent of this \nlanguage is to provide the Fed with the discretion to implement these \nregulations as quickly as is practically possible for merchants, \nissuers and networks to prepare for such new regulations.\n  The hope with this language would be to avoid the situation we are in \nright now where parties impacted by these changes would likely have \nless than a month to implement significant changes to the debit \ninterchange system.\n  To be clear, the Fed may not disregard implementation of debit \ninterchange regulation, as some have articulated. They also may not \narbitrarily decide to implement these rules 5 years from now. Any delay \nin implementation beyond a reasonable timeline of a few months would \nneed to be justified by the Fed.\n  Let me also take a minute to address concerns that have been raised \nabout the language we have used to describe what considerations the \nFederal Reserve must make if a determination is made in this amendment \nand the Federal Reserve is directed to rewrite the debit interchange \nrules.\n  The language states that the Federal Reserve shall ``consider''--\nagain, shall ``consider''--all fixed and incremental costs in \ndetermining what is a reasonable and proportional interchange fee. Let \nme say this again. The Fed shall ``consider''--not include, not \ncalculate, but shall consider--all fixed and incremental costs. That \nword is important because ``consider'' provides the Fed with the \ndiscretion to consider and determine, using their judgment, what is \nreasonable and proportional, meaning any costs considered would need to \nbe justified to the Fed.\n  To further clarify, the language directs the Fed to consider ``all \nfixed and incremental costs associated with debit card transactions and \nprogram operations and allow incentives for a more innovative, \nefficient and secure payment card network.''\n\n[[Page S3589]]\n\n  Why did we include all fixed and incremental costs? That is because \nthe original statute limited the costs the Federal Reserve could \nconsider to only those costs associated with the ``authorization, \nclearance or settlement of a particular electronic debit transaction.'' \nThis language severely limits the costs to issuers that the Fed may \nconsider in calculating reasonable and proportional rates and is in \nlarge measure why the Federal Reserve's proposed rule is currently at \n12 cents.\n  There are a number of fixed costs associated with debit transactions, \nchief among them fraud costs, which are also arbitrarily limited in the \noriginal statute. The fraud language states that the Federal Reserve \nmay--not must but may--allow for a fraud adjustment for costs \nassociated with fraud prevention. Now, the Federal Reserve draft \nproposal did not include any fraud adjustment, and we have no idea what \nan adjustment might look like or whether the final rule would include \none. But if it did, it could only include an adjustment related to \nfraud prevention but not the actual costs or losses associated with \nfraud.\n  Take for example the recent data breach by Michaels stores--a breach, \nby the way, which was the fault of the retailer, which had their debit \nkiosks compromised. What were the costs to the issuer of the cards that \nwere compromised? They were significant.\n  First of all, it was a community bank in Illinois that had a fraud-\nmonitoring program that identified the threat and alerted the retailer \ntheir kiosks had been compromised. Then there were the costs to these \nissuers of making their customers whole again for the losses they \nsustained by criminals removing funds directly from their bank \naccounts--$500 at a time. Additionally, issuers had to foot the costs \nassociated with reissuing the cards and opening new accounts for \ncustomers with compromised accounts. But none of those costs--those \nassociated with fraud and losses assumed by the issuers--could be \ncalculated in the fraud adjustment under the current statute. That is \nwhy we included language directing the Federal Reserve to consider all \nfixed and incremental costs associated with debit card transactions and \nprogram operations to capture those costs. Fraud losses in monitoring \nprograms are not associated with individual transactions, nor is the \ncreation or reissuance of physical cards, account maintenance, or \ncardholder servicing.\n  Let me also say what we do not believe is included in any reasonable \nand proportional fixed and incremental costs associated with program \noperations. As a result of our conversations and consultation with the \nFeds, we do not believe rewards programs or miles would be nor should \nbe considered as permissible costs, nor would or should any executive \ncompensation, nor should the costs of maintaining ATM machines.\n  Why did we include the language allowing the Federal Reserve, in \nsetting reasonable and proportional rates, to ``allow incentives for a \nmore innovative, efficient and secure payment card network''? We added \nit because, in conversations with the Federal Reserve about what sorts \nof costs would be included in reasonable and proportional costs, they \nindicated that right now they do not have the ability to incentivize \nsavings by issuers to make processing more efficient or secure. It \nseemed like a pretty good idea to Senator Corker and me that we should \ngive the Federal Reserve this kind of discretion and that issuers \nshould be incentivized to lower costs below whatever the Federal \nReserve determines to be reasonable and proportional; otherwise, the \nfee would likely stay the same for years to come as there would be no \nincentive to lower costs.\n  In addition to the flexibility provided to the Federal Reserve to set \nthe rates, the amendment also intends to provide discretion to the \nFederal Reserve to include additional factors in the study, such as the \noverall impact of regulating interchange fees on small businesses and \nthe economy, as well as discretion in the agencies the Federal Reserve \nmay consult when drafting the study.\n  In addition, it is intended that the findings must be made public and \nthat the Federal Reserve is not required to start from square one. The \nintent is for the Federal Reserve to be able to build upon the \ninformation and insights which they have gathered already and which are \na part of the current record.\n  Finally, this amendment doesn't undermine or inhibit the Federal \nReserve's ability to implement the routing and network exclusivity \nprovisions in the underlying statute. In fact, it does quite the \nopposite. We sought to preserve this language and these provisions as \nthey were originally included in the statute.\n  In the last couple of days, several Senators have suggested \nadditional changes that would improve the consumer-related aspects of \nthe study proposed by my amendment. I very much appreciate their \nconcerns and their interest on this critically important point, and the \nchanges they have suggested are certainly ones I and other cosponsors \nare open to. Unfortunately, the Senator from Illinois filed a second-\ndegree amendment which essentially closed off any chance to make \nadditional changes to the amendment once it was filed.\n  I am more than willing to work with my colleagues to find ways to \ncontinue to improve this amendment and to ensure that consumers, small \nbusinesses, small banks, and credit unions get a fair deal as we move \nto a regulated interchange marketplace. And that is what we will get \nout of this amendment--the same idea of regulation that 64 Members of \nthis body supported last year.\n  The difference between my amendment and the current law is that we \nwill ensure that the Fed's regulations do not set the price below the \ncost of doing business. The current law prevented the Fed from looking \nat any number of elements of the cost of interchange. Some fraud costs \nwere allowed to be included but not others. Some technology costs were \nincluded but not others. Why? Because the Senate made those arbitrary \ndecisions. The result is a proposed Fed rule that sets the debit \ninterchange rate at 7 or 12 cents for all transactions--a level most \nfolks agree is too low. Let's allow the Fed to find the actual correct \nnumber. As a farmer, I can tell you that if it costs me $3 to produce a \nbushel of wheat, it won't matter if I sell it for $2 or $1 or 50 cents, \nI will still go out of business because it is below my cost of doing \nbusiness. And that is precisely what will happen to our smaller banks \nand credit unions.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have high regard for the Senator from \nMontana. He is my friend, and he will be my friend whatever the outcome \nof the vote happens to be, which will happen in about 40 minutes. But I \ndo disagree with him on this issue.\n  I would like to make it clear from the start that the law on the \nbooks today specifically exempts community banks and credit unions--\nspecifically those valued at $10 billion or less. That means 100 banks \nout of 7,000 in America are affected by this new law and 3 credit \nunions in all of America.\n  Now, the banks and credit unions have come here and said: Not enough \nprotection because we can't be sure you will protect us from the credit \ncard companies coming back on us and hurting us. OK, we can write in \nmore protection, if necessary. But to argue that we are trying to save \nmom-and-pop banks here--from whom? We are trying to save them from the \ncredit card giants that have created this price-fixing mess.\n  If you are an autograph seeker and you happen to want to meet CEOs of \nmajor corporations, you hit it rich today. Get over here and walk the \nhalls of the Senate office buildings, and you will meet the CEOs of the \nbiggest companies and banks in America. Why are they here today? \nBecause of this 2 p.m. vote. Why is this 2 p.m. vote important to the \nthree biggest banks in America--Chase, Bank of America, and Wells \nFargo? Because right now what is at stake with the Tester-Corker \namendment is $8 billion in fees they want to collect from consumers and \nbusinesses all across America--$8 billion.\n  When we got into the business of TARP--remember those days when the\n\n[[Page S3590]]\n\nbanks had messed up the economy so badly that we had to come to their \nrescue with taxpayer money, and the average family across America \nwatched the taxes they were paying this government going to the biggest \nbanks on Wall Street? That was about $800 billion. The three biggest \nbanks that will profit the most here from this amendment--Chase, Bank \nof America, and Wells Fargo--each was a beneficiary of that TARP money, \nthat bailout money. Chase received $25 billion, $45 billion went to \nBank of America, and $25 billion went to Wells Fargo. They did quite \nwell. When we rescued them, they sent us a little thank-you card. Do \nyou know what it was? It was a notice that they were giving their chief \nexecutives bonuses out of the tax money we were sending.\n  So the question is not whether we are going to do another TARP today \nbut whether we are going to do a baby TARP. It is only $8 billion for \nthese three big banks this time, but I think it is an outrage. It is an \noutrage to make consumers across America pay this. They pay it every \ntime they use their debit cards, and the merchants and retailers that \ncollect it have no voice in this process.\n  I wish some of the people who come to this floor and shed copious \ntears over community banks and credit unions that are already protected \nin this law would shed a few tears for the people who run the shops and \nbusinesses across America, the restaurants and the hotels. These are \nthe people who are being hit by these debit card fees every single day. \nWhere is the sympathy for small business on this floor? They are all \nover Illinois, they are all over America.\n  If we really believe the key to economic recovery is the strength of \nsmall business creating and expanding jobs across America, for \ngoodness' sake, let's stand up for them. You can't vote at 2 p.m. for \nthis pending amendment and say you are a friend of small business. No, \nyou can't. Small business is lined up across America saying: For once, \ngive us a break against these credit card companies and the big banks \non Wall Street. Give us a break. Are we going to do it? I am afraid \nnot, if we pass this amendment.\n  I look at this amendment and I think to myself, Why did the banks \nwrite it the way they did? They wrote it so they could include more \ncosts into their calculation of the fee they charge on an interchange \ntransaction with debit cards. I will tell you this: Based on the \nlanguage that was just read to us, they will easily justify the 44 \ncents they are currently charging and more.\n  I respect my colleague from Montana when he says on the floor that he \ndidn't mean to include certain things. I wish he had been specific. I \nthink the language of this amendment is broad enough and wide enough to \ndrive a truck through. The banks are going to come out quite well, \nthank you, at the end of the day. But don't they always? When it is all \nsaid and done, aren't they usually the winners around here?\n  Today, we have a chance to turn the tables, to really make the \nwinners small businesses and consumers across America. That is why \nconsumer groups support keeping the law as it is. That is why, when the \nbanks wrote this, they said the four agencies that would decide what \nthe fee was going to be would be four bank regulators. I am searching--\nsearching, searching--for any reference to consumers or small \nbusinesses. Sorry, the banks couldn't include those people. They \ncouldn't include those people in that calculation.\n  To say ``We are for the little guy, and that is why we need to vote \nfor this amendment'' is to ignore the amendment's wording as written. \nIf you are for the small businesspeople across America, there is only \none vote, and it is a ``no'' vote.\n  Let the Federal Reserve issue this rule. Don't let the banks stop \nthem in their tracks. That is exactly what they want to do. Let them \nissue this rule. If more needs to be done, I am on board. But the \nnotion that we cannot even trust the Federal Reserve to come up with a \nrule on this that may protect small businesses and consumers across \nAmerica is just plain unfair. It is wrong and we ought to know better.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I too echo the thoughts of the good \nSenator from Illinois. Senator Durbin and I are friends. We may not \nsound like it today, but we are. We just happen to disagree on this \nparticular piece of policy.\n  There is one premise that I think is being taken as a given that is \nnot a given at all. It was in the original Durbin amendment. It said we \nwere going to exempt banks of $10 billion and less and credit unions of \n$10 billion and less--so we are going to do that. A lot of folks voted \nfor this amendment because they knew the small banks couldn't \ndistribute their costs, and it would have undue harmful effects on the \nsmall banks, small credit unions, and community banks.\n  But the facts have borne out something different since the last year. \nThey have not been borne out by stuff that I have made up. It comes \nfrom the regulators themselves.\n  I have said many times on this floor that every regulator I have \ntalked to, State or Federal, has said the exemption for small banks and \ncredit unions will not work. It will not work. We voted on something 1 \nyear ago that we thought we had and it does not work. Let me read the \nquotes:\n  Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke:\n\n       We're still not sure whether it will work. There are market \n     forces that would work against the exemption.\n\n  He said it May 12 of this year.\n  Another quote by Chairman Bernanke:\n\n       It is going to affect the revenues of small issuers and \n     could result in some of the smaller banks being less \n     profitable or even failing.\n\n  Once again, in the banking area, by FDIC Chairwoman Bair:\n\n       I do think this is going to reduce the revenues.\n\n  Let me say that again:\n\n       I do think this is going to reduce the revenues at a number \n     of smaller banks and they will have to pass it on to their \n     customers in terms of higher fees.\n\n  What does that mean? Checking, time getting the loan, fees, all that \nstuff. Money doesn't grow out of air. You have to have it, and if you \ndon't have it and you are doing business, under the cost of doing \nbusiness you have to make it up somewhere.\n  Another quote from Ben Bernanke, and it is about the two-tiered \nsystem that is unlikely to maintain--to protect smaller institutions. \nThis is a quote:\n\n       A number of networks have expressed their interest or \n     willingness to maintain a tiered interchange fee system, but \n     of course it is not required.\n\n  Chairwoman Bair again:\n\n       If the Federal Reserve's view is there is no legal \n     authority to require that, it does become more problematic.\n\n  The fact is, the two-tiered system is not going to work. Every \nregulator said it is not going to work. Its impacts are going to be on \nsmall community banks, not the Wall Street boys. They are fine. We \nagree on that. But the community banks and credit unions are going to \nhave incredible impacts on our small businesses that we are trying to \nhelp get us out of this recession we are in.\n  This is not a bailout. This will ensure a regulated debit interchange \nsystem. By the way, I do not believe in bailouts. I didn't believe in \nthe TARP bailout. I voted against it. I voted against the auto dealers' \nbailout. Right or wrong or indifferent, I do not believe in bailouts. I \nwould not be supporting this if there were a bailout. I would not be \noffering it.\n  Wall Street banks are going to be just fine regardless of what \nhappens, but the fact is, the exemption for banks under $10 billion \nwill not work. That is why I am here. It is as simple as that.\n  I wish to close for now with a statement made by the ``Frank'' in \nDodd-Frank, whom this bill is named after, Barney Frank, who worked \nwith Chris Dodd to craft this bill in the House and Senate. Here is \nwhat Barney Frank says. Is today the 8th, by the way? He said it today, \nthe 8th of June, speaking of the Tester-Corker-Hagan-Crapo-Bennet \namendment, this amendment:\n\n       This is a good, balanced, compromised approach. I support \n     it and I hope it will pass.\n\n  The author of this bill from the House thinks this is a good policy \nchange to make Dodd-Frank better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, good to be with you again. I spent most of \nthe morning with you and now part of the afternoon.\n\n[[Page S3591]]\n\n  This is a difficult issue for a number of us in the Senate because we \nhave friends on both sides of this issue. It is also a difficult issue \nfor a lot of people because we do not want to be unmindful of the \nconcerns raised legitimately by merchants for a number of years about \ndebit charges they have had to pay, and we don't want to be unmindful \nof the concerns raised by banks, whether they be big or little, or by \ncredit unions.\n  I was talking to one of my colleagues who said: I don't want to vote \non this again. We had to vote on this once. I don't want to vote on \nthis again. As one guy said: I certainly don't want to have to vote on \nit twice.\n  Another colleague said to me: I don't like the idea of just kicking \nthe can down the road, having a 24-month pause and then maybe a new \nCongress and new administration and maybe it will all go away. That is \nnot what I am interested in doing.\n  Another of my colleagues said to me: Why don't we fix this problem? \nRather than kick the can down the road for 24 months, why don't we say: \nLet's fix this problem. As it turns out, four of our colleagues who \nvoted with the Senator from Illinois, the author of the Durbin \namendment, voted with Durbin originally when the amendment was first \noffered. They actually sat down, two Democrats and two Republicans, \nthey and their staffs, hammered it out, worked with Senator Tester and \nthey worked with Senator Corker as well and that is who wrote the bill. \nDid they get input from the merchants? I am sure they did. Did they get \ninput from the banks? I am sure they did. I would hope so. That is the \nway this place ought to work, where Democrats and Republicans actually \nwork together on legislation, and we seek input from not just banks, \nnot just credit unions, not just merchants, but consumers as well.\n  I think back on the life I have been privileged to lead. I spent a \nlot of years in the Navy and had the privilege to serve my State as \nGovernor and now in the Senate with my colleagues. I know any number of \ntimes in my life I have done things I was sure were the right thing to \ndo but had an unintended consequence. I was sure I did the right thing, \nbut as things turned out, there were consequences I didn't anticipate, \nand what I had to do was go back and help be part of the solution in \naddressing those unintended consequences.\n  Senator Durbin put his finger on a big problem, and the problem he \nput his finger on is--actually, more than 1 year ago but a number of \nyears ago--we have a situation with the use of debit cards where \nmerchants are disadvantaged. They don't have a lot of options, and they \nend up having to pay large fees to banks--sometimes big banks but \nsometimes small banks--and they don't have that much choice. They don't \nlike that. They would like to see us do something about it. So what \nSenator Durbin proposed is a way to deal with that.\n  He intended in his legislation not only to try to help consumers and \nmerchants, but he also tried to protect small banks, those with under \n$10 billion in assets, and to protect credit unions and their members.\n  I wish to see if we have a quote here. These banks have different \nregulators, credit unions have different regulators. I don't have \nquotes from all of them, but here is a quote Senator Tester shared with \nus. Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, when he was talking \nabout the unintended consequences. Here is what Sheila Bair of the FDIC \nsaid. She is talking about institutions, community banks, smaller ones, \nunder $10 billion of assets.\n\n       We are concerned that these institutions may not actually \n     receive the benefit of the interchange fee limit exemption \n     explicitly provided by Congress, resulting in a loss of \n     income for community banks and ultimately higher banking \n     costs for their consumers.\n\n  She said that in her testimony before the House.\n  John Walsh is the Comptroller of the Currency. He said:\n\n       We believe the proposal takes an unnecessarily narrow \n     approach to recovery of costs that would be allowable under \n     the law and that are recognized and indisputably part of \n     conducting a debit card business. This has long-term safety \n     and soundness consequences--for banks of all sizes.\n\n  That is what they said. They think we have a problem. Their job is \nnot to be the lapdog for financial institutions. Their job is to \nregulate financial institutions.\n  I tried to think about some times where we have abuses to clean up \nand how we go about doing it. This sounds strange for a guy from \nDelaware to say this. We had big abuses in credit cards. It was pretty \nmuch impossible for most people to get a credit card application in \ntheir mailbox, look at that application--maybe they got six of them \nthat same week--and decide which of those four, five or six were \nactually in their best interest to fill out and submit. We had credit \ncard banks taking advantage of people in ways that were untoward, I \nthink unethical. What we did in the Banking Committee, where I served, \nis we held not just a hearing, we held extensive hearings for months--\nfor months. We did the same thing in the House, and we asked the \nGovernment Accountability Office to help us with an in-depth study of \nthe credit card industry to try to decide what changes were needed. \nThere are watchdog agencies. They came back and said these are our \nrecommendations. Out of all those hearings came a lot of ideas too.\n  The Senate passed legislation. They passed legislation in the House. \nThe banking industry didn't like it much. They complained about it. We \nwent to conference with the House and the Senate and worked out a \ncompromise. The banking industry didn't like it much. The regulators of \nthe banks were required to help us implement the legislation and they \nhad to write regulations. They had to write regulations that were true \nand consistent with the underlying law and they did and the banks \ndidn't like it much. They were promulgated, some immediately, some over \nseveral months, and eventually they got the job done. I think consumers \nare better off. Did banks make as much as they did on credit cards? No. \nWe know that personally in our State. But are consumers treated fairly? \nYes; they are. Part of what happened was extensive hearings involving \nGAO, getting input from a lot of folks with different views on this, \nand then acting in light of the process.\n  I think what is different in this case, I don't believe the Banking \nCommittee--I can't speak for other committees in the last Congress, but \nI don't believe the Banking Committee or other committees in the House \nor Senate actually had the opportunity to hold hearings and bring \npeople in, in the last Congress, and say this is what is good about the \namendment proposed by our friend from Illinois and this is what is bad. \nI don't think we had GAO--GAO did not have the opportunity to come in \nand say we were never invited to come in. We never invited them to come \nin on the debit card side and, therefore, their voices were not \navailable to us, and that is unfortunate.\n\n  Here is what happened. Legislation was passed. Senator Durbin offered \nit with the best of intentions. He said: We have a problem. We should \nfix it. Here is my suggestion. He essentially said we should regulate \nthe marketplace. We should regulate the marketplace for debit cards. \nThe free marketers said: No; we ought to let market solutions work, \nharness market forces--something I generally agree with--but in this \ncase they were not working so he came up with an alternative and said \nlet's see if there is another way to do this. Unfortunately, with the \nbest of intentions, we have these unintended consequences. The question \nis, What do we do about it?\n  We have a situation where I am not sure consumers are going to be \nadvantaged by the current law as it reads. Big banks, they will be OK. \nThey can take care of themselves. But a lot of smaller banks, the \npeople squawking the loudest, the folks from the community banks, they \nhave been beating on my doors and other doors, and the folks from the \ncredit unions, they are less able, frankly, to look out for themselves, \nand that is despite the intent, the explicit effort by the author of \nthe amendment, to provide them exemption. The regulators say, frankly: \nSorry. It does not work.\n  That suggests to me that we hit a pause button, we hit a pause button \nnot for 2 years but at least for the next as much as 6 months and say \nto the regulators: OK. Do now what we should have done a year or two \nago. Complete an in-depth study, look at the concerns of the merchants, \nlook at the concerns\n\n[[Page S3592]]\n\nof the consumers, look at the concerns of big banks, middle-size banks, \nsmall banks and credit unions, and come back to us with what you think \nto be a fair approach. You have 6 months to do it. If you can do it in \nless time, let's do that.\n  If they come back to us and say: Look, the legislation as written, \ncurrent law, is fine for consumers, it is fine for institutions of all \nsizes and is fair to the merchants--if they come back and say this, \nbasically, the Durbin language in the law prevails. If they say that is \nit, the regulators have spoken and we are done.\n  If they come back and say we have a problem here, these outfits, the \nregulators, have a period--I think it is up to 6 months--to figure out \nregulations that can then be implemented after the 6 months to fix the \nproblem. Some will say how do we know they will do anything for \nconsumers? They just did it for credit cards 2 years ago, and the \nbankers did not like it. They still do not like it. We have the pain in \nmy State in the employment numbers to reflect that they didn't like it. \nWe still live with that pain and discomfort, but who is better off? \nConsumers are better off. They are better off because Congress did its \njob. We were deliberate about it. We sought input from all sides. The \nregulators did their job, and it has been implemented in a prompt way.\n  I wish to close maybe with this thought.\n  There is an outfit called Michaels. We have a Michaels store not far, \nactually, from where my family and I live in Wilmington. They sell art \nsupplies. It is a national chain and a pretty successful company. They \nwere in the news big time recently--not because of a good story but \nbecause of a data breach story. A lot of folks who had accounts with \nthem, their customer information was disclosed. There was great concern \non the part of the consumers, the customers, that there had been this \ndata breach and some of their sensitive information was going to be at \nrisk. It involved hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of customers.\n  To whom did they turn to fix this problem? Did they turn to Michaels \nand say: You fix this problem. No, as it turns out, they didn't. Some \nprobably did, but most probably didn't. Do you know to whom they \nturned? They turned to their banks. They turned to the issuers of the \ncredit cards and said: You fix this problem. You issue a new credit \ncard for us, and you cover this for us. And the banks did that. They \nwere beholden to do that.\n  Finally, I am not here to carry the water for the banks. I think we \nare all here to do what we think is right. To my colleagues who are \nundecided on how to vote--I know some are. They don't want to choose \nbetween their two favorite children, whether it is the merchants on the \none hand or the financial institutions, credit unions on the other \nhand. They don't have to choose between two children. They can ask \nthemselves: What is the right thing to do? Try to understand what is in \nthis amendment, a bipartisan amendment prepared by some of the people I \nmost respect here in this body, and drill down on that. Listen to guys \nlike Barney Frank who don't have a dog in this fight but have a lot of \nknowledge, and try to make the decision they think is the right \ndecision.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 13 minutes 52 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is there any time remaining on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Zero.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if Senator Tester returns to the floor and \nwants to speak before the vote, I will ask unanimous consent to each \nhave 2 minutes for that purpose. Perhaps he is not going to, but I want \nto make this a matter of record here because I want to give him a \nchance to close.\n  Let me try to get down to basics. Have my colleagues ever pulled out \none of these cards to pay for something? If you are my age, you don't \npull it out as often as younger people. This morning, I was down in the \ncarryout here, and a young woman who is a Capitol police officer bought \na pack of chewing gum for $1.20 and handed over her debit card. The \ndebit card was swiped. She took the chewing gum and walked away. The \naverage amount that is charged by the issuing bank of her debit card is \n44 cents for each transaction. How much money do we think the owner of \nthe carryout made on that pack of gum this morning? The answer is \nnothing. Now repeat that over and over again across America.\n  What is happening is that the banks issuing these debit cards are \nimposing interchange fees, swipe fees, on these transactions, and the \nmerchants and the retailers have no voice in the amount of that fee, no \nvoice whatsoever.\n  The Federal Reserve did a study and asked: Well, how much does it \nactually cost them to process that debit transaction? The answer was 12 \ncents, in the range of 12 cents. The charge is 44 cents; the cost is 12 \ncents. Is there something wrong with this picture? It means every \nperson buying goods at stores across America pays more to pay for this \nfee.\n  We have heard the plaintive cries of those offering this amendment of \nhow we have to have some sympathy for these banks--these poor banks, \nstruggling to survive. If they can't collect the maximum on their debit \nfee interchange fee, the swipe fee, what is going to happen to them? \nWell, we have already exempted, incidentally, all banks with values of \n$10 billion and less, so we are talking about the big boys, the big \nbanks.\n  So let's ask a few basic questions.\n  How does the debit card interchange fee in America compare to other \ncountries? Visa and MasterCard do business all around the world. Banks \nissue these all around the world. So how do we stack up? Where is the \ngood old U.S. of A? Well, I will tell my colleagues where we stack up. \nWe have the highest interchange fees charged by Visa and MasterCard \nanywhere in the world--the highest. Thank you. Can America express its \ngratitude any greater than to say thank you to the banks for charging \nus the most for using plastic?\n  So what do they charge in other countries? Debit interchange fees in \nthe European Union are less than one-fifth the charge in the United \nStates. So let's do the math: 9 cents a transaction in Europe, 44 cents \nhere. We want to give a big, sloppy kiss to these big banks at 2 \no'clock for the way they are going to treat us. But it gets better. \nWhen we go to Canada, the Visa and MasterCard debit interchange fee in \nCanada is zero. There is no interchange fee. Now we have people on the \nfloor begging us to show some sympathy for these banks and give them an \ninterchange fee, and they charge nothing in Canada--zero. That is the \nreality.\n  The biggest banks make the biggest money on this process, far and \naway--Chase, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo--to the tune of almost $8 \nbillion a year. How long did they want to study interchange fees? If \none is making $1.3 billion a month, one wants the study to go on for \nmonths, if not years. Get back to you later, we say to the banks. Yes, \nthat is exactly what they want. At 2 o'clock, we will decide as a \nSenate whether we are going to give it to them.\n  This amendment, drawn up by the banks, compromises between the banks, \ngives to the banks exactly what they are looking for--a huge loophole \nto assess their interchange fees to justify what they are charging \ntoday and charge more. There is nothing in here--nothing--to protect \nconsumers and businesses across America.\n  I got started in politics with a fellow named Paul Douglas. This goes \nback a few years. I was a college student. Douglas was a Ph.D. in \neconomics--much smarter than I, for sure. He spent his whole life \ntrying to pass something called truth in lending. All he wanted the \nbanks to do was to tell their customers how much they were charging \nthem and what interest rates. He spent 18 years battling that, and he \nleft the Senate without getting it done. He couldn't finish it. Bill \nProxmire of Wisconsin took up the battle and passed it. Paul Douglas \nfought those banks for 18 years.\n  It is a battle that has been going on a long time around here \nbecause, you see, there is a lot of power in this banking community, \nthese financial institutions. When they come to the floor and say they \nwant something, Congress decides, we better start talking. Rarely do \nthey ever lose.\n\n[[Page S3593]]\n\n  I guess we could say the Wall Street reform bill was a loss for them, \nbut they deserved it. Look at the god-awful mess they put America into \nwith their rotten practices, their stupidity and reckless conduct. We \nare still paying for that. We still have a lot of people out of work \nand businesses that failed. Many of the savings accounts of families \nacross America are still suffering because those banks made those \nmistakes. And in the free market system, did they pay for their \nmistakes? No. The American taxpayers paid for their mistakes.\n  Giving credit where it is due to Senator Tester, he voted against the \nTARP bill. He said it, and I want it to be on the record. I voted for \nit. I did because I was told by Ben Bernanke of the Federal Reserve and \nHank Paulson of the Department of the Treasury: If you don't help these \nbanks and they fail, you will see a worse depression than 1929. I \nbought it. I voted for it. Almost $800 billion in bailouts to these \nbanks. I was seething to think we were going to spend taxpayers' money \nto help these banks be rescued from their own stupidity and their own \ngreed. We did it.\n  The three biggest banks involved here--some $95 billion we sent to \nthem. Well, they are back. They are looking for the second installment \non their payment, this time not from the taxpayers, this time from \nconsumers and businesses across America. What they are asking us for, \nthe biggest banks, the three biggest ones, is almost $8 billion a year \nin these interchange fees.\n  We have a chance now to try to bring some balance to this \nconversation. We have a chance to finally stand up for small businesses \nand merchants and consumers across America who have been victimized by \nthe credit card companies and the big banks for too long. Can this \nSenate stand up once a year, once a decade for consumers across America \nagainst these financial institutions? That is what is at stake with \nthis amendment. I know it is going to be a heated vote because my poor \ncolleagues have been beaten to a pulp by both sides by those who feel \nvery intensely about this issue.\n  I wish to credit my colleague from Montana because he told me at the \noutside--when I said, Jon, please don't do this, he said, I believe it. \nAnd, Jon, I admire you for doing it. I still do. Even though I disagree \nwith you, I admire you for doing it. You are a man of conviction and \nprinciple and a great Senator.\n  But this is a historic moment in the Senate. It is a moment where we \nwill decide whether for once the big banks are going to lose and the \nconsumers are going to win; whether we are going to reduce the cost of \nthese transactions and help consumers across America and small \nbusinesses across America make the profit they need.\n  Some people say: Well, this hasn't been studied enough. For 11 months \nnow, the Federal Reserve has been studying this, the best economists, \nthe best minds there. They have entertained 11,000 comments. They have \nheard everything under the Sun. They have heard it all. In a matter of \ndays, they are set to issue a rule--a rule which no one has seen, a \nrule which the banks don't want anyone to see. They don't want this \nrule to see the light of day, and that is why they are here today--to \nstop the Federal Reserve from issuing a rule that may cost them in \nterms of their bottom line.\n  It is our choice now. It is our choice whether these banks are going \nto prevail. History will record the strength of consumers and small \nbusinesses across America against the Wall Street banks that take away \nmore than half of the interchange fees on debit cards that are \ncollected across America.\n  I hope my colleagues will stand by the decision we made a year ago. I \nhope they will give each of us an opportunity to see this rule come \ninto effect and from that build on it a stronger, growing economy, one \nthat is fair--an economy where interchange fees have been dictated by \nthe big banks and credit card companies for too long.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. How much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The remaining time is 3 minutes \n55 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I mentioned on the floor earlier that I would like to \ngive to my colleague 2 minutes, and then I will take 2 minutes, and \nthat will be it. So I ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, just to clarify, I have 2 minutes, Senator \nDurbin has 2 minutes, and then we vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. That was the order just \nentered.\n  Mr. TESTER. God bless the U.S.A.\n  Mr. President, let me say this, first of all, to the folks in the \ngallery and the Members who are still in their offices. Look at me. Do \nI look like a banker? Senator Corker and I drew up this amendment. The \nbanks did not draw up this amendment. We drew it up with the help of \nSenators Hagan, Crapo, and Bennet.\n  As is usual, Senator Durbin and I agree on 90 percent, and there is \n10 percent on which we disagree. Do I think swipe fees need to be \nregulated? Of course. But the problem with his amendment is that the \nexemption on community banks and credit unions under $10 billion does \nnot work. It doesn't work. I have read all the quotes from Bernanke and \nBair and the head of the OCC and the NCUA and all of them. They have \nsaid that they don't know how to make a two-tiered system work because \nthe free market system will overrule it, and that is the way it ought \nto be in this country.\n  So the bottom line is, I look at this from a rural perspective and \nthe impact the Federal Government has on rural America, and while we \nare trying to solve one problem, we are creating two or three others. I \ncould care less about the Wall Street banks. They are going to do fine. \nBut I will tell my colleagues, if we lose the banks in our small towns \nin Montana or Wyoming or Tennessee, then we can put another nail in the \ncoffin of rural America.\n  With that, I yield the floor to the good Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I couldn't agree more. It is amazing that \nwe passed this 2,400-page bill a year ago, and on all the tough \ndecisions, we deferred to the regulators. The regulators are now \ncreating all kinds of rules because we knew they had some wisdom we \ndidn't have. Yet, in this case, every single regulator involved is \ntelling us that the way the Durbin amendment was written, we are going \nto damage the community banks and credit unions and that it won't work.\n  So it is amazing that in this case where the very people who regulate \ntell us to please change this, it won't work, we are saying no, we are \nnot going to; this is going to benefit Wall Street. That is not the \ncase. This amendment puts the Durbin amendment in the middle of the \nroad where it needs to be, and I hope everyone will support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I understand I have 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if my colleagues are interested in \nsmalltown America, they should be interested in the businesses that \noperate in smalltown America, and they are begging us to vote no on the \nTester-Corker amendment.\n  I happen to live in a town of 120,000 people. It is a little bit \nlarger than my colleague's hometown in Montana, but I can tell you what \nthe businesses there are saying. I can tell you what Wendy Chronister \nis saying, who owns the Qik-n-EZ gas stations. She is saying to me: \nGive me a break. They are hitting us so hard with these debit \ninterchange fees.\n\n  We have letters put in the Record from military base exchanges which \nsay this is the fastest growing, uncontrollable cost they are facing. \nThis is a problem which the credit card companies and the banks have \nwanted to ignore and now this amendment wants to delay for 6 months, a \nyear, or longer.\n  In terms of trusting the regulators, I am afraid the banking \ninterests that wrote this amendment did not trust them to even issue \nthe rule. You had to call this debate before they issued the rule. You \ndo not know what the number is going to be on the interchange fee, but \nyou had to stop them in their tracks.\n  If you will go look in the corridors and rooms around Capitol Hill, \nyou will not find a lot of small town bankers.\n\n[[Page S3594]]\n\nYou will find the biggest banks in America waiting in the wings, \npraying, putting in a billion dollars' worth of prayers that this \namendment is going to pass.\n  I do not question the intentions or motives of Senators Tester or \nCorker. I never will. But I can tell you, the effect of this amendment \nis going to be giving to those big banks and those credit card \ncompanies a windfall of profit they do not deserve.\n  If the interchange fee is zero in Canada, why is it 44 cents here? \nCan we stand up, representing the people of this country, and say that \nis fundamentally unfair; you have to treat our consumers and merchants \nfairly? If we cannot stand up and do that, why are we here? To do the \nbidding of the banks and the credit card companies? I hope not. I hope \nwe are here to stand up for economic fairness and for consumers and \nsmall businesses across America begging us to defeat this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I would like to ask unanimous consent to--\n--\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The bill clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 390\n\n    (Purpose: To reform the regulatory process to ensure that small \n   businesses are free to compete and to create jobs, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Snowe and Coburn, \nI ask unanimous consent to temporarily set aside the pending amendment \nso I may call up my amendment No. 390, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McCONNELL], for Ms. Snowe, \n     for herself, Mr. Coburn, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. \n     Brown of Massachusetts, Mr. Moran, Mr. Thune, Mr. Enzi, Ms. \n     Ayotte, and Mr. Isakson, proposes an amendment numbered 390.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my understanding the order before the \nSenate is that we are going to vote on the Tester amendment; is that \nright?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. TESTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken with the chairman, Senator \nBoxer, and a number of other Senators, including Senator Snowe, who has \noffered her amendment on this bill. She has not determined yet how much \ntime she wants. We will work with her to make sure she has some time to \nspeak on it.\n  Senator DeMint has indicated that he has an amendment he wants to \noffer. Senator Paul has indicated that he has an amendment he wants to \noffer. And Senator Boxer will give a statement for however long she \nfeels is appropriate, as soon as the amendments are offered by Senators \nDeMint and Paul. They will debate those at a later time.\n  We also have people on our side who want to offer amendments. To keep \nthis fairly orderly, we will have two amendments on our side to be \noffered, and then we will sit down and talk about it. At that time, \nthere will be five amendments pending. We are trying to move forward \nwith this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator DeMint be \nrecognized to offer an amendment, and then that Senator Paul be \nrecognized to offer an amendment, and then Senator Boxer be recognized \nto speak for whatever time she feels is appropriate, and we will have a \ncouple offered on the Democratic side, and then we will reassess where \nwe are after that.\n  The only thing is, so that we know where we start on this, we want to \nmake sure the amendments offered by our Republican colleagues and our \nDemocratic colleagues initially be not divisible. I ask unanimous \nconsent that that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To implement the President's request to increase the \n                  statutory limit on the public debt)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. INCREASE IN STATUTORY LIMIT ON THE PUBLIC DEBT.\n\n       (a) Finding.--The Congress finds that the President's \n     budget proposal, Budget of the United States Government, \n     Fiscal Year 2012, necessitates an increase in the statutory \n     debt limit of $2,406,000,000,000.\n       (b) Increase.--Subsection (b) of section 3101 of title 31, \n     United States Code, is amended by striking out the dollar \n     limitation contained in such subsection and inserting in lieu \n     thereof ``$16,700,000,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, this amendment will raise the debt ceiling \nby $2.4 trillion. This will comply with the President's budget. Many on \nthe other side asked for a clean vote on raising the debt ceiling. \nBecause I really want to get along and go along, I want to make this \nvote available for those who wish to raise the debt ceiling.\n  I will vote ``no,'' but I wanted this to be under consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let the games begin. That is what is going \non here. I have full respect for my colleague, but you can tell from \nhis tone and tenor that Senator Paul finds it amusing he is offering a \nclean debt ceiling increase that he is voting against. He is offering \nan amendment he is voting against, when we know we are in discussions \nwith the President, and with the Vice President, and discussions with \nthe Gang of Six to try to figure out a way that we can come together, \nnot have ``gotcha'' votes on the Senate floor. It is outrageous.\n  I will tell you why it is outrageous. We have an underlying bill here \nthat you have been very helpful with, Mr. President--S. 782--the \nEconomic Development Revitalization Act of 2011, which will reauthorize \na very important program that has been in place in this great Nation \nsince 1965. It was last passed when George W. Bush was President. It \npassed this Senate unanimously, without all these amendments that are \ngoing nowhere.\n  There are 27 amendments as of last night--actually, it is probably \nmany more now. We know this game because we played it before, when \nSenator Landrieu stood where I am and tried to get a small business \nbill through here, which would have created thousands of jobs in this \nNation.\n  Well, here we are. We have a bill that came out of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee with a strong vote. We had one dissent. \nSenator Inhofe is my primary cosponsor. For 50 years, this EDA program, \nthe Economic Development Administration, has created jobs and spurred \ngrowth in economically hard-hit communities.\n  We know the struggle we are having in coming out of the greatest \nrecession since the Great Depression. I remind the people within the \nsound of my voice that when President Obama took over, this country was \nbleeding almost a million jobs a month. We are getting back on our \nfeet. We got the auto industry back on its feet. We are getting \nmanufacturing back on its feet, but it is too slow. We have to do more. \nOnce in a while, we get an opportunity to work with small businesses, \nthe private sector, local government, and attract funds from nonprofit \norganizations and bring jobs and important work to our communities. \nThis is one way.\n  An arm of the Chamber of Commerce wrote me a letter yesterday saying \nhow important this work is. The Business Civic Leadership Center said:\n\n       EDA has served as a valuable partner in many communities \n     that we have worked in including San Jose, California; \n     Seattle, Washington; Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Mobile, Alabama; New \n     Orleans, Louisiana; Atlanta, Georgia; Boca Raton, Florida; \n     Minneapolis, Minnesota; Newark, New Jersey, and many others.\n\n  It was signed by Stephen Jordan, executive director of the Business \nCivic Leadership Center of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  This is a bill everybody wants, but games are being played in the \nSenate--I guess just for the fun of it, to stop us from doing our job. \nWhat is our No. 1 job? To create jobs. What does the AFL-CIO say? You \nhave business and labor. They say:\n\n       EDA has established an admirable track record in assisting \n     economically troubled low-income communities with limited job \n     opportunities by putting their investments to good use in \n     promoting needed job creation and industrial and commercial \n     development.\n\n  That is signed by William Samuel, director, Government Affairs \nDepartment, AFL-CIO, and that is dated yesterday.\n  Why is business and labor supporting this bill? Why do they want us \nto stop the games and pass this bill? Because they want jobs for \nbusinesses, and businesses want the work.\n  Now let's take a look at other people who were supportive in addition \nto the Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO: U.S. Conference of Mayors, \nAmerican Public Works Association, National Association of Counties--I \nwas a county supervisor and belonged to that organization many years \nago. If you want bipartisanship, go to the National Association of \nCounties. There are Democrats, Republicans, Independents--people of \nevery stripe, liberal, moderate, conservative. They all come together. \nWhy? Because business and labor are together, and everybody wants jobs.\n  Why do we have to face an amendment by my friend Senator Olympia \nSnowe on deregulation--a bill that hasn't had one hearing in any \ncommittee and will, in many ways, eviscerate the important rules and \nregulations that protect public health and the environment? We should \nhave a hearing on that bill. I am sure we can work together and make it \na wonderful bill. Instead, it is offered on this bill.\n  Mr. PAUL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Not at this time, but I will yield when I conclude.\n  We have a bill that will create tens of thousands of jobs, and we \nhave the first amendment offered by my good friend, which has not had \none hearing, and it repeals all kinds of protections for the public \nhealth.\n  I don't get it. There is only one thing that I can get, with all \nthese amendments, we have amendments on the debt ceiling that have \nnothing to do with this bill. This bill will create income for \ntaxpayers, because when jobs are created and people work, they pay \ntheir fair share of taxes. This bill does not deserve to be treated \nthis way when it passed almost unanimously out of the committee and it \nis totally bipartisan and has been in place for almost 50 years. Yet \nthat is where we are.\n\n  Every Senator has the right to do what he or she wants. They can play \ngames. They can have fun. But I care about the people I represent, and \nthey need jobs. I care about them whether they are in Kentucky, \nCalifornia, or Maryland--any State in this Union. We are United States \nSenators. We should care about the people, not get up here and play \ngames.\n  EDA uses limited Federal dollars to leverage large amounts of private \nsector investment. It is the little spark that creates economic \nactivity in areas that are distressed, and it creates these jobs all \nacross the country. Every dollar of EDA investment attracts nearly $7.\n  Let me show some other charts. When we vote for this bill--and this \nis an authorization, by the way, not an\n\n[[Page S3596]]\n\nappropriation. We have authorized it at $500 million. Historically, in \nthe last couple of years, it has been funded at about $300 million, \n$250 million. But every dollar attracts $7 from the private sector, and \nthat is a fact. It was documented in congressional testimony made on \nMarch 3, 2011. So that is the history of this EDA.\n  People say, well, how much, Senator, do these jobs cost--each job? \nWell, here is what we know. One job is created for every $2,000 to \n$4,000 invested. So it is an average of somewhere around $3,000 a job. \nThat is a good return on our investment. We know that between 220 and \n500 jobs are created for every $1 million of EDA investment.\n  Here is what we know. Between 2005 and 2010, 450,000 jobs were \ncreated by these investments and 85,000 jobs were saved. Everybody in \nthis Senate, I think--though I could be wrong--if asked what is the \nmost important thing we have to do today, would answer it is to help \nspur job creation in the private sector. Most of these are in \ncooperation with the private sector. Sometimes they are sewer projects \nor water projects that are needed by the private sector.\n  Let me cite some examples of that. Since we are authorizing this, at \nthis stage, at $500 million, one might ask, how many jobs would be \ncreated each year. It looks as if it would create nearly 200,000 jobs \nper year and between 430,000 and 1 million jobs over the life of the \nbill.\n  But let me use some examples, because this isn't rhetoric. This is a \nprogram that has been in place since 1965. The city of Dixon, in my \nhome State, got $3 million for a water system that will increase the \ncity's water supply and their storage capacity, which will eliminate a \nmajor impediment to planned development and expansion of the city's \ncommercial industrial areas. When you don't have enough water, you \ncan't expand. I learned that when I was a county supervisor. You need \nto make sure there is adequate water, adequate electricity, and \nadequate sewerage. You have to make sure there are adequate roads. All \nthese things are necessary for development and job creation.\n  This project is expected to create 1,000 jobs and leverage $40 \nmillion in private investment. So we have a $3 million investment to \nimprove the water system and it is going to leverage $40 million. I \ncall that a good deal for our taxpayers and a great deal for the \nAmerican people to see jobs created. So we have 1,000 jobs--good jobs--\ncreated. That means 1,000 dads and moms bringing home paychecks for \ntheir families.\n  But what do we have here? The same thing Senator Landrieu had to put \nup with--amendment after amendment after amendment that has nothing to \ndo with this bill. We even had an amendment from a Republican friend \nthat would do away with this entire agency. Unbelievable.\n  The city of Shafter in my State, $2 million for sewer and water \nimprovements to serve the East Shafter Logistical Center, which will \nallow development of an additional 600 acres to enable continued growth \nof the center and support a multimodal transportation hub. This project \nis expected to create 1,400 jobs and leverage $200 million in private \ninvestment. So that is a $2 million investment that is going to be \nleveraged, leveraged, leveraged.\n  We are going through a time when we have to cut spending, and I love \nwhen the Republicans lecture Democrats about that. Wait till you hear \nwhat goes on here. Guess which party was the only party that balanced \nthe budget and created a surplus in recent memory. The Democrats, with \nBill Clinton. So don't lecture us about how to balance budgets. We know \nhow to do it. And guess what. We know how to do it while creating 23 \nmillion jobs. So I don't need to hear the lectures, because they are \nmisplaced. Talk to yourself. You are the ones who didn't say a word \nwhen George Bush did a tax cut for billionaires and put it all on the \ncredit card. Now you still want to extend those tax cuts and bleed the \nrevenues.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will not yield. I have stated that before, but thank \nyou for asking.\n  Here is where we are. I have to reiterate so I don't lose my place. \nUnder Bill Clinton, the Democrats balanced the budget, created \nsurpluses and 23 million jobs. George Bush came in and he held a press \nconference--I saw a rerun of it last night--and said, we don't need \nsurpluses. This money belongs to the American people. Well, he didn't \nsay what he meant. He meant it belongs to rich people--superrich people \nwho earn over a billion and over a million dollars. He gave away the \nstore. Then he went to war--two wars--and put that on the credit card. \nMy friends on the other side never once said, Gee, I can't raise the \ndebt ceiling to pay the debt. They all voted to pay. Almost to a \nperson, they all voted to raise the debt ceiling, and it was doubled \nfrom when Bill Clinton was in office. But now, after George Bush left a \nmess--a god-awful mess in the debt and the deficit, and he handed \nPresident Obama a $1.2 trillion deficit--all of a sudden they blame \nPresident Obama for all of this.\n  The American people get it. They do not buy that. They understand \nthis. They are not happy where we are, and they shouldn't be, but they \nknow where the problem started. You know why. Because you can't rewrite \nhistory. You could try, but those deficits and those debts--those \nnumbers--are in the books. Unless you erase them, they will remain in \nthe books. I don't care whether it is talking about Paul Revere's ride \nor the deficits, that is history.\n  Let me show the deficits we had when we were in control. We got it \ndown to zero, and we got surpluses and created 23 million jobs. That \nall was erased when we entered a situation in the last couple of years \nof the Bush administration, where jobs were bleeding at 800,000 a \nmonth, 700,000 a month, credit was frozen, and the automobile industry \nwas in the tank. President Obama took action, but this recovery is \ntough. It has been the worst recession since the Great Depression.\n  This is what I know. We can do this if we work together, dare I say \nit? We can adopt a framework that understands billionaires and \nmillionaires don't need their tax cuts now. We can get some more \nrevenues in here and cut the fat and cut the duplication and go after \nthe people who don't pay the taxes they owe. We can end the war in \nAfghanistan and save $1 trillion over 10 years. I can come up with $4 \ntrillion easily. Allow Medicare to negotiate with the drug companies \nfor lower prices. How is that--$200 billion?\n  But, no, instead, there is demagoguery and there are attempts to \nbring down bills such as this--clean, nice bills that will do \neverything we know we need to do now--leverage our spare dollars, \nattract public investment, create jobs and create jobs. But, no, we are \nfacing a host of amendments, and I don't find it funny. I find it sad \nthat we cannot come together.\n  I have a city in California, a very fast-growing city in the Silicon \nValley--San Jose. We got them, through this program, $3 million for the \nrenovation and expansion of the Center for Employment Training. What do \nthey do there? They teach skills so when there are certain job losses \ngoing on, we have people with these new skills. We increased that \ncenter's capacity by 860 students. We expanded access to a GED, so \npeople who didn't finish high school could get their diploma. We taught \nthem how to speak better, how to read better, and we taught them small \nbusiness entrepreneurship. This is what we are expanding to new people.\n  This project is going to create 4,900 jobs and leverage $3 million in \nprivate investment. This project was one to one. It was $3 million in \npublic investment, $3 million in private investment, with 4,900 new \njobs predicted.\n  By the way, these are not earmarks. We have six regional offices and \nthere are applications made for these grants. They are made by the EDA \nand it is under the Commerce Department.\n  On the west coast, in 2003--to prove some points here--EDA invested \n$1.8 million in the construction of a water and energy technology \nincubator in the Central Valley of California. For those who don't know \nthe Central Valley, it is where you get a lot of your fruits and \nvegetables. They are struggling in this downturn. In 2003, according to \nEDA, the incubator has housed more than 15 entrepreneurs since it \nopened, and those entrepreneurs have obtained over $17 million in \nprivate capital and created jobs for the Central Valley. So\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\na $1.8 million investment in the construction of a more than 2,300 \nsquare foot incubator for a water and energy technology business, and \nlook what happened. From that small investment, it attracted $17 \nmillion. That is a huge leverage--a huge leverage.\n  You all know Boeing Company. In order to help mitigate the Boeing \nCompany's decision to reduce manufacturing jobs in Renton, WA, EDA \ninvested $2 million in 2006 to help build infrastructure to serve the \ncommercial redevelopment of a 42-acre former aircraft manufacturing \nsite. The redevelopment has created a mixed-use campus used by \nbusinesses focusing on commercial services, high-tech and life \nsciences, and helped create 2,500 jobs.\n  In the Midwest--I talked about this yesterday--in the city of Duluth, \nMN, they did something terrific there. They gave a grant of $3.5 \nmillion, matched by a city grant of $2.3 million, and they set up this \naviation business--the Duluth Aviation Business Incubator at the Duluth \nAirport. This investment helped a company named Cirrus Aircraft grow \nfrom a handful of employees to a thousand employees by 2008. This \nincubator is now leased to Cirrus Design Corporation, which has the \nlargest share of the worldwide general aviation market.\n  What we are talking about here is planting a seed of economic \ndevelopment, and that seed attracts more seeds from the private sector, \nfrom the local people, from the nonprofits. At the end of the day, what \nhave we done by that little seed? It has grown. And this has been \nhappening since 1965 when this program was created.\n  By the way, you will be shocked to know it was authorized at the same \namount of money in 1965--$500 million. So the fact is this isn't a \nprogram that has grown and grown; it has stayed the same. That means, \nif you put inflation into the equation, it has been dramatically cut to \na tiny part of what it once was for the country, but it is a beautiful \npart of our economic growth.\n  What do we need today? Jobs. What is the second thing we need? Jobs. \nAnd what is the third thing we need? Jobs. I am not amused by 27, 28, \n29, 30 amendments, some of which have nothing to do with what we are \ntalking about.\n  One of my friends on the other side of the aisle has an amendment \nthat is pending to repeal banking reform--everything we did and worked \non. I guess he wants to go back to the days when the banks got bigger, \nbigger, gambled with our money, and we almost lost capitalism in this \ncountry. OK, that is his right. Why is he doing it on this bill, \nwithout a hearing?\n  Another colleague has an amendment to end the regulations, I say to \nmy friend, that protect the health and safety of the people. Not one \nhearing on it.\n  I think the American people have to wake up, so I am saying: Wake up, \nAmerica, today. Wake up and pay attention to what is happening.\n  We have a bill on the Senate floor that is meant to do one thing--\ncreate jobs in areas that have been hard hit by this bad economy. Why \nare the Republicans stalling it, hurting it, putting forward amendments \nthat have nothing to do with it? We have to ask that question. They \nvoted for it under George Bush unanimously, the same program. They \nvoted for it nearly unanimously out of our committee, I say to my \nfriend who is a senior member and a great chairman of the subcommittee \non our committee--they voted for it. Now they are delaying it and \noffering all these poison pill amendments to it.\n  This is the second time they have done it. America, you have to wake \nup. It is the second time they have done it. They did it to the small \nbusiness bill. They hurt small business. They are doing it to this \nbill. They are hurting job creation, and they are hurting small \nbusiness again, and they are hurting big business. I said before, one \nof the provisions helped Boeing.\n  Maytag, there is another company you know the name of. In 2007 the \nMaytag plant, headquartered in Newton, IA, which employed 1,800 factory \nworkers, was closed. By 2008 the city identified two new manufacturing \noperations that could be located on the old site: TPI Composites, a \nwind turbine blade manufacturer, and Trinity Structural Towers, a \nmanufacturer of massive steel towers for windmills.\n  Can I ask my friend if he would like some time on this? I am going to \ncontinue telling the Maytag story. When I finish, I am going to turn to \na very important member of the committee, Senator Cardin, for some \nremarks.\n  EDA invested $580,000 in 2008 for grading, site preparation, and \nsurfacing for a wind tower storage facility that was leased to Trinity. \nThat $580,000 attracted $21 million in public investment. That same \nyear we saw other investments in Iowa.\n  I am going to stop and yield the floor so my friend can ask unanimous \nconsent that he be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I believe we are on the pending amendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right now we are on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Let me compliment Senator Boxer for her leadership on \nthis bill. She pointed out this EDA bill brought forward is about jobs. \nIt is about offering jobs in underserved areas. These are areas in \nwhich it is difficult to create jobs in good times, but in hard times \nthey get hit even harder. The EDA program leverages a small amount of \npublic support for private sector investment that creates jobs in \nunderserved areas.\n  In my State of Maryland, EDA projects have been very successful in \nbringing jobs to the rural parts of Maryland--to western Maryland and \nto our eastern shore. They have leveraged private sector investment, \nand we maintained and created jobs.\n  Yesterday on the Senate floor I gave specific examples of EDA \nprojects in western Maryland and on the eastern shore of Maryland. I \ntalked about an old manufacturing plant that was saved under an EDA \ngrant, leveraged 10 to 1 with private sector investment, saving over \n100 jobs and creating another 20. These are jobs that are important for \neconomic growth in our community.\n  We all understand this recovery has been a very difficult one for us \nto get moving at the pace of job growth that we know we need for this \nNation. We all talk about what we can do for our budget deficit, but I \nhope we all would agree the most important thing we can do would be to \ncreate more jobs.\n  The majority leader has brought forward three major bills now to \ncreate jobs. We would like to have a little cooperation from the other \nside of the aisle so we can get these bills to the President for \nsignature. The FAA bill, which deals with the modernizing of our air \nsystem, which will create jobs and will make air transportation safer, \nis caught up in conference. Let's get it done and bring it to the \nPresident. We had the SBIR bill before us that will help small \nbusinesses that are in innovation as far as job growth. We had so many \nnongermane amendments offered to it we could not get it to the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  Now we have an EDA bill that came out of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee by a near unanimous vote, that over the history of the \nEDA has not been controversial in its reauthorization, and now it looks \nas if we are going to see numerous nongermane amendments offered in an \neffort, basically, to just ignore the importance of the underlying bill \nthat can create jobs for our communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to, yes, come forward with their amendments. \nLet's debate them. If they are not relevant to creating jobs under the \nEDA bill, then let's be reasonable. Let's not have a whole series of \namendments that are totally beyond the scope of this bill, such as the \ndebt limit issue or repeal of our financial reform of last year. I \ndon't mind debating those issues, but they should not be debated at \nthis particular moment.\n  I do hope we will be able to get to the reauthorization bill. I \npointed out yesterday that one of the highest priorities, from our \nlocal people in Maryland, on need was additional help from the Federal \nGovernment for planning dollars. Planning dollars allow local \ncommunities to develop a strategy that can help them with economic \ngrowth in a community.\n  I can tell you, having recently been out to Cumberland, MD--a great \nand beautiful part of our State of Maryland--they used to have a lot of \nmanufacturing jobs. Many of those jobs have\n\n[[Page S3598]]\n\nmoved on. They do have a strategy, but they need the planning help to \nput that together so they can come forward with a game plan, attracting \nmore private sector interest in order to create more job opportunities \nfor families to stay in the western part of our State. It is that type \nof assistance that is critically important to America.\n  I come back to the point Senator Boxer raised. The purpose of this \nbill is to create jobs--save jobs and create jobs. We need to get on \nwith that business in the Senate. That is why I am proud to have worked \non the Environment and Public Works Committee to bring this bill \nforward. I hope my colleagues will be judicious with their amendments \nso we can get this bill through the Senate, to the House, so we will \nhave an opportunity to get this to the President in the very near \nfuture.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Boxer). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 407\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I can offer amendment No. 407.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 407.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the FHA to equitably treat homebuyers who have \n              repaid in full their FHA-insured mortgages)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 22. PROHIBITION ON INTEREST CHARGES FOR ON-TIME \n                   PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS.\n\n       Section 203 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1709) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(z) Prohibition on Interest Charges for On-time Principal \n     Payments.--Each mortgagee (or servicer) with respect to a \n     mortgage under this section may not impose, nor may the \n     Secretary require the imposition of, any interest charge on \n     such a mortgage as a result of the loss of any time period \n     provided by the mortgagee (or servicer) within which the \n     mortgagor may fully repay the principal balance amount of the \n     mortgage, with respect to--\n       ``(1) any days in the billing cycle that precedes the most \n     recent billing cycle in which such amounts were repaid; or\n       ``(2) any amounts repaid in the current billing cycle that \n     were repaid within such time period.''.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I will speak at a different point about \nthis amendment, but it is an equitable amendment dealing with the \ninterest charges on government loans that are paid off in the middle of \nthe month to prorate the interest. It is a consumer issue. I think it \nwill help American families. I will explain it in more detail in a \nlater part of the proceedings.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 428\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment so I may call up amendment No. 428, which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Merkley], for himself and Ms. \n     Snowe, proposes an amendment numbered 428.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To establish clear regulatory standards for mortgage \n                   servicers, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n              TITLE ___--REGULATION OF MORTGAGE SERVICING\n\n     SEC. ___1.

REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Director shall submit to Congress a report that \n     contains--\n       (1) an evaluation of the effect of this title on--\n       (A) State law; and\n       (B) communication between servicers and borrowers; and\n       (2) a description of any problems concerning the \n     implementation of this title.\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I wish to speak to the bill before us \non the Economic Development Administration.\n  I rise specifically to talk about the issue that is on the minds of \nall Americans; that is, the topic of jobs. Unemployment is far too \nhigh. My home State unemployment is very high, and that is before we \ncount all the folks who are underemployed--those who have found some \ntype of part-time work, but it is not enough to support their families.\n  We all know how worried Americans are about this. It goes to the \nheart of their financial foundations, the success of their families, \nand it should be our top focus.\n  The good news is that the bill before us creates jobs and stimulates \nthe economy in our towns and regions that need help the most. Economic \nDevelopment Administration assistance is targeted to both rural and \nurban areas experiencing high unemployment, low income, a natural \ndisaster or other severe economic distress. It does this at a low cost \nand gets the most bang for our buck.\n  The bill encourages private sector investment. Indeed, for every $1 \nthe government spends on these projects, we leverage $7 in private \ninvestment. That is terrific leverage for our national investment.\n  With national unemployment still above 9 percent and with extreme \nstorms causing destruction around the Nation, our support in these \nregions matters now more than ever. Whether a town is recovering from a \nplant closure or a flood, it is critical that the community invest in \nplanning for their new economic future. The kind of assistance provided \nby the Economic Development Administration is critical to promoting \neconomic growth and job creation, particularly in small communities.\n  I wish to share an example from my home State in the town of \nVernonia, OR. It is a small community in the northern part of our State \nthat was devastated by heavy flooding in 2007. Similar to many of the \nrural communities that are helped by these grants, Vernonia is too \nsmall to have dedicated staff to help them rebuild the local economy, \nand that is where the EDA has a great role to play. Through two EDA \nprograms, the Federal Government was able to step in and help by \npartnering with local governments and private business, and today \nVernonia is doing much better. As the executive director of that area's \neconomic development district said: ``We would be lost without the \nEDA.''\n  Take another example regarding the timber industry in Oregon, hit \nhard by declining demand because the housing market is in the ditch. \nThe timber companies and their workers are struggling, but they have \ntwo things on their side: great workers and great natural resources. \nWith the help of grants from the EDA, one of those lumber mills on the \nKlamath Reservation has been turned into a new biomass plant, producing \ngreen energy for the region, bringing new economic activity to the \nKlamath Reservation and creating and saving jobs for Oregonians.\n  Furthermore, the EDA can continue to help our timber companies and \nother similar businesses plan for the future and play a key role in \nhelping communities by coordinating between private companies and the \nForest Service. The EDA can help these companies project what timber \ncontracts are likely to come down the road and how they can tailor \ntheir business model to grow accordingly.\n  EDA investments are a proven path to retaining or creating new \nprivate sector job opportunities and helping small businesses diversify \nor expand. In fact, from 2005 to 2010, EDA projects led directly to the \ncreation of more than 300,000 jobs--and this doesn't even count the \nmany thousands more jobs that were created by those seven private \ndollars for every public dollar.\n  Without question, the EDA represents an efficient and cost-effective \nway to help distressed regions overcome the challenges they are facing \nand build a new foundation for job growth in our communities.\n\n[[Page S3600]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and to put our country back on \nthe path to creating jobs.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, earlier today, I voted against the \ninterchange fee amendment, Senate amendment No. 392 offered by the \njunior Senator from Montana and I would like to explain why. Before I \ndo that, I would like to acknowledge two important points about Senator \nTester. First, I appreciate the fact that he made significant changes \nto his amendment in an attempt to reach a middle ground on this issue. \nAnd the concern he has for small community banks and credit unions is \nbeyond question. Having said that, I did not reach the same conclusion \nhe reached that we should delay the regulatory process with regard to \ninterchange fees.\n  Most of the concern raised has been expressed against the Federal \nReserve's December 2010 draft interchange fee rulemaking. It was a \ndraft proposal. Let me repeat that: it was a draft proposal. The \nFederal Reserve received 11,000 comments on the draft rulemaking. The \nfinal rulemaking, due any day and scheduled to take effect in July, \nwill reflect those comments and suggestions. We need to let the \nregulatory process work. If the final rule doesn't work as Congress \nintended, we have a number of options to fix it, up to and including a \ncongressional resolution of disapproval. If the Senate had approved the \nTester amendment, it may have been ``fixing'' a problem that doesn't \nexist.\n  The Federal Reserve's rulemaking was required by a provision \ncontained in the Wall Street reform bill Congress passed last year. The \nsenior Senator from Illinois was the author of that provision. He \nmodified it to exempt smaller banks and credit unions with assets under \n$10 billion. Now we are being told the exemption is unworkable. Again, \nwe haven't seen the final rule yet but I don't agree with the premise.\n  Andrew Kahr is a leading financial services expert. He was the \nfounder and chief executive officer of First Deposit Corp, which later \nbecame Providian. He recently laid out the following arguments, which I \nfind cogent, on the American Banker Web site:\n\n       One argument is that the clearing networks, of which there \n     are only four that matter, will not support the ``two-tier'' \n     interchange system . . . Ridiculous. Visa is the largest of \n     the networks. It's already announced that it will implement \n     Durbin. (Maybe this is an object lesson as to why Visa \n     remains No. 1.)\n       For the small banks, MasterCard is the only other \n     significant player. If MasterCard finds it politic not to add \n     one more wrinkle to a skein of interchange levels that is \n     already of Byzantine complexity, then let the small banks \n     gravitate to Visa in order to benefit from Durbin.\n       A second argument of the big-bank lobbyists is that \n     merchants will reject the debit cards of small banks if these \n     carry a 1 percent interchange cost, versus 0.3 percent for \n     the large banks. Really? Then why don't these merchants \n     reject all credit cards, with interchange of 2 percent or \n     more, if the customer could instead use a debit card? When is \n     the last time a merchant politely asked you whether you could \n     pay with a debit card instead of a credit card?\n\n  Mr. Kahr concludes that if interchange fee revenue for the big banks \ndrops but stays the same for the small banks and credit unions, the \nsmall banks will reap a competitive advantage. They will be able to \nimpose lower fees, pay more interest, and give greater rewards to \ndepositors. As he put it, ``anything that reduces revenue for big banks \nbut not for small ones should help the latter compete more effectively \nagainst the former.''\n  Here is why I supported Senator Durbin's amendment to the Wall Street \nreform bill to regulate these fees in the first place. Banks do not \ncompete with each other on the fees that merchants pay them for debit \ncard use. Instead, Visa and MasterCard fix fee rates on behalf of all \nbanks. There is no naturally occurring market force that keeps \ninterchange fees at reasonable levels. The Visa and MasterCard duopoly \nis so dominant that merchants cannot refuse to accept their cards. \nConsequently, Visa and MasterCard don't lower interchange fees--they \nraise them, to entice banks to issue more of their cards. Retail \nmerchants have no leverage to stop this escalation. As a result, the \nU.S. has the highest debit interchange fees in the world, averaging \n1.14 percent of each transaction and amounting to over $16 billion per \nyear. These fees affect merchants, universities, charities, government \nagencies, and everyone else who accepts debit cards as payment. The \nfees end up getting passed on to consumers in the form of higher retail \nprices for everything from groceries to gas to textbooks.\n  The Durbin provision stipulated that fees set by Visa and MasterCard \non behalf of big issuing banks must be reasonable and proportional to \ncosts incurred by the issuer that are ``specific to a particular \nelectronic debit transaction.'' Some argue this is too narrow. The \nproblem with the Tester amendment, well-intentioned as it may have \nbeen, is that it was too broad. It directed the Federal Reserve to let \nVisa and MasterCard set fee rates to ``all fixed and incremental costs \nassociated with debit card transactions and program operations.'' The \nterm ``program operations'' wasn't further defined and could have \ncreated a potentially enormous loophole. Rates could actually go higher \nunder this standard.\n  I appreciate the hard work the junior senator from Montana put into \nhis amendment. If the Federal Reserve's final rule truly presents \nproblems for community banks and credit unions, I will join him in the \neffort to fix it. For the time being, I think we should let the \nregulatory process proceed and that's why I opposed the amendment. We \nhelped out the banks; now it is time to help out consumers and \nAmerica's small businesses.\n  Thank you, Madam President, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Webb and Mr. Corker pertaining to the \nintroduction of S.J. Res. 18 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, noticing that there is nothing happening \non the floor, I want to come down and talk a little bit about the vote \nthat just occurred on the Tester-Corker amendment.\n  Obviously, I was on the losing side of this debate, but as we went \nback to our office, I did want to say that one of the folks I have \nworked with a long time noted that this may be the first time in a long \ntime in the Senate where we had a real bipartisan debate, where we had \npeople on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the issue in large \nnumbers. While we came up short from my standpoint on the vote--the \nother side obviously did not come up short--I want to say that I see a \nglimmer of hope in that regardless of how the outcome may have been on \nthis particular vote--and again, I worked hard to try to pass an \namendment that I thought was good policy--the fact is, if you really \nlook at the vote count, I cannot remember in a long time a vote on a \ncontentious piece of legislation such as this where there were so many \npeople in the majority and minority, on both sides of the issue, just \nevaluating the policy on the grounds on which it was coming forward. So \nfor what is it worth, I thought that was an interesting observation.\n  I want to say to those people who supported the Tester-Corker \namendment that I thank them very much for listening and working with us \nto try to pass the legislation. And for those people who voted against \nit, I thank them for the way in which this debate was conducted. Again, \nit has been a long time since I remember something like this on the \nfloor where you had such a split vote on both sides of the aisle. I\n\n[[Page S3601]]\n\nthink that is progress. I just wanted to note that.\n  Certainly to all of those who were actively engaged in this debate on \nboth sides of it, I think that in itself, while we did not prevail in \nthe legislation itself, from the standpoint of the Senate, not myself, \nI think that is an accomplishment worth noting.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, our economic situation grows more dire by \nthe day. Our unemployment rate has gone back up to 9.1 percent. Last \nmonth, only 54,000 jobs were created. You have to create over 125,000 \nto stay even. Housing prices remain in free fall. Since 2007, home \nvalues declined by more than they did during the Great Depression. In \nlarge part due to QE2, Americans are facing higher gas prices and \nhigher food prices that are cutting into their family budgets. Now \nthere is increasing pressure for a QE3, which would only accelerate \ncommodity inflation.\n  Looming over all of this is our national debt. We have a national \ndebt of nearly $14.5 trillion. That actually understates things. This \nis how USA Today calculated it earlier this week. This chart says it \nall. Let me read that: ``U.S. owes $62 trillion.''\n  Let me read that again so it sinks in: ``U.S. owes $62 trillion.''\n  Numbers such as this are frightening to the American people. They are \nnumbers fit for a banana republic, not the great United States of \nAmerica, and they are numbers that demand a balanced budget amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution.\n  I do not say this lightly. Our Constitution has served us well, \nworking over more than two centuries to guarantee and extend liberty \nand equal rights of American citizens. But from time to time it has \nbecome apparent that the Constitution needs to be amended. The Founders \nthemselves contemplated this eventuality, giving to the people's \nrepresentatives in Congress and the people in the various States the \nopportunity to amend the Constitution. It has become so clear that our \nspending situation is so grim, and the President and some members of \nhis party are so unwilling to rectify it, that a constitutional \namendment is in order.\n  The bottom line is that Federal spending has become a threat to \nliberty. The inability to rein in Federal spending is effectively \nundermining the promises of the Declaration of Independence and the \nConstitution's preamble. Federal spending is a threat to this Nation's \nfree men and women, slowly turning our fellow citizens into servants \nand stewards.\n  To restore the promise of the Constitution and the classical liberty \nthe Founders sought to secure, we must amend the Constitution and we \nmust do it now. We must amend the Constitution by voting on S. J. Res. \n10, passing it and sending it to the people of the States for \nratification. The people I serve in Utah are demanding this action and \nI know the citizens across this country are demanding it as well. They \nsee the problems looming before them.\n  One of the first things I did at the beginning of this Congress was \nintroduce S. J. Res. 3, a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. It received the support of 32 Members of the Senate at \nthat time. We didn't have time to get to the rest of them. But what is \nremarkable is what happened a few weeks later. All 47 members of the \nRepublican caucus unified behind a single balanced budget amendment, S. \nJ. Res. 10. I was proud to work with my colleagues of varied political \nbeliefs from across the country to draft this amendment that announced \nloudly and clearly where the Senate Republican caucus stands on this \nissue.\n  When I introduced this amendment at the end of March, I was honored \nto stand beside Mitch McConnell and my colleague from Utah, Mike Lee, \nas well as my colleagues Senators Cornyn, Toomey, DeMint, Rubio, and \nmany others who took a stand for putting Federal restraints on Federal \nspending and restoring the Constitution's original checks and balances.\n  I was honored by the support this amendment received from groups \ncommitted to taxpayers and limited government. Here is a list of some \nof the groups supporting S. J. Res. 10: 60 Plus, Americans for Tax \nReform, Americans for Prosperity, Club for Growth, FreedomWorks, \nAmericans for Limited Government, the National Taxpayers Union, the \nCouncil for Citizens Against Government Waste, the Pass the BBA \nCoalition, the National Taxpayer Limitation Committee, the American \nCouncil for Health Reform, Grassroot Voices, and Ending Spending. But \nmost of all I was honored to be serving my constituents in Utah who \ntold me this was a fight worth having.\n  I am under no illusions that this is going to be an easy fight. The \nbottom line is that some Members of Congress and certainly President \nObama cannot be trusted to control Federal spending in the long term. \nConsider the issue of entitlement spending. Medicare and Social \nSecurity are bankrupt. The failure to put forward a plan that would \naddress their permanent spending shortfalls is quite simply a plan for \nthe destruction of Medicare and Social Security. The Democrats' \ncommitment to the entitlement status quo is the commitment to national \nbankruptcy.\n  Don't take my word for it. Listen to what the Social Security and \nMedicare trustees had to say about those programs. In 2010, Social \nSecurity ran a $49 billion cash deficit. It is now permanently in the \nred, with the Federal Government forced to use general revenues to make \nup for these shortfalls. The trust fund will be completely exhausted in \n2036, and we all know there is no real trust fund, just IOUs issued by \nthe government. But even that will be exhausted in 2036.\n  What about Medicare? Not to be outdone, Medicare's trust fund is now \npermanently in the red as well, and will be completely depleted in \n2024, if not before; that date keeps moving up because of the \nprofligacy of people here in the Congress and the lack of leadership in \nthe White House. These numbers are jarring. They demand a serious and \nan adult response.\n  But what is the reaction of our colleagues on the other side to these \nnumbers, at least some of them? For too many, the strategy is one of \ndeny and smear--deny there is a problem and smear those who attempt to \nfix this spending crisis.\n  The President's budget was a joke. His do-over budget was nothing \nmore than a speech with some vague details. Before Memorial Day the \nSenate's Democratic leadership busied itself attacking Chairman Paul \nRyan's budget rather than offering up one of their own. Just before \nMemorial Day, that is what they did. At a time when leadership is \ncalled for, President Obama is missing in action and complicit in the \ndemagoguery of his surrogates at the Democratic National Committee.\n  There is a reason the Democrats are reluctant to offer any way \nforward out of this mess. It is quite simple--they refuse to cut \nspending and reform entitlements. But they also refuse to tell the \ntruth about the tax increases that would be necessary to balance the \nbudget their way. The entitlements, of course, are Social Security, \nMedicaid, and Medicare, to mention a few.\n  The Democrats are content to be the tax collectors for the welfare \nstate but they will not acknowledge what this entails--massive tax \nincreases on America's families and on America's small businesses.\n  In his original budget, President Obama proposed $1.6 trillion in tax \nincreases on all segments of our economy. In spite of these tax \nincreases, his budget got nowhere close to balance. Before Memorial \nDay, Democrats attacked Chairman Ryan's budget and offered up as an \nalternative roughly $21 billion in tax increases on oil companies. To \nborrow from John McEnroe: They cannot be serious; $21 billion in tax \nincreases when we have $62 billion in unfunded obligations. The United \nStates owes $62 trillion. What a joke.\n\n  The experience of the last few decades and last few weeks \ndemonstrates the need for a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. Our spending is simply out of control, and President \nObama and many of his allies refuse to address this spending in a \nmeaningful\n\n[[Page S3602]]\n\nway. All they have in their bag of tricks are tax increases, but the \ntax increases that would be necessary to fill this deficit hole would \ncrush the liberty and the livelihoods of the American people.\n  Rather than doing serious work and making the tough decisions \nnecessary to right our fiscal ship--rather than engaging in true \nleadership--the President seems content to focus on the next election \nand leave the hard decisions for a later day. That is the best-case \nscenario. The worst-case scenario is that certain liberals are content \nto force a full-blown fiscal crisis--one that would make the economic \ncollapse of 2008 and 2009 look like the minor leagues--and then hope \nall the pressure will be to institute a value-added tax that will be a \npermanently open spigot, filling the coffers of the bloated Federal \nGovernment. Neither of these scenarios is unacceptable.\n  The fact is, we are running out of time. The country needs to act \nnow. Fortunately, in the absence of Presidential leadership, the \nconstitution provides an opportunity for Congress, along with the \npeople of the States, to amend the Constitution and solve our country's \nsystemic fiscal imbalance, even when the President refuses to do so.\n  Getting a balanced budget amendment passed is going to be an uphill \nclimb. We all know that. I know all too well the Democrats' calculated \nresistance to serious efforts to reduce Federal spending. In 1997, a \nbalanced budget amendment I introduced and fought for fell short by \njust one vote in the Senate. We had 66 votes. We actually had 67 that \nmorning, but one of our Senators was threatened by the unions and \nflipped and we lost by 1 vote. Fourteen years later, our national debt \nstands at $14 trillion, threatening our economic future, reducing our \nglobal competitiveness, and jeopardizing our national security. Can we \nimagine where we would be had we been successful in passing that \namendment and had one more vote to do it back in 1997? We wouldn't be \nin the colossal mess we are in today. Yet the resistance to a balanced \nbudget amendment is probably even stronger among Democrats now than it \nwas in 1997.\n  Nonetheless, I am hopeful that if the citizens and taxpayers of Utah \nare in any way representative of the people in the rest of the \ncountry--and I think they are--it is clear they have had enough. The \npeople of this country are not going to stand by any longer and wait \nfor Congress to fix this situation. They understand the Constitution \nmust be amended in order to revive the Founders' original limits on the \nsize of the Federal Government. Passing a balanced budget amendment is \nnot just a constitutional imperative, it is essential to the long-term \nfiscal health of this country.\n  In the coming weeks, the fight over the debt limit is going to come \nto a head. It is going to be a long, hot summer. But I, as will a lot \nof others who care for this country, will be itching for a fight, and I \nwill go to bat for this balanced budget amendment. In this country, the \npeople are sovereign, and it is well past the time we give them a \nbalanced budget amendment to ratify.\n  I urge my colleagues who have not done so already to support S.J. \nRes. 10. I look forward to debating and voting on this resolution--and \npassing it--later this summer.\n  I believe the leadership on the other side should bring up the \nbalanced budget amendment and have a full-scale debate before we lift \nthe debt ceiling--if the debt ceiling is to be lifted--and I am not so \nsure it should be lifted without a balanced budget amendment. On the \nother hand, the very least that has to happen is to bring up this \nbalanced budget amendment before we actually get into the fight over \nthe debt ceiling. It would be very good for this whole body to have to \ndefend itself and to have to make arguments, pro and con, with regard \nto a balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  I believe when the American people see what terrible shape we are \nin--caused by terrible profligacy, caused by terrible spending by the \nCongress of the United States--when people start to understand this, \nthey are going to get tremendously angry, and I think in every respect \nthey are going to start saying we have had enough. We have had enough. \nIt is time for you folks in the Congress to stand and pass a balanced \nbudget amendment that we will have to live with in order to save this \ncountry and save it from the free fall we are in. I hope we can get our \ncolleagues on both sides--we do have all 47 Republicans--I hope we can \nget our colleagues on the other side to think and look clearly toward a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment, S.J. Res. 10. I look forward \nto debating and voting on this amendment and passing it later this \nsummer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Education\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I wish to take a few moments to talk \nabout the Republican budget, the so-called Ryan budget in the House. \nThis has been widely condemned, of course, for its plan to end Medicare \nand for its radical cuts to Medicaid. But I have come to the floor to \nhighlight yet another extreme element of that Republican budget--its \nunprecedented assault on education funding and the grave threat this \nposes to school reform efforts across the United States.\n  This Republican budget would slash funding for education by 15 \npercent next year--2012. Even more drastic cuts to education funding \nwould come in each of the years to follow.\n  These Draconian cuts to education could not come at a worse time for \nAmerica's public schools. The final budget agreement for the current \nfiscal year reduced education funding by $1.3 billion. It zeroed out, \nfor example, the successful Striving Readers Initiative, the only \ncomprehensive Federal program to help struggling adolescent readers. I \nmight just add, that budget ended all literacy programs for kids in \nAmerica funded by the Federal Government. The Federal Government now \ndoes not fund one literacy program in America. That is how bad it has \ngotten. Meanwhile, cash-strapped State and local governments are \nslashing school budgets and firing tens of thousands of teachers. In \nTexas, Gov. Rick Perry has called for a $10 billion cut in education \nfunding. In New York City, the mayor, Mike Bloomberg, has proposed \nlaying off 6,000 teachers.\n  I have an unusual perspective, as both the chair of the \nappropriations subcommittee that funds our Federal education programs \nas well as the chair of the authorizing committee, the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which authorizes education \nprograms.\n  There is no question in my mind that combined Federal, State, and \nlocal budget cuts pose a grave threat to education reform efforts \nacross the country, just as these efforts are reaching a critical mass. \nHere is why. Forty-eight States and the District of Columbia have \ncollaborated to create high-quality common education standards for the \nfirst time. The Obama administration's Race to the Top Initiative has \njump-started ambitious State-level reforms ranging from expanded \ncharter schools to stricter teacher and prep school accountability. In \nthe HELP Committee, Senator Enzi and I together are working on a \nbipartisan effort to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct.\n  However, it is wishful thinking to expect improvements in school \nquality at a time when we are laying off teachers, increasing class \nsizes, and reducing instructional time. I am struck by the fact that \nthe Republican budget's assault on education comes at a time when \nAmerica's competitors are surging forward. For example, China has \ntripled its investment in education and is building hundreds of new \nuniversities. Even in times of austerity and shrinking budgets, smart \ncountries don't just turn a chainsaw on themselves, they continue to \ninvest in the future and, above all, they continue to boost investments \nin education.\n  So as we go forward with education reform in the United States, we \nare building on strength. Most kids in affluent communities already \nattend high-quality public schools and go on to higher education. Our \nchallenge is to ensure that all American students have this \nopportunity, including the nearly 20 percent of children who live in \npoverty.\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\n  Again, certainly money is not the only factor in creating high-\nperforming schools, but it does take money to modernize school \nfacilities, to hire highly qualified teachers, to create effective \nassessment systems, and to provide appropriate instructions for \nstudents with special needs. To demand reform without resources is to \nset up students and teachers to fail. Let me repeat that. To demand \nreform without resources is to set up the students and the teachers to \nfail.\n  In the months ahead, Congress will be focused on reducing the deficit \nand trying to prevent a default on America's debt obligations. Of \ncourse, this is appropriate. But it must not preclude sustained, strong \ninvestments in education for our young people. We need to invest more, \nnot less, in helping States and districts to close the gap between \nworld-class schools that are in the affluent suburbs and the struggling \nschools in poor, urban, and rural communities. We need to provide \nresources to ensure that the goal of graduating students who are \ncollege and career ready applies equally to all students, including \nkids with disabilities, including English language learners. In the \nface of steadily rising college tuition, we must maintain the maximum \nPell grant so kids from low-income families can achieve the American \ndream and get a college education.\n\n  Pundits have attributed the GOP loss in the special election in New \nYork's 26th congressional district to voter anxiety because of the plan \nthe Republicans have to end Medicare. So a lot of the pundits have \nsaid: Well, this recent election in New York's 26th congressional \ndistrict is the result of that. But public dissatisfaction with the \nRepublican budget goes way beyond Medicare. Americans see this budget \nas unbalanced and unfair, especially when it comes to education.\n  The American people are asking: Why do the Republicans insist that \ntrillions of dollars are available for new tax cuts, mainly for big \nbusinesses and the wealthy, but supposedly we cannot afford to sustain \nfunding for public education? This is a classic case of eating your \nseed corn. It is an approach that does not remotely reflect the \npriorities and values of the American people.\n  The Republican budget, as I have said before, is premised on the idea \nthat America is poor and broke, that our best days are behind us, and \nthat we have no choice but to slash investment required in order to \nkeep our middle class strong. I totally disagree. Many Americans are \nhurting because of the struggling economy, but the United States \noverall remains a tremendously wealthy and resourceful nation. Quite \nfrankly, we are the richest Nation on the face of the Earth. Even \nfurther, we are the richest Nation in human history. We have the \nhighest per capita income in America of any major nation. So one has to \nask the question, if we are so rich, why are we so poor? The question \nis not the lack of money. It is not the lack of wealth. It is because \nthe system is broken. We have a system malfunction in this country, and \nwe have to right that system. Because we are an optimistic, forward-\nlooking people, we can do it. We can work together, and we can meet any \nchallenge.\n  But we expect the government to be on our side--not holding us back, \nnot dragging us down, not shorting our futures, not telling people who \nare low income or recent immigrants to this country or kids who do not \nhave a good start in life that, sorry, we cannot give you a world-class \nquality education, we cannot afford to have the best teachers, we \ncannot afford to have good schools for you.\n  If you happen to be wealthy and live in a wealthy area that has high \nproperty taxes and you have a good school and you have good teachers, \ngood for you. But if by happenstance of birth you are born to a family \nwho does not have any money and maybe your parents never went to \ncollege--maybe, as I said, they are new immigrants to this country; \nmaybe they do not speak English that well--if you are in a poor urban \narea or a poor rural area and you have low-quality schools, low-quality \nteachers, chances are you never had any early learning available to \nyou. So when you started kindergarten, you were already way behind \nthose kids in that affluent school in high-income areas.\n  Is that what we are about? Is that what we are trying to say, that we \nare going to have this kind of almost class warfare, that if you are \nborn wealthy and stuff, you have it made but if you are born poor, \nforget about it when it comes to education? That is what the Republican \nbudget says. We are not going to have quality public education for our \nkids.\n  As I said, this does not reflect the values of the American people. \nWe want to make sure our public education system is good for all \nchildren, that they all have the best qualified teachers, that they \nhave good schools, good facilities, the latest technology, that they \nare challenged to do their best, and that they know if they do their \nbest and if they study hard and they get good grades, they will be able \nto go to college and not have a mountain of debt hanging over their \nheads when they graduate.\n  We have done great things as a society, things we have had to do \ntogether, which we could not do as individuals, such as building an \ninterstate highway system, a rail system, mapping the human genome, \nand, again, creating world-class universities. We have done this. We \nhave done this working together, as something we can do together as \ngovernment that we cannot do as individuals.\n  Through our government, we come together to provide a ladder of \nopportunity to give every citizen a shot at the American dream--a \nladder of opportunity that includes Pell grants, the GI bill, job \ntraining, early learning, and, yes, world-class schools.\n  I am convinced the great majority of Americans share this positive \nvision. Again, we are determined to bring deficits under control. But \nwe cannot eat our seed corn. We have to make smart investments in \neducation, and we refuse to be dragged backward into a winner-take-all \nsociety, where the privileged and the powerful seize an even greater \nshare of the wealth, even as our schools are crumbling and our middle \nclass is struggling and declining.\n  For nearly half a century, robust Federal investments in quality \npublic schools and access to higher education have been a critical \npillar undergirding the American middle class. The Republican budget \nwill take a jack hammer to that pillar. This, I believe, is a grave \nmistake. The middle class is the backbone of our Nation. It is time our \nleaders show the backbone to defend it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 390\n\n  Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity also to \nstrongly oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Maine. If \npassed, the amendment would impose severe and unnecessary burdens on \nagencies charged with protecting the American people and would severely \nweaken our vital health and safety protections.\n  My Republican colleagues have tried hard to make the word \n``regulation'' into a bad word. They have created an absurd caricature: \nthe nameless bureaucrat arbitrarily imposing random rules and \nregulations on businesses, and their sole purpose is making sure the \nbusiness fails. That is ridiculous.\n  Most Americans understand this is grossly distorted. The truth is, \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, is not \nabout the government working more efficiently--a goal we all share--it \nis about using the sort of feel-good slogan of ``regulatory reform'' as \ncover for an effort to paralyze the ability of the government to \nenforce vital health and safety protections.\n  In effect, the Snowe amendment ought to be called the ``buyer \nbeware'' amendment. Go back to the days when the snake oil salesman \ncould sell you anything and you took it at your own risk, where we did \nnot have safe drug laws and food safety laws and things such as that to \nprotect people. It was just a buyer beware society. Do we want to go \nback to that?\n  I believe the American people want clean air and clean water and to \nknow they are not adulterated. The Snowe amendment would weaken \nenvironmental protection.\n  I believe the American people want to make sure their children's toys \nare safe, that they are not loaded with mercury and other elements that \nwill destroy their health. The Snowe amendment would mean weaker \nprotection of toys and other consumer products.\n\n  I believe the American people want workers to come home safely at the\n\n[[Page S3604]]\n\nend of the day. The Snowe amendment would mean more injuries and deaths \nin mines and other hazardous workplaces.\n  I believe the American people want the food they eat to be safe and \nuntainted. The Snowe amendment could mean we cannot enact implementing \nregulations for our recent bipartisan food safety bill, which we just \npassed last year--bipartisan. But when you pass a bill, obviously, the \nFood and Drug Administration is going to have to issue regulations. \nWell, the Snowe amendment would severely restrict that. Again, you \nwould be playing Russian roulette with the food you eat. Maybe it is \nsafe; maybe it is not--buyer beware.\n  I believe, in the wake of the financial meltdown of 2008, which \nalmost caused another Great Depression, the American people want \noversight and regulation of banks and other financial institutions. The \nSnowe amendment, again, could mean banks would remain free to do the \nsame reckless, predatory practices that nearly wrecked our economy.\n  There are already important checks on regulatory authority. The law \nalready requires agencies to perform comprehensive assessments of the \nimpact of regulations on businesses and local government. There is an \nextensive notice and comment period under the Administrative Procedures \nAct, where those impacted by potential rules--including small \nbusinesses--are given an important say in regulation. Agencies already \nengage in regulatory flexibility analysis to ensure that their \noversight does not needlessly overburden small businesses.\n  In contrast, the aim of the Snowe amendment is to impose additional \nhurdles to dramatically slow down the issuance of critically needed \nrules and, in many cases, stop the rulemaking process altogether. For \nexample, the Snowe amendment would require an analysis of ``indirect'' \nimpact on small businesses--``indirect'' impact, whatever that means. \nWell, let me cite perhaps an example.\n  Instead of the Mine Safety Health Administration spending its \nresources protecting our miners, the amendment could require the agency \nto determine whether a new mine safety standard indirectly harms, say, \na small paper company that supplies paper to the mine's corporate \noffices. This is a ridiculous waste of resources and time. So we do not \neven know what the ``indirect'' impact means. That could mean almost \nanything.\n  Likewise, the amendment would permit businesses to sue to block a \nrule even before it is finalized. In other words, businesses could seek \nto litigate a proposed rule. I often hear my Republican colleagues \nspeak against activist judges. I can think of few things more activist \nthan for unelected judges to review a rule even prior to the agency \nperforming the lengthy notice and comment process to finalize a rule. \nIt already takes years for agencies to promulgate health and safety \nrules. This amendment would exacerbate the problem and further clog up \nthe court system. Think about all the court cases that would be filed \njust on a proposed rule, before it even goes to the comment period, \nbefore it is even finalized.\n  Moreover, the bill requires an agency to review the impact of all--\nall--its current rules on small businesses to determine if a rule must \nbe modified, rescinded or continued unchanged. In other words, rather \nthan addressing new problems and implementing new acts of Congress, an \nagency would need to spend all its time reviewing past, settled \nregulations, some of which may have been in effect for the last 50 \nyears.\n  To its credit, the Obama administration already is conducting a \ncomprehensive, rigorous review of all rules in order to see which ones \nshould be repealed, modified or kept in place. We should let this \ncareful review take place before implementing severe constraints on \nagency rulemaking.\n  So the Snowe amendment would make government less responsive. It \nseeks to cripple the government's ability to make sensible lifesaving \nregulations.\n  Again, it ought to be titled the ``buyer beware'' amendment. If you \nlike living in that kind of a society, I suggest you go to some Third \nWorld country, where you do not know what you eat or what you drink or \nwhether the air you breathe and the water you consume is safe and \nhealthy. If that is the kind of America you want, you should support \nthe Snowe amendment. But if you want an America where our kids are safe \nfrom dangerous toys, where you know the food you eat is going to be \nsafe and the water you drink and the air you breathe, where you know \nthere are safety rules in place so you are not going to get unduly \ninjured or harmed at the workplace, if you believe this is the kind of \nAmerica that operates better and is more functionally productive than a \nbuyer beware kind of society, then I suggest you should oppose the \nSnowe amendment.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Snowe amendment as ill-\nadvised. Again, it is a part of a bill that has never gone through the \ncommittee hearing process. If nothing else, it ought to go through \ncommittee, have hearings, and let's see if it has any support at all \nout there before we bring it to the floor of the Senate. I urge my \ncolleagues to defeat the Snowe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, with all due respect, I plan to support \nthe amendment that has been addressed by my good friend from Iowa. \nHaving come from the small business world, I am fully aware of the cost \nof these things, and tomorrow I will be introducing an amendment that \nis going to address something different, but really something with \nhigher figures on it; that is, the cost of the EPA regulations.\n  This is something that is a little bit different than what my friend \nfrom Iowa has been talking about. When we stop and think about the \nregulatory things that are going on right now with the Clean Water Act \nand the Solid Waste Disposal Act--we are talking about greenhouse gas \nregulations, things that should be addressed by legislation but are \nnot, so they are trying to do it through regulation: boiler MACT, that \nis the maximum-achievable technology; utility MACT; ozone, actually the \nchanging of the ozone standards when they are not using--as the law \nrequires--the newer, updated information; and particulate matter and \ncoal ash and some of the rest.\n  But I am saving that for tomorrow. I am only saying that now because \nthere is a cost to overregulation. That is what I know my friend, \nSenator Snowe, is trying to get at. It is my understanding--correct me \nif I am wrong--that we are not trying to get recognized and move \ncurrent amendments aside. Is that correct now? I will not try to do \nthat.\n  However, I do want to mention that probably the most significant \nsingle amendment we are going to have on the EDA reauthorization bill \nwould be the one to take down the maximum amount from $500 million to \n$300 million. It is kind of interesting because this program in my \nState of Oklahoma has been very successful. Believe it, time and time \nagain, we have been able to do things, attract businesses and industry.\n  Down in a little town called Elgin, OK, adjacent to the Ft. Sill live \nrange, we have been able to put together something that is going to \nattract about a 150,000-square-foot building, all of that with a very \nsmall initial grant. So it has worked well.\n  I understand some of the critics of this program. In some areas maybe \nit has not worked that well, if it has. However, I have noticed this, \nand since some of this jurisdiction is in the committee of which I am \nthe ranking member, the Environment and Public Works Committee, it is \nimportant to look at these things.\n  In these difficult times, I think it is important not to authorize \nmore than we could anticipate would be very prudently appropriated. \nSince we have been authorizing $400 million in the past, and the total \namount is something less than $300 million, I am going to have an \namendment that would take down the existing limit on this, which is \n$500 million, down to $300 million. That will be amendment No. 430. It \nis already submitted.\n  Interestingly enough, while I do not agree with President Obama on \nmany things, he seems to agree on this, and I am going to read a \nstatement he made: ``The Administration supports\n\n[[Page S3605]]\n\nthe passage of S. 782.'' But down here it says:\n\n       However, the bill would authorize spending levels higher \n     than those requested by the President's budget, and the \n     administration believes that the need for smart investment to \n     help Americans win the future must be balanced with the need \n     to control spending and to reduce the deficit. The \n     administration looks forward to working with Congress in \n     reducing the limits of this bill.\n\n  So I am going to make it easy for the administration and introduce \nthis amendment No. 430. It is submitted right now. We are hoping to be \nable, at some point, to start setting aside and getting up these \namendments for votes. That is one of the major reasons, as one of the \nsponsors of this bill, we have a lot of things we need to be talking \nabout on the Senate floor.\n  We have done nothing around here. We have not done appropriations. We \nhave not done anything except a handful of noncontroversial judges--and \nsome controversial, I might add. But, nonetheless, we should be talking \nabout these things. There are a lot of things we want to get done, and \ncertainly this is one of them.\n  The other amendment, though, that is a little less understandable \nbecause it involves something that I throw in the category of being \njust not believable. We have a critter in Oklahoma and it is also \naround other parts of the country. It is called a Lesser Prairie \nChicken. Going all of the way back to my days in the State \nlegislature--I am talking about a long time ago, before a lot of you \nguys were born--people were concerned about the Lesser Prairie Chicken \nand were always trying to protect it. Yet our farmers and ranchers had \na problem with that because they burrow down and make holes and our \ncows and our horses will break legs and all of that kind of thing.\n  That has nothing to do with what is happening today except they are \ntalking about having that--right now it is actually a candidate for an \nendangered species, and the reason is because they are claiming that, \nof course, the population is dwindling. Well, it is not. The problem \nis, we have too many of them. This is kind of interesting. The State--\nfor those of you whose geography is not too good--immediately north of \nmy State of Oklahoma is Kansas. In Kansas they have a hunting season \nfor the Lesser Prairie Chicken, but you can go a mile south across the \nOklahoma border and it would be protected. It is ludicrous that they \nwould do that.\n  Here is another reason--a problem. First of all, federally mandated \nuses of alternative energy such as wind and all of that I think is \ninappropriate. We have all the resources we need in fossil fuels to run \nthis country. We have the resources, in terms of oil, gas, and coal. We \nhave enough to run this country for 100 years without being dependent \non the Middle East.\n  These are things we should be doing. Well, when you have these \nmandated percentages, that means you have to go into other forms of \nenergy where the technology is not quite there. Now, wind technology is \nthere, although a lot has to happen before it is going to be in a \ncompetitive match and not have to be subsidized. Nonetheless, Oklahoma \nhappens to be in the wind belt. You go through Oklahoma, you can see in \nnorthern Texas all the way through Oklahoma and southern Kansas, we are \nin the wind belt. The problem we have--I have airplanes. I have many \nvices; flying airplanes is one of them. So I am over the western part \nof Oklahoma almost every weekend.\n  When I take people who have not been there, they are amazed at the \nnumbers of windmills. At any one place out there you can see 200 or \n300. So it represents a huge investment. A lot of stakeholders are \ninvolved in it and they have said that certain things are going to \nhappen. But wait a minute. If they end up listing the Lesser Prairie \nChicken, that is going to all of a sudden put Fish and Wildlife in a \nposition where they can stop this wind energy that is taking place \nright now. The reason they can, and it will not be their fault--they \nwill say, well, it is a habitat. It is threatened because there are \ntowers, and predators are on these towers and looking down. Then they \nwould have to stop that from taking place.\n  They could conceivably have to take down millions of dollars' worth \nof investments that are there right now. So I have an amendment to this \nbill that is going to preclude them from being able to list it.\n  By the way, I have had a visit with the candidate who has been \nnominated to be Director of Fish and Wildlife, Dan Ashe. I had him, \nalong with Secretary Ken Salazar, Secretary of the Interior, in my \noffice. We talked at some length about some of these things, and he has \nmade a commitment to come out to Oklahoma and to see what a hardship \nthis would be.\n  So I think it would be an excellent idea to find some vehicle--and \nthis vehicle seems to be the one that is being used right now to put \nsuch legislation on--that would preclude them from listing the Lesser \nPrairie Chicken.\n  The private investment in Oklahoma wind power is, of course--we are \none of the top States--we are at No. 13 of all 50 States in terms of \nwind. It could be significantly curtailed. State Senator Bryce Marlatt \nin Oklahoma noted that it was already a $300 million investment just in \nthe last 3 years. So we want to protect this investment.\n\n  We have OG, Oklahoma Gas and Electric, recently announcing the \nconstruction of a high-power line from Oklahoma City to Woodward. \nWoodward is kind of the mouth of the Panhandle. Then, eventually going \ninto Guymon, all the way through what used to be called no man's land \nin the Panhandle of Oklahoma. These would be multimillion-dollar \ninvestments that could be severely challenged by the listing of the \nLesser Prairie Chicken.\n  So I will be offering that amendment. I already submitted the \namendment and would look forward to explaining that further as the time \ncomes.\n  In the meanwhile, tomorrow I do want to get into the cost of the \nregulation. If we are really sincere in this country right now about \ndoing something to promote business and industry, the first thing we \nneed to do is get the bureaucrats off the backs of the businesses out \nthere that are planning to expand and those that are in existence \ntoday. So we will be addressing that tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Frankie Freeman\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, Missouri is full of amazing Americans. \nAt the very top of this list is my friend, Frankie Muse Freeman. She \nhas been selected to receive the extraordinary honor called the \nSpingarn Medal, the NAACP's highest national honor.\n  Each year, the NAACP selects only one person in this country to \nreceive the prestigious Spingarn Medal in recognition of particularly \noutstanding achievement.\n  We in Missouri are so proud of Ms. Freeman for her many \naccomplishments, including receiving this most distinguished award. \nWhile I am honored to come to the floor and congratulate Frankie \nFreeman, I regret that I will not be able to be in St. Louis, at the \nSt. Louis City and County Freedom Fund Dinner to deliver these remarks \nand celebrate this great woman and her many admirers and supporters in \nthe St. Louis area.\n  Frankie Freeman is an amazing story. She is 94 years old and still \nhas the passion to serve her community. At age 16, Ms. Freeman enrolled \nin her mother's alma mater, Hampton Institute. In 1947, before the \nPresiding Officer or I were ever born, she earned a law degree from \nHoward University Law School. During that time period, as one might \nimagine, there really were not law firms that hired either women or \nAfrican Americans, much less an African-American woman.\n  So what did Frankie Freeman do? She decided to open her own law firm. \nShe began her practice with divorce and criminal cases and with a huge \ndose of pro bono cases. After 2 years she became legal counsel to the \nNAACP legal team that filed suit against the St. Louis Board of \nEducation in 1949. In 1954, Freeman was the lead attorney for the \nlandmark case, Davis v. St. Louis Housing Authority, which ended legal \nracial discrimination in public housing in St. Louis.\n  In the almost 60 years since that decision, Ms. Freeman has \ntirelessly fought for civil rights at home in St. Louis and across the \nNation. She has endured abuse and discrimination, but through it all \nshe worked with intellect and dignity while employing one of her very \nbest weapons, a warm and friendly personality and a very quick smile.\n\n[[Page S3606]]\n\n  In 1964 President Lyndon Johnson appointed her to serve as the first \nwoman on the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. She continued to serve on \nthe Commission under Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Carter.\n  Recognizing that there was still much work to do to end \ndiscrimination, Ms. Freeman joined with others to help form the \nbipartisan Citizens Commission on Civil Rights. Frankie Freeman's work \nhas earned her many awards. She holds honorary degrees from multiple \nuniversities, including Hampton University, the University of Missouri, \nSt. Louis University, Washington University, and Howard University. Now \nshe has been inducted into the National Bar Association's Hall of Fame.\n  Despite this long history of accomplishments, Frankie Freeman still \nknows what is important--serving the community she loves.\n  At age 94, she remains active in her local community by volunteering \nat her church. Throughout her career, she has served on several local \nboards, including the National Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis \nand the United Way of Greater St. Louis. Along the way, she also found \ntime to write a book about her life, which I highly recommend to anyone \nfor an inspiring story, a uniquely American story of a woman who had a \nvision at a time when women who looked like her weren't supposed to \nhave a vision.\n  Ms. Freeman will become the 96th recipient of the Spingarn Medal this \nJuly when she is honored during the NAACP national convention in Los \nAngeles. Past Spingarn medalists include Maya Angelou, W.E.B. Du Bois, \nand Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. This impressive list of exceptional \nAmericans whose company Attorney Freeman will now join gives you a \nsense of the caliber of person Attorney Freeman is.\n  There is no doubt that attorney Frankie Freeman is deserving of this \ndistinction. I am so proud of her for being honored with this \nrecognition of her lifelong dedication to justice and civil rights. She \nis such an inspiration to me, and she has been an inspiration to \nthousands of young people during her life, an inspiration to so many \nAmericans, regardless of race, an inspiration for what she stands for \nand what she has accomplished in her lifetime. I am so grateful to call \nher my friend, and I thank her for all she has done for the people of \nSt. Louis, the people of Missouri, and the people of this great Nation. \nCongratulations and thank you, Frankie Freeman.\n  Mr. President, I will spend a few moments talking about the Economic \nDevelopment Administration. There are lots of times we debate \nlegislation on the floor, and we do it in almost an academic way. We \nthink of the proposals in the abstract. Unfortunately, there are many \ntimes we don't think about the real consequences of legislation. This \nyear, at this time, this legislation feels very consequential to me. It \nfeels very consequential because of what my State has gone through.\n  The Economic Development Administration plays a substantial role in \nmaking Federal resources available to assist communities that are \naffected by disasters to rebuild and recover.\n  As my colleagues in this Chamber are well aware, the first half of \nthis year has been devastating to my State. Since the start of the \nyear, 28 States have suffered at least one federally declared major \ndisaster.\n  Missouri has been particularly hard hit, starting with the severe \nstorms on New Year's Eve. We also had severe flooding along the \nMississippi River, multiple tornadoes, including one that struck and \ncaused severe damage to St. Louis and, obviously, the historic tornado \nthat has, in fact, done such damage to the community of Joplin. We are \nalso expecting additional extensive flooding along the Missouri River \nin northwest Missouri. Many families there are steeling for the worst \nas we wait for the waters to arrive.\n  When disaster strikes, the Federal Government steps in, as it should, \nto support the efforts of State and local government, nonprofit groups, \nand the faith community to help communities recover and rebuild.\n  In Missouri, EDA works with all 19 regional planning commissions in a \ncollaborative role to help carry out projects deemed important by local \nelected officials and community leaders, particularly in the event of a \nnatural disaster.\n  The Economic Development Administration's explicit mission includes \nthe assistance of regions ``experiencing sudden and severe economic \ndislocations, such as those resulting from natural disasters.''\n  I just visited with people from a radio station in Joplin. The man I \nvisited there was on the air for 23 straight hours. This radio station \nturned out to be one of the few methods of communication that everybody \ncould rely on in the immediate hours after the tragedy struck. Eight of \nthe twenty-eight employees who work at that radio station lost their \nhomes, including the man who was on the air for 23 straight hours. \nThere has been severe dislocation that has occurred in Joplin, MO. Two \nthousand homes were wiped away, clean gone. Another 6,000 structures, \nincluding homes and businesses, were severely damaged and are \nuninhabitable. There are thousands and thousands and thousands of \npeople in Joplin, MO, who woke up that Monday morning--in fact, hadn't \nbeen to sleep the night before because they were busy huddling in \nrubble or were camped out at a relative's home because they had no \nplace to go.\n  In the past few years alone, EDA has provided similar assistance in \nKansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Nebraska, and North Dakota after disasters \nhit communities in those States. EDA has already stepped up in Joplin \nand established a $3 million revolving fund to assist small businesses \nin the area, so that people have a place they can go back to, in terms \nof their work, after this kind of disaster.\n  We have a long history in this country of rolling up our sleeves and \nworking together in difficult times. The Federal Government has always \nbeen a partner in those efforts, providing financial and technical \nsupport. The Economic Development Administration has been part of this \nsupport. It is my hope the EDA will continue to provide this invaluable \nservice.\n  That is why this legislation is more important than words on a page. \nIt could make the difference between someone being able to stay in the \ncommunity, being able to go back to work, being able to put the pieces \nback together after a tragic loss. I hope my colleagues take this \nseriously and move quickly and promptly to support this legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am here to talk about the legislation \nthat is before us--that has been before the Senate today and likely to \nbe before the Senate tomorrow--on economic development but specifically \nto talk about the interest of promoting economic development and job \ncreation.\n  A couple of amendments I plan to offer will help give American \nemployers some relief from regulatory mandates that are stifling \neconomic growth and job creation.\n  I hear all the time in Ohio--I am sure my colleagues hear it in their \nStates--employers saying: We would like to expand and begin hiring \nagain, but one of the concerns is that there is regulation that affects \nus. Almost every business I meet in Ohio--and I was in Ohio last week \nmeeting with businesses in the area of energy, both companies that \nproduce energy and companies that use a lot of energy, including \nchemical companies and steel companies in Ohio--have stories about some \nof the regulatory burdens that are making it more difficult to get jobs \nback and to get our economy back on track. By all accounts, the \nregulatory burden on employers is growing. A recent study commissioned \nby the Small Business Administration estimates that the annual toll, \nnow, of Federal regulations on the American economy has reached $1.75 \ntrillion. By the way, $1.75 trillion is more than the IRS collects in \nFederal income taxes.\n\n  With the unemployment rate now at 9.1 percent and the unfortunate \nnews we heard about last month's job numbers, it should be a wake-up \ncall to us to focus on economic development--\n\n[[Page S3607]]\n\nspecifically, how do we get businesses to do more in terms of hiring, \nspend less on redtape, less on bureaucracy, and reduce the regulatory \nburden in smart ways?\n  The current administration has said some of the right things but \nactually moved in the wrong direction. We have seen a sharp increase in \nthe last couple of years in what are deemed to be major economically \nsignificant rules. That is defined as regulations that impose a cost on \nthe economy of $100 million or more.\n  According to the administration's Office of Management and Budget, \nthe current administration has been regulating at a pace of 84 major \nrules per year. By way of comparison, that is about a 50-percent \nincrease over the regulatory output during the Clinton administration, \nwhich had about 56 rules per year, and an increase from the Bush \nadministration as well. So we have seen more regulations and more \nsignificant regulations.\n  I was encouraged to hear President Obama's words when he talked about \nthe Executive order in January, which is entitled ``Improving \nRegulation and Regulatory Review.'' But now we need to see action. We \nneed to see it from the administration, from individual agencies to \nprovide real regulatory relief for job creators to be able to reduce \nthis drag on the economy.\n  One commonsense step we can take is to strengthen what is called the \nUnfunded Mandates Relief Act. It was passed in 1995. It was bipartisan. \nI was a cosponsor in the House of Representatives. It is an effort to \nrequire Federal regulators to evaluate the cost of rules, to look at \nthe benefits and the costs, and to look at less costly alternatives on \nrules.\n  The two amendments I would like to offer over the next few days as we \nconsider the legislation before us would improve this Unfunded Mandates \nReform Act, and it would reform it in ways that are entirely consistent \nwith the principle President Obama has laid out and committed to in his \nExecutive order on regulatory review.\n  The first amendment would require agencies specifically to assess \npotential effects of new regulations on job creation--so focusing in on \njobs--and to consider market-based and nongovernmental alternatives to \nregulation. This would broaden the scope of the Unfunded Mandates \nRelief Act to require cost-benefit analysis of rules that impose direct \nor indirect costs of $100 million a year or more. So, again, this is \nfor major rules of $100 million or more. It would also require agencies \nto adopt the least costly or least burdensome option that achieves \nwhatever policy goals have been set out by Congress. It seems to me it \nis a commonsense amendment. I hope we will get bipartisan support for \nit.\n  The second amendment would extend the Unfunded Mandates Relief Act to \nso-called independent agencies which today are actually exempt from the \ncost-benefit rules that govern all other agencies. In 1995, we had this \ndebate and determined at that time we would not extend the legislation \nto independent agencies. In the interim, independent agencies have been \nproviding more and more rules, have put out more and more regulations, \nand are having a bigger and bigger impact. An example of an independent \nagency would be the SEC, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the \nCFTC, which is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. These are \nagencies that, although independent in the executive branch, are very \nmuch involved in putting out major rules and regulations. It is \nsometimes called the ``headless fourth branch'' of government because \ntheir rules are not reviewed for cost-benefit analysis, even by the \nOMB, the Office of Management and Budget, in its Office of Information \nand Regulatory Affairs, so-called OIRA.\n  We have looked at some GAO data and put together various studies, and \nit appears to us that there are about 200 regulations that were issued \nbetween 1996 until today that would be deemed to have an impact of $100 \nmillion or more on the economy but were automatically excluded from the \nUnfunded Mandates Relief Act because they were deemed to be from \nindependent agencies.\n  So it is basically closing a loophole and closing this independent \nagency loophole, which I believe is a sensible reform. It has been \nendorsed by many people, including, interestingly, the current OIRA \nAdministrator and the President's regulatory czar, Cass Sunstein, who, \nin a 2002 Law Review article, talked about the fact that this is an \narea where UMRA ought to be extended because, again, there were so many \nindependent agencies that were putting out regulations impacting job \ncreation in this country.\n  No regulation, whatever its source, should be imposed on American \nemployers or on State and local governments without serious \nconsideration of the costs, the benefits, and the availability of a \nleast-burdensome alternative. Both these amendments would move us \nfurther toward that sensible goal, and I hope the leadership will allow \nthese amendments to be offered. I think they fit well with the \nunderlying legislation. If they are offered, I certainly urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support them.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

GIVAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \ndistinguished Kentuckian who has worked tirelessly on behalf of our \nNation's soldiers, sailors and marines for more than 40 years. Louis E. \nGivan, a lifelong resident of my hometown of Louisville, has played a \nvital role in protecting the men and women of our Armed Forces and our \ncountry's defense.\n  Formerly a sailor himself in the U.S. Navy, he has served for the \nlast 11 years as the general manager of Raytheon Missile Systems \noperations in Louisville. I was saddened to hear of his retirement from \nthat position this coming July 5. He will certainly be missed.\n  Mr. Givan--or, to those who know him, Ed--was a 1966 graduate of St. \nXavier High School in Louisville and in 1970 earned his bachelor of \nscience degree in mechanical engineering from the J.B. Speed School of \nEngineering at the University of Louisville. In 1968, he began working \nat the Naval Ordnance Station in Louisville, and he stayed at that post \nuntil 1996, in various engineering and supervisory positions.\n  In 1996 the Naval Ordnance Station transitioned to private ownership, \nand Ed's leadership was crucial in making that transition a successful \none. The facility eventually became part of Raytheon Missile Systems, \nand Ed was appointed general manager in 2000. As general manager, Ed \nhas led Raytheon Missile Systems in Louisville to great success, \nsuccess for both the company and for the local community. They design, \ndevelop, and produce vital weapons systems for our armed forces, \nenabling America to have the most formidable military force in the \nworld. Weapons produced at the Louisville facility are used by our \nforces in all parts of the globe, including in Iraq.\n  Kentucky is lucky to have benefitted from Ed's dedication, commitment \nto excellence, and leadership for so many years. I am sure his wife \nVelma; his sons Eddie, Tony, and Chris; and his grandchildren Benjamin, \nNathan, Isaac, Macy and Natalie are all very proud of what Ed has \naccomplished. I wish him the very best in retirement, and I am sure my \ncolleagues join me in saying that this U.S. Senate thanks Mr. Louis E. \n``Ed'' Givan for his faithful service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/08/senate-section/article/S3607-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3607-S3609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3608]]\n\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2011.\n     Hon. Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Holder: I am writing about the \n     Justice Department's implementation of the Crime Victims' \n     Rights Act--an act that I co-sponsored in 2004. These \n     questions relate to an Office of Legal Counsel (``OLC'') \n     Opinion made public on May 20, 2011 and more broadly to \n     concerns I have heard from crime victims' advocates that the \n     Department has been thwarting effective implementation of the \n     Act by failing to extend the Act to the investigative phases \n     of criminal cases and by preventing effective appellate \n     enforcement of victims' rights. I am writing to ask you to \n     answer these questions and explain the Department's actions \n     in these areas.\n\n\n  Government Protection of Victims' Rights During Investigation of a \n                                 Crime\n\n       When Congress enacted the CVRA, it intended to protect \n     crime victims throughout the criminal justice process--from \n     the investigative phases to the final conclusion of a case. \n     Congress could not have been clearer in its direction that \n     using ``best efforts'' to enforce the CVRA was an obligation \n     of ``[o]fficers and employees of the Department of Justice \n     and other departments and agencies of the United States \n     engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of \n     crime . . . .'' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771(c)(1) (emphasis added). \n     Congress also permitted crime victims to assert their rights \n     either in the court in which formal charges had already been \n     filed ``or, if no prosecution is underway, in the district \n     court in the district in which the crime occurred.'' 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3771(d)(3) (emphasis added).\n       Despite Congress' clear intention to extend rights to crime \n     victims throughout the process, the Justice Department is \n     reading the CVRA much more narrowly. In the recent OLC \n     opinion, for example, the Department takes the position that \n     ``the CVRA is best read as providing that the rights \n     identified in section 3771(a) are guaranteed from the time \n     that criminal proceedings are initiated (by complaint, \n     information, or indictment) and cease to be available if all \n     charges are dismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or \n     if the Government declines to bring formal charges after the \n     filing of a complaint).'' The Availability of Crime Victims' \n     Rights Under the Crime Victims' Rights Act of 2004, \n     Memorandum from John E. Bies (Dec. 17, 2010, publicly \n     released May 20, 2011) (hereinafter ``OLC Opinion''). Indeed, \n     in that same opinion, I am surprised to see the Department \n     citing a snippet from my floor remarks during the passage of \n     the CVRA for the proposition that crime victims can confer \n     with prosecutors only after the formal filing of charges. See \n     id. at 9 (citing 150 Cong. Rec. S4260, S4268 (Apr. 22, 2004) \n     (statement of Sen. Kyl).\n       I did want to express my surprise that your prosecutors are \n     so clearly quoting my remarks out of context. Here is the \n     full passage of my remarks, which were part of a colloquy \n     with my co-sponsor on the CVRA, Senator Feinstein:\n\n       Senator Feinstein: Section . . . (a)(5) provides a right to \n     confer with the attorney for the Government in the case. This \n     right is intended to be expansive. For example, the victim \n     has the right to confer with the Government concerning any \n     critical stage or disposition of the case. The right, \n     however, is not limited to these examples. I ask the Senator \n     if he concurs in this intent.\n       Senator Kyl: Yes. The intent of this section is just as the \n     Senator says. This right to confer does not give the crime \n     victim any right to direct the prosecution. Prosecutors \n     should consider it part of their profession to be available \n     to consult with crime victims about concerns the victims may \n     have which are pertinent to the case, case proceedings or \n     dispositions. Under this provision, victims are able to \n     confer with the Government's attorney about proceedings after \n     charging.\n\n     150 Cong. Rec. S4260, S4268 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statements of \n     Sens. Feinstein & Kyl) (emphases added). Read in context, it \n     is obvious that the main point of my remarks was that a \n     victim's right to confer was ``intended to be expansive.'' \n     Senator Feinstein and I then gave various examples of \n     situations in which victims could confer with prosecutors, \n     with the note that the right to confer was ``not limited to \n     these examples.'' It is therefore troubling to me that in \n     this opinion the Justice Department is quoting only a limited \n     portion of my remarks and wrenching them out of context to \n     suggest that I think that crime victims do not have any right \n     to confer (or to be treated with fairness) until after \n     charging.\n       In giving an example that the victims would have such \n     rights after charging, I was not suggesting that they had no \n     such right earlier in the process. Elsewhere in my remarks I \n     made clear that crime victims had rights under the CVRA even \n     before an indictment is filed. For example, in the passage \n     quoted above, I made clear that crime victims had a right to \n     consult about both ``the case'' and ``case proceedings''--\n     i.e., both about how the case was being handled before being \n     filed in court and then later how the case was being handled \n     in court ``proceedings.'' As another example, Senator \n     Feinstein and I explained that we had drafted the CVRA to \n     extend a right to victims to attend only ``public'' \n     proceedings, because otherwise the rights would extend to \n     grand jury proceedings. See, e.g., 150 Cong. Rec. S4260, \n     S4268 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statements of Sens. Feinstein & Kyl). \n     Of course, no such limitation would have been necessary under \n     the CVRA if CVRA rights attach (as the Department seems to \n     think) only after the filing of a grand jury indictment.\n       Courts have already rejected the Justice Department's \n     position that the CVRA applies only after an indictment is \n     filed. For example, in In re Dean, 527 F.3d 391 (5th Cir. \n     2008), the Department took the position that crime victims \n     had no right to confer with prosecutors until after the \n     Department had reached and signed a plea agreement with a \n     corporation (BP Products North America) whose illegal actions \n     had resulted in the deaths of fifteen workers in an oil \n     refinery explosion. Of course, this position meant that \n     the victims could have no role in shaping any plea deal \n     that the Department reached. In rejecting the Department's \n     position, the Fifth Circuit held that ``the government \n     should have fashioned a reasonable way to inform the \n     victims of the likelihood of criminal charges and to \n     ascertain the victims' views on the possible details of a \n     plea bargain.'' Id. at 394.\n       In spite of this binding decision from the Fifth Circuit, \n     crime victims' advocates have reported to me that the Justice \n     Department is still proceeding in the Fifth Circuit and \n     elsewhere on the assumption that it has no obligations to \n     treat victims fairly or to confer with them until after \n     charges are formally filed. Given the Fifth Circuit's Dean \n     decision, this position appears to place the Department in \n     violation of a binding court ruling that extends rights to \n     thousands of crime victims in Louisiana, Mississippi, and \n     Texas. And more generally, the Department's position simply \n     has no grounding in the clear language of the CVRA.\n       My first question: What is the Justice Department doing to \n     extend to victims their right to fair treatment and their \n     right to confer with prosecutors when the Justice Department \n     is negotiating pre-indictment plea agreements and non-\n     prosecution agreements with defense attorneys, including \n     negotiations within the Fifth Circuit?\n\n\n              Crime Victims' Right to Appellate Protection\n\n       Protection of crime victims' rights in appellate courts is \n     an important part of the CVRA. As you know, when Congress \n     passed the CVRA, the federal courts of appeals had recognized \n     that crime victims could take ordinary appeals to protect \n     their rights. See, e.g., Doe v. United States, 666 F.2d 43, \n     46 (4th Cir. 1981) (rape victim allowed to appeal district \n     court's adverse ``rape shield statute'' ruling); United \n     States v. Kones, 77 F.3d 66 (3rd Cir. 1996) (victim allowed \n     to appeal adverse restitution decision). Congress sought to \n     leave these protections in place, while expanding them to \n     ensure that crime victims could obtain quick vindication of \n     their rights in appellate courts by providing--in \n     Sec. 3771(d)(3)--that ``[i]f the district court denies the \n     relief sought, the [victim] may petition the court of appeals \n     for a writ of mandamus.'' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771(d)(3). \n     Ordinarily, whether mandamus relief should issue is \n     discretionary. The plain language of the CVRA, however, \n     specifically and clearly overruled such discretionary \n     mandamus standards by directing that ``[t]he court of appeals \n     shall take up and decide such application forthwith . . . .'' \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771(d)(3) (emphasis added). As I explained \n     when the Senate considered the CVRA:\n\n       [W]hile mandamus is generally discretionary, this provision \n     [18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771(d)(3)] means that courts must review \n     these cases. Appellate review of denials of victims' rights \n     is just as important as the initial assertion of a victim's \n     right. This provision ensures review and encourages courts to \n     broadly defend the victims' rights.\n\n     150 Cong. Rec. S4270 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl) \n     (emphases added). Similarly, the CVRA's co-sponsor with me, \n     Senator Feinstein, stated that the Act would create ``a new \n     use of a very old procedure, the writ of mandamus. This \n     provision will establish a procedure where a crime victim \n     can, in essence, immediately appeal a denial of their rights \n     by a trial court to the court of appeals.'' 150 Cong. Rec. \n     S4262 (statement of Sen. Feinstein) (emphases added); see \n     also id. (statement of Sen. Kyl) (crime victims must ``be \n     able to have . . . the appellate courts take the appeal and \n     order relief). In short, the legislative history shows that \n     Sec. 3771(d)(3) was intended to allow crime victims to take \n     accelerated appeals from district court decisions denying \n     their rights and have their appeals reviewed under ordinary \n     standards of appellate review.\n       In spite of that unequivocal legislative history, the \n     Justice Department has in past cases asserted a contrary \n     position. In In re Antrobus, 519 F.3d 1123 (10th Cir. 2008), \n     Ken and Sue Antrobus sought to obtain appellate review of a \n     ruling by a trial court that they could not deliver a victim \n     impact statement at the sentencing of the man who sold the \n     murder weapon used to kill their daughter. The Tenth Circuit \n     ruled against them on the basis that the Antrobuses were not \n     entitled to regular appellate review, but only discretionary \n     mandamus review. See id. at 1124-25. The Tenth Circuit did \n     not consider the legislative history in reaching this \n     conclusion, leading the Antrobuses to file petitions for \n     rehearing and rehearing en banc--petitions that recounted \n     this legislative history. In response, the Justice Department \n     asked the Tenth Circuit to deny the victims' petitions. \n     Remarkably, the Justice Department told the Tenth Circuit \n     that it could ignore the\n\n[[Page S3609]]\n\n     legislative history because the CVRA ``is unambiguous.'' \n     Response of the United States, In re Antrobus, No. 08-4002, \n     at 12 n.7 (10th Cir. Feb. 12, 2008).\n       At the time that the Justice Department filed this brief, \n     no Court of Appeals agreed with the Tenth Circuit. At the \n     time, three other Circuits had all issued unanimous rulings \n     that crime victims were entitled to regular appellate review. \n     See In re W.R. Huff Asset Mgmt. Co., 409 F.3d 555, 562 (2d \n     Cir. 2005); Kenna v. US. Dist. Ct. for the Cent. Dist. of \n     Ca., 435 F.3d 1011, 1017 (9th Cir. 2006); In re Walsh, 229 \n     Fed.Appx. 58, at 60 (3rd Cir. 2007).\n       My next question for you is, given that the Justice \n     Department has an obligation to use its ``best efforts,'' 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3771(c)(1), to afford crime victims their rights, \n     how could the Department argue in Antrobus (and later cases) \n     that the CVRA ``unambiguously'' denied crime victims regular \n     appellate protections of their rights when three circuits had \n     reached the opposite conclusion?\n\n\n      Government's Right to Assert Error Denial of Victims' Rights\n\n       To further bolster protection of crime victims' rights, \n     Congress also included an additional provision in the CVRA--\n     Sec. 3771(d)(4)--allowing the Justice Department to obtain \n     review of crime victims' rights issues in appeals filed by \n     defendants: ``In any appeal in a criminal case, the \n     Government may assert as error the district court's denial of \n     any crime victim's right in the proceeding to which the \n     appeal relates.'' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771(d)(4). The intent \n     underlying this provision was to supplement the crime \n     victims' appeal provision found in Sec. 3771(d)(3) by \n     permitting the Department to also help develop a body of case \n     law expanding crime victims' rights in the many defense \n     appeals that are filed. It was not intended to in any way \n     narrow crime victims' rights to seek relief under \n     Sec. 3771(d)(3). Nor was it intended to bar crime victims \n     from asserting other remedies. For instance, it was not \n     intended to block crime victims from taking an ordinary \n     appeal from an adverse decision affecting their rights (such \n     as a decision denying restitution) under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291. \n     Crime victims had been allowed to take such appeals in \n     various circuits even before the passage of the CVRA. See, \n     e.g., United States v. Kones, 77 F.3d 66 (3rd Cir. 1996) \n     (crime victim allowed to appeal restitution ruling); United \n     States v. Perry, 360 F.3d 519 (6th Cir. 2004) (crime victims \n     allowed to appeal restitution lien issue); Doe v. United \n     States, 666 F.2d 43, 46 (4th Cir. 1981) (crime victim allowed \n     to appeal rape shield ruling).\n       As I explained at the time the CVRA was under \n     consideration, this provision supplemented those pre-existing \n     decisions by ``allow[ing] the Government to assert a victim's \n     right on appeal even when it is the defendant who seeks \n     appeal of his or her conviction. This ensures that victims' \n     rights are protected throughout the criminal justice process \n     and that they do not fall by the wayside during what can \n     often be an extended appeal that the victim is not a party \n     to.'' 150 Cong. Rec. S4270 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. \n     Kyl).\n       I have heard from crime victims' advocates that the \n     Department has not been actively enforcing this provision. \n     Indeed, these advocates tell me that they are unaware of even \n     a single case where the Department has used this supplemental \n     remedy. My final question: Is it true that the Department has \n     never used this provision in even a single case in the more \n     than six years since the CVRA was enacted?\n           Sincerely,\n                                                          Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/08/senate-section/article/S3607-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3607-S3609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CRIME VICTIMS' RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S3608]]\n\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2011.\n     Hon. Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Holder: I am writing about the \n     Justice Department's implementation of the Crime Victims' \n     Rights Act--an act that I co-sponsored in 2004. These \n     questions relate to an Office of Legal Counsel (``OLC'') \n     Opinion made public on May 20, 2011 and more broadly to \n     concerns I have heard from crime victims' advocates that the \n     Department has been thwarting effective implementation of the \n     Act by failing to extend the Act to the investigative phases \n     of criminal cases and by preventing effective appellate \n     enforcement of victims' rights. I am writing to ask you to \n     answer these questions and explain the Department's actions \n     in these areas.\n\n\n  Government Protection of Victims' Rights During Investigation of a \n                                 Crime\n\n       When Congress enacted the CVRA, it intended to protect \n     crime victims throughout the criminal justice process--from \n     the investigative phases to the final conclusion of a case. \n     Congress could not have been clearer in its direction that \n     using ``best efforts'' to enforce the CVRA was an obligation \n     of ``[o]fficers and employees of the Department of Justice \n     and other departments and agencies of the United States \n     engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of \n     crime . . . .'' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771(c)(1) (emphasis added). \n     Congress also permitted crime victims to assert their rights \n     either in the court in which formal charges had already been \n     filed ``or, if no prosecution is underway, in the district \n     court in the district in which the crime occurred.'' 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 3771(d)(3) (emphasis added).\n       Despite Congress' clear intention to extend rights to crime \n     victims throughout the process, the Justice Department is \n     reading the CVRA much more narrowly. In the recent OLC \n     opinion, for example, the Department takes the position that \n     ``the CVRA is best read as providing that the rights \n     identified in section 3771(a) are guaranteed from the time \n     that criminal proceedings are initiated (by complaint, \n     information, or indictment) and cease to be available if all \n     charges are dismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or \n     if the Government declines to bring formal charges after the \n     filing of a complaint).'' The Availability of Crime Victims' \n     Rights Under the Crime Victims' Rights Act of 2004, \n     Memorandum from John E. Bies (Dec. 17, 2010, publicly \n     released May 20, 2011) (hereinafter ``OLC Opinion''). Indeed, \n     in that same opinion, I am surprised to see the Department \n     citing a snippet from my floor remarks during the passage of \n     the CVRA for the proposition that crime victims can confer \n     with prosecutors only after the formal filing of charges. See \n     id. at 9 (citing 150 Cong. Rec. S4260, S4268 (Apr. 22, 2004) \n     (statement of Sen. Kyl).\n       I did want to express my surprise that your prosecutors are \n     so clearly quoting my remarks out of context. Here is the \n     full passage of my remarks, which were part of a colloquy \n     with my co-sponsor on the CVRA, Senator Feinstein:\n\n       Senator Feinstein: Section . . . (a)(5) provides a right to \n     confer with the attorney for the Government in the case. This \n     right is intended to be expansive. For example, the victim \n     has the right to confer with the Government concerning any \n     critical stage or disposition of the case. The right, \n     however, is not limited to these examples. I ask the Senator \n     if he concurs in this intent.\n       Senator Kyl: Yes. The intent of this section is just as the \n     Senator says. This right to confer does not give the crime \n     victim any right to direct the prosecution. Prosecutors \n     should consider it part of their profession to be available \n     to consult with crime victims about concerns the victims may \n     have which are pertinent to the case, case proceedings or \n     dispositions. Under this provision, victims are able to \n     confer with the Government's attorney about proceedings after \n     charging.\n\n     150 Cong. Rec. S4260, S4268 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statements of \n     Sens. Feinstein & Kyl) (emphases added). Read in context, it \n     is obvious that the main point of my remarks was that a \n     victim's right to confer was ``intended to be expansive.'' \n     Senator Feinstein and I then gave various examples of \n     situations in which victims could confer with prosecutors, \n     with the note that the right to confer was ``not limited to \n     these examples.'' It is therefore troubling to me that in \n     this opinion the Justice Department is quoting only a limited \n     portion of my remarks and wrenching them out of context to \n     suggest that I think that crime victims do not have any right \n     to confer (or to be treated with fairness) until after \n     charging.\n       In giving an example that the victims would have such \n     rights after charging, I was not suggesting that they had no \n     such right earlier in the process. Elsewhere in my remarks I \n     made clear that crime victims had rights under the CVRA even \n     before an indictment is filed. For example, in the passage \n     quoted above, I made clear that crime victims had a right to \n     consult about both ``the case'' and ``case proceedings''--\n     i.e., both about how the case was being handled before being \n     filed in court and then later how the case was being handled \n     in court ``proceedings.'' As another example, Senator \n     Feinstein and I explained that we had drafted the CVRA to \n     extend a right to victims to attend only ``public'' \n     proceedings, because otherwise the rights would extend to \n     grand jury proceedings. See, e.g., 150 Cong. Rec. S4260, \n     S4268 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statements of Sens. Feinstein & Kyl). \n     Of course, no such limitation would have been necessary under \n     the CVRA if CVRA rights attach (as the Department seems to \n     think) only after the filing of a grand jury indictment.\n       Courts have already rejected the Justice Department's \n     position that the CVRA applies only after an indictment is \n     filed. For example, in In re Dean, 527 F.3d 391 (5th Cir. \n     2008), the Department took the position that crime victims \n     had no right to confer with prosecutors until after the \n     Department had reached and signed a plea agreement with a \n     corporation (BP Products North America) whose illegal actions \n     had resulted in the deaths of fifteen workers in an oil \n     refinery explosion. Of course, this position meant that \n     the victims could have no role in shaping any plea deal \n     that the Department reached. In rejecting the Department's \n     position, the Fifth Circuit held that ``the government \n     should have fashioned a reasonable way to inform the \n     victims of the likelihood of criminal charges and to \n     ascertain the victims' views on the possible details of a \n     plea bargain.'' Id. at 394.\n       In spite of this binding decision from the Fifth Circuit, \n     crime victims' advocates have reported to me that the Justice \n     Department is still proceeding in the Fifth Circuit and \n     elsewhere on the assumption that it has no obligations to \n     treat victims fairly or to confer with them until after \n     charges are formally filed. Given the Fifth Circuit's Dean \n     decision, this position appears to place the Department in \n     violation of a binding court ruling that extends rights to \n     thousands of crime victims in Louisiana, Mississippi, and \n     Texas. And more generally, the Department's position simply \n     has no grounding in the clear language of the CVRA.\n       My first question: What is the Justice Department doing to \n     extend to victims their right to fair treatment and their \n     right to confer with prosecutors when the Justice Department \n     is negotiating pre-indictment plea agreements and non-\n     prosecution agreements with defense attorneys, including \n     negotiations within the Fifth Circuit?\n\n\n              Crime Victims' Right to Appellate Protection\n\n       Protection of crime victims' rights in appellate courts is \n     an important part of the CVRA.

Kones, 77 F.3d 66 (3rd Cir. 1996) (victim allowed \n     to appeal adverse restitution decision). Congress sought to \n     leave these protections in place, while expanding them to \n     ensure that crime victims could obtain quick vindication of \n     their rights in appellate courts by providing--in \n     Sec. 3771(d)(3)--that ``[i]f the district court denies the \n     relief sought, the [victim] may petition the court of appeals \n     for a writ of mandamus.'' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771(d)(3). \n     Ordinarily, whether mandamus relief should issue is \n     discretionary.

Sec. 3771(c)(1), to afford crime victims their rights, \n     how could the Department argue in Antrobus (and later cases) \n     that the CVRA ``unambiguously'' denied crime victims regular \n     appellate protections of their rights when three circuits had \n     reached the opposite conclusion?\n\n\n      Government's Right to Assert Error Denial of Victims' Rights\n\n       To further bolster protection of crime victims' rights, \n     Congress also included an additional provision in the CVRA--\n     Sec. 3771(d)(4)--allowing the Justice Department to obtain \n     review of crime victims' rights issues in appeals filed by \n     defendants: ``In any appeal in a criminal case, the \n     Government may assert as error the district court's denial of \n     any crime victim's right in the proceeding to which the \n     appeal relates.'' 18 U.S.C.

Xaysana\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and heroic service of SGT Vorasack T. Xaysana. \nSergeant Xaysana, assigned to the Headquarters and Headquarters \nCompany, 2nd Battalion, based in Fort Hood, TX, died on April 10, 2011. \nSergeant Xaysana was serving in support of Operation New Dawn in \nKirkuk, Iraq. He was 30 years old.\n  A native of Westminster, CO, Sergeant Xaysana enlisted in the Army in \n2005. During over 6 years of service, he distinguished himself through \nhis courage and dedication to duty. Sergeant Xaysana's exemplary \nservice quickly won the recognition of his commanding officers. He \nearned, among other decorations, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Global \nWar on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Army Good Conduct Medal.\n  Sergeant Xaysana worked on the front lines of battle, serving in the \nmost dangerous areas of Iraq. Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death \nfollows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die \nat any time.'' Sergeant Xaysana's service was in keeping with this \nsentiment--by selflessly putting country first, he lived life to the \nfullest. He lived with a sense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones \nthroughout Iraq. Though his fate on the battlefield was uncertain, he \npushed forward, protecting America's citizens, her safety, and the \nfreedoms we hold dear. For his service and the lives he touched, \nSergeant Xaysana will forever be remembered as one of our country's \nbravest.\n  To Sergeant Xaysana's parents, Thong Chanh and Manithip, and to his \nentire family, I cannot imagine the sorrow you must be feeling. I hope \nthat, in time, the pain of your loss will be eased by your pride in \nVorasack's service and by your knowledge that his country will never \nforget him. We are humbled by his service and his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/08/senate-section/article/S3609-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3609-S3610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GRAZING IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to submit for the Record an \narticle written by Karen Budd-Falen and published May 28, 2011, in the \nWyoming Livestock Journal. The article's title is ``Leveling the \nPlaying Field: Support for the Grazing Improvement Act of 2011.''\n  The title of the article is instructive. Anyone living and working in \nrural communities knows the playing field is not level. The National \nEnvironmental Policy Act has become the preferred tool to delay and \nlitigate grazing permit renewals for American ranchers.\n  Livestock grazing on public lands has a strong tradition in Wyoming \nand all Western States. Ranchers are proud stewards of the land, yet \nthe permitting process to renew their permits is severely backlogged \ndue to litigation aimed at eliminating livestock from public land.\n  During times of high unemployment and increasing food prices, we need \nto be encouraging jobs in rural economies. We need to be fostering an \nenvironment to raise more high quality, safe, American beef and lamb; \nnot litigating less.\n  That is why I introduced the Grazing Improvement Act of 2011. This \nlegislation will provide the certainty and stability public grazing \npermit holders desperately need in order to continue supporting rural \njobs, providing healthy food, and maintaining open spaces for \nrecreation and wildlife.\n  It is time to help level the playing field for hard working ranching \nfamilies across the West. Their livelihood should not be held hostage \nby litigation and anti-grazing special interest groups. I thank my \ncolleagues, Senators Enzi, Crapo, Hatch, Heller, Risch, and Thune, in \nsupporting ranching families and this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Wyoming Livestock Roundup, May 28, 2011]\n\nLeveling the Playing Field: Support for the Grazing Improvement Act of \n                                  2011\n\n                         (By Karen Budd-Falen)\n\n       If jobs and the economy are the number one concern for \n     America, why are rural communities and ranchers under attack \n     by radical environmental groups and overzealous federal \n     regulators?\n       America depends upon the hundreds of products that \n     livestock provide, yet radical groups and oppressive \n     regulations make it almost impossible for ranchers to stay in \n     business. Opposition to these jobs comes in the form of \n     litigation by radical environmental groups to eliminate \n     grazing on public lands, radical environmental group pressure \n     to force ``voluntary'' grazing permit buy-outs from ``willing \n     sellers,'' and holding permittees hostage to the court \n     deference given to regulatory ``experts.'' The playing field \n     is not level and the rancher is on the losing side. The \n     Grazing Improvement Act of 2011 will level the playing field. \n     I urge your support.\n       The Grazing Improvement Act of 2011 does the following:\n       1. Term of Grazing Leases and Permits. Both BLM and Forest \n     Service term grazing permits are for a 10-year term. This \n     bill extends that term to 20 years. This extension does not \n     affect either the BLM's or Forest Service's ability to make \n     interim management decisions based upon resource or other \n     needs, nor does it impact the preference right of renewal for \n     term grazing permits or leases.\n       2. Renewal, Transfer and Reissuance of Grazing Leases and \n     Permits. This section codifies the various ``appropriation \n     riders'' for the BLM and Forest Service requiring that \n     permits being reissued, renewed or transferred continue to \n     follow the existing terms and conditions until the paperwork \n     is complete. Thus, the rancher is not held hostage to the \n     ability of the agency to get its\n\n[[Page S3610]]\n\n     job done--a job that is admittedly harder because of radical \n     environmental appeals, litigation and FOIA requests.\n       This bill also codifies the ability of the BLM and Forest \n     Service to ``categorically exclude'' grazing permit renewal, \n     reissuance or transfer from the paperwork requirements under \n     National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) if the permit or \n     lease continues current grazing management on the allotment. \n     Minor modifications to a permit or lease can also be \n     categorically excluded from NEPA if monitoring indicates that \n     the current grazing management has met or is moving toward \n     rangeland and riparian objectives and there are no \n     ``extraordinary circumstances.'' Finally, this section allows \n     the BLM and Forest Service to continue to set their priority \n     and timing for permit renewal or reissuance.\n       3. Applicability of Administrative Procedure Act. This \n     provision is really what levels the playing field for the \n     rancher, against the environmental ``willing buyer'' and the \n     arbitrary decisions of the governmental regulator.\n       First, this provision applies a real decision making \n     process, with an independent hearing officer or judge, to \n     Forest Service administrative appeals. Currently, legal \n     challenges to Forest Service decisions are heard by the \n     ``next higher Forest Service line officer.'' There have long \n     been allegations that this system is significantly skewed so \n     that the Forest Service decision maker is ``almost always \n     right.'' For example, out of the 28 decisions that were \n     administratively appealed in Forest Service Region 2 \n     (Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota) from 2009 \n     to the present, only two were rejected as being legally or \n     factually wrong. In that same time period, in California, out \n     of 78 appeals, only 13 decisions were either rejected or \n     withdrawn. In Arizona and New Mexico, the Forest Service \n     ``independent review by the next higher line officer'' only \n     found 15 out of 83 decisions were deficient. In other words, \n     just considering these three Forest Service regions, the \n     agency found itself right 85 percent of the time. In a fair \n     and equal system, no one is right that many times!\n       This provision would change that pattern so that Forest \n     Service grazing permittees would appeal the decisions they \n     believed were legally, factually or scientifically wrong to \n     an independent law judge and the Forest Service would have to \n     show why its decision is right, rather than the permittee \n     having to show why the decision is wrong. The permittee would \n     also be able to cross-examine Forest Service ``experts'' on \n     the reasons for the decision and the agency would have to \n     supply some justification for its decision. It is critical \n     that Forest Service permittees have the ability to protect \n     themselves from arbitrary decisions--an ability they do not \n     have now.\n       Second, this Act would level the playing field for BLM \n     permittees. Like the Forest Service provisions discussed \n     above, this bill ``changes'' the current appeals system by \n     requiring the BLM to prove its decision is legally and \n     scientifically correct, rather than forcing the permittee to \n     prove why the decision is legally and scientifically wrong.\n       Additionally, the OHA has determined that when the BLM \n     issues a decision adversely affecting a permittee's grazing \n     privileges, the BLM decision can still be upheld, even if the \n     BLM did not comply with all of the grazing regulations. In \n     short, under the current appeals system, the permittee's \n     experts have to show why the BLM experts are wrong (a burden \n     that is very hard to carry) and the BLM decision can still be \n     held to be correct, even if the BLM only substantially \n     complied with its regulations. This is not a level playing \n     field and a problem that absolutely needs corrected.\n       Finally, this section also returns to the law the \n     ``automatic stay'' provisions eliminated by the Bruce Babbitt \n     ``Range Reform `94'' regulations, except for decisions of a \n     temporary nature and except in emergency situations.\n       In truth, this bill is more than mere technical changes to \n     erroneous agency regulations--it gives some very real \n     protection to the permittees. For example, the Ruby Pipeline \n     ``donation'' to Western Watersheds Project to purchase \n     grazing preferences on a ``willing seller'' basis only works \n     if the permittee is honestly ``willing to sell.'' However, if \n     the permittee is always behind the curve in protecting his \n     grazing permit and the only way he can ``win'' is by \n     ``voluntarily selling'' his permit for pennies on the dollar, \n     the word ``willing'' is truly compulsion. And, in the case of \n     the Forest Service, the current administrative appeals \n     process is like asking your father to change the decision of \n     your mother, when your mother and father agreed on the \n     decision before it was dictated to you.\n       Finally, this bill reverses the U.S. Justice Department \n     capitulations to environmental groups during the course of \n     recent litigation. These ``settlements'' have significantly \n     restricted the BLM's and Forest Service's ability to \n     legitimately use categorical exclusions to renew grazing \n     permits. Neither the Justice Department nor the federal \n     bureaucrats should be allowed to make Congressional policy \n     without the Congressional branch of government.\n       Make no mistake--this is not just a public lands ranchers' \n     bill; this bill will help preserve family ranches, rural \n     communities and the American beef supply. This is an American \n     jobs bill! I urge your support and ask that you request your \n     Congressional representatives support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/08/senate-section/article/S3610-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GOOD SHEPHERD FOOD BANK\n\n Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. In early 1981, JoAnn and Ray Pike \nof Lewiston, ME, became concerned about the growing number of families \nand elderly in their community who were going hungry. Inspired by a \nnewspaper story about an organization in Kansas City that received food \ndonations from the food industry to distribute to those in need, the \nPikes and their home prayer group turned concern into action.\n  On Palm Sunday of that year, the people of the twin cities of \nLewiston-Auburn joined in a walkathon and raised $6,000. The Good \nShepherd Food Bank was born. Thirty years later, it serves all 16 Maine \ncounties, providing nourishment and hope to more than 70,000 Maine \npeople each month.\n  This remarkable story of compassion started small. The first food \nbank was located in an apartment and garage at the Pike home. Within 8 \nmonths, the quantity of donated food outgrew that space and the \noperation moved to a former textile mill in Lewiston. Today, the food \nbank has more than 100,000-square feet of warehouse space in Lewiston, \nPortland, and Brewer, enough to store 12 million pounds of food per \nyear.\n  At first, a handful of food companies joined this effort. Word of the \ngood work being done in Lewiston quickly spread, and food \nmanufacturers, distributors, and supermarkets throughout Maine stepped \nforward--more than 200 companies now contribute to the food bank.\n  Getting so much food to so many people over such a large area is a \ngreat challenge. It is a challenge that has been met by volunteers. The \nGood Shepherd Food Bank has established partnerships with more than 600 \norganizations throughout Maine--churches, charities, and civic clubs--\nthat form a vast distribution network. This results in an operation of \nextraordinary efficiency. For every $1 donated to support food bank \noperations, $8.50 worth of food is provided.\n  As a founding member of the Senate Hunger Caucus, I know we have done \nmuch here in Washington to ensure food security for all, but that there \nis more to do. I also know that so much of the real work of helping \nthose in need is done in our communities by caring and dedicated \ncitizens. The Good Shepherd Food Bank of Maine is a shining example of \nsuch caring and dedication, and I congratulate this wonderful \norganization and its many supporters on 30 years of inspiring \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/08/senate-section/article/S3610-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3610-S3611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MALCOLM ROSS O'NEILL\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ndistinguished career of a highly decorated soldier and accomplished \npublic servant. Following decades of unwavering service to our Nation, \nDr. Malcolm Ross O'Neill recently retired as the Assistant Secretary of \nthe Army for Acquisition, Logistics & Technology, AL In his capacity \nas the Assistant Secretary and Army acquisition executive, Dr. O'Neill \nled the Army's 41,000-member acquisition workforce in its vital mission \nto equip and sustain the world's most capable, powerful, and respected \nArmy.\n  Dr. O'Neill has made significant contributions to our national \nsecurity over the course of a career spanning nearly five decades. He \nproudly served 34 years on active duty as an Army officer, both in \npeacetime and in combat. Dr. O'Neill was commissioned in the U.S. Army \nas a field artillery officer in 1962 and served with the 82nd Airborne \nDivision; as an adviser with the 21st Reconnaissance Company of the \n21st Army of the Republic of Vietnam Division; and assistant chief of \nstaff, Ammunition, with the Danang Support Command in Vietnam. His \nfirst acquisition job was as a member of the source selection team for \nwhat was then called surface-to-air missile, development--now the \nPatriot missile system. His extensive military experience includes \nservice as commander, U.S. Army Laboratory Command; deputy director of \nthe Strategic Defense Initiative Organization; and director of the \nBallistic Missile Defense Organization.\n  Under Dr. O'Neill's leadership as Assistant Secretary of the Army, \nthe\n\n[[Page S3611]]\n\nArmy acquisition community has honored its paramount commitment to meet \nthe needs of soldiers in combat missions today. However, Dr. O'Neill \nalso reenergized the Army's efforts to develop advanced soldier \ncapabilities for tomorrow's conflicts. He reminded us that scientific \nand technical advancements play a critical role in maintaining the \nArmy's unparalleled preeminence in the future. As the lead Army \nacquisition official, Dr. O'Neill made significant progress in \ndeveloping a vigorous and robust science and technology portfolio \nincorporating the combined efforts of Army scientists, labs, advisory \nboards and other stakeholders. These accomplishments will leave an \nindelible impact on the Army's warfighting capabilities.\n  Dr. O'Neill's emphasis on sound management and execution of major \nweapon systems has helped the Army to prioritize capabilities and \nmodify existing programs to achieve long-term success. He has played a \ncritical role in bringing the Army requirements, resourcing, testing, \nand acquisition communities together to make informed decisions and \nadjustments within key programs. As the Army and Department of Defense \ncontinue to transform through an era of limited resources, Dr. O'Neill \nchampioned the importance of wise investments, competition, and sound \nacquisition strategies to ensure that more money was spent on the \nwarfighting capabilities of our soldiers and less on overhead. The Army \nis in a better position to adapt to an ever-changing environment of \ncompeting needs as a result of his efforts.\n  Three words define this dedicated public servant: honor, integrity, \nand courage. The Nation is in his debt for his many accomplishments \nduring the long and distinguished career of Malcolm Ross \nO'Neill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/08/senate-section/article/S3611-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             100TH ANNIVERSARY OF CHALLENGE DAIRY PRODUCTS\n\n Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues a milestone that has been reached by an \nimportant cooperative association responsible for the marketing and \ndistribution of dairy products from 450 California family-owned \ndairies.\n  Challenge opened for business under the name of Challenge Cream & \nButter Association 100 years ago with four employees and a wagon. That \nfirst day, Challenge sold 12 pounds of butter. Today, Challenge Butter \nis the largest butter brand in the West, and Challenge Dairy is the \nleading dairy foodservice provider in California, with eight \ndistribution centers spanning the State in Lodi, San Leandro, Monterey, \nFresno, Santa Maria, Ventura, Los Angeles, and San Diego. Challenge \ndirectly employs over 175 hard-working California citizens and has \naided thousands of California dairy farmers in their success over the \nyears. Today, more than 450 dairies are part of Challenge's \ncooperative, putting tens of millions of dollars into California's \neconomy annually.\n  Challenge's success is made up of dedicated California dairy farmers \nand employees who have ensured the quality of all products produced \nfrom each of its creameries. Early on, dairymen realized marketing was \nand remains to be key in successfully spreading the word about the \nquality of their products, which was why Challenge was conceived.\n  The benefits of farmer cooperation were so effective that the status \nof every single dairyman was materially improved, just from their \nexistence. A leader in quality improvement, Challenge established the \nstandards all other dairy organizations followed. Thus, Challenge has \nfiguratively held a protective umbrella over farm endeavors, for the \ngood of the farmers and the Nation, for more than a century.\n  By refusing to sell any item that didn't meet the highest standards, \nChallenge built a reputation for quality. That reputation has grown as \nChallenge led the way in the dairy industry with product and \nmanufacturing innovations such as the aluminum butter churn, the first \nsuccessful metal butter churn in the world.\n  Now a wholly owned subsidiary of California Dairies, Inc. CDI, \nCalifornia's largest dairy provider and the second largest in the \ncountry, Challenge has grown to represent more than 450 dairy farmers \nand markets nearly half of CDI's butter supply. CDI has six \nmanufacturing facilities that are located throughout the central valley \nand directly employs over 740 people.\n  Challenge has operated through two World Wars and the Great \nDepression in addition to a number of other obstacles. Through it all, \nthe company adapted and persevered to continue fulfilling the people's \nneed for quality dairy products and support the dairy farmers behind \nproducing products. We believe Challenge embodies the determination and \nthe spirit of the people of California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/08/senate-section/article/S3611-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/08/senate-section/article/S3611-3", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/08/senate-section/article/S3611-4", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3611-S3613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-1945.

A bill to improve the administration of the Department of \nEnergy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Department of \nEnergy Administrative Improvement Act of 2011. The bill makes several \nimprovements to the way the Department of Energy, DOE, conducts its \nbusiness and in doing so is designed to give taxpayers a better return \non their investments in DOE programs. Senator Murkowski, who is the \nranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is a \ncosponsor of this bill. These provisions were taken from the energy \nbill, S. 1462, reported out of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee last Congress. The provisions in this bill were adopted \nunanimously in the last Congress by members of the Committee as part of \nour work on S. 1462. Let me briefly highlight the sections of this \nbill.\n  Section 3 was taken from the recommendations of a 2009 report by the \nNational Academy of Public Administration, which reviewed the business \npractices of the Department. Similar to the Department of Defense, it \nrequires DOE to submit a 5-year budget profile for its programs with \nthe DOE's annual budget submission to Congress. A 5-year estimate will \nencourage the Department to think about long-term budget implications \nof programs rather than on a year-to-year basis.\n  Section 4 replaces a provision enacted into law in the section 1007 \nof the Energy Policy Act of 2005, 42 U.S.C. 7256(g), relating to Other \nTransactions Authority. Section 1007 was based on\n\n[[Page S3616]]\n\nthe similar authority applying to the Department of Defense. Section 4 \nis a fresh re-write of the authority so it is organic within the \nDepartment of Energy Organization Act and not the Department of \nDefense's authorities. The language is largely the same in content as \nthat in section 1007 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The DOE went \nthrough an extensive comment period in developing rules for the use of \nthis authority after it was enacted into law in 2005 to ensure \ntransparency in its development and use. This section still contains \nreporting requirements to Congress on the use of this authority to \nensure effective oversight. The Advanced Research Projects Agency--\nEnergy has used this authority to initiate projects with energy \ncompanies that were not traditional government contractors and I \nbelieve this is a sound addition to the contracting authorities \navailable to the Department.\n  Section 5 permits the DOE to designate and protect proprietary data \nfor a period of 5 years for transactions entered into by the \nDepartment. Section 3001 of Energy Policy Act of 1992, 42 U.S.C. 13541, \ncontained various provisions to protect results from industry \npartnerships with the Department of Energy. The 1992 data protection \nprovision was carried forward implicitly in section 1005 of the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005, 42 U.S.C. 16395. This section gives the Secretary \nof Energy explicit authority to protect proprietary data in order to \npromote commercialization of new technology arising from the public-\nprivate partnerships in such areas as energy storage, smart grid and \nadvanced nuclear technologies.\n  Section 6 gives the Department direct hire authority for a period of \ntwo years consistent with merit principles and public notice. Similar \nauthority, known as excepted personnel authority, originally was \navailable to the DOE's predecessor agency, the Atomic Energy \nCommission. That authority transferred to the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, NRC, but not the DOE. Interestingly, the NRC with its large \nscientific and engineering workforce has been rated as one of the best \nplaces to work in the federal government. While flexible personnel \nauthorities are not singularly determinative of agency performance, I \nbelieve this pilot program will be an important tool for the Department \nto attract the best and brightest engineers, scientists and specialized \ntechnical personnel to work on its wide array of missions.\n  Section 7 gives the DOE critical pay authority to hire up to 40 \nhighly skilled individuals for key or critical mission positions at the \nDepartment, for a period of up to 4 years. This will enable DOE to \nattract highly qualified individuals from industry and academia for \npositions within the Department typical of its complicated science and \nengineering missions.\n  Section 8 gives the DOE the authority to rehire retired DOE employees \nfor mission-critical positions without impacting their retirement \nannuity. Many Department employees served in excess of 20 or 30 years \nin programmatic positions managing large, technically complicated \nprojects. This authority will enable continuity of knowledge transfer \nas newer employees are hired.\n  Section 9 updates the list of DOE National Laboratories in section 2 \nof the Energy Policy Act of 2005, 42 U.S.C. 15801(3) to reflect the \nname change of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center to ``SLAC \nNational Accelerator Laboratory''.\n  The Department of Energy has one of the most technical and \ncomplicated missions in the Federal Government, which includes managing \nour Nation's nuclear stockpile, basic and applied energy research, \nenvironmental cleanup of former cold war nuclear weapons production \nsites, and finally the management of large contracts spanning decades. \nI hope that these provisions will be helpful to the Department to \nefficiently conduct its missions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1160\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEFINITION OF NATIONAL LABORATORY.\n\n       Section 2(3) of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (42 U.S.C. \n     15801(3)) is amended by striking subparagraph (P) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(P) SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WEBB (for himself and Mr. Corker):\n  S.J. Res. 18. A joint resolution prohibiting the deployment, \nestablishment, or maintenance of a presence of units and members of the \nUnited States Armed Forces on the ground in Libya, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the Senate floor, \nalong with my colleague, Senator Corker, a fellow member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, to speak about a joint resolution we are \nintroducing today that deals with the situation in Libya.\n  This is introduced as a joint resolution rather than as an amendment \non the current legislation because I believe this matter is serious \nenough that our body should actually consider this as a stand-alone \npiece of legislation and coordinate it with the House and get this \npassed with due speed.\n  This resolution, first of all, contains a statement of policy that \nAmerican Armed Forces should be used exclusively to defend and advance \nour national security interests.\n  Second, it prohibits the deployment, establishment, or maintenance of \nground troops in Libya, with two notable exceptions. The first would be \nfor the purpose of the immediate personal defense of American \nGovernment officials, including diplomatic representatives, which I \nbelieve would be an important exclusion once and if we decide to \nconduct negotiations or reestablish our Embassy inside Libya. The other \nexception would be for the purpose of rescuing members of our Armed \nForces who would be in Libya and would be under imminent danger.\n  It also prohibits the awarding of a contract to private security \ncontractors to conduct, establish, or maintain any activities on the \nground in Libya.\n  This language in section 2 is similar to language that passed the \nHouse last week with a vote of 416 to 5.\n  Section 3 includes a sense of Congress that the President should \nrequest congressional authorization for the continuation of American \ninvolvement in\n\n[[Page S3618]]\n\nongoing activities in Libya, and that the Congress, in its \nconstitutional role, should debate and consider this matter \nexpeditiously.\n  Sections 4 and 5 require the transmission of information to the \nCongress on a wide variety of information that, to this point, we have \nnot been properly included on. That language, in some form, passed the \nHouse last Friday with a vote of 268 to 145.\n  Again, I appreciate very much Senator Corker joining me as the \nprincipal cosponsor of this joint resolution.\n  I would like to explain why I believe it is important we take this \nmeasure as a body, as a Congress, in response to the actions the \nPresident took in Libya nearly 3 months ago.\n  First, we know, and we are reminded every day, that our economy is \ngoing through a terrible crisis, even as we are expending hundreds of \nbillions of dollars every year on wars in the most vitriolic and \ncontentious parts of the world.\n  Second, our military has been engaged in continuous combat operations \nfor nearly 10 years. We still have 45,000 military members in Iraq \ndespite a stated commitment for a full withdrawal by the end of this \nyear. We have about 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, and the prospect for \na meaningful withdrawal in the short term does not look good.\n  When we examine the conditions under which the President ordered our \nmilitary into action in Libya, we are faced, in my view, with the \nprospect of a very troubling, if not downright odd, historical \nprecedent that has the potential to haunt us for decades.\n  The issue in play is not simply whether the President should ask the \nCongress for a declaration of war, nor is it wholly about whether the \nPresident has violated the edicts of the War Powers Act, which, in my \nview, he clearly has. The issue for us to consider is whether a \nPresident--any President--can unilaterally begin, and continue, a \nmilitary campaign for reasons that he alone defines as meeting the \ndemanding standards of a vital national interest worthy of risking \nAmerican lives and expending billions of dollars of our taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  What was the standard in this case? The initial justification was \nthat a dictator might retaliate against people who rebelled against \nhim. I do not make light of the potential tragedy involved in such a \npossibility, although it should be pointed out that there are a lot of \ndictators in this world and very few democracies in this particular \nregion, which gives this standard a pretty broad base if a President \ndecides to use it again. Then, predictably, once military operations \nbegan in Libya, the stated goal became regime change, with combat now \nhaving dragged on for nearly 3 months.\n  So in a world filled with cruelty, the question becomes whether a \nPresident--any President--should be able to pick and choose when and \nwhere to use military force using such a vague standard. Actually that \nis the most important question. Given our system of government, who \nshould decide? Even if a President should unilaterally decide on the \nbasis of overwhelming, vital national interests that requires immediate \naction, how long should that decision be honored, and to what lengths \nshould our military go before the matter is able to come under the \nproper scrutiny and boundaries of our Congress?\n  Let's review the bidding. What did it look like when our President \nordered our military into action in Libya, and what has happened since? \nWas our country under attack or under the threat of an imminent attack? \nWas a clearly vital national interest at stake? Were we invoking the \ninherent right of self-defense as outlined in the United Nations \ncharter? Were we called upon by treaty commitments to come to the aid \nof an ally? Were we responding in kind to an attack on our forces \nelsewhere as we did in the 1986 raids in Libya when I was in the \nPentagon, after American soldiers had been killed in a disco in Berlin? \nWere we rescuing Americans in distress as we did in Grenada in 1983? \nNo, we were not.\n  The President followed no clear historical standard when he \nunilaterally decided to use force in Libya. Once this action continued \nbeyond his original definition of ``days, not weeks,'' he did not seek \nthe approval of Congress. While he has discussed this matter with some \nMembers of Congress, he has not formally conferred with the legislative \nbranch.\n  I believe it is appropriate to question on whose behalf this \ncontinuing action is being taken, and, most importantly at this point, \nwhat is going to be asked of our military in the coming months, \nassuming the Qadhafi regime does fall? This is not even a civil war.\n  As Secretary of Defense Gates commented to me when I asked him that \nquestion during a hearing on the Armed Services Committee recently: You \ndon't have a civil war when there is no clearly formed opposition \nmovement. It has been a random rebellion. We can empathize with the \nfrustrations of this rebellion, but looking into the future, the only \nthing the opponents of the present regime all seem to agree on is that \nQadhafi should go.\n  As I have said repeatedly over the past few months, this matters \ngreatly when one considers what the aftermath of this action could \nentail for the international community.\n  An additional curiosity is that we still recognize this regime even \nas we have been participating for nearly 3 months in actions designed \nto destroy it. I have raised this matter repeatedly with our State \nDepartment. We have not severed relations with this regime, nor have we \nrecognized a successor regime. We have merely suspended our relations. \nSo we are looking at something of a historical anomaly. We are \nparticipating in attacks on a regime that we recognize, on behalf of \nrebel forces that are so amorphous that we don't, and we really do not \nknow what is going to replace the regime that we recognize once it is \ngone.\n  Obviously, I am not raising these points out of any lasting love for \nMr. Qadhafi or any hopes that he continues in his present position. But \nlet's be very clear. This is a region rife with tribalism, fierce \nloyalties, and brutal retaliation. In this part of the world the lust \nfor revenge upon those who try to destroy you is not a characteristic \nthat is unique to Mr. Qadhafi. Whether Qadhafi stays or falls, that is \nvery likely going to be the future at some level in Libya, and this is \nnot a place for American troops to be sent in order to sort out this \nmess. If other nations decide to do so, I certainly have no objection. \nBut our military is stretched too thin, our economy is too fragile, and \nthe reasons for us to continue in this effort are too ill-defined.\n  So it is important for the Congress to step in and to clearly define \nthe boundaries of our involvement. We should be saying without \nhesitation that no American ground personnel should be introduced into \nLibya, now or in the future. We should also be insisting on fair and \nopen communication from this administration to the Congress rather than \nthe stonewalling that has characterized the past 3 months.\n  This is not a political issue for me. Rather, it is an issue of how \nour government is structured. I would submit that this issue has \nhistorical consequences. Our three branches of government were \ncarefully designed by the Founding Fathers to guard against hasty \ndecisions or judgments that would not be fully in our national \ninterest. For centuries, the English monarchs had been able to wage \nwars of choice, with the only restriction being whether Parliament \nwould raise enough taxes to fund their adventurous armies. Our Founding \nFathers said no. The Framers of the Constitution deliberately gave the \nCongress the specific power to rein in such conduct and to protect our \npeople from unwise choices by insisting on a democratic consensus.\n  The structure of international relations has become much more complex \nsince then, but the principle is still vital, and it still must hold.\n  Over the past 10 years, in pursuit of a workable formula with which \nto defend our Nation against legitimate threats, we have allowed the \nbalance of power in our constitutional system to tilt far too heavily \nto the executive branch. There could be no clearer example of why the \nCongress must finally say ``enough is enough'' than the situation we \nnow face in Libya. We must clearly say, as a governing body, that there \nare boundaries on the conduct of a President--any President--when it \ncomes to his or her unilateral decision to use military force. We \nshould be clear that American military forces--in uniform or not--do \nnot belong on the ground in Libya.\n\n[[Page S3619]]\n\n  We should make it clear that we will not be deterred in requests for \ninformation that allow us to perform our responsibilities. To do less \nthan that would bring us back in time, to a system of government our \nforefathers risked their lives to improve upon. We are not the \nParliament of King Charles. I believe my fellow Members would agree \nthat our role as a legislative body is more than that of collecting \ntaxes so that the President--any President--can raise armies and fight \nwars of his own choosing. And that is why I am asking every Senator to \nsupport this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia, the former Secretary of the Navy, in the \nintroduction of this joint resolution, along with Senator Lee from \nUtah. I look forward to a debate of this resolution next week which I \nhope will end up passing both bodies and which calls for a number of \nanswers we have been requesting to come forth.\n  I wish to discuss the ongoing situation in Libya where--specifically \nU.S. participation in NATO military operations authorized by the United \nNations' Security Council resolution passed on March 17, 2011. For \nthose of you listening, you heard me correctly. It was authorized by \nthe United Nations, not the U.S. Congress. We are spending roughly $2 \nmillion per day on a mission on which the President has yet to broadly \nconsult Congress.\n  I find it unbelievable that the President would seek the approval of \nthe United Nations and the Arab League for military operations over \nLibya while sidelining the body that speaks for the American people, \nnot even answering our questions. This is not consultation, nor is the \nPresident heeding the concerns of his own constituents.\n  For many weeks now, I and many colleagues, for that matter, have \nattempted to gain answers to some of the most basic questions about \nwhat we are doing in Libya. Through hearings in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, we have not received these answers. We have asked for \nspecific witnesses and received no response. This is not consultation.\n  In my ongoing attempts to receive answers to these questions, I sent \na letter to Secretary Clinton and Secretary Gates on April 14, 2011, \nspecifically outlining five questions. I have the letter here and ask \nunanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 2011.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert M. Gates,\n     Secretary of Defense, U.S. Department of Defense, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Secretary Clinton and Secretary Gates: It has now been \n     nearly one month since the United States first engaged in \n     coalition operations in Libya. Since that time, there has \n     been relatively infrequent information sharing with the \n     Congress regarding the full scope of U.S. involvement in the \n     conflict. Administration officials have assured Congress that \n     the United States was playing only a supporting role in \n     ongoing operations in Libya, and those operations did not \n     include kinetic operations. Yesterday, April 13, 2011, it was \n     revealed during a Pentagon briefing that three U.S. aircraft \n     assigned to NATO had fired ordnance. This seems contradictory \n     to the information we have previously received and is an \n     example of the disconnect between Congress and the \n     administration on the nature of the U.S. role in Libya. To \n     that end, I ask that you provide the following:\n       (1) A full accounting of U.S. assets assigned to the \n     mission and how they are being utilized.\n       (2) Requests the U.S. has received from coalition partners \n     and Libyan opposition forces for materiel and support--both \n     fulfilled and denied.\n       (3) The contents of additional U.S. offers of assistance.\n       (4) Plans to offer additional assistance to Libyan \n     opposition forces.\n       (5) All meetings that the administration has engaged in \n     with coalition partners, the Libya contact group and the \n     Libyan opposition forces to discuss the operations and \n     political future of Libya.\n       I thank you for your service to our country, and I look \n     forward to your prompt reply to my request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bob Corker,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, today, 1 day shy of 8 weeks later, I \nfinally received a response. This response did not come from Secretary \nClinton. It did not come from Secretary Gates. This response came from \nthe Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs and \nonly paid lipservice to one of my five specific requests for \ninformation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this ``nonresponse'' printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2011.\n     Hon. Bob Corker,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Corker: Thank you for your letter of April 14 \n     regarding the State Department's effort to assist the \n     coalition and support the people of Libya. The past three \n     months have demonstrated Colonel Qadhafi's unrelenting \n     efforts to kill those who wish to instill democracy in Libya \n     and the use of barbarous, indiscriminant bombing of cities \n     and vital civilian infrastructure. These acts further \n     delegitimize Qadhafi as a leader of the Libyan people.\n       The State Department is working to ensure the coalition \n     remains united behind the goal of protecting the people of \n     Libya. We continue to work closely with coalition and \n     regional governments to isolate Qadhafi and create support \n     for the opposition. This effort includes the termination of \n     diplomatic status for Libyan diplomats still supporting the \n     regime and the freezing of all regime assets. As the \n     situation evolves, we continue to evaluate further options to \n     increase pressure on Qadhafi to step down. We are also \n     considering options to provide the opposition the financial \n     wherewithal it needs to support itself.\n       Along with looking at multiple ways to increase pressure on \n     the Qadhafi regime, the State Department is looking at better \n     ways to provide humanitarian assistance to civilians in \n     conflict areas. We are assessing options for assistance we \n     could provide to the Libyan people and are consulting \n     directly with the opposition and our international partners. \n     Some aid has been identified; the President directed up to \n     $25 million in non-lethal items from U.S. government stocks, \n     including medical supplies, uniforms, boots, tents, personal \n     protective gear, and prepackaged rations.\n       We continue working with the international community to \n     determine the best way to support the Transitional National \n     Council (TNC) in meeting its financial needs. The May 5 Libya \n     Contact Group meeting in Rome endorsed the creation of a \n     Temporary Financial Mechanism, which will help facilitate and \n     coordinate financial assistance. Additionally, the United \n     States is providing $53.5 million in humanitarian assistance \n     to support people affected by the crisis.\n       Chris Stevens, U.S. Envoy to the TNC, remains in Benghazi \n     and continues to hold productive meetings with high-level \n     members of the TNC. In addition to Secretary Clinton's \n     meetings with TNC leadership, Mr. Stevens regularly meets \n     with senior TNC leaders to better understand the steps they \n     are undertaking to build a democracy based on universal \n     principles of respect for human rights and rule of law. While \n     we are working closely with the TNC, we also continue to meet \n     with a broad spectrum of Libyans involved in the opposition \n     writ large.\n       Thank you again for your interest and support for Libya. \n     Please do not hesitate to contact us again if we can be of \n     further assistance on this or any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Joseph E. MacManus,\n\n                                       Acting Assistant Secretary,\n                                              Legislative Affairs.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, this is unacceptable. This is an \nunacceptable way to treat a coequal branch of the U.S. Government that \nis granted certain responsibilities to our Armed Forces by the Founders \nof our country. Without these answers, Members of Congress are unable \nto assess critical questions and debate whether we should continue to \nengage in military operations in Libya.\n  That is why I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator Webb and \nSenator Lee, in introducing S.J. Res. 18 today. This is a joint \nresolution drawing on language that already passed the House of \nRepresentatives last week, and it requires the President to answer 21 \nquestions critical to determining whether engagement in Libya is in the \nvital national interest of the United States.\n  This joint resolution further expresses the sense of Congress that \nthe President should request authorization from Congress for the \ncontinuation of U.S. involvement in ongoing NATO activities in Libya.\n\n[[Page S3620]]\n\n  It says Congress should fully debate and consider such a request in \nan expedient manner. I can't imagine there is anybody in this body who \nwould not like to debate this issue on the floor, regardless of how \nthey may feel about this conflict. We owe it to every man and woman who \nputs on a uniform to serve our country and to every taxpayer who funds \nthe operation to be clear that our entry into any conflict has been \nthoughtfully considered, contains clear justification, a clear mission, \nand a clear debate of the risks and benefits. The information sought by \nthis joint resolution will help us meet those obligations.\n  I look forward to the Senate considering this joint resolution in the \nnear future--hopefully next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/08/senate-section/article/S3620-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3620]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 205--DESIGNATING THE PERIOD BEGINNING ON JUNE 19, \n   2011, AND ENDING ON JUNE 25, 2011, AS ``POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE \nAWARENESS WEEK'', AND RAISING AWARENESS AND UNDERSTANDING OF POLYCYSTIC \n       KIDNEY DISEASE AND THE IMPACT SUCH DISEASE HAS ON PATIENTS\n\n  Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. Hatch) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 205\n\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease, known as ``PKD'', is one \n     of the world's most prevalent life-threatening genetic \n     diseases, affecting an estimated 600,000 people in the United \n     States, including newborns, children, and adults regardless \n     of sex, age, race, geography, income or ethnicity;\n       Whereas there are 2 forms of polycystic kidney disease, \n     autosomal dominant (ADPKD), affecting 1 in 500 people \n     worldwide, and autosomal recessive (ARPKD), a rare form, \n     affecting 1 in 20,000 live births and frequently leading to \n     early death;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease causes multiple cysts to \n     form on both kidneys (ranging in size from a pinhead to a \n     grapefruit), leading to an increase in kidney size and \n     weight;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disease \n     that causes damage to the kidneys and the cardiovascular, \n     endocrine, hepatic, and gastrointestinal systems;\n       Whereas patients with polycystic kidney disease often \n     experience no symptoms early in the disease, and many \n     patients do not realize they have polycystic kidney disease \n     until other organs are affected;\n       Whereas symptoms of polycystic kidney disease may include \n     high blood pressure, chronic pain in the back, sides or \n     abdomen, blood in the urine, urinary tract infection, heart \n     disease, and kidney stones;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is the number one genetic \n     cause of kidney failure in the United States;\n       Whereas more than half of polycystic kidney disease \n     patients will reach kidney failure and require dialysis or a \n     kidney transplant to survive, thus placing an extra strain on \n     dialysis and kidney transplantation resources;\n       Whereas there is no treatment or cure for polycystic kidney \n     disease; and\n       Whereas there are thousands of volunteers nationwide \n     dedicated to expanding essential research, fostering public \n     awareness and understanding, educating patients and their \n     families about polycystic kidney disease to improve treatment \n     and care, providing appropriate moral support, and \n     encouraging people to become organ donors: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the period beginning on June 19, 2011, and \n     ending on June 25, 2011, as ``Polycystic Kidney Disease \n     Awareness Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of Polycystic Kidney \n     Disease Awareness Week, to raise public awareness and \n     understanding of polycystic kidney disease;\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research to find \n     treatments and a cure for polycystic kidney disease; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to support Polycystic Kidney Disease \n     Awareness Week through appropriate ceremonies and activities, \n     to promote public awareness of polycystic kidney disease, and \n     to foster understanding of the impact of such disease on \n     patients and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/08/senate-section/article/S3620-2", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3620-S3621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 206--DESIGNATING JUNE 20, 2011, AS ``AMERICAN EAGLE \nDAY'', AND CELEBRATING THE RECOVERY AND RESTORATION OF THE BALD EAGLE, \n                THE NATIONAL SYMBOL OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Hoeven, Mrs. Feinstein, \nMr. Roberts, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Mrs. Boxer, and \nMr. Corker) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 206\n\n       Whereas on June 20, 1782, the bald eagle was officially \n     designated as the national emblem of the United States by the \n     founding fathers at the Second Continental Congress;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is the central image of the Great \n     Seal of the United States;\n       Whereas the image of the bald eagle is displayed in the \n     official seal of many branches and departments of the Federal \n     Government, including--\n       (1) the Office of the President;\n       (2) the Office of the Vice President;\n       (3) Congress;\n       (4) the Supreme Court;\n       (5) the Department of the Treasury;\n       (6) the Department of Defense;\n       (7) the Department of Justice;\n       (8) the Department of State;\n       (9) the Department of Commerce;\n       (10) the Department of Homeland Security;\n       (11) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n       (12) the Department of Labor;\n       (13) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n       (14) the Department of Energy;\n       (15) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;\n       (16) the Central Intelligence Agency;

118 Stat. 3934);\n       Whereas the sale of the limited edition bald eagle \n     commemorative coins issued by the Secretary of the Treasury \n     has raised approximately $7,800,000 for the nonprofit \n     American Eagle Foundation of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee to \n     support efforts to protect the bald eagle;\n       Whereas, if not for the vigilant conservation efforts of \n     concerned Americans and the enactment of strict environmental \n     protection laws (including regulations) the bald eagle would \n     probably be extinct;\n       Whereas the American Eagle Foundation has brought \n     substantial public attention to the cause of the protection \n     and care of the bald eagle nationally;\n       Whereas November 4, 2010, marked the 25th anniversary of \n     the American Eagle Foundation;\n       Whereas the dramatic recovery of the population of bald \n     eagles--\n       (1) is an endangered species success story; and\n       (2) an inspirational example for other wildlife and natural \n     resource conservation efforts around the world;\n\n[[Page S3621]]\n\n       Whereas the initial recovery of the population of bald \n     eagles was accomplished by the concerted efforts of numerous \n     government agencies, corporations, organizations, and \n     individuals;

PRESCRIBED FIRES IN FLINT HILLS REGION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Flint Hills Region of Kansas and Oklahoma contains \n     the world's largest share of the remaining tallgrass prairie, \n     and is the only place in which that habitat occurs in \n     landscape proportions;\n       (2) only 4 percent of the presettlement tallgrass prairie \n     in North America survives to this day, and 80 percent of that \n     prairie is located in Kansas;\n       (3) the Flint Hills Region is also home to certain \n     declining avian species, such as the greater prairie chicken \n     and Henslow's sparrow, that cannot continue to exist without \n     large expanses of native tallgrass prairie in an original \n     state;\n       (4) the Flint Hills Region is a significant corridor for \n     migrating shorebirds, such as the American golden plover, the \n     buff-breasted sand-piper, and the upland sandpiper;\n       (5) beginning in the mid-19th century, cattlemen understood \n     that the richness of the Flint Hills grasses depended on a \n     good spring burn--something they learned from the Native \n     Americans;\n       (6) fire still thrives in the Flint Hills because the \n     ranchers, and others using the land, understand that the \n     natural ecosystem depends on fire;\n       (7) ranchers, landowners, and conservation groups use \n     prescribed burns to mimic the seasonal fires that have shaped \n     the tallgrass prairie for thousands of years;\n       (8) areas not burned for several years develop mature \n     grasses and thicker, thatch-like vegetation, a habitat that \n     is preferred by invasive species;\n       (9) the Flint Hills Region is a place in the United States \n     that is an example of the prevailing agricultural system \n     working essentially in tandem with an ancestral native \n     ecosystem, preserving most of the complexity and the dynamic \n     processes that helped shape the area; and\n       (10) due to the uniqueness of the Flint Hills tallgrass \n     prairie and the historic manner in which the tallgrass \n     prairie has been managed by fire--\n       (A) prescribed burn practices used as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act to manage the Flint Hills tallgrass \n     prairie should be allowed to continue; and\n       (B) ambient air data resulting from fires used for that \n     management should be not be included in determinations of \n     compliance with the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.).\n       (b) Prescribed Fires.--The Clean Air Act is amended by \n     inserting after section 329 (42 U.S.C. 7628) the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 330.

Res. 206\n\n       Whereas on June 20, 1782, the bald eagle was officially \n     designated as the national emblem of the United States by the \n     founding fathers at the Second Continental Congress;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is the central image of the Great \n     Seal of the United States;\n       Whereas the image of the bald eagle is displayed in the \n     official seal of many branches and departments of the Federal \n     Government, including--\n       (1) the Office of the President;\n       (2) the Office of the Vice President;\n       (3) Congress;\n       (4) the Supreme Court;\n       (5) the Department of the Treasury;\n       (6) the Department of Defense;\n       (7) the Department of Justice;\n       (8) the Department of State;\n       (9) the Department of Commerce;\n       (10) the Department of Homeland Security;\n       (11) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n       (12) the Department of Labor;\n       (13) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n       (14) the Department of Energy;\n       (15) the Department of Housing and Urban Development;\n       (16) the Central Intelligence Agency; and\n       (17) the Postal Service;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is an inspiring symbol of--\n       (1) the spirit of freedom; and\n       (2) the democracy of the United States;\n       Whereas, since the founding of the Nation, the image, \n     meaning, and symbolism of the bald eagle have played a \n     significant role in the art, music, history, commerce, \n     literature, architecture, and culture of the United States;\n       Whereas the bald eagle is prominently featured on the \n     stamps, currency, and coinage of the United States;\n       Whereas the habitat of bald eagles exists only in North \n     America;\n       Whereas, by 1963, the population of bald eagles that nested \n     in the lower 48 States had declined to approximately 417 \n     nesting pairs;\n       Whereas, due to the dramatic decline in the population of \n     bald eagles in the lower 48 States, the Secretary of the \n     Interior listed the bald eagle as an endangered species on \n     the list of endangered species published under section \n     4(c)(1) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1533(c)(1));\n       Whereas caring and concerned individuals from the Federal, \n     State, and private sectors banded together to save, and help \n     ensure the recovery and protection of, bald eagles;\n       Whereas, on July 20, 1969, the first manned lunar landing \n     occurred in the Apollo 11 Lunar Excursion Module, which was \n     named ``Eagle'';\n       Whereas the ``Eagle''  played an integral role in achieving \n     the goal of the United States of landing a man on the Moon \n     and returning that man safely to Earth;\n       Whereas, in 1995, as a result of the efforts of those \n     caring and concerned individuals, the Secretary of the \n     Interior listed the bald eagle as a threatened species on the \n     list of threatened species published under section 4(c)(1) of \n     the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(c)(1));\n       Whereas, by 2007, the population of bald eagles that nested \n     in the lower 48 States had increased to approximately 10,000 \n     nesting pairs, an increase of approximately 2,500 percent \n     from the preceding 40 years;\n       Whereas, in 2007, the population of bald eagles that nested \n     in the State of Alaska was approximately 50,000 to 70,000;\n       Whereas, on June 28, 2007, the Secretary of the Interior \n     removed the bald eagle from the list of threatened species \n     published under section 4(c)(1) of the Endangered Species Act \n     of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(c)(1));\n       Whereas bald eagles remain protected in accordance with--\n       (1) the Act of June 8, 1940 (16 U.S.C. 668 et seq.) \n     (commonly known as the ``Bald Eagle Protection Act of \n     1940''); and\n       (2) the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.);\n       Whereas, on January 15, 2008, the Secretary of the Treasury \n     issued 3 limited edition bald\n\n[[Page S3630]]\n\n     eagle commemorative coins under the American Bald Eagle \n     Recovery and National Emblem Commemorative Coin Act (Public \n     Law 108-486; 118 Stat. 3934);\n       Whereas the sale of the limited edition bald eagle \n     commemorative coins issued by the Secretary of the Treasury \n     has raised approximately $7,800,000 for the nonprofit \n     American Eagle Foundation of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee to \n     support efforts to protect the bald eagle;\n       Whereas, if not for the vigilant conservation efforts of \n     concerned Americans and the enactment of strict environmental \n     protection laws (including regulations) the bald eagle would \n     probably be extinct;\n       Whereas the American Eagle Foundation has brought \n     substantial public attention to the cause of the protection \n     and care of the bald eagle nationally;\n       Whereas November 4, 2010, marked the 25th anniversary of \n     the American Eagle Foundation;\n       Whereas the dramatic recovery of the population of bald \n     eagles--\n       (1) is an endangered species success story; and\n       (2) an inspirational example for other wildlife and natural \n     resource conservation efforts around the world;\n       Whereas the initial recovery of the population of bald \n     eagles was accomplished by the concerted efforts of numerous \n     government agencies, corporations, organizations, and \n     individuals; and\n       Whereas the continuation of recovery, management, and \n     public awareness programs for bald eagles will be necessary \n     to ensure--\n       (1) the continued progress of the recovery of bald eagles; \n     and\n       (2) that the population and habitat of bald eagles will \n     remain healthy and secure for future generations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 20, 2011, as ``American Eagle Day'';\n       (2) applauds the issuance of bald eagle commemorative coins \n     by the Secretary of the Treasury as a means by which to \n     generate critical funds for the protection of bald eagles; \n     and\n       (3) encourages--\n       (A) educational entities, organizations, businesses, \n     conservation groups, and government agencies with a shared \n     interest in conserving endangered species to collaborate and \n     develop educational tools for use in the public schools of \n     the United States; and\n       (B) the people of the United States to observe American \n     Eagle Day with appropriate ceremonies and other activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/06/08/senate-section/article/S3630-1", "month": "06", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, \n                              JUNE 9, 2011\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
