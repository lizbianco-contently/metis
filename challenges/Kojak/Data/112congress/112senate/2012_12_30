Mr. President, as we stand here--or sit here--and watch \nwhat is happening, we know there are negotiations going on to avert at \nleast part of the fiscal cliff. I want to say--I have said this \nprivately, but I want to do it publicly--I hope our leaders can find a \nway out of this.\n  I watched the President speak today and I thought, as usual, he was \nvery fair in what he said. What he basically said is it is the middle \nclass that grows this economy. It is the middle class that needs to be \nlifted up. It is the middle class that cannot afford tax hikes. Those \nat the very top can do just a little bit more.\n  It is a very simple point. I hope, given that everyone says they are \nfor the middle class--I know my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle say that every day, that they agree with that--that finding this \ncompromise will not be elusive but will come to pass.\n  I have been here for a while. My understanding is we have not met \nbetween Christmas and New Year's Day since 1962. So it does take a \ncrisis of major proportions to make that happen. I think we are in a \ncrisis right now, but it is a self-made one. It is a self-imposed one. \nIt is similar to the crisis we had on the debt ceiling--self-imposed. \nIt is not some, God forbid, exterior attack on our country which we\n\n[[Page S8522]]\n\ncould not prevent. It is not some, God forbid, plague or a terrible \nvirus that is running across the land. To me it is something that is \nnot that complicated.\n  As the President said, we have a series of tax cuts that are \nexpiring. If we let them expire, it means there will be a huge tax \nincrease, mostly hitting the middle class and the working poor. The \nupper incomes, the people in that category, have done so well that even \nthey say they would have to talk to their accountant before they even \nknew there was any impact on their tax bill. So we can come together.\n  The President favored a limit which would be $250,000, meaning that \neveryone who earns up to that would get a tax break. Everybody's income \nup to $250,000 gets a tax break, everybody, 100 percent of the people. \nBut those who are fortunate to have higher incomes would go back to the \ntax rates that prevailed when Bill Clinton was President.\n  Why the other side is horrified by that is perplexing to me. I look \nback at the Clinton era. I was here. That is a long time ago. I came to \nthe Senate with Senator Feinstein when Bill Clinton was President, and \nhe faced similar issues in that we had a deficit that was getting out \nof control, a debt that was getting out of control. We needed to have \ngrowth. So he put forward a budget plan that invested in our people, \ninvested in the infrastructure, invested in education, and at the same \ntime said we can find cuts in other areas and we can raise taxes on \nthose who are doing very well.\n  What happened with that fair and balanced approach? What happened was \nthe greatest prosperity in modern history--23 million jobs, no more \ndeficits, we got to a balanced budget. I remember saying to my husband: \nMy goodness, what is going to happen? There will not be any more U.S. \nGovernment bonds because we are going to be out of the debt situation. \nWe saw it on the horizon.\n  When George W. Bush became President, he decided to go back, backward \non rates across-the-board, from the wealthiest to the middle to the \npoor, and he put two wars on a credit card and we are where we are.\n  To add to this history, we all know we are coming out of the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression. It has been difficult. It was led \nby, unfortunately, some unscrupulous people on Wall Street who created \na nightmare in the housing market. I remember saying to Treasury \nSecretary Paulson: Can you please explain the role of derivatives here \nand what happened and how we got into this crisis? He put his head in \nhis hands and he said: Not now. I will talk to you later.\n  That is not very encouraging when the Secretary of the Treasury puts \nhis head in his hands and says I can't explain it now.\n  We are coming out of this difficult time, and guess what. We are \ndoing much better. We had an election. It was pretty clear. People want \nto see us reach a balance.\n  As I stand here, I know there are negotiations going on in the rooms \nsurrounding us. I wish for the best, I hope for the best, and I ask for \nthe best. There is a word called ``compromise.'' It doesn't mean you \ncompromise your principles, but it means that you can compromise \nbecause that is what the American people want us to do. Yes; they do.\n  I wish to give an example. Say you were out hiking. Mr. President, in \nyour State there are a lot of hikers. If you saw someone on a cliff, \ntrapped, caught on a rope and you knew the only way to save the person \nwas first to cut the rope--you are standing with someone else and you \nsay: Cut the rope at the top. He says: Cut the rope at the bottom, and \nyou stand there arguing; meanwhile, the man is struggling on this \ncliff: Get me down. Wouldn't it be smart to cut the rope in the middle \nand save the guy? You can argue later, should I have cut the rope at \nthe top or the bottom--no, cut it in the middle, save the man.\n  That is a pretty simplistic example of where we are. But I have the \nprivilege of knowing we can get it done when we work together. I was so \nproud to bring to this Senate a highway bill, a transportation bill. \nMillions of jobs were at stake. Our States were worried they would stop \ngetting their highway funds. We would have had to stop road projects in \nthe middle. We would not have had State funding for transit. But you \nknow what happened. Senator Inhofe and I sat in a room. You could not \nfind two more divergent people in their thinking, he a conservative \nRepublican and I a progressive Democrat. We sat in a room and he said I \nwant this, this, and this. I said I want that, that, and that. Then we \nsaid let's make a deal. Let's meet in the middle. We did it--much to \neveryone's surprise--and that bill passed the Senate.\n  When it got to the House, it got stuck. So Senator Inhofe and I and \nSenator Reid went over to meet with John Boehner and Chairman Mica and \nwe all agreed we would get it done. Neither side got everything they \nwanted. Anyone who takes that position, in my opinion, is not putting \ncountry first. I don't care whether they are Republican, Democrat or \nanything else.\n  We are not, each of us, going to get everything we want, Lord knows. \nThere is a lot I could do if I had a wand and could make it happen. But \neverybody has a different view of exactly how to go forward. I think we \nare being tested.\n  I know it is tough going. I know if we do not get a deal, it does not \nstop there; we will keep on working. But there is no reason on this \nbeautiful, God's green Earth why we cannot get a deal. If everyone is \nsincere and saying they want the middle class to be protected, we can \nget a deal. President Obama says $250,000 is the line. Maybe I think \n$350,000 is the line; maybe someone else, $500,000; maybe someone else, \n$150,000. We can meet somewhere and cut that rope somewhere in the \nmiddle and save this country from the uncertainty that plagues us right \nnow.\n  In the olden days--when I say ``olden,'' it is a long time ago--I was \na stockbroker. I was an economics major and a stockbroker on Wall \nStreet. The thing Wall Street and investors cannot take is uncertainty. \nIf they know taxes are going up, they will refigure things. If they \nknow taxes are going down, they will refigure things. If they know \ntaxes are staying the same, they will figure it out. But right now they \nare frozen because they do not know. Families are also, in many ways, \nfrozen. They do not know whether they have to budget so they will have \n$2,000 less next year. They do not know whether it will be $4,000. They \ndon't know if it is ever going to change. The uncertainty is the fault \nof leaders who cannot get together. I think it is critical that we get \na deal, and I hope it is in the next couple of hours.\n  I believe it was a reporter who asked me: What is the difference if \nit is done now or 5 days from now?\n  I said the difference is this uncertainty, this pall, and an unneeded \nescalating crisis.\n  Then someone might say: Well, we don't have to do it now. We will do \nit on January 4. Well, we don't have to do it on January 4; we will get \nit done on the 10th.\n  We need to get it done. America wants us to get it done.\n  The President has shown that he is willing to be flexible. He has \ncome out with some ideas that I have to swallow--very hard--to accept. \nI know personally how strongly he feels that $250,000 should be where \nwe draw the line when we allow tax breaks, but he was willing to offer \n$400,000. He was willing to look at changing some of our programs. It \nis very tough for him to do that, but he is willing to do that even \nthough he ran on his program and won by millions of votes on his \nprogram.\n  So if the President can be flexible and say: OK, I will step back \nfrom everything I really want to do and move in the direction of the \nRepublicans, then the Republicans need to move in our direction. I \nthink we are going to be judged by whether we are going to be stuck in \nthe mud because we just don't have the courage to change or whether we \nstep forward at this moment. I think it should be this moment.\n  If we cannot get it done, I certainly hope we will have an up-or-down \nvote on the President's plan, which I feel was very fair. The President \noffered a plan. Do I like everything about it? Absolutely not. But he \nshowed he is willing to take those steps. I would hate to think our \ncolleagues would filibuster that and demand a 60-vote threshold as we \ngo over this cliff.\n  The American people are hanging from the cliff, and we can let them\n\n[[Page S8523]]\n\ndown very gently today and solve this problem. If all we do is stand \nand stay in our corners, I am very fearful the message is that we don't \nknow how to meet each other halfway, and that is not a good thing. \nVoters are going to turn on those people who stand in their corners and \ndon't move. That is not the role of legislators.\n  I will close with this. We have a different form of government than \nthey have in Europe. This is not a parliamentary system. In a \nparliamentary system, one government rules everything, one party rules \neverything. They have the Prime Minister, the equivalent of the \nSpeaker, and the leader all in one party, and then they don't \ncompromise. They put their agenda there and get their program through. \nIf there is a lack of confidence, the people can change parties. The \nnext party then comes in and does what it wants. That is not what we do \nhere.\n  Sometimes I wish it were the form of government we had because at \nleast there would be some action and we would know what to expect. We \nwould not have this uncertainty because each party has its dreams, its \nhopes, its plans, and they would have a chance to get those policies \nthrough. We don't have that here. We have to meet each other halfway \nbecause the House is run by the Republicans, and it will be next year. \nThe Senate is run by the Democrats, but it is not a supermajority. We \nhave to deal with our colleagues. The President is a Democrat. We have \nto work together. That is the name of the game.\n  If I can work with Jim Inhofe on the highway bill and Debbie Stabenow \ncan work with Pat Roberts on the farm bill--and there are other \nexamples I could give. For instance, Senator Feinstein worked with her \nRepublican counterpart. I could give many examples on the \nAppropriations Committee. We know we can do this. We just have to take \na deep breath and put our egos aside for this country's sake and make \nthose compromises that allow us to still stand tall. I am only 5 feet, \nso that's hard, but you get the point.\n  We can do this, and we should do it now. If we don't do it now, we \nshould vote on the President's plan because the people of this country \ndeserve better than to be left hanging on a cliff. They don't deserve \nthat. It is not right.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum. I ask that the \ntime be equally divided between the two sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Happy New Year, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak about the nominee for Commissioner of \nFHA, Carol Galante. I opposed her nomination earlier in the year \nbecause of some concerns about what the FHA may or may not do; however, \nI had no concern whatsoever about her qualifications or ability. She is \ncoming up in the second vote today, and I want to put on the record my \nwholehearted support for the Senate reaching the 60 votes necessary to \nconfirm her appointment, and I want to explain why.\n  There are some people in the Chamber who justifiably have concerns \nabout the FHA, its liability on insurance and the fact that it is \nbearing so much of the burden on housing finance. But that is not the \nFHA's fault, that is the fault of Dodd-Frank. The restrictions on \nlenders would have forced FHA to be the lender of last resort--or most \nresort--for most American people. That is something we in the Senate \nhave the ability to fix, but we should not punish a talented, \nexperienced, well-qualified, and highly recognized individual who knows \nhousing, both multi and single family, from being Commissioner of the \nFHA.\n  So I rise to say to any Member that if they have a problem with the \nFHA, don't take it out on Ms. Galante. Look at what happened after the \npassage of Dodd-Frank and the fact that the FHA had to take on the \nburden because there was no other alternative in housing finance. What \nwe need to do, rather than defeating good nominees for office, is give \nthose nominees the kinds of underpinnings where the laws allow capital \nto flow to the mortgage market through various and numerous entities so \nthe whole burden doesn't have to be borne by the FHA and the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  I rise with pleasure to say I will vote in favor of Carol Galante as \nCommissioner of the FHA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak behind the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia. He has more experience in the housing market than \nany Senator in the Senate and always speaks with eloquence and balance. \nI would like to second what he said.\n  I spent a lot of time with the nominee, Carol Galante. She is \ntechnically very proficient. Over the past 2 weeks she has put in place \nreforms that are very strong. It is just a start. I know a lot more \nneeds to happen at FHA, but she has put in place some very significant \nreforms.\n  I know we have been losing billions of dollars at FHA--and I think \nseniors have been taking advantage of it--on something called a full-\ndraw fixed-rate reverse mortgage. The advertisements for that have been \non TV. The FHA has been losing its shirt over that program. She ended \nthat program--or will end it by the end of January--on her own, along \nwith doing some other things relative to debt-to-income. That is one \nexample of why I think she is technically very proficient.\n  I know there are Members of this body today who may work against her \nbecause they are very dissatisfied with what has been happening at FHA. \nCandidly, much of that is due to us. We need to pass some legislation \nto deal with FHA, and we have been resistant to do that. I know Johnny \nIsakson, David Vitter, and others in our body have been pushing for us \nto address that. I know the Presiding Officer serves on the Banking \nCommittee with me, and we know reforms need to take place.\n  Here is what I would say. The main reason FHA is in the problem it is \nin is due to loans that were made back in 2006, 2007, 2008, and the \nbeginning of 2009. What is happening is that the losses from those \nloans are just now kicking in. There is no question that FHA has some \nissues relative to their economic value, but there have been five \nincreases in rates at FHA recently to try to get it back to where it \nneeds to be.\n  So what I would say to my friends on this side of the aisle is that \nif we think the FHA can get better by not having a Commissioner, I find \nthat to be kind of strange. She has been the Acting Commissioner since \nDavid Stevens left. It seems to me we would be much better having \nsomebody in that position who is actually accountable and able to bring \npermanent staff with her. They know the issues that are going to need \nto be dealt with at FHA.\n  Again, I think I have spent about as much time with her as anybody in \nthis body. I know Senator Isakson has done the same. I find her to be \nvery technically proficient. Over the last few weeks I have seen her do \nsome bold things relative to the debt-to-income ratio with some of the \nFHA participants. We need to do something about the loan amounts at \nFHA. They are at 729 now. At some point, they probably need to drop \ndown once we get the rest of the market working in the fashion it \nshould be.\n  I wholeheartedly support her in this position. There is a lot of work \nthat needs to take place at the FHA. I think she is somebody who has \nthe ability to carry that out. The biggest issue with FHA right now is \nthis body and the folks down the hallway. We need to pass legislation \nto deal with overall housing finance. I know Senator Isakson from \nGeorgia is going to be very involved with that. I hope to be involved, \nand my guess is the Presiding Officer is going to be involved as well.\n  My sense is that we need to have someone who is running the FHA to \nhelp it to work better. I hope my colleagues on this side of the \naisle--hopefully many of them--will join in giving her strong support \ntoday and work closely with her to help the FHA to be the kind of place \nit ought to be. I agree with the Senator from Georgia in that\n\n[[Page S8524]]\n\nit should not have the market share it has today, but a big part of \nthat has to do with our inaction in this body and our inability to thus \nfar deal with GSE.\n  I hope many Members will join in supporting Carol Galante.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thirteen minutes for the majority.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Presiding Officer let me know when I have talked \nfor 4 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The chair will let the Senator \nknow.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Corker for his \nremarks and join in with his support for Carol Galante. She has a long \nand distinguished career of building and promoting affordable housing, \nand she is very well qualified.\n  She began her career as a housing coordinator for the city of Santa \nBarbara, rising to become the city's housing and redevelopment manager. \nI want to point out that Santa Barbara is a magnificent part of my \nState. I have a beautiful State. At the time, they didn't have much in \nthe way of moderate-income housing, and that was part of the very \nimportant work she did.\n  She moved on to Eden Housing, a nonprofit affordable-housing \ndeveloper, where she developed over 400 homes as a project manager. She \neventually took over as executive director.\n  She later joined BRIDGE Housing as vice president, and in 1996 she \ntook the helm of that organization as its president and chief \nexecutive. BRIDGE is the largest nonprofit developer of affordable-\nincome and mixed-use developments in California. While she was there, \nCarol oversaw the creation of 13,000 affordable homes for more than \n35,000 Californians and programs that helped one-fourth of their \nresidents advance to home ownership because she knew that was the goal. \nHome ownership, even after all we have been through, is the dream, and \nshe understands that.\n  So in 2009, President Obama appointed Carol as HUD's Deputy Assistant \nSecretary for multifamily housing programs where she oversaw a $50 \nbillion portfolio of affordable and market rate multifamily properties \nthrough FHA's multifamily insurance program. At a time when support for \nhousing was desperately needed, she took a smaller staff and grew \nannual lending from $2.5 billion to over $10 billion.\n  Carol has served for a year now as Acting Commissioner for FHA where \nshe has worked to weed out bad lenders, ensuring greater stability of \nthe reverse mortgage program, and increasing counseling resources for \nborrowers. As we look over what happened in the housing sector, we know \npeople bought homes who shouldn't have bought homes, lenders took \nadvantage of them, and everybody was in the mix in terms of why things \nwent so sour.\n  Carol's accomplishments have been recognized through numerous honors, \nincluding inductions into the Hall of Fame for Bay Area business \nleaders in California. She has been recognized by California Home \nBuilding and the California Housing Consortium. So she gets support \nfrom everybody--from the builders, from the homeowners, from the \nrenters.\n  Carol has the strong support of a broad coalition of housing \nadvocates and lenders. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from the Mortgage Bankers Association and a letter from \nwhat looks to be two or three dozen other housing organizations.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 26, 2012.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leaders Reid and McConnell: The members of the \n     Mortgage Bankers Association, the National Association of \n     Home Builders, and the National Association of Realtors wish \n     to offer our continued support of the nomination of Carol \n     Galante to be Assistant Secretary for Housing and Federal \n     Housing Administration (FHA) Commissioner at the U.S. \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\n       FHA continues to play a critical role as the overall \n     housing market struggles toward recovery. FHA is especially \n     vital to homebuyers who may need a little ``extra help'' \n     securing safe, decent, and affordable housing, focusing more \n     on the needs of first-time, minority, and low- and moderate-\n     income borrowers than any other national program. At present, \n     approximately 77 percent of FHA-insured home purchase loans \n     are made to first-time homebuyers, and 31 percent of these \n     first-time homebuyers are minorities.\n       FHA has also played an important role in the financing of \n     multifamily rental housing, which has enabled the \n     construction and rehabilitation of needed affordable rental \n     units, as private market sources of capital have not been \n     available. Since FY2008, FHA's commitments in multifamily \n     loans grew from $2 billion to $13 billion in FY2011. Because \n     of its essential role in the current housing marketplace, FHA \n     must have a seasoned leader to direct its mission at this \n     crucial time in all geographic areas of the country.\n       Carol Galante will bring tremendous expertise and a deep \n     commitment to strengthening FHA's program areas to the post \n     of Commissioner. Her decades of work in affordable housing \n     development and more recently, managing FHA's multifamily \n     programs, give her a unique perspective on the issues facing \n     our nation's housing and mortgage markets. This experience \n     and practical understanding will serve her well in this new \n     position.\n       Our organizations are eager to continue working with Ms. \n     Galante in this capacity when she is confirmed, and we are \n     pleased that the Senate reached an agreement to consider her \n     nomination next week. We hope that the full Senate will \n     approve her nomination when it comes to a vote. Thank you in \n     advance for your consideration of these views.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mortgage Bankers Association.\n     National Association of Home Builders.\n     National Association of Realtors.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                November 16, 2011.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, U.S. \n         Senate, Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Shelby: The \n     undersigned organizations strongly endorse the nomination of \n     Carol J. Galante as Assistant Secretary for Housing/Federal \n     Housing Commissioner. We believe her tenure as Acting \n     Commissioner, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily \n     Housing and her 31-year long private sector real estate \n     experience has prepared her well to be the Assistant \n     Secretary. We urge you to approve her nomination.\n       As Acting Commissioner, Ms. Galante already has had several \n     impressive achievements. She spearheaded a major overhaul of \n     the HUD Housing Counseling Program, including establishing \n     the new Office of Housing Counseling. The changes to HUD's \n     Housing Counseling Program will improve effectiveness, better \n     target resources to maximize efficiency and ensure that HUD \n     grant funds achieve maximum impact in the communities where \n     they are invested.\n       She also prioritized a global review of the Home Equity \n     Conversion Mortgage (HECM or reverse mortgage) program, \n     including issuing guidance to the industry on the use of \n     borrower financial assessments and analysis of other \n     potential changes to ensure the long-term stability of this \n     important program.\n       As the nation contends with the foreclosure crisis, Ms. \n     Galante has ensured that taxpayers are protected from waste, \n     fraud and abuse by holding lenders accountable for non-\n     compliance with the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) \n     requirements. This included the November 1, 2011 suspension \n     of Allied Home Mortgage Corporation and its President; the \n     withdrawal of 11 lenders from FHA's program and the \n     imposition of more than $1.5 million in civil money penalties \n     on non-compliant lenders.\n       Lastly, she oversaw the publication of two significant \n     Mortgagee Letters that outline changes to FHA's requirements \n     for lenders, making FHA programs work more effectively for \n     FHA's lender partners.\n       Prior to becoming Acting Commissioner, she led the \n     Multifamily Housing Division of FHA, with 1600 employees and \n     53 field offices. Ms. Galante was responsible for a $50 \n     billion portfolio of affordable and market rate multifamily \n     properties through the FHA Multifamily Insurance Program, as \n     well as the administration of the $9 billion Project Based \n     Rental Assistance Program and the 202/811 grant programs for \n     elderly and disabled housing.\n       And before she began her federal service, she was President \n     and Chief Executive of BRIDGE Housing, California's largest \n     non-profit housing development corporation, and its affiliate \n     companies. This included overseeing a Property Management \n     company, an economic development corporation, senior\n\n[[Page S8525]]\n\n     services and land development. BRIDGE is widely known as a \n     leading practitioner using the best private sector business \n     practices and entrepreneurial ideas to build affordable homes \n     and apartments in a wide variety of communities.\n       As the nation's housing market remains fragile, we need Ms. \n     Galante's demonstrated experience at FHA to provide \n     leadership on and practical solutions to America's housing \n     challenges. We urge you to approve Ms. Galante to take on \n     this challenge.\n           Sincerely,\n       Affordable Housing Tax Credit Coalition; Center for \n     American Progress Action Fund; Center for Responsible \n     Lending; Consortium for Citizens With Disabilities Housing \n     Task Force; Corporation for Enterprise Development; \n     Corporation for Supportive Housing; Council of Large Public \n     Housing Authorities; Council of State Community Development \n     Agencies; Enterprise Community Partners, Inc.; Habitat for \n     Humanity; Housing Assistance Council; Housing Partnership \n     Network; LeadingAge; Local Initiatives Support Corporation; \n     Low Income Investment Fund; McCormack Baron Salazar; Mortgage \n     Bankers Association.\n       National Affordable Housing Management Association; \n     National Alliance on Mental Illness; National Alliance to End \n     Homelessness; National Association of Affordable Housing \n     Lenders; National Association of Housing & Redevelopment \n     Officials; National Association of Local Housing Finance \n     Agencies; National Community Reinvestment Coalition; National \n     Community Stabilization Trust; National Housing & \n     Rehabilitation Association; National Housing Conference; \n     National Housing Trust; National Leased Housing Association; \n     National Low Income Housing Coalition; Self-Help; Stewards of \n     Affordable Housing for the Future; The Community Builders; \n     Volunteers of America.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to read from a letter the majority \nand minority leaders received from the Mortgage Bankers Association, \nthe National Association of Homebuilders, and the National Association \nof Realtors. These are the businesspeople, and this is what they said \nabout her:\n\n       Carol Galante will bring tremendous expertise and a deep \n     commitment to strengthening FHA's programs . . . Her decades \n     of work in affordable housing development and more recently, \n     managing FHA's multifamily programs, give her a unique \n     perspective on the issues facing our nation's housing and \n     mortgage markets.\n\n  So here we have a person who understands the business side, and she \nunderstands the renters and the owners.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for an additional 30 seconds, please.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So we have someone who understands the business side, the \nrenter side, and the home ownership side.\n  I am very proud this woman is a Californian. I know there are lots of \nissues within FHA, and we all have to work on them, and we have heard \nthat from Senator Corker. But, my goodness, we want someone who can \nwork with us. She is the perfect person.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  In a short while the Senate will vote on two nominees for service in \nthe executive branch of our government. I rise today to speak in \nsupport of one of those two, which is William Baer, who has been \nnominated to serve as Assistant Attorney General managing the Antitrust \nDivision of the U.S. Department of Justice.\n  I happen to have come to know Bill Baer personally because he \npractices law in a firm with a very good friend and neighbor of mine \nhere in Washington, and in that regard I can certainly testify to the \nfact that he is an honorable, interesting, enjoyable person. But that \nalone doesn't qualify him to hold this high office. He has \nextraordinary experience. I would say he is very widely acknowledged as \none of the best antitrust lawyers in our country. I would say this \nnomination is really a merit selection nomination. I will get to that \nin a minute.\n  Bill Baer graduated from Lawrence University and the School of Law at \nStanford University. He has served with distinction throughout his \ncareer, earning accolades such as recognition as the Washington, DC, \nAntitrust Lawyer of the Year by Best Lawyers, as well as one of the \ndecade's most influential lawyers by the National Law Journal.\n  He is currently head of the Antitrust Practice Group of a very \ndistinguished firm based in Washington, Arnold & Porter, and there he \ndraws on his 35 years of experience in civil and criminal investigation \nto manage that firm's work in the areas of antitrust litigation, \ninternational cartel investigations, and merger and acquisition \nreviews.\n  In an earlier chapter in his life, Bill Baer served over several \nperiods at the Federal Trade Commission, rising from a trial attorney \nduring his first term there in 1975 to serve as assistant to the \nchairman, then assistant general counsel, and between 1995 and 1999 as \nDirector of the Bureau of Competition.\n  Here is the point I think really speaks to the fact that Bill Baer's \nnomination to head the Antitrust Division is nonpartisan and based on \nhis extraordinary capabilities. His nomination has received a letter of \nsupport signed by 12 prior Assistant Attorneys General for the \nAntitrust Division of the Department of Justice who served between 1972 \nand 2011, and these include people who have led the Antitrust Division \nfrom President Nixon through Presidents of both political parties, to \nPresident Obama. His nomination has also received a letter of support \nsigned by each chair of the Section of Antitrust Law of the American \nBar Association--those who have served as chair of that section between \n1977 and 2011. So 29 of the most distinguished practitioners of \nantitrust law from all around the country, all different political \npersuasions, have written in support of this nomination.\n  I just wanted to take this opportunity to say it is an honor to not \njust thank the President for this nomination but to thank Bill Baer for \nbeing willing to leave a quite successful law practice to return to the \nservice of our country in an area that is critically important to our \nfree market economy in which he happens to be one of our Nation's \nforemost experts.\n  So I hope my colleagues will support the nomination of Bill Baer when \nit comes to a vote very soon this afternoon.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes this \nafternoon to explain why I will be opposing the nomination of Carol \nGalante and why I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \ndo the same.\n  This nomination is not one of the many ``go along to get along'' \nnominations we do so often in the Senate; this is a nomination that \nwill have a direct effect on our constituents' pocketbooks and it \ndemands, I believe, our serious attention today.\n  Carol Galante has been the Acting Assistant Secretary and Federal \nHousing Commissioner at the Department of Housing and Urban Development \nsince July 2011. Therefore, this nomination vote, in a sense, will \nserve as a referendum of sorts on the current management of the Federal \nHousing Administration.\n  Ms. Galante, in her role as Acting FHA Commissioner, has failed to \ntake serious actions to shore up the solvency and prevent a taxpayer \nbailout of the Federal Housing Administration that we know as FHA.\n  The latest actuarial report shows that FHA has a negative economic \nvalue, and a taxpayer bailout is most likely. Despite these warnings, \nFHA waited until April 2012 to raise additional premiums, and Secretary \nDonovan, the Secretary of HUD, has testified to the Senate Banking \nCommittee that it will wait until next year to increase premiums by a \nmeager 10 basis points despite having statutory authority to do more to \nprotect the taxpayers.\n  Ms. Galante has denied the true severity of the problems at the FHA. \nIn a New York Times piece last year, Ms. Galante said: ``[there] is no \nevidence or widespread prediction that home prices are going to decline \nto the kind of levels'' that would require a bailout.\n  Really? Yet although some prices have risen slightly, the FHA's \nfinancial position continues to deteriorate. Several experts now \nconclude that a taxpayer bailout is simply a matter of time.\n  The 2012 actuarial report and the disastrous state of FHA's finances \nled the Washington Post editorial board to conclude:\n\n       Right now the critics are starting to look pretty \n     prescient. . . . Affordable possession of one's own home is \n     the American dream. Government support for excessive \n     borrowing has turned into a national nightmare.\n\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\n\n  The FHA's capital reserve is still well below the level determined by \nCongress to be the bare minimum to cover FHA's future losses. Even \nthough FHA narrowly avoided a bailout this year, dangers remain in the \nyears ahead due to its over $1 trillion exposure to risky loans and \nprecarious economic conditions.\n  Most of the FHA's recent actions have only concealed these dangers. \nFor example, instead of adequately raising insurance premiums over the \nlife of the loan, FHA has increased upfront premiums to simply cover \nlosses in the short term. Also, upfront premiums can be rolled into the \nmortgage principal balance, thereby decreasing equity for borrows who, \nin most cases, have little equity to begin with. Increasing the upfront \npremiums could make FHA loans even riskier for both the borrower and \nthe taxpayer who stands behind the mortgages.\n  I believe it is time to face the reality that the Federal Housing \nAdministration is dangerously undercapitalized, and because of the lack \nof serious reform FHA teeters on the brink of a bailout, as I have \nsaid.\n  Andrew Kaplan, a New York University economics professor said:\n\n       They [the FHA] are doing very badly . . . there's no two \n     ways about it. Over the next five years, there won't be \n     enough of an economic recovery to fix FHA's finances. Not a \n     chance.\n\n  A study by a Wharton professor estimates that an FHA bailout could \ncost between $50 billion and $100 billion and warned that only a \n``quick and substantial economic and housing market recovery'' can \navoid ``substantial losses for the American taxpayer.''\n  Data from the actuarial report shows that the serious delinquency \nrate for all FHA loans is 9.6 percent. The delinquency rates for loans \noriginated in 2006, 2007, and 2008 are between 20 and 30 percent. \nApproximately 739,000 loans are seriously delinquent, an increase of \nover 100,000 loans from last year. If the borrowers of these delinquent \nloans all default on their mortgages, it would result in $57 billion in \nclaims to the FHA. We hope that would not happen.\n  The FHA's latest quarterly report shows capital resources of $32 \nbillion. It also states that cash flow from operations, which largely \nconsists of premium revenues, covered only 80 percent of net claims \nlast quarter.\n  The latest actuarial report in 2012 confirms that FHA's finances are \ndramatically worse than last year.\n  FHA's capital ratio has gone negative for the first time since 1991, \nand economic value is in excess of negative $16 billion. Last year the \nreport projected a $9.4 billion value, representing a decline of $24.9 \nbillion.\n  FHA's delinquencies continue to rise and continued high loan limits \nkeep FHA's role in the market very broad. The projected loss on \noutstanding business is at an all-time $39 billion.\n  FHA is leveraged at 422:1--422:1--and has a sparse $2.55 billion \nequity cushion on its over $1 trillion portfolio. Think about it. FHA \nhas underestimated its loan losses every year for the past 3 years.\n  In addition, since the Treasury Department already has so-called \npermanent and indefinite authority to provide funding for the FHA, a \nbailout of the FHA could occur without, as the Presiding Officer knows, \nany congressional vote. This is not a vote today to determine whether \nwe support the President. This is also not a vote to determine whether \nwe can vote in a bipartisan manner. I think this is a vote to determine \nwhether we support the American taxpayer.\n  I believe Ms. Galante has demonstrated her inability to identify the \nmultitude of problems at the FHA, and I believe it is incumbent upon \nus, on behalf of the American people--the taxpayers--to reject this \nnomination and demand real reforms at FHA and a nominee who represents \nand appreciates the urgency of this situation and a willingness to \naddress it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, very briefly--I know the Senator from Ohio \nwants to make some comments--I very much enjoy working with the Senator \nfrom Alabama. He has been outstanding on the Banking Committee, and I \nagree with almost every criticism he has made regarding the FHA. As a \nmatter of fact, we have stood together trying to cause the housing \nindustry to work much better than it is for not just those trying to \npurchase homes but, obviously, the American taxpayers to whom he just \nalluded.\n  But I wish to also point out something that was just said. One of the \nmain reasons the FHA is in the problem it is in is the loans that were \nmade in 2006, 2007, and 2008--long before this nominee was there. I \nagree this nominee needs to be more aggressive in making changes, and I \nagree that, even more so, this Congress needs to be more aggressive in \nmaking changes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the nominee to myself \nregarding reforms that are being implemented between now and January 1 \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of Housing and\n\n\n                                            Urban Development,\n\n                               Washington, DC, December, 18, 2012.\n     Senator Bob Corker,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Corker: Thank you for commitment to the health \n     and stability of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), as \n     expressed most recently at the December 6, 2012 Senate \n     Banking Committee and through your proposed amendment \n     designed to strengthen and protect FHA's Mutual Mortgage \n     Insurance Fund. Secretary Donovan and I share your concerns \n     and I am committed to continuing to take aggressive action to \n     rebuild the reserves of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, \n     which have been so negatively impacted by the legacy loans \n     insured by FHA--particularly those from the 2007-2009 \n     vintages.\n       As you know, the actions we have taken to date, including \n     those recently announced in our Annual Report to Congress, \n     are designed to increase recoveries from this legacy book, \n     price risk appropriately on new loans, and begin to shrink \n     FHA's presence in the market. You and I agree, however, that \n     more can and should be done to correct fundamental structural \n     problems in FHA's reverse mortgage program (the Home Equity \n     Conversion Mortgage, or HECM, program), and to refine FHA's \n     risk profile so that both FHA and borrowers are better able \n     to weather the difficulties of any future downturn in the \n     housing market and economy. We are also committed to measures \n     that facilitate the return of private capital to the market. \n     I appreciate your strong advocacy to ensure that FHA takes \n     the actions needed to restore its financial health. I would \n     like to address each of the four critical policies you raised \n     and the immediate actions FHA is taking to address them:\n       1. Minimum Credit Score for New FHA Loans: FHA is \n     finalizing a formal policy directive (Mortgagee Letter) that \n     will require borrowers with credit scores below 620 to have a \n     maximum total debt-to-income (DTI) ratio no greater than 43 \n     percent in order for their loan applications to be approved \n     through FHA's TOTAL Scorecard, a system used by lenders to \n     score the quality of an FHA loan application. If a borrower's \n     DTI exceeds 43 percent, lenders will be required to manually \n     underwrite the loan, and to document compensating factors \n     that qualify the borrower for FHA-insured financing, such as \n     a larger down payment or a higher level of reserves. Our \n     preliminary data indicate that this requirement would reduce \n     claim rates by approximately 20 percent for borrowers with \n     credit scores of 620 or below. I believe this policy change \n     will significantly strengthen the extent to which FHA is \n     protected from unwarranted risk and borrowers are offered \n     loans that are sustainable for them.\n       2. Moratorium on the Full-draw HECM Reverse Mortgage: \n     Through the HECM program, seniors have access to a number of \n     different product options. However, in recent years, several \n     structural problems have developed that have altered the \n     usage of FHA's HECM products, changing the risks associated \n     with the program. While declining home prices and greater \n     longevity of seniors have yielded greater projected losses, \n     another major contributor has been the lack of a secondary \n     market for these loans. There are many explanations for the \n     evolution of these complexities, but the end result has been \n     an increase in risk to both FHA and borrowers that must be \n     rectified immediately. As discussed in our Annual Report to \n     Congress, FHA is preparing a policy directive that would \n     result in the immediate cessation of the use of the Standard \n     Fixed Rate HECM product. This product currently represents a \n     large majority of the loans insured through the HECM program, \n     with the Variable Rate Standard product and the HECM Saver \n     products (Fixed Rate and Variable) representing the balance. \n     The amount that can be drawn under the Saver product is \n     substantially less than under the Standard program, and the \n     upfront fees to the borrower are all but eliminated for Saver \n     loans. Eliminating the use of the Fixed Rate Standard program \n     is an immediate stop gap measure, and FHA will also commence \n     rulemaking to make several other important changes, including \n     establishing formal guidelines for conducting financial \n     assessments of borrowers and the creation of set-asides for \n     payment of taxes and insurance.\n\n[[Page S8527]]\n\n       3. Scale Back of FHA Market Share: In June 2012, FHA began \n     administratively pricing mortgage insurance premiums for \n     large loans (loans above $625,500) at a level 25 basis points \n     higher than those with lower loan limits (150 bps compared to \n     125 bps). FHA, as mandated by Congress, is currently the only \n     federal entity able to insure loans between $625,500 and \n     $729,000. FHA is committed to taking steps to redirect this \n     business to the private market where it has typically been \n     served. With the premium increase we announced in November, \n     these large loans will now be priced at the current statutory \n     maximum for annual mortgage insurance premiums (155 bps). \n     Further, FHA will implement a policy change that lowers the \n     maximum loan-to-value ratio on loans above $625,500 to 95% \n     from 96.5%, or in other words, raising the down payment from \n     3.5% to 5% for these loans. The combination of a higher down \n     payment and higher mortgage insurance premiums for these \n     loans will continue our efforts to drive this business to the \n     private market.\n       4. Access to FHA Loans After a Foreclosure: Borrowers are \n     able to access FHA-insured financing three years after they \n     have experienced a foreclosure only if they have \n     reestablished good credit and qualify for an FHA loan in \n     accordance with the fully documented underwriting \n     requirements for any FHA-insured mortgage origination. FHA is \n     concerned that a few lenders are inappropriately advertising \n     and soliciting borrowers with the false pretense that they \n     can somehow ``automatically'' qualify after three years. \n     First and foremost, FHA will step up its enforcement for FHA-\n     approved lenders with regard to such advertising and remind \n     them of their duty to fully underwrite loan applications in \n     accordance with FHA guidelines. In addition, the credit \n     score/DTI policy outlined above will be applicable to \n     borrowers seeking to obtain FHA-insured financing following a \n     foreclosure. Furthermore, FHA is committed to performing \n     additional data analysis to determine if the original cause \n     of a borrower's foreclosure was due to a one-time economic \n     event, such as the loss of employment that has since been \n     regained, and whether that results in any different or better \n     performance than other reasons for foreclosure. This effort \n     may inform future policies in this area. Finally, as \n     discussed in our Annual Report to Congress, FHA is also \n     committed to structuring a new housing counseling initiative \n     that would apply to a number of borrower classifications, \n     including borrowers with previous foreclosures.\n       Senator, I deeply appreciate the advocacy, focus, and \n     concern you bring to ensuring that the Mutual Mortgage \n     Insurance Fund is restored to financial health as rapidly as \n     possible. I share your sense of urgency about these matters, \n     and I commit to you that I will move on these additional \n     actions by January 31, 2013, and I have confirmed that the \n     Administration will support these new policies. You have my \n     word on this and I expect to be held accountable to perform.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Carol J. Galante,\n\n                          Acting Assistant Secretary for Housing--\n                                     Federal Housing Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Again, I wish to thank the Senator from Alabama for his \ncomments regarding FHA. I agree; a lot has to change. I just think we \nare much better having a Director there to try to make those changes \nhappen than not.\n  With that, I yield the floor and see the Senator from Ohio in the \nChamber.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee, \nwho is a valued member of the Banking Committee. I thank him for his \ncomments in support of Ms. Galante's nomination, and I appreciate some \nof the criticisms Senator Shelby offered. I wish to answer a couple of \nthose but then move directly to Ms. Galante and concur in the support \nfor Ms. Galante from Senator Corker.\n  Two years ago, Senator Begich and I introduced an FHA reform bill \nwhich, unfortunately, because of people on the other side, has been \nblocked, for whatever reasons.\n  Two weeks ago, we tried to pass the FHA Emergency Fiscal Solvency \nAct--a commonsense reform measure that came out of the House of \nRepresentatives, sponsored by a Republican from Illinois, Congressman \nBiggert. She is the chair of the relevant House Financial Services \nSubcommittee. It passed the House on a suspension, 402 to 7--an unusual \ndemonstration of bipartisanship in the House of Representatives.\n  Passing that bill would not have prevented action next Congress. Yet \nsome of my colleagues again stand in the way of these taxpayer \nprotections.\n  Let me turn to Ms. Galante and the reasons I am supporting her \nnomination.\n  As an Ohioan, I am inclined to support an Ohio Wesleyan graduate who \nis married to an Akron native. Obviously, more important than that, she \nhas shown deep interest in the challenges facing the housing market in \nnortheast Ohio, a place that has been devastated by a hollowing out of \nour manufacturing base and preyed upon by unscrupulous subprime \nlenders--for a period of more than a decade, I might add.\n  She has met with the Cuyahoga County Land Bank, the Cleveland Housing \nNetwork, city officials to hear about all the great work people are \ndoing in northeast Ohio to rebuild the city's housing market. Some of \nthe most innovative ideas in the country have come out of Cleveland and \nthe land bank and the housing network.\n  After I sat down with her and shared stories of big banks that were \nallowing FHA properties in Cincinnati to fall into decay, FHA updated \nits servicing rules to hold these banks accountable.\n  FHA has selected Cleveland, Akron, and Canton for its next round of \nnote sales. This program allows for the sale of distressed and \ndelinquent FHA mortgages to parties that will rehabilitate the loans in \norder to help stabilize these neighborhoods.\n  Because of her many years of experience in housing and real estate \nand her commitment to addressing the crucial issues facing today's \nhardest hit cities--big cities and smaller cities alike--and what has \nhappened to these housing markets, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the Galante \nnomination.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \nnomination of Ms. Carol J. Galante to be HUD Assistant Secretary for \nHousing and Federal Housing Commissioner.\n  Carol Galante currently serves in the position for which she has been \nnominated. Prior to her designation as the Acting FHA Commissioner, Ms. \nGalante served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multifamily \nHousing Programs, overseeing HUD's FHA multifamily portfolio as well as \n1.6 million units of assisted housing.\n  The FHA is playing an important countercyclical role in the housing \nmarket, providing credit as private sources of capital have withdrawn. \nMuch has been done by the administration and Congress to strengthen \nFHA's underwriting and fiscal position in recent years. However, as we \nhave seen in a recent report on the financial status of the FHA, the \nlegacy of loans insured in prior years still pose a threat to the fund \nthat must be managed. It is important that the FHA have a confirmed \nmanagement team in place to continue oversight of these legacy loans. \nMs. Galante is a highly qualified nominee, and I urge my colleagues to \nconfirm her without delay.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            The Fiscal Cliff\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my office submitted our latest offer to \nthe majority leader last night at 7:10 p.m. and offered to work through \nthe night to find common ground. The majority leader's staff informed \nus they would be getting back to us this morning at 10 a.m., despite \nthe obvious time crunch we all have. It is now 2 p.m. We have yet to \nreceive a response to our good-faith offer. I am concerned about the \nlack of urgency here. I think we all know we are running out of time. \nThere is far too much at stake for political gamesmanship. We need to \nprotect the American families and businesses from this looming tax \nhike.\n  Everyone agrees action is necessary. In order to get things moving, I \nhave just spoken with the majority leader. I also placed a call to the \nVice President to see if he could help jump-start the negotiations on \nhis side. The Vice President and I have worked together on solutions \nbefore and I believe we can again.\n\n[[Page S8528]]\n\n  I want my colleagues to know that we will keep everyone updated. The \nconsequences of this are too high for the American people to be engaged \nin a political messaging campaign. I am interested in getting a result. \nI was here all day yesterday. As I indicated, we submitted our latest \nproposal at 7 p.m. last night. I am willing to work with whoever can \nhelp.\n  There is no single issue that remains an impossible sticking point. \nThe sticking point appears to be a willingness, an interest, or, \nfrankly, the courage to close the deal. I want everyone to know I am \nwilling to get this done, but I need a dance partner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been negotiating now for 36 hours or \nthereabouts. We did have conversations last night that ended late in \nthe evening between the staffs. This morning we have been trying to \ncome up with some counteroffer to my friend's proposal. We have been \nunable to do that.\n  I have had a number of conversations with the President. At this \nstage, we are not able to make a counteroffer. The Republican leader \nhas told me that--he just said here that he is working with the Vice \nPresident. I wish them well. In the meantime, I will continue to try to \ncome up with something, but at this stage, I do not have a counteroffer \nto make. Perhaps as the day wears on, I will be able to.\n  I will say that I think the Republican leader has shown absolute good \nfaith. It is just that we are apart on some pretty big issues.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, the Senate turns to the \nnomination of William Joseph Baer, of Maryland, to be an Assistant \nAttorney General. If confirmed he will head the Antitrust Division of \nthe Department of Justice. In considering the confirmation of the \nPresident's nominees, I give the President great deference. I believe \nhe should have great latitude in selecting his advisors and officers. \nBut that does not mean that I will not make an independent \ndetermination of the nominee's qualifications and fitness for the job. \nI am not here to merely rubberstamp the President's desires. Factors \nthat I consider relevant include respect for the Constitution, fidelity \nto the law, intellectual ability, personal integrity, and professional \ncompetence. In reviewing Mr. Baer's entire record, I was disappointed \nto find he does not meet this test. Therefore I will vote no on his \nconfirmation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to express my \nsupport for Carol Galante, who is from my home State of California, in \nher nomination for Commissioner of the Federal Housing Administration \nand Assistant Secretary for Housing.\n  The FHA Commissioner is directly responsible for oversight of the FHA \ninsurance portfolio, which includes single family, multifamily housing \nand insured health care facilities. Carol Galante has been serving in \nan acting capacity since last year, but it is critical that she be \nconfirmed by the Senate today.\n  While Acting FHA Commissioner, Carol Galante has made improvements to \nthe long term health and position of the FHA. It is important that we \nconfirm her to this position because continuing in an acting capacity \nadds to overall uncertainty in the market regarding the role of the \nFHA.\n  In the wake of the collapse of the housing bubble, the FHA has played \na vital role in providing access to credit for worthy homebuyers \nlooking to purchase a home. As the private mortgage insurance market \npulled back, the FHA has stepped in to make sure that credit-worthy \nborrowers have the ability to get a mortgage.\n  Carol Galante has taken steps as the Acting Commissioner to help FHA \nbetter manage risk, bolster the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund and \nstreamline programs to better enable FHA to fulfill its mission of \ncontributing to the creation and growth of stable, sustainable, \ninclusive communities.\n  This includes placing a moratorium on the troubled full drawdown \nreverse mortgage program, increasing underwriting standards for riskier \nborrowers, and increasing down payment requirements and insurance \npremiums for higher balance mortgages.\n  I believe that these steps will help enhance the future solvency of \nthe FHA while allowing the agency to fulfill its mission of providing \nlow-income and first time homebuyers with access to affordable mortgage \ncredit.\n  Carol Galante had decades of work experience in affordable housing \ndevelopment before she went to HUD to manage FHA's multifamily \nprograms; this gives her a unique perspective on the issues facing our \nNation's housing and mortgage markets.\n  In addition to her early work in the private sector in real estate \ndevelopment, ownership, and management, she worked for a number of \nCalifornia cities as a city planner and in community economic \ndevelopment.\n  These roles led to her eventual position for 25 years as president \nand chief executive of BRIDGE Housing Corporation, the largest \nnonprofit developer of affordable, mixed-income and mixed-use \ndevelopments in California. While at BRIDGE, she helped create \npartnerships between government, private industry and nonprofits.\n  This blend of public and private experience has been extremely \nvaluable for the Federal Housing Administration as it deal with both \nthe private loan and mortgage industry.\n  Given her demonstrated and unique experience in the housing market, I \nstrongly urge the confirmation of Carol J. Galante as Federal Housing \nAdministration Commissioner and Assistant Secretary for Housing.\n\n\n                 Vote on the Nomination of William Baer\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 2 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote on the Baer nomination.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. We yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of William Joseph Baer, of Maryland, to be an \nAssistant Attorney General?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachussetts (Mr. \nKerry), the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), and the Senator \nfrom Vermont (Mr. Leahy) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. \nChambliss), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. DeMint), the Senator \nfrom Nebraska (Mr. Johanns), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Kirk), the \nSenator from Ohio (Mr. Portman), and the Senator from Florida (Mr. \nRubio).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am glad that the Senate voted to confirm \nthe nomination of Bill Baer to serve as Assistant Attorney General in \nthe Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. His nomination has \nbeen pending for 10 months, and more than three\n\n[[Page S8529]]\n\nmonths have passed since the Judiciary Committee favorably reported his \nnomination with bipartisan support. The Antitrust Division has \ncontinued its important work with three acting heads who have worked \ndiligently to fulfill the mission of the office. But those solutions \nare only temporary, and it is essential that the Senate undertook its \nconstitutional responsibility to advise and consent on a permanent \ndivision head with responsibility for enforcing our Nation's antitrust \nlaws.\n  Mr. Baer is an outstanding candidate to fulfill this role. He has \nspent over 35 years working in the field of antitrust and consumer \nprotection law. He served as Director of the Bureau of Competition at \nthe Federal Trade Commission in the 1990s, and now chairs the Antitrust \nGroup at the law firm of Arnold & Porter. His nomination has received \nbipartisan support from leading practitioners of antitrust law, \nincluding 12 former heads of the Antitrust Division representing every \npresidential administration since 1972. His nomination has also \nreceived bipartisan support from 29 former chairs of the American Bar \nAssociation's Section on Antitrust Law, who praise his ``demonstrated \nability as an antitrust lawyer and his outstanding record of public \nservice.''\n  Bill Baer is a leading voice on antitrust matters. He advised the \nAntitrust Modernization Commission, and frequently contributes to \nworkshops at the Department of Justice and FTC. He was named one of \n``The Decade's Most Influential Lawyers'' by The National Law Journal \nin 2010, and the ``Leading Lawyer for Antitrust'' in 2011. Chambers, \nWho's Who, and the Legal 500 have all recognized him as one of our \ncountry's leading practitioners in antitrust law.\n  When the 12 former heads of the Antitrust Division wrote to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee in support of Mr. Baer's nomination earlier \nthis year, they wrote: ``Mr. Baer's tenure as Director of the [FTC] \nBureau of Competition was marked by principled, effective enforcement \nof the antitrust laws and . . . procedures that balanced the needs of \nthe Commission with the legitimate concerns of both businesses and \nconsumers. We are confident that he will continue the strong, rational, \nand nonpartisan antitrust enforcement tradition of the United States \nDepartment of Justice.''\n  After months and months of needless delays, Bill Baer can at last \nbegin that important work to help protect the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we had a brief colloquy, the Republican \nleader and I, before the vote. Now that everyone is on the floor, I \nwill elaborate a little bit. We have one more vote today. Then we are \nboth going to have our respective caucuses. We hope there will be an \nannouncement after that. We will have to wait and see.\n  Over the last 24 hours, we have been working with Senator McConnell's \nstaff and Senator McConnell to craft legislation to shield middle-class \nfamilies from huge tax increases that could pass both Chambers on a \nbipartisan basis. But I wish to be clear. There are still serious \ndifferences between the two sides. I am only going to talk about one. \nWe have made a lot of progress. I said earlier today, I appreciate very \nmuch Senator McConnell's good-faith efforts, and I am confident he \nfeels the same way about me.\n  The one thing I do want to mention is that we are not going to have \nany Social Security cuts. At this stage, that just doesn't seem \nappropriate. We are open to discussion about entitlement reforms, but \nwe are going to have to take it in a different direction. The present \nstatus will not work. We are willing to make difficult concessions as \npart of a balanced comprehensive agreement, but we will not agree to \ncut Social Security benefits as part of a small or short-term \nagreement, especially if that agreement gives more handouts to the \nrich.\n  With 36 hours left until the country goes over the Cliff, I remain \nhopeful but realistic about the prospects of reaching a bipartisan \nagreement. At some point in the negotiating process it becomes obvious, \nwhen the other side is intentionally demanding concessions they know \nthe other side is not willing to make, we are not there.\n  I hope we are going to be able to go further. Right now, with the \nstatus of the negotiations, we are not where we could come forward and \nsay we have this for you. As I indicated, and just to make another \nstatement in that regard, at some point in the negotiating process it \nappears there are things that stop us from moving forward. I hope we \nare not there, but we are getting real close, and that is why I still \nhold out hope we can get something done. I am not overly optimistic, \nbut I am cautiously optimistic we can get something done.\n  I hope I have made it clear we have one vote. That is all we have. I \nhope later in the evening there will be another vote or two, but right \nnow we don't have that. We have one scheduled vote, and that is taking \nplace right now. But everybody should hang loose because something may \nbreak and we will be able to get something done.\n\n\n                 Vote on Nomination of Carol J. Galante\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote on the nomination.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. I yield back the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Carol J. \nGalante, of California, to be an Assistant Secretary of Housing and \nUrban Development?\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKerry), and the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg), are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

There is still time left to reach an agreement, \nand we intend to continue negotiations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to a period of \nmorning business for debate only, with Senators permitted to speak for \nup to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/30/senate-section/article/S8530-4", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I guess the good news is that I am \nrising today not to speak about the fiscal cliff. What I am speaking \nabout is not good news because it deals with the tragic event that \noccurred in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11, when terrorists took the \nlives of our Ambassador, Chris Stevens, and three other brave Americans \nwho were serving us there.\n  I rise today, along with the ranking member of the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Collins, to submit for the \nRecord the report she and I have been working on with our staffs and \nother members of the committee following those events in Libya. We call \nthis report ``Flashing Red: A Special Report On The Terrorist Attack At \nBenghazi.'' ``Flashing red'' is a term that was used in a conversation \nwith us by an official of the State Department, and it could not have \nbeen more correct. All the evidence was flashing red that we had put \nAmerican personnel in Benghazi in an increasingly dangerous situation, \nwith violent Islamic extremists gathering there, with events having \noccurred, attacks on our mission there--two others prior that year. Yet \nwe did not give them the security they needed to protect them, and we \ndid not make the decision that I believe we should have made, since we \ndid not provide them with the security, that we should have closed our \nmission there. As a result, people really suffered.\n  We recognize that the congressionally mandated Accountability Review \nBoard at the Department of State has issued a report on the events in \nBenghazi. I think it was an excellent report. There are other \ncommittees of Congress continuing with their own investigations. Each \nof these will and should make a valuable contribution to our \nunderstanding of what happened at Benghazi so that we can take steps to \nmake sure nothing like it ever happens again.\n  Under the rules of the Senate, the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs has a unique mandate to investigate the \neffectiveness and efficiency of governmental agencies, especially when \nmatters that span multiple agencies are involved.\n  Our report is intended to inform the Senate and the American people \nabout events immediately before, during, and after the attack at \nBenghazi. In order to contribute most to the public debate, we have \nchosen to include only unclassified information in this report. We are \nhopeful that the report can and will make an important contribution to \nthe ongoing discussions about how to better protect our diplomatic \npersonnel abroad.\n  Our report contains 10 findings and 11 recommendations that we \nbelieve can help us better protect our diplomats and others who serve \nour country, often in very dangerous places. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the full text of the report be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this is probably the last opportunity I \nwill have to do this, to thank the ranking member again for the \nextraordinary partnership we have had for more than a decade now on the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. It is really \nmeaningful to me that we have this last opportunity to do something \ntogether, across party lines, that we believe and hope will be in our \nnational interest.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   Flashing Red: A Special Report on the Terrorist Attack at Benghazi\n\n(By Joseph I. Lieberman, Chairman and Susan M. Collins, Ranking Member)\n\n\n United States Senate Committee On Homeland Security And Governmental \n                                Affairs\n\n                           December 30, 2012\n\n       While our country spent September 11, 2012, remembering the \n     terrorist attacks that took place 11 years earlier, brave \n     Americans posted at U.S. government facilities in Benghazi, \n     Libya, were fighting for their lives against a terrorist \n     assault. When the fight ended, U.S. Ambassador to Libya John \n     C. (Chris) Stevens and three other Americans were dead and \n     U.S. facilities in Benghazi were left in ruin. We must \n     remember the sacrifice that these selfless public servants \n     made to support the struggle for freedom in Libya and to \n     improve our own national security. While we mourn their \n     deaths, it is also crucial that we learn from how they died. \n     By examining the circumstances of the attack in Benghazi on \n     September 11th, we hope to gain a better understanding of \n     what went wrong and what we must do now to ensure better \n     protection for American diplomatic personnel who must \n     sometimes operate in dangerous places abroad.\n       We are cognizant that the Congressionally-mandated \n     Accountability Review Board (ARB) of the Department of State \n     has now issued its important and constructive report and that \n     other Congressional committees are investigating the Benghazi \n     attack as well. Each makes significant contributions to our \n     collective understanding of what transpired and what we must \n     do going forward.\n       The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \n     (HSGAC), pursuant to its authority under Rule XXV(k) of the \n     Standing Rules of the Senate, Section 101 of S. Res 445 \n     (108th Congress) and Section 12(e) of S. Res 81 (112th \n     Congress), has a unique mandate to investigate the \n     effectiveness and efficiency of governmental agencies, \n     especially when matters that span multiple government \n     agencies are involved. Over the years, HSGAC has spent much \n     time and dedicated considerable resources to understanding \n     the challenges inherent in national security interagency \n     relationships, and it is through this lens that we have \n     examined and drawn lessons from the attack in Benghazi.\n       Since the 112th Congress is drawing to a close, this \n     investigation has necessarily been conducted with a sense of \n     urgency and with focused objectives. Our findings and \n     recommendations are based on investigative work that the \n     Committee has conducted since shortly after the attack of \n     September 11, 2012, including meetings of members and staff \n     with senior and mid-level government officials; reviews of \n     thousands of pages of documents provided by the Department of \n     State, Department of Defense, and the Intelligence Community \n     (IC); written responses to questions posed by the Committee \n     to these agencies; and reading of publicly-available \n     documents.\n       In the report that follows we provide a brief factual \n     overview of the attacks in Benghazi and then discuss our \n     findings and recommendations.\n\n\n                 Brief Overview of the Benghazi Attacks\n\n       The attacks in Benghazi occurred at two different \n     locations: a Department of State ``Temporary Mission \n     Facility'' and an Annex facility (``Annex'') approximately a \n     mile away used by another agency of the United States \n     Government. On September 11th, Ambassador Stevens was in \n     Benghazi, accompanied by two Diplomatic Security (DS) agents \n     who had traveled there with him. Also present were three \n     other DS agents and a Foreign Service Officer, Sean Smith, \n     who were posted at the Temporary Mission Facility \n     (``facility'' or ``compound''). There were also three members \n     of the February 17 Brigade, a Libyan militia deputized by the \n     Libyan government but not under its direct control, and four \n     unarmed local contract guards protecting the compound.\n       During the day on September 11th, the Ambassador held \n     several meetings on the compound and retired to his room at \n     approximately 9:00 p.m. local time. About 40 minutes later, \n     several agents and guards\n\n[[Page S8531]]\n\n     heard loud shouting, noises coming from the gate, as well as \n     gunfire, and an explosion. A closed-circuit television \n     monitor at the facility's Tactical Operations Center \n     (``TOC'') showed a large number of armed people flowing \n     unimpeded through the main gate. One of the DS agents in the \n     compound's TOC triggered an audible alarm, and immediately \n     alerted the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli and DS headquarters in \n     Washington. These notifications were quickly transmitted from \n     the Department of State to the Department of Defense. DS \n     headquarters maintained open phone lines with the DS \n     personnel throughout the attack. That same DS agent also \n     called the Annex to request assistance from security \n     personnel there, who immediately began to prepare to aid the \n     U.S. personnel at the diplomatic facility.\n       When the attack commenced, four DS agents and Foreign \n     Service Officer Smith were in or just outside the same \n     building where the Ambassador was spending that night. A \n     fifth DS agent was in the TOC when the terrorist attack \n     began. Ambassador Stevens, Smith, and one DS agent sought \n     shelter in the building's safe haven, a fortified area \n     designed to keep intruders out, while the other three agents \n     went to retrieve additional weapons and tactical gear such as \n     body armor, helmets, and ammunition. After retrieving their \n     gear, at least two of the DS agents sought to return to the \n     building where the Ambassador was. On the way back, however, \n     the DS agents encountered attackers. The lone DS agent with \n     the Ambassador reported via radio that he was secure within \n     the safe haven, allowing the two agents who had left in \n     search of weapons to seek refuge in the same building where \n     they had armed themselves. The third DS agent who had gone to \n     the TOC to retrieve his gear, stayed there with the DS agent \n     who had been manning the TOC since the beginning of the \n     attack.\n       The attackers started to set several of the compound's \n     structures on fire, using diesel fuel found on site, and \n     groups of attackers tried to enter several buildings on the \n     compound. The attackers did not succeed in entering the TOC, \n     but did succeed in entering the building where Ambassador \n     Stevens was staying and the building where the two DS agents \n     were seeking refuge. No safe havens were breached during the \n     initial assault. The attackers spread the diesel fuel \n     throughout the building where the Ambassador was hiding, and \n     ignited it, causing the building to fill with smoke.\n       When the smoke became so thick that breathing was \n     difficult, the DS agent attempted to lead the Ambassador and \n     Smith to escape through a nearby window. The agent opened the \n     window to make sure it was safe to leave, and stepped out but \n     then realized he had become separated from the Ambassador and \n     Smith. The agent radioed the TOC, requesting assistance and \n     returned numerous times to the building to look for the \n     Ambassador and Smith. When the other agents arrived, they \n     also took turns entering and searching the building. Though \n     they were able to find and remove Smith's body, they were \n     unable to find Ambassador Stevens.\n       After being notified about the attack, Annex personnel had \n     attempted to contact the February 17 Brigade, other militias, \n     and the Libyan government to ask for assistance. After \n     gathering necessary weapons and gear, at approximately 10:04 \n     p.m., six security personnel and a translator left the \n     Annex en route to the facility. Prior to reaching the \n     facility, they again attempted to contact and enlist \n     assistance from the February 17 Brigade, other militias, \n     and the Libyan government. By 10:25 p.m., the security \n     personnel from the Annex had entered the compound and \n     engaged in a 15-minute firefight with the armed invaders. \n     The team reached the Ambassador's building at 10:40 p.m. \n     but was unable to find him due to the intense fire and \n     smoke.\n       At 11:15 p.m., the Annex security personnel sent the DS \n     agents (who were all suffering from smoke inhalation from \n     their continuous search for Ambassador Stevens and Smith) to \n     the Annex, and followed there later, both groups taking fire \n     while en route. By this time, an unmanned, unarmed \n     surveillance aircraft began circling over the Benghazi \n     compound, having been diverted by the Department of Defense \n     from its previous surveillance assignment over another \n     location. Soon after the Americans returned to the Annex, \n     just before midnight, they were attacked by rocket-propelled \n     grenade (RPG) and small arms fire. The sporadic attacks \n     stopped at approximately 1:01 a.m.\n       U.S. government security personnel who were based in \n     Tripoli had deployed to Benghazi by chartered aircraft after \n     receiving word of the attack, arriving at the Benghazi \n     airport at 1:15 a.m. They were held at the airport for at \n     least three hours while they negotiated with Libyan \n     authorities about logistics. The exact cause of this hours-\n     long delay, and its relationship to the rescue effort, \n     remains unclear and merits further inquiry. Was it simply the \n     result of a difficult Libyan bureaucracy and a chaotic \n     environment or was it part of a plot to keep American help \n     from reaching the Americans under siege in Benghazi?\n       The team from Tripoli finally cleared the airport and \n     arrived at the Annex at approximately 5:04 a.m., about ten \n     minutes before a new assault by the terrorist began, \n     involving mortar rounds fired at the Annex. The attack \n     concluded at approximately 5:26 a.m., leaving Annex security \n     team members Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty dead and two \n     others wounded. The decision was then made to leave the \n     Annex. Libyan forces, not militia, arrived around 6:00 a.m. \n     with 50 vehicles and escorted the Americans to the airport. \n     Two planes carrying all remaining U.S. personnel then left \n     Benghazi. The first flight departed between 7:00 a.m. and \n     7:40 a.m. (agency timelines vary on this point) and the \n     second at 10:00 a.m.\n       American government officials outside of Benghazi learned \n     of the attack shortly after it started at 3:40 p.m. EST (9:40 \n     p.m. Benghazi time). DS agents, in addition to notifying \n     personnel at the Annex, immediately alerted officials at the \n     U.S Embassy in Tripoli and the Department of State \n     Headquarters in Washington, D.C. As noted earlier, the U.S. \n     Africa Command (AFRICOM) at the Department of Defense (DOD) \n     directed an unarmed surveillance aircraft to the skies over \n     the Benghazi compound at 3:59 p.m. EST. It arrived there at \n     5:10 p.m. EST (11:10 p.m. Benghazi time). At 4:32 p.m., the \n     National Military Command Center in the Pentagon alerted the \n     Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff, and \n     the information was shared with Secretary of Defense Leon \n     Panetta and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General \n     Martin Dempsey. Secretary Panetta and General Dempsey were at \n     the White House for a previously scheduled meeting at 5:00 \n     p.m. and so were able to brief the President on the \n     developments in Benghazi as they were occurring.\n       From 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. EST, Secretary Panetta met with \n     senior DOD officials to discuss the Benghazi attack and other \n     violence in the region in reaction to the anti-Muslim video. \n     The Secretary directed three actions: 1) that one Fleet \n     Antiterrorism Security Team (FAST) platoon stationed in Rota, \n     Spain, deploy to Benghazi and that a second FAST platoon in \n     Rota prepare to deploy to Tripoli; 2) that U.S. European \n     Command's In-extremis Force, which happened to be training in \n     central Europe, deploy to a staging base in southern Europe; \n     and 3) that a special operations force based in the United \n     States deploy to a staging base in southern Europe. The \n     National Command Center transmitted formal authorization for \n     these actions at 8:39 p.m. A FAST platoon arrived in Tripoli \n     the evening (local time) of September 12th, and the other \n     forces arrived that evening at a staging base in Italy, long \n     after the terrorist attack on the U.S. facilities in Benghazi \n     had ended and four Americans had been killed.\n\n\n                    Key Findings and Recommendations\n\n       Finding 1. In the months leading up to the attack on the \n     Temporary Mission Facility in Benghazi, there was a large \n     amount of evidence gathered by the U.S. Intelligence \n     Community (IC) and from open sources that Benghazi was \n     increasingly dangerous and unstable, and that a significant \n     attack against American personnel there was becoming much \n     more likely. While this intelligence was effectively shared \n     within the Intelligence Community (IC) and with key officials \n     at the Department of State, it did not lead to a commensurate \n     increase in security at Benghazi nor to a decision to close \n     the American mission there, either of which would have been \n     more than justified by the intelligence presented.\n       Security decisions concerning U.S. facilities and personnel \n     overseas are informed by several different types of \n     information, including classified threat reporting from the \n     IC; cables and spot reports from U.S. diplomatic posts, which \n     describe local incidents and threats; and publicly available \n     information. Prior to the attack, the IC and the Department \n     of State were aware of the overall threat landscape in Libya \n     and the challenges facing the new Libyan government in \n     addressing those threats. This understanding evolved over \n     time, consistent with broader changes in the nature of the \n     threat, and also based on reported incidents and attacks in \n     Benghazi and other parts of Libya in 2012.\n       The Committee has reviewed dozens of classified \n     intelligence reports on the evolution of threats in Libya \n     which were issued between February 2011 and September 11, \n     2012. We are precluded in this report from discussing the \n     information in detail, but overall, these intelligence \n     reports (as the ARB similarly noted) provide a clear and \n     vivid picture of a rapidly deteriorating threat environment \n     in eastern Libya--one that we believe should have been \n     sufficient to inform policy-makers of the growing danger to \n     U.S. facilities and personnel in that part of the country and \n     the urgency of them doing something about it. This \n     information was effectively shared by the IC with key \n     officials at the Department of State. For example, both the \n     Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International \n     Programs in the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Charlene Lamb, \n     who was responsible for the security at more than 275 \n     diplomatic facilities, and former Regional Security Officer \n     (RSO) for Libya Eric Nordstrom, who was the principal \n     security adviser to the U.S. Ambassador in Libya from \n     September 21, 2011 to July 26, 2012, told the Committee that \n     they had full access to all threat information from the IC \n     about eastern Libya during the months before the attack of \n     September 11, 2012. Yet the Department failed to take \n     adequate action to protect its personnel there.\n       This classified intelligence reporting was complemented by \n     open-source reporting on attacks and other incidents \n     targeting western interests in Libya during the months prior \n     to the September 11, 2012 attack. The RSO in Libya compiled a \n     list of 234 security incidents in Libya between June 2011 and\n\n[[Page S8532]]\n\n     July 2012, 50 of which took place in Benghazi. The document \n     describes an array of incidents, including large-scale \n     militia clashes, protests involving several hundred people, \n     and the temporary detention of non-governmental organization \n     (NGO) workers and of U.S. diplomatic personnel in Benghazi. \n     Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy noted in \n     a briefing for the Committee, that Libya and Benghazi were \n     ``flashing red'' around the time of the attack.\n       The incident reporting shows that western facilities and \n     personnel became an increasing focus of threats in the spring \n     of 2012. For example, on April 2, 2012 in Benghazi, a British \n     diplomatic vehicle was attacked by a mob of demonstrators. \n     Four days later, on April 6th, a crude improvised explosive \n     device (IED) was thrown over the wall of the U.S. facility in \n     Benghazi, causing minimal damage. A spot report on the day of \n     the event stated that shortly after the event two individuals \n     were questioned. The suspects included one current and one \n     former guard employed by Blue Mountain Group, the company \n     which supplied the unarmed Libyan contract guards responsible \n     for screening visitors to the U.S. compound--underscoring the \n     potential risk of an insider threat in Benghazi. Four days \n     after that, on April 10th, also in Benghazi, a crude IED was \n     thrown at the convoy of the United Nations Special Envoy to \n     Libya.\n       Other publicly reported incidents occurred during this time \n     frame, but there are four that we believe are particularly \n     noteworthy. Taken as a whole, they demonstrated the \n     capability and intent of Benghazi-based Islamist extremist \n     groups to conduct a significant attack against U.S. or other \n     western interests in Libya:\n       On May 22, 2012, the International Committee for the Red \n     Cross/Red Crescent (ICRC) building in Benghazi was hit by two \n     RPG rounds, causing damage to the building but no casualties. \n     Several days later, the Brigades of the Imprisoned Sheikh \n     Omar Abdel Rahman claimed responsibility for this attack, \n     accusing the ICRC of proselytizing in Libya.\n       On June 6, 2012, the U.S. Temporary Mission Facility in \n     Benghazi was targeted by an IED attack that blew a hole in \n     the perimeter wall. Credit for this attack was also claimed \n     by the Brigades of the Imprisoned Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, \n     which said it carried out the attack in response to the \n     reported drone strike on al Qaeda leader Abu Yahya al-Libi in \n     Northern Waziristan.\n       On June 11, 2012, an attack was carried out in Benghazi on \n     the convoy of the British Ambassador to Libya. Attackers \n     fired an RPG on the convoy, followed by small arms fire. Two \n     British bodyguards were injured in the attack. This attack \n     was characterized afterwards in an incident report by the \n     Department of State's Bureau of Diplomatic Security as a \n     ``complex, coordinated attack.''\n       On June 18, 2012, the Tunisian consulate in Benghazi was \n     stormed by individuals affiliated with Ansar al-Sharia Libya \n     (AAS), allegedly because of ``attacks by Tunisian artists \n     against Islam.''\n       Overall, the threat to western interests in eastern Libya \n     and in Benghazi specifically was high even prior to the \n     attack of September 11, 2012. Reviewing these incidents, an \n     unclassified open source report by a contractor to AFRICOM \n     noted in July 2012 that:\n       ``Nonetheless, Benghazi has seen a notable increase in \n     violence in recent months, particularly against international \n     targets. These events point to strong anti-Western sentiments \n     among certain segments of the population, the willingness of \n     Salafi-jihadi groups in the city to openly engage in violence \n     against foreign targets, and their capacity to carry out \n     these attacks.''\n       Taking classified reporting on the increasing dangers in \n     eastern Libya together with the open source incidents should \n     have provided a clear picture of the dangers for American \n     personnel in Benghazi unless their security were greatly \n     improved.\n       Finding 2. Notwithstanding the increasingly dangerous \n     environment in eastern Libya in 2011 and 2012, the U.S. \n     government did not have specific intelligence of an imminent \n     attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi. The lack of such \n     actionable intelligence may reflect a failure in the IC to \n     focus sufficiently on terrorist groups that have weak or no \n     operational ties to core al Qaeda and its main affiliates.\n       While the IC had developed and adequately shared general \n     threat information on terrorist groups and Islamist extremist \n     militias in eastern Libya prior to the attack, it did not \n     have specific warning that this attack was to take place on \n     September 11, 2012. Intelligence capabilities that provide \n     early, specific warnings have played a critical role in \n     preventing terrorist attacks against U.S. facilities overseas \n     and in the homeland in the last decade. There were no such \n     warnings available for Benghazi before the attack of \n     September 11, 2012. Why?\n       First, there may not have been significant or elaborate \n     advance planning for the attack. In a hearing before our \n     Committee on September 19, 2012, National Counterterrorism \n     Center (NCTC) Director Matthew Olsen described the attack as \n     ``opportunistic'' and stated that the IC had no indication of \n     ``significant advanced planning or coordination for this \n     attack.''\n       However, the activities of local terrorist and Islamist \n     extremist groups in Libya may have received insufficient \n     attention from the IC prior to the attack, partially because \n     some of the groups possessed ambiguous operational ties to \n     core al Qaeda and its primary affiliates. For example, public \n     statements by Libyan officials and many news reports have \n     indicated that Ansar al-Sharia Libya (AAS) was one of the key \n     groups involved in carrying out this attack on the U.S. \n     facility in Benghazi. The group took credit on its own \n     Facebook page for the attack before later deleting the post. \n     U.S. officials viewed AAS prior to the attack as a ``local \n     extremist group with an eye on gaining political ground in \n     Libya.'' AAS has not been designated as a foreign terrorist \n     organization by the U.S. government, and apparently the IC \n     was ``not focused'' on this group to the same extent as core \n     al Qaeda and its operational affiliates.\n       This finding has broader implications for U.S. \n     counterterrorism activities in the Middle East and North \n     Africa. With Osama bin Laden dead and core al Qaeda weakened, \n     a new collection of violent Islamist extremist organizations \n     and cells have emerged in the last two to three years. These \n     groups are not all operationally linked to core al Qaeda or \n     in some cases have only weak ties to al Qaeda. This trend is \n     particularly notable in countries such as Libya, Egypt, \n     Tunisia, and Syria that are going through political \n     transition or military conflict as a result of the political \n     upheavals referred to as the ``Arab Spring.''\n       While such groups do not always have strong operational \n     ties to al Qaeda, they adhere to a similar violent Islamist \n     extremist ideology. As an unclassified August 2012 report by \n     the Library of Congress noted, AAS in Libya shares common \n     symbols (the black flag) and ideology with al Qaeda. This \n     Committee has spent several years focusing on the role that \n     this ideology plays in motivating homegrown violent Islamist \n     extremists, most of whom have no direct ties to al Qaeda. A \n     similar phenomenon, though potentially much more dangerous, \n     is at work with respect to many of these nascent terrorist \n     groups, and is leading many of them to shift their focus from \n     local grievances to foreign attacks against U.S. and other \n     western facilities overseas.\n       Recommendation: U.S. intelligence agencies must broaden and \n     deepen their focus in Libya, and beyond, on nascent violent \n     Islamist extremist groups in the region that lack strong \n     operational ties to core al Qaeda or its main affiliate \n     groups. One benefit of doing so would be improved tactical \n     warning capabilities, the kind of which were not present at \n     Benghazi, but might have been even for an ``opportunistic'' \n     attack.\n       Finding 3. The absence of specific intelligence about an \n     imminent attack should not have prevented the Department of \n     State from taking more effective steps to protect its \n     personnel and facilities in Benghazi.\n       This finding reflects earlier conclusions of the 1985 \n     Advisory Panel on Overseas Security (``Inman Report'') and \n     the 1999 Accountability Review Board report on the attacks on \n     the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which both warned \n     the Department of State against becoming too reliant on \n     tactical intelligence to determine the level of potential \n     terrorist threats. The Inman report points out that ``it \n     would be foolhardy to make security decisions on the basis of \n     an expectation of advance warning of peril.''\n       Deputy Assistant Secretary Charlene Lamb stated that the \n     level and kind of attack at Benghazi was something they had \n     never seen before anywhere in the world. However, given clear \n     warnings that threats were increasing in the Benghazi area, \n     the Department of State should not have waited for a specific \n     incident to happen or expected the delivery of tactical \n     intelligence of a specific, imminent threat before taking \n     additional steps to protect its diplomats or, if that was not \n     possible, to close the Benghazi facility.\n       Recommendation: In providing security for its personnel \n     around the world, the Department of State must fully consider \n     the types of attacks that could take place given the \n     strategic threat environment, even in the absence of imminent \n     warning intelligence.\n       Finding 4. Prior to the terrorist attacks in Libya on \n     September 11, 2012, it was widely understood that the Libyan \n     government was incapable of performing its duty to protect \n     U.S. diplomatic facilities and personnel, as required by \n     longstanding international agreements, but the Department of \n     State failed to take adequate steps to fill the resulting \n     security gap, or to invest in upgrading the Libyan security \n     forces.\n       A host country's responsibility to protect and safeguard a \n     foreign nation's diplomatic personnel and facilities in its \n     country has been codified in several international treaties, \n     including the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, \n     which states that ``[t]he receiving State is under a special \n     duty to take all appropriate steps to protect the consular \n     premises against any intrusion or damage and to prevent any \n     disturbance of the peace of the consular post or impairment \n     of its dignity.'' The Treaty also states that ``[t]he \n     receiving State shall treat consular officers with due \n     respect and shall take all appropriate steps to prevent any \n     attack on their person, freedom or dignity.''\n       A host country's protection of an American embassy or other \n     diplomatic facilities is one of the most important elements \n     of security at that facility, but it is not the only one. A \n     facility's own security, such as its U.S. Marine Corps \n     Security Guards, DS agents, and in some cases, private \n     security guards under contract, is also critical to its \n     overall security posture. States whose governments do not \n     exercise full control over their sovereign territory, or that \n     have a limited security capability, cannot be counted\n\n[[Page S8533]]\n\n     on to safeguard U.S. diplomatic personnel and facilities. \n     This is usually true, of course, in the aftermath of a \n     revolution or civil war--as was the case in Libya--where the \n     provision of protective services by the host nations is \n     unpredictable at best. In those instances, the Department of \n     State must improve one or more of the other three protectors \n     of mission security within its control: Marine Corps Security \n     Guards, Dipolmatic Security agents, or private security \n     contractors.\n       In February 2011, the revolution began to end Colonel \n     Muammar al-Qadhafi's autocratic rule of Libya. Between \n     February and October of 2011, Libya was consumed with intense \n     fighting between anti-government groups and Qadhafi's regime. \n     On October 20, 2011, opposition forces conquered the last \n     Qadhafi stronghold in Sirte and killed Qadhafi. Qadhafi's \n     death ended the revolt but left open the question of who \n     would govern Libya and how.\n       Just days after Qadhafi's death, Libyans turned to the \n     interim Transitional National Council (TNC), established in \n     the spring of 2011, to improve security and begin the process \n     of reconstituting national institutions. However, the TNC \n     faced numerous challenges and ``struggled to calm the \n     incendiary regional and factional disputes or exert control \n     even over its own militias.'' Since no cohesive opposition \n     group emerged from the civil war, the TNC had to contend with \n     various armed factions that ``remained a law unto \n     themselves.''\n       On July 7, 2012, Libyan voters participated in the first \n     national election since 1965 and elected 200 members to the \n     General National Congress. The election of the General \n     National Congress represented a significant political \n     achievement, but the formation of a new government was still \n     under negotiation when the attacks in Benghazi occurred three \n     months later in September. Civil order had not yet been \n     restored. According to one expert review, ``[a]ttacks on \n     international targets, a series of aggressive attacks by \n     armed Salafists on religious buildings around the country, \n     and an assassination campaign against senior security \n     officers have fueled widespread criticism of interim leaders \n     since early 2012.''\n       Given the unstable political and security situation, \n     particularly in eastern Libya, the Libyan government was \n     unable to provide security protection to foreign diplomatic \n     facilities in a manner consistent with international law. \n     That is why the Department of State relied in part on a local \n     militia, the February 17 Brigade, to provide protection for \n     the Benghazi facility, as well as unarmed Libyan guards under \n     contract with a private security firm. Throughout 2012, \n     Department of State officials questioned the February 17 \n     Brigade's competence and expressed concerns about its \n     abilities. U.S. Department of State personnel were also \n     concerned about the involvement of members of the February 17 \n     Brigade in the extrajudicial detention of U.S. diplomatic \n     personnel in at least one incident in Benghazi. Eric \n     Nordstrom, told the Committee that while the February 17 \n     Brigade did provide some protection and would likely respond \n     to an attack, they clearly needed additional training. Only \n     limited training ever occurred.\n       Some U.S. personnel also questioned the Brigade's loyalty \n     to the Libyan government and their capacity or desire to \n     safeguard American interests. In June 2012, an RSO in \n     Benghazi wrote, ``Unfortunately, given the current threat to \n     the diplomatic mission, the militia members not currently on \n     the [four-man team stationed at the facility] have expressed \n     concern with showing active open support for the Americans in \n     Benghazi.'' Notably, the contract between the State \n     Department and the February 17 Brigade had expired by the \n     time of the attack. In a handoff email to his replacement on \n     August 29, 2012, the principal U.S. diplomatic officer in \n     Benghazi wrote that the contract with the militia ``lapsed \n     several weeks ago'' but that they were still operating under \n     its terms. He said that ``[t]his is a delicate issue, as we \n     are relying on a militia in lieu of the central authorities \n     and [Feb 17 Brigade] has been implicated in several of the \n     recent detentions. We also have the usual concerns re their \n     ultimate loyalties. But they are competent, and give us an \n     added measure of security. For the time being, I don't think \n     we have a viable alternative.'' In early September, a member \n     of the February 17 Brigade told another RSO in Benghazi that \n     it could no longer support U.S. personnel movements. The RSO \n     also asked specifically if the militia could provide \n     additional support for the Ambassador's pending visit and was \n     told no.\n       The ability of the Libyan government to provide surge \n     forces to rescue or evacuate personnel from the Benghazi \n     facility was also extremely limited. The Department of State \n     recognized this limitation. As early as February 1, 2012, RSO \n     Nordstrom stated in a memo to his superiors that the \n     political situation in post-revolution Libya ``was fragile'' \n     and that ``[m]any basic state institutions, including \n     emergency services and tourist facilities are not yet fully \n     operational.''\n       Nordstrom noted that ``various factions and militias \n     continue to vie for power in the absence of a stable \n     political and security environment, often resulting in \n     violence.''\n       This view of the Libyan government's inadequate security \n     capabilities persisted through the attack on September 11, \n     2012. Communications from U.S. personnel in Libya continued \n     to repeat the same conclusions stated by Nordstrom earlier in \n     February. For instance, an early August cable from the \n     Tripoli Embassy to the Department of State in Washington, \n     states that even though the TNC had established a Supreme \n     Security Council (SSC) to stabilize the security situation in \n     Benghazi, its own commander had said that the SSC had ``not \n     coalesced into an effective, stable security force.'' \n     Further, the cable warned that the ``absence of a significant \n     deterrence, has contributed to a security vacuum that is \n     being exploited by independent actors.'' Similarly, an August \n     20, 2012 security update reported that other diplomats \n     believed the SSC was `` `fading away,' unwilling to take on \n     `anyone with powerful patrons from powerful tribes.' '' That \n     same month, DS personnel reviewing tripwires for an ordered \n     departure of the post--that is, political, security, and \n     intelligence benchmarks which would prompt diplomatic \n     officials to close a facility or modify its operations--\n     stated that ``[m]ission opinion is that Libyan security \n     forces are indifferent to the safety needs of the U.S. \n     mission.'' On September 11, 2012, the day of the attack, the \n     ``Weekly Report'' prepared by Department of State officers on \n     the security situation in Benghazi described the frustrations \n     of an SSC commander that the police and security forces were \n     ``too weak to keep the country secure.''\n       Prior to Ambassador Stevens' visit to Benghazi in September \n     2012, the U.S. mission in Benghazi had made a request to the \n     Libyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs for additional security in \n     Benghazi to support the visit. At a minimum, these requests \n     included appeals for a 24/7 police presence consisting of a \n     vehicle and personnel at each of the compound's three gates. \n     The only Libyan government response appears to have been an \n     SSC police vehicle parked in front of the front gate (which, \n     as the ARB noted, sped away as the attack began).\n       Though a few members of the February 17 Brigade and the \n     Libya Shield militia assisted the Americans on the night of \n     the attack, the security that these militias and the local \n     police provided to U.S. personnel was woefully inadequate to \n     the dangerous security environment in Benghazi.\n       The unarmed local contract guards also provided no \n     meaningful resistance to the attackers. The Department of \n     State's Inspector General had previously found that concerns \n     about local security guards were not limited to Libya. A \n     February 2012 Department of State Inspector General (IG) \n     report found that more than two-thirds of 86 diplomatic posts \n     around the world surveyed reported problems with their local \n     guard contractors. Of those posts that reported problems with \n     their contractors, 37 percent said there was an insufficient \n     number of local guards and 40 percent said there was \n     insufficient training. The IG found that overseas diplomatic \n     posts, particularly those in high-threat situations beyond \n     Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan urgently needed best-value \n     contracting, which takes into account the past performance of \n     contractors.\n       Recommendation: When it becomes clear that a host nation \n     cannot adequately perform its functions under the Vienna \n     Convention, the Department of State must provide additional \n     security measures of its own, urgently attempt to upgrade the \n     host nation security forces, or decide to close a U.S. \n     Diplomatic facility and remove U.S. personnel until \n     appropriate steps can be taken to provide adequate security. \n     American personnel who serve us abroad must often work in \n     high risk environments, but when they do, we must provide \n     them with adequate security. That clearly was not the case in \n     Benghazi on September 11, 2012.\n       Recommendation: The Department must conduct a review of its \n     local guard programs and particularly the use of local guard \n     contractors at high-risk posts who do not meet appropriate \n     standards necessary for the protection of our personnel or \n     facilities.\n       Finding 5. The Benghazi facility's temporary status had a \n     detrimental effect on security decisions, and that fact was \n     clearly known by DS personnel in Benghazi and to their \n     superiors who nevertheless left the American personnel in \n     Benghazi in this very dangerous situation. The Department of \n     State did not take adequate measures to mitigate the \n     facility's significant vulnerabilities in this high-threat \n     environment.\n       The Department of State opened the temporary mission in \n     Benghazi in 2011 after the revolution against the Qadhafi \n     government began because eastern Libya was the headquartes of \n     the opposition to Qadhafi, and the embassy in Tripoli had \n     been closed due to security concerns. The temporary mission \n     was first located in a hotel and then moved, based on \n     security concerns, to the compound referred to as the \n     Temporary Mission Facility. After the U.S. Embassy was \n     reopened in Tripoli when Qadhafi was overthrown, the \n     Department of State initially planned to close the Benghazi \n     facility in late 2011. However, in December 2011, the \n     Department decided to extend its presence in Benghazi until \n     December 2012. In the memo approving this decision, the \n     Department stated that the facility would be a ``smaller \n     operation'' but noted its importance to eastern Libyans and \n     the assistance it could provide to the embassy in Tripoli.\n       The temporary status of the Benghazi facility contributed \n     to its vulnerability. For example, DS agents stationed in \n     Benghazi were always on temporary duty assignments, remaining \n     there for relatively short periods, often no longer than a \n     month. As Nordstrom noted, having temporary duty agents made \n     ``developing security procedures, policies,\n\n[[Page S8534]]\n\n     and relationships more difficult.'' The temporary status also \n     made it difficult to procure funds for security upgrades. A \n     briefing paper prepared for a meeting of Assistant Secretary \n     of State for Diplomatic Security Eric Boswell and then-\n     Ambassador to Libya Gene Cretz noted, ``Due to the ambiguity \n     surrounding the duration of the U.S. Mission in Benghazi, RSO \n     Benghazi has encountered funding issues for projects that are \n     commonplace at most U.S. missions.'' The Committee received \n     conflicting evidence with regard to whether the temporary \n     Benghazi facility was on the Security Environment Threat \n     List--a semiannual document that aids DS management in the \n     allocation of overseas security resources and programs. In \n     any event, it is hard to imagine there were more than a few \n     Department of State missions anywhere in the world that were \n     in a more dangerous environment than Benghazi.\n       In the December 2011 memo approving the Temporary Mission \n     Facility in Benghazi, the Department of State noted the need \n     for corrective security measures for the facility. According \n     to RSO Nordstrom, the Department of State never consulted \n     with him about the security requirements of the facility \n     before the December 2011 action memo was sent to Under \n     Secretary Kennedy for approval. The memo approved by Kennedy \n     indicated that the Department of State would ``rapidly \n     implement a series of corrective security measures as part of \n     the consolidation of the State footprint.'' However, the memo \n     lacked details as to the security standards to be followed \n     and the resources required to implement the security \n     measures. The absence of dedicated resources contributed to \n     the constraints under which those in Washington and Benghazi \n     would operate throughout 2012.\n       During 2012, however, the Department did make a variety of \n     field expedient security enhancements, including:\n       The installation of concrete jersey barriers;\n       The installation of four vehicle barriers for access \n     control and anti-ram protection;\n       Increased compound lighting;\n       The installation of barbed wire on top of the existing \n     perimeter wall to raise height and on top of the interior \n     chain link fence to create secondary barrier;\n       The installation of platforms for property and street \n     surveillance;\n       The construction of four guard booths;\n       The installation of steel grillwork on windows;\n       The installation of emergency releases on select windows \n     grills for fire/emergency exit;\n       The replacement of several wooden doors with steel doors \n     with appropriate locking hardware;\n       Sandbag emplacements for internal defense purposes; and\n       Hardening villas with safe rooms with a steel door.\n       But these physical security upgrades were insufficient to \n     deter or repel the dozens of armed attackers that swarmed the \n     compound, unimpeded, on September 11, 2012. As discussed in \n     more detail below, the facility lacked the type of pedestrian \n     barriers that could have slowed the attackers, even though \n     the Department of State Inspector General and an earlier \n     Accountability Review Board had each recommended the \n     installation of such barriers at diplomatic posts in high-\n     risk places like Benghazi.\n       Because the Benghazi facility was temporary, no security \n     standards applied to it. While existing security standards \n     require meaningful physical barriers to slow pedestrian \n     access for permanent U.S. diplomatic facilities, there were \n     few meaningful physical barriers at the Benghazi facility \n     that would slow pedestrian access other than the closed gate. \n     Once the gate was opened, there were no other physical \n     impediments at that access point to keep anyone out of the \n     facility's grounds or slow their assault.\n       Having additional physical barriers to reinforce the gate \n     might have delayed the breach of the compound, giving those \n     inside more time to prepare for the attack. For example, some \n     permanent diplomatic facilities have a compound access \n     control (CAC) point, a ``mantrap,'' or both. Both of these \n     types of barriers act as gates or enclosures that are used to \n     limit the movement of pedestrians entering a diplomatic \n     facility. While a CAC is primarily installed in conjunction \n     with a pedestrian entrance, a mantrap is typically installed \n     in conjunction with a vehicle gate or barrier. According to \n     Deputy Assistant Secretary Charlene Lamb, a CAC was not in \n     place at Benghazi due to time and money constraints. She \n     estimated a CAC there would have cost hundreds of thousands \n     of dollars. No mantrap was in place either, though the reason \n     for that is less clear. Unfortunately, we will never know if \n     the additional investment in either a CAC or mantrap would \n     have provided the time needed to save the lives of Ambassador \n     Chris Stevens and Foreign Service Officer Sean Smith because \n     of the fires set by the terrorists.\n       The absence of mantraps has been identified as a security \n     vulnerability at least twice in the last ten years by the \n     Department of State. According to a 2009 Department of State \n     Inspector General Report, the 2004 Accountability Review \n     Board regarding the attack on the U.S. consulate in Jeddah, \n     Saudi Arabia recommended the installation of pedestrian \n     barriers at U.S. diplomatic facilities overseas. During that \n     attack, terrorists exited their vehicle and quickly breached \n     the perimeter after being stopped by the entrance's anti-\n     vehicle barrier. The attackers killed six and wounded several \n     others.\n       Five years later, the Department of State Inspector General \n     found that the absence of approved security standards or \n     recent directives from the Bureau of Diplomatic Security \n     regarding the installation of mantraps resulted in a fewer \n     number of mantraps at overseas posts than required worldwide. \n     At the time, 25 percent of critical threat posts that \n     responded to the IG's survey did not have or request a \n     mantrap and 39 percent of posts rated as a high threat post \n     that responded to the survey also had no mantraps, plans for \n     a mantrap, or were unable to accommodate mantraps. The \n     numbers were worse for low and medium threat posts. According \n     to the Department of State IG report, the average cost of \n     installing mantraps at a U.S. diplomatic post (including \n     related infrastructure) is approximately $55,000.\n       In determining the amount of additional security to provide \n     to the Benghazi facility, the Department of State did not \n     conduct a joint analysis or confer with other agencies, such \n     as DOD or members of the IC. For U.S. diplomatic facilities \n     at greatest risk, such as Benghazi, more interagency analysis \n     of security needs must be done to identify gaps in security \n     and take the steps to address them. Since the attack in \n     Benghazi, the Department of State and the Department of \n     Defense have jointly begun this important work, focusing \n     initially on the highest threat facilities around the globe, \n     but that should have happened before the attack.\n       Resourcing for security is a joint responsibility of the \n     Executive Branch and the Legislative Branch. The Department \n     of State's decisions regarding security at the Benghazi \n     facility were made in the context of its budget and security \n     requirements for diplomatic facilities around the world. \n     Overall, the Department of State's base requests for security \n     funding have increased by 38 percent since Fiscal Year (FY) \n     2007, and base budget appropriations have increased by 27 \n     percent in the same time period. Other security funding \n     provided beyond that in supplemental appropriations bills has \n     been nearly entirely for diplomatic facilities in just three \n     countries--Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Less has gone \n     elsewhere and very little is available to the temporary \n     facilities such as the one in Benghazi.\n       Importantly, funding requests for baseline diplomatic \n     security programs have not been fully funded in any year \n     since FY 2010. These accounts fund local guards, security \n     technology, DS agents, and maintenance, construction and \n     security upgrades for facilities. The Administration \n     requested almost $2.4 billion for the Worldwide Security \n     Protection (WSP) and Embassy Security, Construction and \n     Maintenance (ESCM) accounts in fiscal year 2011 (the \n     Department of State's two largest diplomatic security \n     accounts), but the House of Representatives recommended a \n     funding level that was $127.5 million less than the \n     President's Budget request. The Senate restored $38 million \n     of the funding in the final enacted appropriations bill for \n     that year. In fiscal year 2012, the gap was larger: Congress \n     enacted appropriations for diplomatic security that were $275 \n     million less than was requested.\n       At the same time, Congress has generally been responsive in \n     providing supplemental and Overseas Contingency Operations \n     (OCO) funds to the Department of State--more than $1.7 \n     billion since 2007--in response to emergent, security-driven \n     funding requests, although primarily for facilities in Iraq, \n     Afghanistan and Pakistan. However, there was no supplemental \n     or OCO request made by the President for additional \n     diplomatic security enhancements in FY2010 or FY2011. Neither \n     the Department of State nor Congress made a point of \n     providing additional funds in a supplemental request for \n     Libya, or more specifically, Benghazi.\n       Congress' inability to appropriate funds in a timely manner \n     has also had consequences for the implementation of security \n     upgrades. RSO Nordstrom stated that Continuing Resolutions \n     had two detrimental effects on efforts to improve security in \n     Benghazi. First, the Department of State would only allow \n     funds to be expended at a rate of 80 percent of the previous \n     year's appropriations level, so as not to risk a violation of \n     the Anti-Deficiency Act. Second, in the absence of a \n     supplemental appropriations or reprogramming request, \n     security funds for Benghazi had to be taken ``out of hide'' \n     from funding levels for Libya because Benghazi was not \n     included in previous budget requests.\n       Recommendation: The Department of State should establish a \n     mandatory process to determine what security standards are \n     applicable to temporary facilities to ensure that they are \n     adequately protected.\n       Recommendation: In the future, more interagency joint \n     assessments or analyses of security needs must be done for \n     U.S. diplomatic facilities at greatest risk. A joint \n     assessment could not only improve our government's ability to \n     identify security gaps, it would make all agencies more aware \n     of assets available to meet security challenges and those \n     available to respond to a crisis.\n       Recommendation: The Administration and Congress must work \n     together to provide sufficient, steady, and timely funding \n     resources to secure diplomatic facilities and personnel \n     worldwide.\n       Finding 6. The Department of State did not adequately \n     support security requests from its own security personnel in \n     Benghazi.\n       Throughout 2012, the number of DS agents temporarily \n     deployed to Benghazi fluctuated, decreasing to as low as one \n     agent for a six week period in March and April 2012 due to \n     visa problems. At the time of the attack, there were three DS \n     agents who were stationed in Benghazi and two more who \n     accompanied the Ambassador there from Tripoli.\n\n[[Page S8535]]\n\n     RSO Nordstrom said that security personnel in Tripoli were \n     sometimes used to augment Benghazi security when necessary.\n       As conditions changed in late spring and early summer, \n     officers in Tripoli and in Washington had good situational \n     awareness of the growing threats in Libya and especially in \n     Benghazi. However, the Department of State did not provide \n     enough security to address the increased threats and did not \n     adequately support field requests for additional security. \n     For example, in March 2012 the Tripoli Embassy had requested \n     five full-time security positions for Benghazi. However, a \n     day after sending this request, Nordstrom was told that \n     Washington had capped the number of agents in Benghazi at \n     three, even though the request for five agents was consistent \n     with the December 2011 action memo approved by Under \n     Secretary Kennedy to extend the duration of the Benghazi \n     facility. In addressing the March request for five DS agents, \n     Deputy Assistant Secretary Lamb questioned RSO Nordstrom \n     about the fact that two of those five requested positions \n     would be used for non-personnel security related duties--one \n     for driving and one to secure a computer. Deputy Assistant \n     Secretary Lamb asked that local employees be hired for these \n     positions since they were arguably not related to security. \n     Later, two local nationals were hired to fulfill these \n     duties. In July Embassy officials in Tripoli requested a \n     minimum of three DS agents for Benghazi.\n       Nordstrom also testified that he would have preferred to \n     extend a DOD support team, which DOD provided to the \n     Department of State on a non-reimbursable basis, that was \n     scheduled to depart in August 2012. The 16-person Site \n     Security Team (SST) was stationed in Tripoli, but on occasion \n     some of its members also helped with security in Benghazi. \n     The team's deployment had previously been extended twice. \n     Nordstrom said he thought that requesting an extension would \n     have ``too much political cost,'' and he was not told to do \n     so. In July 2012, Nordstrom had sent a request, via cable \n     approved by Ambassador Stevens, for a minimum of 13 temporary \n     U.S. security personnel--which he said could be either DS \n     employees or SST personnel, or a combination of both--to \n     support needs in Tripoli. Nordstrom said he never received a \n     response to that request. Though the Department of State \n     never formally asked DOD to extend the SST team, at the time \n     of the attack several members of the SST were still in \n     Tripoli for other purposes, and two participated in the \n     rescue effort the night of the attack.\n       In the Department's late 2011 plan describing a transition \n     to ``locally staffed operations,'' one of the reasons given \n     for that transition was that ``DS does not have sufficient \n     resources to sustain the current level of the security assets \n     in Libya.'' Lamb commented on this issue in her interview \n     with the Committee, stating that it was hard to sustain large \n     numbers of DS agents on short-term tours because there is not \n     a floating pool of agents so that to fill a gap in Libya she \n     needed to create a gap elsewhere.\n       Finding 7. Despite the inability of the Libyan government \n     to fulfill its duties to secure the facility, the \n     increasingly dangerous threat assessments, and a particularly \n     vulnerable facility, the Department of State officials did \n     not conclude the facility in Benghazi should be closed or \n     temporarily shut down. That was a grevious mistake.\n       The Department of State kept the Benghazi facility open \n     despite the inability of the Libyan government to fulfill its \n     duties to secure the facility and the increasingly dangerous \n     threat environment that American intelligence described. \n     Though diplomatic security officials in Libya repeatedly \n     considered and discussed the adequacy of security at the \n     Benghazi facility, we found no evidence that any official \n     ever recommended closing the facility even though the \n     facility's vulnerability remained high, particularly in \n     relation to the limited number and quality of the security \n     personnel on site including the militia, the contracted \n     guards, and DS agents on short-term assignments.\n       In the months leading up to the September 11, 2012 attack, \n     U.S. personnel sitting on the Benghazi Emergency Action \n     Committee (EAC)--the interagency entity responsible for \n     assessing the security of the facility--met several times to \n     discuss the growing threats in eastern Libya, and whether \n     additional actions to protect U.S. personnel ought to be \n     taken. As late as August 15, 2012, an EAC was convened and \n     resolved to update the ``tripwires'' for the facility. The \n     updates were to include a new category, ``suspension of \n     operations,'' under which diplomatic personnel remain present \n     at a post but limit activity off U.S. grounds. Notes from \n     that meeting show that joint security exercises were carried \n     out with Annex security personnel that same month, and that \n     conditional manpower requests and the revised set of \n     tripwires were sent to the Embassy in Tripoli for review. A \n     Department of State document shared between officials in \n     Tripoli show various ``tripwires'' in Benghazi were, in fact, \n     set off weeks before September 11, 2012. Following a bomb \n     attack on a Libyan Army colonel in August, the principal U.S. \n     diplomatic officer in Benghazi wrote that ``[g]iven our small \n     size, there is really no distinction between authorized and \n     ordered departure from Benghazi: if we lose one more person, \n     we will be ineffective . . . we are already at a skeleton \n     crew.''\n       Still, no additional security was provided to the facility \n     in Benghazi and there was no ordered evacuation. RSO \n     Nordstrom said the inability of the host nation to provide \n     security is a significant tripwire. Yet neither he nor, to \n     his knowledge anyone else at the Department of State, \n     recommended the Benghazi post be closed.\n       Despite the Department of State's initial determination \n     that the facility in Benghazi would be a temporary one, as \n     time progressed, some Department of State officials believed \n     U.S. diplomats needed to remain there longer than they \n     initially expected. Just weeks before his death and even \n     after there had been attacks against the facility and other \n     western targets in Benghazi, Ambassador Stevens continued to \n     make the case that the Department of State needed a long term \n     presence in Benghazi.\n       A number of other western governments also continued to \n     maintain a presence in Benghazi throughout the summer and \n     fall of 2012. Under Secretary Kennedy noted that diplomats \n     for Italy, France, Turkey and the United Nations remained in \n     Benghazi during that time period.\n       One option American officials did consider was co-locating \n     the American government facilities in Benghazi. By December \n     27, 2011, officials had ``come to the conclusion that co-\n     location is the best and most economical option for'' a \n     continued presence in Benghazi. They also recognized that \n     there were administrative hurdles to this--such as finding a \n     suitable location large enough for the presence of all \n     personnel. The ARB report on the 1998 Nairobi and Dar es \n     Salaam attacks recommended that, ``When building new \n     chanceries abroad, all U.S. government agencies, with rare \n     exceptions, should be located in the same compound.'' The \n     Department of State should also examine whether similar \n     standards should be adopted for the co-location of temporary \n     facilities.\n       Finding 8. The Department of Defense and the Department of \n     State had not jointly assessed the availability of U.S. \n     assets to support the Temporary Mission Facility in Benghazi \n     in the event of a crisis and although DOD attempted to \n     quickly mobilize its resources, it did not have assets or \n     personnel close enough to reach Benghazi in a timely fashion.\n       The Department of Defense (DOD) has a longstanding \n     cooperative relationship with the Department of State, \n     providing support for evacuation and security of diplomatic \n     facilities. For Libya, responsibility for DOD support for \n     diplomatic missions primarily rested with AFRICOM and its \n     Combatant Commander, General Carter F. Ham, headquartered in \n     Stuttgart, Germany. AFRICOM is one of DOD's six geographic \n     combatant commands and is responsible for all DOD operations, \n     exercises, and security cooperation on the African continent \n     (with the exception of Egypt), its island nations, and \n     surrounding waters. The command is also responsible to the \n     Secretary of Defense for military relations with 54 African \n     nations, the African Union, and African regional security \n     organizations. It was established in February 2007 and became \n     a stand-alone command in October 2008. The reason for \n     establishing AFRICOM grew out of concerns about DOD's \n     division of responsibility for Africa among three geographic \n     commands--European Command (EUCOM), Central Command \n     (CENTCOM), and Pacific Command (PACOM)--and worries that \n     security in Africa was receiving less attention than it \n     required based on the increasing presence of Islamist \n     extremists and terrorists there.\n       Since its creation, AFRICOM has been involved in a number \n     of operations in Africa, with a focus on training African \n     forces and engaging in counterterrorism activities in the \n     Horn of Africa. Unlike many of the other geographical \n     combatant commands, AFRICOM was developed to maintain a light \n     footprint. It maintains a single base on the entire \n     continent, in Djibouti. In the spring of 2011, AFRICOM \n     directed U.S. support to the NATO military operations in \n     Libya, and in October 2011, it established a joint task force \n     to command and control post-conflict U.S. operations related \n     to Libya. Since DOD assumes responsibility for evacuation of \n     diplomatic personnel, U.S. citizens, and designated host \n     nation and third country nationals in crises, AFRICOM was \n     responsible for working with Department of State officials in \n     Libya to develop and coordinate Noncombatant Evacuation \n     Operations (NEO) plans for the diplomatic facilities within \n     the region. But the Department of State did not know how long \n     it would take DOD to evacuate personnel at the Benghazi \n     facility in the case of a crisis, naturally making it more \n     difficult for the Department of State to ensure it had \n     adequate security at the facility.\n       In addition, General Ham did not have complete visibility \n     of the extent and number of government personnel in Benghazi \n     in the event that a NEO was required. If sufficient time had \n     been available for such an evacuation, we are concerned that \n     this limitation could have impeded AFRICOM's ability to \n     respond and fulfill its mission responsibility.\n       AFRICOM's lack of operational assets near Benghazi hindered \n     its capacity to evacuate U.S. personnel during the attacks. \n     The Djibouti base was several thousand miles away. There was \n     no Marine expeditionary unit, carrier group or a smaller \n     group of U.S. ships closely located in the Mediterranean Sea \n     that could have provided aerial or ground support or helped \n     evacuate personnel from Benghazi. AFRICOM also lacked a \n     dedicated Commander's In-extremis Force (CIF)--a specially \n     trained force capable of performing no-notice missions. As a \n     result,\n\n[[Page S8536]]\n\n     General Ham was forced to call on the European Command's CIF \n     whose location in Eastern Europe prevented it from getting to \n     Benghazi before the four Americans were killed and all other \n     U.S. personnel were evacuated. We note that AFRICOM later \n     received an independent CIF in October, 2012. DOD and AFRICOM \n     tried to provide effective support on September 11th, but \n     given the nature of the attack in Benghazi and the distance \n     of their assets from Benghazi, they were tragically unable to \n     do so.\n       Recommendation: DOD and the Department of State must \n     jointly perform comprehensive crisis defense and evacuation \n     planning for personnel at U.S. diplomatic facilities \n     worldwide, particularly in high risk environments to \n     determine whether DOD can provide timely support and \n     evacuation capabilities, and assist the Department of State \n     in deciding whether to keep facilities open.\n       Recommendation: Because Africa has increasingly become a \n     haven for terrorist groups in places like Libya and Mali, DOD \n     should provide more assets and personnel within range on land \n     and sea to protect and defend both Americans and our allies \n     on the African continent.\n       Finding 9. Although the September 11, 2012 attack in \n     Benghazi was recognized as a terrorist attack by the \n     Intelligence Community and personnel at the Department of \n     State from the beginning, Administration officials were \n     inconsistent in stating publicly that the deaths in Benghazi \n     were the result of a terrorist attack.\n       One of the key lessons of this Committee's six-year focus \n     on the threat of violent Islamist extremism is that, in order \n     to understand and counter the threat we face, we must clearly \n     identify that threat. During the Committee's investigation \n     into the Fort Hood massacre, for example, we found systemic \n     problems with the way the military addressed violent Islamist \n     extremism in its policies and procedures (treating this \n     specific threat within the broader context of ``workplace \n     violence''). Similarly, while we welcomed the \n     Administration's release last year of a national strategy and \n     implementation plan for countering radicalization \n     domestically, we expressed our disappointment in the \n     Administration's continued refusal to identify violent \n     Islamist extremism as our enemy. The enemy is not a vague \n     catchall of violent extremism, but a specific violent \n     Islamist extremism. It is unfair to the vast majority of law-\n     abiding Muslims not to distinguish between their peaceful \n     religion and a twisted corruption of that religion used to \n     justify violence.\n       There are related lessons to be learned from the \n     Administration's public comments about Benghazi, which we \n     believe contributed to the confusion in the public discourse \n     after the attack about exactly what happened.\n       The NCTC and U.S. law define terrorism as the \n     ``premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated \n     against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or \n     clandestine agents.'' Senior officials from the IC, the \n     Department of State, and the FBI who participated in \n     briefings and interviews with the Committee said they \n     believed the attack on the mission facility in Benghazi to be \n     a terrorist attack immediately or almost immediately after it \n     occurred. The ODNI's spokesman also has publicly said, ``The \n     intelligence community assessed from the very beginning that \n     what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack.''\n       In short, regardless of questions about whether there had \n     been a demonstration or protest outside the Temporary Mission \n     Facility in advance of the attack, the extent to which the \n     attacks were preplanned, or the role of an anti-Islamic video \n     which had sparked protests at the U.S. embassy in Cairo and \n     elsewhere earlier on September 11th, there was never any \n     doubt among key officials, including officials in the IC and \n     the Department of State, that the attack in Benghazi was an \n     act of terrorism.\n       For example, two emails from the State Department \n     Diplomatic Security Operations Center on the day of the \n     attack, September 11, and the day after, September 12, 2012, \n     characterized the attack as an ``initial terrorism incident'' \n     and as a ``terrorist event.'' Agencies and offices \n     responsible for terrorism, including the National \n     Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), the CIA's Office of Terrorism \n     Analysis, and the FBI's Counterterrorism Division, were \n     immediately involved with gathering information about the \n     attack. Indeed, how could there have been any doubt in \n     anyone's mind that, when a large number of armed men break \n     into a U.S. diplomatic facility, set fire to its buildings, \n     and fire mortars at Americans, that it is by definition a \n     terrorist attack?\n       However, the IC's assessment was not reflected consistently \n     in the public statements made by Administration officials, \n     several of whom cited the ongoing investigation, in the week \n     following the attack:\n       On September 12th, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \n     attributed the attack to ``heavily armed militants'' who \n     assaulted the compound . . .'' Her suspicion was that the \n     people involved in this ``were looking to target Americans \n     from the start.'' She also noted that we ``continue to apply \n     pressure on Al Qaeda and other elements that are affiliated . \n     . .''\n       Also that September 12th President Obama, referring to the \n     anti-Islamic video, said ``we reject all efforts to denigrate \n     the religious beliefs of others. But there is absolutely no \n     justification to this type of senseless violence . . .'' He \n     went on to add, ``Of course, yesterday was already a painful \n     day for our nation as we marked the solemn memory of the 9/11 \n     attacks,'' and that ``No acts of terror will ever shake the \n     resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or \n     eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.''\n       However, that same day, the President had the following \n     exchanges with Steve Kroft in a taping for the CBS news \n     program 60 Minutes:\n       Mr. Kroft: Do you believe that this was a terrorist attack?\n       The President: Well, it's too early to know exactly how \n     this came about, what group was involved, but obviously it \n     was an attack on Americans and we are going to be working \n     with the Libyan government to make sure that we bring these \n     folks to justice one way or the other . . .\n       Mr. Kroft: That doesn't sound like your normal \n     demonstration.\n       The President: As I said, we're still investigating exactly \n     what happened, I don't want to jump the gun on this. But--\n     you're right that this is not a situation that was--exactly \n     the same as what happened in Egypt. And--my suspicion is--is \n     that there are folks involved in this who were looking to \n     target Americans from the start. So we're gonna--make sure \n     that our first priority is to get our folks out safe, make \n     sure that our embassies are secured around the world. And \n     then we are gonna go after--those folks who carried this out \n     . . .\n       This is also obviously a reminder that for all the progress \n     that we've made in fighting terrorism, that we're living in a \n     volatile world. And, you know, our troops, but also our \n     diplomats and our intelligence officers they're putting their \n     lives on the line every single day in some very dangerous \n     circumstances . . .\n       But I think we also also have to understand that, we have \n     to remain vigilant. And that even as we--continue to apply \n     pressure on Al Qaeda and--other elements that are \n     affiliated--that in big chunks of the world, in Northern \n     Africa and the Middle East, you've got--a lot of dangerous \n     characters. And we've got to make sure that we're continuing \n     to apply pressure on them . . .\n       Two days later, during a September 14, 2012, White House \n     press briefing, Press Secretary Jay Carney was asked to \n     respond to senators' characterizations of the incident as a \n     terrorist attack following a briefing by Secretary Panetta \n     and others:\n       [Unidentified Reporter]: Jay, one last question--while we \n     were sitting here--Secretary Panetta and the Vice Chair of \n     the Joint Chiefs briefed the Senate Armed Services Committee. \n     And the senators came out and said their indication was that \n     this, or the attack on Benghazi was a terrorist attack \n     organized and carried out by terrorists, that it was \n     premeditated, a calculated act of terror. Levin said--Senator \n     Levin--I think it was a planned, premeditated attack. The \n     kind of equipment that they had used was evidence it was a \n     planned, premeditated attack. Is there anything more you \n     can--now that the administration is briefing senators on \n     this, is there anything more you can tell us?\n       Mr. Carney: Well, I think we wait to hear from \n     administration officials. Again, it's actively under \n     investigation, both the Benghazi attack and incidents \n     elsewhere. And my point was that we don't have and did not \n     have concrete evidence to suggest that this was not in \n     reaction to the film. But we're obviously investigating the \n     matter, and I'll certainly--I'm sure both the Department of \n     Defense and the White House and other places will have more \n     to say about that as more information becomes available.\n       Then, on September 16th, during one of several similar \n     appearances on the Sunday news programs, Ambassador Susan \n     Rice had the following exchange with David Gregory of NBC's \n     Meet the Press:\n       Gregory: Can you say definitively that the attacks on--on \n     our consulate in Libya that killed Ambassador Stevens and \n     others there security personnel, that was spontaneous, was it \n     a planned attack? Was there a terrorist element to it?\n       Ms. Rice: Well, let us--let me tell you the--the best \n     information we have at present. First of all, there's an FBI \n     investigation which is ongoing. And we look to that \n     investigation to give us the definitive word as to what \n     transpired. But putting together the best information that we \n     have available to us today our current assessment is that \n     what happened in Benghazi was in fact initially a spontaneous \n     reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo, \n     almost a copycat of--of the demonstrations against our \n     facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the \n     video. What we think then transpired in Benghazi is that \n     opportunistic extremist elements came to the consulate as \n     this was unfolding. They came with heavy weapons which \n     unfortunately are readily available in post revolutionary \n     Libya. And it escalated into a much more violent episode. \n     Obviously, that's--that's our best judgment now. We'll await \n     the results of the investigation . . .\n       On September 18th, President Obama said on the Late Show \n     with David Letterman that ``extremists and terrorists used \n     this (referring again to the anti-Islamist video) as an \n     excuse to attack a variety of our embassies, including the \n     consulate in Libya.''\n       A definitive response to the question of whether Benghazi \n     was a terrorist attack was given by NCTC Director Matthew \n     Olsen during a hearing before this Committee on September 19, \n     2012. Olsen was asked by the Chairman whether he ``would say \n     that Ambassador Stevens and the three other Americans died as \n     a result of a terrorist attack.''\n\n[[Page S8537]]\n\n     Director Olsen responded that, ``[c]ertainly, on that \n     particular question, I would say yes. They were killed in the \n     course of a terrorist attack'' on our diplomatic mission in \n     Benghazi.\n       After Olsen's September 19th appearance before the \n     Committee, other Administration officials stated with more \n     certainty that Benghazi was a terrorist attack. For example:\n       On September 19th, referring to Matthew Olsen's statements \n     that Benghazi was a terrorist attack, Victoria Nuland stated \n     ``We stand by comments made by our intelligence community who \n     has first responsibility for evaluating the intelligence and \n     what they believe we are seeing.''\n       On September 20th, Jay Carney said, ``It is, I think, self-\n     evident that what happened in Benghazi was a terrorist \n     attack. Our embassy was attacked violently, and the result \n     was four deaths of American officials. So again, that's self \n     evident . . . ''\n       On September 21st, Secretary Clinton said, ``What happened \n     in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and we will not rest \n     until we have tracked down and brought to justice the \n     terrorist who murdered four Americans.''\n       On September 24th, however, when one of the co-hosts of the \n     television program The View asked the President to clarify \n     what she perceived to be discrepancies in the public record \n     regarding the Administration's position about whether \n     Benghazi attack was an act of terrorism, the President's \n     answer was not as definitive:\n       Joy Behar: It was reported that people just went crazy and \n     wild because of this anti-Muslim movie, or anti-Muhammad, I \n     guess, movie. But then I heard Hillary Clinton say that it \n     was an act of terrorism. Is it? What do you say?\n       The President: Well, we're still doing an investigation. \n     There's no doubt that the kind of weapons that were used, the \n     ongoing assault, that it wasn't just a mob action. Now, we \n     don't have all the information yet, so we're still gathering \n     it. But what's clear is that around the world, there's still \n     a lot of threats out there. And that's why we have to \n     maintain the strongest military in the world. That's why we \n     can't let down our guard when it comes to the intelligence \n     work that we do, and staying on top of not just al Qaeda--the \n     traditional al Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan--but all \n     these various fringe groups that have started to develop . . \n     .\n       Director Olsen's statement on September 19, 2012 before \n     this Committee was also significant because he mentioned ties \n     to al Qaeda. He said:\n       At this point, what I would say is that a number of \n     different elements appear to have been involved in the \n     attack, including individuals connected to militant groups \n     that are prevalent in eastern Libya, particularly in the \n     Benghazi area. As well, we are looking at indications that \n     individuals involved in the attack may have had \n     connections to al Qaeda or al Qaeda's affiliates, in \n     particular al Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb.\n       Olsen's acknowledgement was important because, in talking \n     points that were prepared the previous week by the IC for \n     Congress, a line saying ``we know'' that individuals \n     associated with al Qaeda or its affiliates participated in \n     the attacks had been changed to say: ``There are indications \n     that extremists participated,'' dropping the reference to al \n     Qaeda and its affiliates altogether. Members of the IC \n     differed over whether or not this information should remain \n     classified. It is nevertheless noteworthy that the analyst \n     who drafted the original talking points--a veteran career \n     analyst in the intelligence community believed it was \n     appropriate to include a reference to al Qaeda in the \n     unclassified talking points. The senior analyst concluded \n     that the information could be made public because of the \n     claims of responsibility made by Ansar al-Sharia, which has \n     been publicly linked to al Qaeda.\n       In addition to the change deleting al-Qaeda, a reference to \n     ``attacks'' in Benghazi was changed to ``demonstrations.'' \n     Director of National Intelligence (DNI) James Clapper and \n     representatives from the CIA, the State Department, NCTC and \n     the FBI told this Committee that the changes characterizing \n     the attacks as ``demonstrations'' and removing references to \n     al-Qaeda or its affiliates were made within the CIA and the \n     IC, while the change from ``we know'' to ``indications'' was \n     made in response to an FBI request. They also testified that \n     no changes were made for political reasons, that there was no \n     attempt to mislead the American people about what happened in \n     Benghazi, and that the only change made by the White House \n     was to change a reference of ``consulate'' to ``mission.''\n       To provide a full account of the changes made to the \n     talking points, by whom they were made and why, DNI Clapper \n     offered to provide the Committee with a detailed timeline \n     regarding the development of the talking points. At the time \n     of writing this report, despite repeated requests, the \n     Committee had yet to receive this timeline. According to a \n     senior IC official, the timeline has not been delivered as \n     promised because the Administration has spent weeks debating \n     internally whether or not it should turn over information \n     considered ``deliberative'' to the Congress. The September \n     28, 2012 public statement from the ODNI confirmed the IC's \n     judgment ``that some of those involved were linked to groups \n     affiliated with, or sympathetic to al Qa'ida.''\n       We anticipate that the ongoing investigation into these \n     attacks by the FBI will provide important new details about \n     exactly which violent Islamist extremists carried out the \n     attack, the extent to which it was planned, and their precise \n     motivations. But as everyone now acknowledges, there is no \n     doubt that Benghazi was indeed a deliberate and organized \n     terrorist attack on our nation. If the fact that Benghazi was \n     indeed a terrorist attack had been made clear from the outset \n     by all Administration and Executive Branch spokespeople, \n     there would have been much less confusion and division in the \n     public response to what happened there on September 11, 2012.\n       Much of the public discussion about the Benghazi attack has \n     focused on whether a protest took place in Benghazi prior to \n     the attack. While the IC worked feverishly in the days after \n     the attack to identify the perpetrators of the attack, they \n     did not place a high priority on determining with certainty \n     whether a protest had in fact occurred. The IC's preliminary \n     conclusion was that there had been a protest outside of the \n     mission prior to the attack, making this assessment based on \n     open source news reports and on other information available \n     to intelligence agencies. The IC later revised its assessment \n     and the Accountability Review Board has since ``concluded \n     that no protest took place before the Special Mission and \n     Annex attacks.''\n       The unnecessary confusion in public statements about what \n     happened that night with regards to an alleged protest should \n     have ended much earlier than it did. Key evidence suggesting \n     the absence of a protest was not widely shared as early as it \n     could have been, creating or contributing to confusion over \n     whether this was a peaceful protest that evolved into \n     something more violent or a terrorist attack by an \n     opportunistic enemy looking for the most advantageous moments \n     to strike.\n       As early as September 15th, the Annex team that had been in \n     Benghazi during the attack reported there had been no \n     protest. This information was apparently not shared broadly, \n     and to the extent that it was shared, it apparently did not \n     outweigh the evidence decribed above that there was a \n     protest. The next day, the President of Libya's General \n     National Congress, Mohamed Yousef el-Magariaf, also stated on \n     the CBS News show Face the Nation that the attack was planned \n     and involved Al Qaeda elements.\n       On September 15th and 16th, officials from the FBI \n     conducted face-to-face interviews in Germany of the U.S. \n     personnel who had been on the compound in Benghazi during the \n     attack. The U.S. personnel who were interviewed saw no \n     indications that there had been a protest prior to the \n     attack. Information from those interviews was shared on a \n     secure video teleconference on the afternoon of the 16th with \n     FBI and other IC officials in Washington; it is unclear \n     whether the question of whether a protest took place was \n     discussed during this video conference.\n       Information from those interviews was written into FBI FD-\n     302 interrogation reports and sent back to the FBI \n     headquarters. Nearly a week later, on or around September \n     22nd, key information from those interrogation reports was \n     disseminated by the FBI in Intelligence Information Reports \n     (IIRs) to other agencies within the IC. By that date, \n     however, the IC had already received conclusive proof via \n     other means that there had been no protest prior to the \n     attack, in the form of video evidence from the facility's \n     CCTV cameras.\n       We also found documentation that one DS agent apparently \n     concluded there had been no protest as early as September \n     18th. On that date, a State Department DS agent who had seen \n     national press reporting about the attacks asked an agent at \n     the DS Command Center in an email, ``Was there any rioting in \n     Benghazi reported prior to the attack?'' The reply from the \n     Command Center agent: ``Zip, nothing, nada.''\n       Recommendation: When terrorists attack our country, either \n     at home or abroad, Administration officials should speak \n     clearly and consistently about what has happened. While \n     specific details and a full accounting cannot be provided \n     until the government has completed its investigation, the \n     fact that a terrorist attack occurred must be communicated \n     with clarity.\n       Finding 10. As discussed earlier, the talking points about \n     the September 11th attack in Benghazi which were issued by \n     the Intelligence Community on September 14th in response to a \n     request by the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, were the subject of much of the confusion and \n     division in the discussion of the attack. That confusion and \n     division were intensified by the fact that the talking points \n     were issued before the IC had a high degree of confidence \n     about what happened in Benghazi and in the midst of a \n     national political campaign.\n       Recommendation: While the Intelligence Community's primary \n     mission is to inform the appropriate officials of the \n     executive and legislative branches of our government about \n     events that affect our security, it is not the responsibility \n     of the IC to draft talking points for public consumption--\n     especially in the heat of a political campaign--and we \n     therefore recommend that the IC decline to do so in the \n     future.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       The deaths of Ambassador Stevens and three other Americans \n     at the hands of terrorists is a tragic reminder that the \n     fight our country is engaged in with Islamist extremists and \n     terrorists is not over. U.S. and\n\n[[Page S8538]]\n\n     Western diplomats, and other personnel operating in the \n     Middle East and other countries where these terrorists use \n     violence to further their extremist agenda and thwart \n     democratic reforms are increasingly at risk.\n       We hope this report will help contribute to the ongoing \n     discussion that our nation must have about how best to \n     protect the brave men and women who serve our country abroad \n     and how to win this war that will continue for years to come. \n     We owe it to our public servants abroad to protect them as \n     they work to protect us. The government of the U.S. failed \n     tragically to fulfill that responsibility in Benghazi on \n     September 11, 2012. We hope the findings and recommendations \n     we have made in this Special Report will help ensure that \n     such a failure never happens again.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n       1.

The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the chairman of the \nHomeland Security Committee, Senator Joe Lieberman, in submitting for \nthe Congressional Record our investigative report on the terrorist \nattack against the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, that claimed the \nlives of four Americans who were serving our country. This report is \nindeed the last initiative the chairman and I will produce together. It \nis the final work product of 10 years of cooperation and collaboration \nand was authored in the same bipartisan spirit as our investigations \ninto the attack at Fort Hood and into the Government's response to \nHurricane Katrina, among many others.\n  I will so miss working with Chairman Lieberman. He is an \nextraordinary Senator who has contributed so much during his years in \nthe Senate and as a leader of our committee. Sadly, our last official \nact together was prompted by the terrorist attack in Benghazi on \nSeptember 11 of this year that took the lives of our Ambassador and \nthree other brave Americans. Our findings and recommendations are based \non the extensive investigative work the committee has conducted since \nshortly after the attack of September 11, 2012, including meetings with \nsenior and midlevel government officials; reviews of literally \nthousands of pages of documents, both classified and unclassified, \nprovided by the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the \nintelligence community; a review of written responses to questions \nposed by our committee to numerous agencies; our consultations with \nsecurity experts and former officials; and our review of publicly \navailable documents.\n  Our investigation found that the terrorists essentially walked right \ninto the Benghazi compound, unimpeded, and set it ablaze due to \nextremely poor security in a threat environment that was indeed \n``flashing red,'' in the words of a high-ranking State Department \nofficial.\n  As we all recognize, the ultimate responsibility for this atrocity \nlies with the terrorists who attacked our diplomats. Nevertheless, \nthere are several lessons we must learn from this tragedy if we are to \nmake our diplomats\n\n[[Page S8540]]\n\nsafer in the future. It is in that spirit that we are putting our \nunclassified report into the Record so that we can share it with our \ncolleagues and with the American people. We will have more to say about \nour specific findings and recommendations when we release the report \ntomorrow.\n  In the months leading up to the attack, it was well known in \nWashington that Benghazi was increasingly dangerous and at risk for a \nsignificant attack.\n  Our mission facility in Benghazi was itself the target of two prior \nattacks involving improvised explosive devices, including an April \nattack in which one current and one former contract guard at the \nfacility were suspects, and a June attack that blew a hole in the \nperimeter wall.\n  There were also multiple attacks on other western targets, including \na June attack in which a rocket propelled grenade was fired at the \nconvoy of the British ambassador to Libya, injuring two British \nbodyguards. Yet, the State Department failed to take adequate steps to \nreduce the facility's vulnerability to a terrorist attack of this kind.\n  While the Department and the Intelligence Community lacked specific \nintelligence about this attack, the State Department should not have \nwaited for--or expected--specific warnings before increasing its \nsecurity in Benghazi, a city awash with weapons and violent extremists.\n  Our report also underscores the need for the Intelligence Community \nto enhance its focus on violent Islamist extremist groups in the region \nto improve the likelihood of obtaining such intelligence.\n  The lesson about over-dependence on such intelligence, however, is \nnot new. The independent Accountability Review Board reports following \nthe 1998 attacks on our embassies in Africa found that ``both the \nintelligence and policy communities relied excessively on tactical \nintelligence to determine the level of potential terrorist threats to \nposts worldwide,'' yet prior security reviews and ``previous experience \nindicate[d] that terrorist attacks are often not preceded by warning \nintelligence.'' The State Department must finally take this lesson to \nheart.\n  The State Department failed to implement adequate security measures \nto account for the fact that there was no reasonable expectation that \nthe host government--Libya--would protect our diplomats. There was an \noverreliance on the rule of international law when Benghazi was \noperating under the rule of militias outside the effective control of \nthe central Libyan government.\n  The unreliability and conflicting loyalties of the Libyan militia and \nthe unarmed Blue Mountain guards hired to protect the facility are \ndeeply troubling, especially since this problem was recognized long \nbefore the attack. Despite evidence that they were not dependable, \nAmerican personnel were forced to rely upon them far too much. For \nexample, in August, State Department personnel in Benghazi stated that \n``[m]ission opinion is that Libyan security forces are indifferent to \nthe safety needs of the U.S. mission.'' This proved all too true.\n\n  When a host nation cannot adequately protect our diplomats, the State \nDepartment must provide additional security measures of its own, \nurgently press the host government to upgrade its security forces, or \nremove U.S. personnel until appropriate steps can be taken to provide \nadequate security. It is telling that the British government removed \nits personnel from Benghazi after the attack on its ambassador.\n  Too often, the State Department failed to sufficiently respond to--or \neven ignored--repeated requests from those on the ground in Benghazi \nfor security resources, especially for more personnel.\n  Ironically, the challenges facing the security personnel in Benghazi \nwere well summarized in a March 2012 write-up from the top U.S. \nsecurity officer in Benghazi as he sought to recognize his security \nagents with a meritorious honor award. The official justified the award \nbased upon the fact that, ``Agent ingenuity took over where funding and \nDepartment restrictions left off.''\n  The temporary and junior security personnel in Benghazi pleaded for \nmore help from Washington and Tripoli, but they were forced to make do \non their own.\n  The Department must also reassess its local guard programs, \nparticularly the use at high-risk posts of local guard contractors who \ndo not meet standards necessary for the protection of our personnel or \nfacilities.\n  I have previously noted the parallels and repeated mistakes \nidentified in the report on the 1998 bombings of our embassies in Kenya \nand Tanzania, and we include several of these in our report. One of the \nrecurring lessons is that the President and Congress must work together \nto ensure that we appropriately fund security for the State Department.\n  We have seen finger pointing about the lack of resources for embassy \nsecurity, but the budget is a shared responsibility. The inadequate \nsecurity in Benghazi was a product of both budgets approved by Congress \nand of the desire of the administration for a light footprint.\n  Overall, appropriations for the Department of State's security have \nincreased by 27 percent since 2007 and Congress has generally been \nresponsive in providing supplemental and Overseas Contingency \nOperations--OCO--funds to the Department of State. But, there was no \nsupplemental or OCO request made by the President for additional \nembassy security enhancements in the last three years.\n\n  The administration must reevaluate its budget priorities, and since \nthe Benghazi attack, Secretary Clinton is undertaking such a review. \nShe has asked to reprogram $1.4 billion of the FY13 budget request to \njump start this effort.\n  The lack of resources is just one of a number of factors we \nidentified in our report that contributed to a perfect storm on the \nnight of September 11.\n  Our report also calls for the State Department to work more closely \nwith the Department of Defense and the intelligence community to \nimprove the security of our diplomats in high-threat areas when our \nnational interests require their presence. When a host nation cannot \nprotect our personnel, the Department of State must work more \neffectively with the Department of Defense to assign and deploy \nmilitary assets, such as Marine Security Guards, and plan for \ncontingencies in the event of an attack.\n  One of our findings is that, while the Defense Department attempted \nto mobilize its resources quickly, it had neither the personnel nor \nother assets close enough to reach Benghazi in a timely fashion. \nIndeed, as we learned, the Combatant Commander of U.S. Africa Command \ndid not have complete visibility regarding the number of U.S. \ngovernment personnel in Benghazi who would require evacuation in the \nevent of an attack.\n  Our diplomats are increasingly being called on to serve in dangerous \nposts, in countries where emerging democracies lack the ability to \nprotect U.S. personnel and where terrorists and extremist factions \nharbor antipathy toward the West. The U.S. cannot afford to retreat \nentirely from dangerous places where our country's interests are at \nstake, nor is it possible or smart to transform every diplomatic post \ninto a fortress.\n  The absence of reasonable time-tested security measures is, however, \nunacceptable in such high-risk countries. When a host nation cannot \nadequately protect our diplomats or if the State Department and other \nU.S. agencies cannot work together to provide appropriate security, we \ncannot ignore the option of temporarily removing U.S. personnel until \nappropriate steps can be taken to provide adequate security.\n  Finally, our report concludes that the attack in Benghazi was \nrecognized as a terrorist attack by the intelligence community from the \nbeginning.\n  Nonetheless, administration officials were inconsistent in stating \npublicly that the deaths in Benghazi were the result of a terrorist \nattack. If the fact that Benghazi was indeed a terrorist attack had \nbeen made clear from the outset by the administration, there would have \nbeen much less confusion about what happened in Benghazi that terrible \nnight. The attack clearly was not a peaceful protest in response to a \nhateful anti-Muslim video that evolved into a violent incident. It was \na terrorist attack by an opportunistic enemy.\n  This, too, is not a new lesson. One of the key lessons of this \nCommittee's 6-\n\n[[Page S8541]]\n\nyear focus on the threat of violent Islamist extremism is that, in \norder to understand and counter the threat we face, we must clearly \nidentify that threat. We have repeatedly expressed our disappointment \nin the administration's reluctance to identify violent Islamist \nextremism as our enemy--while making the sharp distinction between the \npeaceful religion of Islam and a twisted corruption of that religion \nused to justify violence. The administration's inconsistent statements \nabout whether this was a terrorist attack are symptomatic of this \nrecurring problem. We hope this lesson will finally be heeded.\n  Ultimately, it is with the goal of enabling continued U.S. engagement \naround the world to support our own national interests that we offer \nour findings and recommendations regarding the terrorist attacks in \nBenghazi, Libya, on September 11, 2012. The men and women who serve our \ncountry in dangerous posts deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his extraordinary work on \nthis very important project.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, first, I thank both of my colleagues for \ntheir diligent work. They committed themselves to this work, and I \nappreciate it. They keep us all informed.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Manchin pertaining to the introduction of (S. \n3714) are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/30/senate-section/article/S8541-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8541-S8542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       INCREASING AMERICAN JOBS THROUGH GREATER EXPORTS TO AFRICA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise with the intention of asking \nconsent for the immediate consideration of passage of S. 2215, the \nIncreasing American Jobs Through Greater Exports to Africa Act that I \nhave introduced in the Senate with Senators Boozman, Coons, Cardin, and \nLandrieu. It is being sponsored and led in the House of Representatives \nby Congressman Chris Smith and Congresswoman Karen Bass.\n  It is a straightforward and bipartisan bill that tackles a very \nserious problem by specifically making sure that American companies \nhave the ability to compete in the growing African market. Economists \nhave called this the next frontier, and it is hungry for American goods \nand services. It is also a market that others are competing for too \noften at the expense of American businesses, American employees, \nAmerican products, and American values.\n  China, in particular, has an aggressive strategy to help its \ncompanies invest in Africa, leaving a troubling footprint across the \ncontinent of its economic, labor, environmental, and governance values \nand standards. The loss to American workers and American influence on \nthe continent is enormous and inexcusable. That is why we introduced \nthis bill to make sure a senior administration official brings \ndesperately needed coordination and leadership to the U.S. export \nstrategies in Africa. It also makes sure the various agencies, such as \nthe Department of Commerce, the Export-Import Bank, the Department of \nState, and others are fully engaged in helping foster U.S. investment \nin Africa.\n  For months we have been working with various committees of the House \nand Senate on this effort. I want to notably thank John Kerry of \nMassachusetts and Senator Dick Lugar of Indiana for seeing its \nunanimous support through the Foreign Relations Subcommittee was \nsecure--as well as the Banking and Financing Committees for their help \nin allowing us to go forward.\n  The bill cleared the hotline on the Democratic side some time ago, \nand we worked with a number of our Republican colleagues to address \nmany legitimate concerns. So imagine my disappointment at this closing \nhour when I learned that there is a new Republican hold blocking this \nbill at the very last minute.\n  Mr. President, you have been to Africa. You know what we are facing. \nThis is a continent which is emerging in the 21st century in a way that \nwe never imagined. It is surprising to some to learn that when they try \nto project forward where the economic growth in the world will occur in \nthe next 10 or 20 years, 60 percent of that growth will be in Africa. \nMany people still view it in a stereotypical context of some backward \ncontinent of people with limited resources and limited ability. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth.\n  Africa is going to emerge in the 21st century. The question is, Will \nthe United States be there as a trading partner sharing not only our \ngoods and services but our values? We ought to take heed to the fact \nthat the Chinese are there, and their role is growing. If we step back \nand allow the Chinese to master this continent at our expense, we will \npay for it for generations. They will literally have ensconced \nthemselves in this economy in so many different ways.\n  Currently, they are making what they call concessional loans, which \nmeans discount loans. If they want to build a stadium in Addis Ababa, \nEthiopia, go see the Chinese. If they need to borrow $100,000 or $100 \nmillion, whatever it happens to be, they will give it to them. They \njust need to pay them back 70 percent of what they borrowed--only 70 \npercent. How could the Ethiopians say no?\n  Then the Chinese say: On one condition; the contractor is going to be \nfrom China and at least half of the employees will be Chinese \nemployees, as will the engineering firm, the agricultural firm, and all \nof the different agencies of the private sector that come in to build \nthis stadium. Then when it is finished, they don't leave. They stick \naround to bid on the next project. They become an integral part of the \neconomy of that nation at the expense of the United States.\n  What should we do about it? Nothing? After hearing this story in \nEthiopia, I came back and gathered the American agencies that promote \nexports to Africa. It turned out there were a half dozen of them. They \nwere glad to see one another. They don't get together that often. I \nasked them what they were doing. They said they each have concerns, and \nthey are doing a little of this and a little of that but no \ncoordination.\n  How many speeches have we heard about the waste of government and \ntaxpayer dollars because of the fumbling and uncoordinated effort by \nour government. That is why I introduced this bill to avoid that.\n  The purpose of this bill is to dramatically increase exports to \nAfrica, to use existing resources at existing agencies to achieve it, \nand to make sure that at the end of the day we create more jobs in \nAmerica and more businesses successfully exporting goods and services \nto that great continent. At the end of the day, the Africans will have \nquality products, goods, and services, and there will be more jobs in \nthe United States. What is wrong with that equation? Obviously, there \nis at least one Senator who thinks it is a bad idea, and he has put a \nhold on this bill after I spent months working to clear it through all \nof the committees in the hopes that we could have this bipartisan bill.\n  This is a bill that is supported and sponsored by Republican \nsubcommittee chairman Chris Smith over in the House of Representatives. \nThis is supposed to be what we are about--to come up with a bipartisan \neffort, an effort that will create jobs in America, coordinate existing \nagencies, and open new markets for America's goods and services that \nwill benefit every State in the Union. That is what I set out to do.\n  I am so close to getting it done. One Senator is going to object. It \nis unfortunate after all of the work we put into this that they would \nstop this bill. I hope the Senator will reconsider his position. I have \nan official request that I am going to make at this point.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 536, S. 2215; that the committee-reported \nsubstitute amendment be withdrawn; the Durbin substitute amendment \nwhich is at the desk be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time and passed; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements \nrelating to this measure be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish to \nmake just a couple observations and explain why I am going to object.\n\n[[Page S8542]]\n\n  First, for the record to be clear, it is my understanding this \nmeasure--and there is no question the Senator from Illinois has put a \ngreat deal of work into this. All his motives are absolutely \ncommendable and legitimate. The measure itself, I believe, has not gone \nthrough a markup in the Banking Committee. There are many Members who \nhave serious concerns about this particular bill for which the \nunanimous consent request is being made.\n  More broadly, about the Ex-Im Bank--in fact, I would argue this bill \nand this unanimous consent request puts a light on one of the concerns \nmany of us have with the Ex-Im Bank in the first place. Let's remember \nwhat the Ex-Im Bank is. This is a taxpayer subsidy for large \ncorporations to export products. I am a big fan of trade. I am a big \nfan of exports. I am not a fan of taxpayers having to subsidize the \nactivity, and some of us, myself very much included, believe it ought \nto be a very high priority of this and any other administration to work \nfor the mutual end of these taxpayer-subsidized export vehicles all \naround the world. They exist in other places as well, and that is the \nexcuse that is usually given for why we have to also subsidize our \ncorporations on their exports. I don't think that is a very good \nargument. I would certainly prefer to see a broad curtailment and \neventually the end of this process; whereby, Europeans and Asians and \nAmericans all engage in this flawed policy of subsidizing their \nrespective corporations' export efforts.\n  Here is what happens with this bill, and this is exactly the kind of \nthing that happens when the government sets up a political venture to \nengage in economic activity. It gets politicized. Someone comes along \nwith perfectly good motives and good intentions and decides there is \nsome category of activity that is more important than other categories \nof activity. In this case, it is a geographical prioritization that the \nSenator from Illinois wishes to make by requiring a certain amount of \nbusiness be transacted in Africa. I suspect there are people in this \nbody and in other places who would make similarly persuasive arguments \nthat there are places in Asia that ought to get this special treatment \nwhich the Senator from Illinois is recommending, and there are other \npeople who would suggest maybe it shouldn't be a geographically based \npreference, but it ought to be a product line-based preference or it \nought to be driven by the number of American workers who are involved \nin whatever it is that is being exported.\n  I can imagine all kinds of export criteria by which political forces \ncould decide that the Ex-Im Bank ought to have special treatment in \nspecial categories, all of which simply distorts the normal market \nactivities that would actually optimize exports, economic growth, and \njob creation.\n  So despite all the good intentions and the hard work done by the \nSenator from Illinois, I think this specific policy would be a mistake. \nMore broadly, I think we are not yet on the right path of curtailing \nthe taxpayer obligation for these export subsidies.\n  For that reason, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to clarify a few things. The \nParliamentarian referred the bill to the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. It was reported favorably by that committee. It was referred \nto the Senate Banking Committee, but I made a point with Senator \nBoozman, our colleague on the Republican side, of taking this bill to \nthe Banking Committee, which clearly shows this is not an attempt to go \naround this committee. I have the greatest respect for the Members of \nthe Banking Committee on both sides and we have done our best to work \nwith them.\n  Secondly, this argument that we have to get out of the business of \nhaving government support for business activity is a naive argument. \nLet me give just a couple numbers to reflect on, when it comes to the \nfuture of our chances of American businesses working successfully to \nexport to Africa.\n  Right now, the Export-Import Bank of the United States has supplied \nthe support of about $1 trillion in 2011 for all exports to Africa. \nSome of these are guarantees on loans. Some of them allow for lower \ninterest rates because the guarantees do exist. But let me tell my \ncolleagues what is happening with the Chinese at the same time. While \nwe are putting in $1 trillion in Africa, the Chinese are putting in $12 \ntrillion. Who is going to win that competition? When it is all over, \nwho will win that competition? By a margin of 12 to 1 the Chinese will \nwin it. Many of those who say they support business and new jobs for \nAmerica basically want to abandon the field and walk away from it. They \nwant to let the Chinese take it away: We are going to play free market, \nthat is all; no government involvement. We are just going to have a \nflatout arms' length transaction with these countries--and we will end \nup with fewer jobs in America, fewer exports to Africa, fewer \nbusinesses working on that continent.\n  Some people say: Why did you pick Africa? Of all the places, we could \nhave picked Asia or all these different places. When we take a look at \nthe indicators, the African Continent is undergoing a period of rapid \ngrowth and middle-class development that most Americans aren't even \naware of. In the year 2000, 6.7 percent of the population of Africa had \naccess to the Internet. Talk about the Dark Ages: 6.7 percent, in 2000. \nBy 2009, it had grown from 6.7 percent to 27.1 percent of the \npopulation with access to the Internet. Seventy-eight percent of \nAfrica's rural population now has access to clean water. Our images of \na backward continent are just plain wrong. Our opportunities are \nunlimited but not if we ignore the reality. The Chinese are going to \noutthink us and outwork us and we are going to lose and we will \nultimately say: We are pure of heart. We are not going to have our \ngovernment in this. The Chinese may want to do it. We will just give up \nthe jobs that could have come to America. We will give up the \nopportunity for businesses to export to Africa from the United States. \nWhat a terrible outcome that is. It truly is shortsighted. It argues \nfor a good economic theory but one that doesn't reflect the reality of \nthe world we live in today.\n  After all these months of hard work by a bipartisan group of Senators \nand Congressmen, we come down to one objection. That is how the Senate \nworks. I know it and I respect it. Each Senator has a right to make an \nobjection. I wish to applaud my colleague from Pennsylvania for coming \nto the floor and saying it in his own words. Many times this is done in \nsecrecy without any disclosure of who is behind a hold or an objection, \nand I salute the Senator from Pennsylvania for his honesty in coming to \nthe floor, even though we obviously disagree on this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/30/senate-section/article/S8542-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8542-S8543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE FISCAL CLIFF\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is hard to imagine we are a little over \n24 hours away from going over the so-called fiscal cliff, which occurs \nat midnight on December 31--tomorrow. This cliff is self-imposed. It is \na penalty we voted for if we fail to deal with the deficit our Nation \nfaces. Unfortunately, as of this moment, we have not reached an \nagreement to avoid it. I haven't given up hope. Conversations and \nnegotiations continue all through this day and I am sure into tomorrow, \nand I hope by the end of tomorrow night we can celebrate the end of \nthis year and the beginning of a new year with good news for the \nAmerican people.\n  This is exactly the wrong time for us to go over this cliff. We are \nin the midst of an economic recovery. We are seeing new job creation. \nBusinesses are seeing new growth. We are seeing the kind of economic \nindicators we have been waiting for, for years. Going over the cliff is \ngoing to bring uncertainty to our markets and, with that uncertainty, a \npullback in consumer confidence and a reduction, I am afraid, in \nbusiness activity and in the creation of new jobs.\n  There are sensible ways to avoid it. The President has suggested one. \nIn addition to spending cuts, we need to increase revenue to reduce our \ndeficit. The President said let's have the tax rates which applied \nduring the Clinton administration--a time of great economic expansion--\napply to those making over $250,000 a year. That is only 2 percent of \nthe population, but it generates hundreds of billions of dollars in \nsavings over a 10-year period of time. There has been resistance from \nthe\n\n[[Page S8543]]\n\nother side of the aisle, and we are in active negotiation with the \nRepublicans now as to what we can do to raise revenue to reduce our \ndeficit.\n  We are also talking about some other elements that trouble me. One of \nthem is the estate tax. The estate tax is a tax paid by very few \nAmericans. Less than 1 percent of those who die each year pay anything \nto the Federal Government on their estates because most people don't \nhave an estate large enough to qualify for estate tax liability.\n  There was a long debate for many years on this issue, and Frank Luntz \nand some of the Republican advisers masterfully came up with this term \nthe ``death tax'' and they created this impression among a lot of \npeople that this tax--the estate tax or death tax--would be imposed on \nvirtually everyone. In fact, when I went to O'Hare Airport once to \ncheck in curbside, where people can do that, one of the United Airlines \nattendants took my baggage, saw the name tag on it, and said: Senator, \nplease do something and protect me from the death tax. I wanted to stop \nand tell this hard-working gentleman he would have to win the lottery \nto pay the death tax, as he called it. It is reserved for a small \nnumber of people in this country who have done very well in life and \nend up paying a tax ultimately on the increase in value of many of the \nassets they bought during the course of their life.\n  Having said that, it has become part of our deficit negotiation. I am \ntroubled by the notion we are somehow going to give a tax break to some \n6,000 very fortunate Americans and incur a new expense for our Federal \nGovernment of some $130 billion or $140 billion in the process. What \nare we thinking? At a time when we have to try to bring together the \nresources to reduce our deficit, why would we want to give a new bonus \nbreak for the wealthiest people in this country when it comes to the \nestate tax? That, to me, would be a step backward. I hope we aren't \nforced into any agreement that includes it, although I stand here \nknowing full well if there is an ultimate compromise, there will be \nparts of it I find disgusting and reprehensible which I may have to \nswallow in the name of finding a compromise that will avoid this fiscal \ncliff. That is the nature of a political compromise. I hope that one \nisn't included, but it may be.\n\n  In addition, we have to do things that are important for this economy \nand one of the most important is to make sure we extend unemployment \nbenefits for the long-term unemployed. If we don't act and act quickly, \n2 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits tomorrow--2 \nmillion. These people are literally struggling to get by and keep their \nfamilies together while they look for a job. We should make sure this \nstimulus--the money for unemployed families--continues, so while they \nare trying to find a job or, in fact, going through new education and \ntraining, they have a helping hand. That is who we are as Americans and \nwe ought to include it in any package that avoids this fiscal cliff.\n  Beyond that, there is much work that needs to be done beyond the \nfiscal cliff. This negotiation does not go deeply into deficit \nreduction, and I think we need to. I was a member of the Simpson-Bowles \nCommission. I salute my colleague Kent Conrad of North Dakota, who is \nretiring in just a few days, for his amazing leadership in bringing us \nto this moment in this national debate, but we still have much work to \ndo, and I am sorry Kent will not be here to be personally part of it. I \nhave viewed him as an almost irreplaceable resource in this debate. He \nknows more about our Federal budget and the deficit challenge we face \nthan any Member of Congress, period. All the rest of us have learned so \nmuch from him, and we are certainly going to miss him.\n  We need to continue this effort he started to reduce the deficit. We \nneed to look seriously at our entitlement programs so at the end of the \nday we meet our obligation to future generations. Social Security is \nsolvent for 20 years. We should make it solvent for 75, and we can do \nit; if we face it today, we can do it. I think we ought to have a \nseparate commission taking a look at this challenge, reporting back to \nCongress and entertaining alternatives and substitutes on the floor \nthat are certified to meet the same goal. That is important.\n  We also know in 12 years Medicare will not have the resources it \nneeds to meet its obligations. Forty or 50 million Americans depend on \nit, literally, for their life-and-death issues when it comes to health \ncare. We need to work on that immediately to deal with reducing the \ncost of Medicare while still protecting the integrity and promise of \nthat amazing program that has served us so well for almost 50 years.\n  We have a challenge ahead of us. First, let's work together on a \nbipartisan basis to try to avoid this fiscal cliff; if we cannot, let's \nwork as quickly as we can to get back on our feet, on a bipartisan \nbasis, and come up with an agreement that moves our economy forward. \nFinally, let's deal with deficit reduction and long-term entitlement \nreform. That is part of our obligation.\n  I spoke to our Senate Democratic caucus a little earlier today about \nthe terrible problems we face in Illinois, with one of the lowest \ncredit ratings in the Nation, primarily because our pension systems are \nunderfunded. For more than four decades, Republican and Democratic \nGovernors have ignored the challenge, as have many leaders in our \ngeneral assembly. And now the responsibility falls on this generation \nof leaders to try to deal with a vexing situation where it would take \nliterally one-third of our State budget to meet the unfunded \nliabilities of our pension systems.\n\n  We cannot let that happen at the Federal level. Whether it is Social \nSecurity or Medicare, we need to make the thoughtful choices, the \nthoughtful advances in these programs today that protect them for \ngenerations to come.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Blumenthal).

Mr. President, we are here just hours before a \nlooming deadline that is going to affect just about every American in \nsome way, and I do believe both sides of the aisle and both sides of \nthe Rotunda want to come to a conclusion that will keep us from having \nwhat looks like a complete meltdown of governing in Washington.\n  Someone asked the question in one of our conferences: When was the \nlast time Congress was in session and voting between Christmas and New \nYear's? The answer was, since 1970 there has not been such a session. \nAnd it has actually happened only four times in the history of our \ncountry, and two of those times were dealing with World War II.\n  So I think the enormity of the issue is very clear, and that is why \nwe are here. I think we should have done this 6 months ago, a year ago. \nI think all of us agree we should not be here at this last hour still \ntrying to negotiate a point at which so many Americans are going to be \nmore heavily taxed.\n  I was pleased to see that the distinguished deputy leader on the \nDemocratic side talked about the three areas we have to address, and \ndeficit reduction is most certainly one of them because we are facing a \nceiling of a $16.4 trillion debt that is getting ready to be exceeded. \nSo, yes, deficit reduction and entitlement reform are two areas we must \naddress.\n  This country cannot continue to have Social Security and Medicare \nspiraling toward insolvency. We cannot do it. But it is going to take a \nbipartisan approach. It is not rocket science to see that we have a \nDemocratic Senate, a Republican House, and a Democratic President, and \nthat is going to be the same starting January 3 of next year for at \nleast 2 more years. So we know what we are dealing with, and I think it \naffects us right now in the fiscal cliff negotiations because we are \nnot going to do anything unless it is bipartisan. We will not be able \nto pass anything in the House that does not have significant Republican \nvotes in the Senate, and the Democrats in the Senate are not going to \nbe able to support something that will not require some votes of \nDemocrats in the House.\n  So we are together--maybe it is like a dysfunctional family, but we \ndo have to work together because without bipartisanship, nothing is \ngoing anywhere. Therefore, I think you have to go back to negotiations \n101, which is that someone in a negotiation has to win some and lose \nsome. The other party in a negotiation has to win some\n\n[[Page S8544]]\n\nand lose some. The President is not going to get everything he wants. \nThe Republicans in the House and Senate are not going to get everything \nwe want, nor are the Democrats in the House and Senate.\n  So we have areas where we can come together, and I have seen it. All \nof us were talking in the last couple of hours about how we have talked \nto our counterparts on the other side of the aisle about what could \nbring us together, and there are very clear areas where we can come to \nan agreement.\n  We are not going to be able to negotiate all parts of what we must do \nto get our financial house in order. We are not going to be able to do \ntax reform in a comprehensive way, we are not going to be able to do \nthe fixing of and reforming of our entitlement programs, and we are not \ngoing to be able to set all of the spending cuts we are going to have \nto do going forward right here in the next 36 hours. We cannot do it. \nThat has to be done on a basis of determining after many hearings what \nour priorities are and what the ceiling on spending should be. We must \nset a ceiling. Is it 18 or 20 percent of gross domestic product? Is it \nsome amount that goes down each year? That is the question that has to \nbe decided after a lot of discussion next year.\n  But what we can do is avoid a fiscal calamity by not having the \nsequestration take place on January 2 at midnight--but make that for a \nvery short term. It cannot be 2 years of a moratorium on sequestration \nbecause then we would not get to where we need to be in determining the \npriorities that will lower the rate of spending in this country. Our \nproblem in this country is a spending problem, and with a $16.4 \ntrillion debt, more spending is not going to be the answer.\n  So let's look at a very short-term avoidance of sequestration because \nwe do not want to disrupt our military when they have boots on the \nground in harm's way. We would not do that. We would not do it on \neither side of the aisle. So we need to talk about some short-term \nsequestration avoidance but not a long-term one because there are \nthings we can cut in the military budget that will not affect the \nequipment and the pay and the living conditions of our military. We can \ncut other things. So we have to be able to come to terms with not \nhaving sequestration but making it very short term.\n  I think it is clear the President has wanted to increase taxes on \nwhat he considers the wealthy. I disagree with the President on what is \nwealthy, and I hope we can come to terms. Even the President has said a \n$400,000 threshold is something he could accept. Many on the other side \nof the aisle have said $500,000 or $600,000--$400,000 or $500,000 or \n$600,000 is something they could work with. And if we do some other \nthings, I believe we could come to a consensus--not something that \nwe like because I do not think we ought to raise taxes on anyone, and I \nhave certainly voted that way, but there is some area where we can have \na fix that will keep us from having to go over this cliff and hurt so \nmany people in this country.\n\n  I think it is so important that we look at the big-ticket items in a \ncomprehensive way, knowing that we are going to have to do that next \nyear. But there are things we can do right now. I do not know 1 person \nout of 100 here who wants the AMT to take effect and cause people who \nmake $33,750 to have to pay more taxes. I think we should do away with \nthe AMT completely, but certainly it should not kick in at $33,750. We \nneed to fix it, and I think everybody here agrees we need to fix it.\n  The distinguished deputy leader was talking about the death tax. Now, \nhe does not think we should fix the death tax. I certainly do. If we go \nto a $1 million exemption and a 55-percent tax, I think that is going \nto hurt family-owned businesses, it is going to hurt farms and ranches, \nand it is going to hurt the people who work for those family-owned \nbusinesses. Why is that? It is because the value of farms and ranches, \nwhich is land, does not have a revenue stream that allows you to pay \nthe tax. So what do you have to do? You have to sell an asset, but you \ncannot get the full valuation that is put on it. You cannot do it. I \nhave owned a manufacturing company, and I can tell you, you cannot sell \nthe equipment for the value that is put on that piece of equipment. So \nwhat happens to a family-owned business? They end up having to sell at \npennies on the dollar to pay the tax, and people are put out of work. \nIs that really what we want?\n  The exemptions we have now are $5.1 million and a 35-percent rate. It \nwould go to $1 million--in 36 or 48 hours--$1 million and a 55-percent \nrate. And remember, the death tax is a tax that has already been paid \nagain and again and again. It is a tax on the value of the equipment or \nthe land that has already been taxed with a property tax or a sales tax \non the equipment.\n  So there is a reason to have some accommodation in the death tax so \nthat we will not face more unemployed people who worked for a family-\nowned business or farm, and if it is not the No. 1 issue of the Farm \nBureau of this country, it certainly is in the top two or three because \nthey know--they know--what it is like to have to sell land at a value \nthat is not realistic and pay a tax. And a 55-percent tax is pretty \nconfiscatory.\n  So I do hope we can come together on a bipartisan basis because if we \ndo not come together on a bipartisan basis, nothing will get done, \nbecause we have the House that is looking to the Senate, which is \nsupposed to be the adult in the room, and they are looking at us to see \nhow the votes turn out, and we need a large majority on both sides of \nthe aisle to send to the House something that has a firm stamp of \napproval of this body.\n  We need the President to be a player here as well. I am encouraged \nthat he is now talking to our leaders and hopefully being constructive. \nAnd certainly our Vice President, who served in this body for so long, \ndoes understand the importance of the one-on-one talks, and he is \ntalking to, I know, our leader and most certainly the Democratic leader \nas well.\n  So the hour is getting late, both figuratively and literally. We do \nnot have much time to settle an issue that will affect the economy of \nthis country.\n  Last but not least, I am sure the President does not want to have a \ncalamity like this happen on his watch. And I do not want, on my watch, \nas one who is leaving the Senate this year, for this to be the last \nthing that happens on my watch. I do not think anyone here is going to \nbenefit from a calamity happening in this country's economy--even for a \nfew days--because it just looks as though we cannot govern.\n  It is time to realize that on a bipartisan basis we can do some \nthings that will not be universally liked. It will not be liked by \neveryone in this room because we are not going to get everything we \nthink is right. But we can move our country forward. We can help \neveryone in this country, every taxpayer.\n  But we are not going to raise taxes to spend more. We should be \nsaying, OK, if there is going to be a threshold that pays more taxes, \nwe should know it is going to bring down the deficit. That is a very \nimportant point that we hope will be determined at the end of this road \nin 36 to 48 hours.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that on Friday, December 28, \nthe Senate passed H.R. 1. I would like to outline some of the goals \nthat I and many of my colleagues from New York have for this \nlegislation. As you know, the Senate Appropriations Committee under the \nleadership of the late Chairman Inouye and now Chairman Mikulski, has \nput together a very robust and flexible bill that will help many \nvictims of our damaged States, from housing to small business to \ntransportation. The depth of the devastation to New York was \nsignificant--some estimate nearly $100 billion in damage.\n  When I saw whole neighborhoods in my State washed away, it was clear \nthat significant Federal disaster funding was necessary. Although it \nhas been 2 months since Hurricane Sandy ravaged New York, I am pleased \nthe Senate has passed H.R. 1, with more than $60 billion in Federal \nfunding to\n\n[[Page S8545]]\n\naid homeowners, small businesses, hospitals, and New York's critical \npublic infrastructure.\n  I spent hours with New Yorkers after the storm, and I thank my Senate \ncolleagues for hearing their pleas and ensuring that the Federal \nGovernment has stepped up to help them in this terrible time.\n  I hope that our colleagues in the other body will swiftly pass H.R. \n1. New Yorkers have already been waiting too long.\n  I would like to describe how H.R. 1 will provide Federal relief to \nthe victims of Hurricane Sandy.\n  Shortly after the storm subsided, some claimed that the FEMA disaster \nrelief fund had enough funds and that a supplemental appropriation \ncould wait. I could not disagree more and fought hard to ensure that \nthe bill we have today was brought to the Senate floor. H.R. 1 includes \n$11.5 billion for the disaster relief fund to support disaster response \nand recovery needs of our local governments and first responders.\n  H.R. 1 includes $17 billion for the community development block grant \nfor victims of Hurricane Sandy who have lost their homes or businesses. \nFEMA will provide repair funding of $31,900, but for many of the \n300,000 New York homeowners with significant damage, the CDBG funds are \nessential to cover their uninsured losses. These funds can also be used \nfor the critical mitigation projects, such as flood proofing so that \nthese same homeowners will be safe when the next storm comes.\n  H.R. 1 provides $5.4 billion in Federal funds to the Army Corps to \nfortify our New York coastline. From Staten Island to Montauk, the \ncoast of New York is vulnerable to future storms. The following \nprojects were never fully constructed due to a lack of funding and will \nnow be eligible: South Shore of Staten Island; city of Long Beach; \nRockaway beach; Coney Island; Fire Island to Montauk Point; Gilgo and \nRobert Moses beaches; and Asharoken Village.\n  As was said throughout debate on H.R. 1, disaster funding is also \nabout prevention. It is essential that the Army Corps conduct a \ncomprehensive flood protection study of the New York Harbor region. I \nhope they will get to work immediately once the bill becomes law.\n  H.R. 1 will also build a bridge back to profitability for our small \nbusinesses. Thousands of small business owners were inundated by \nHurricane Sandy endured total destruction or interruption of commerce \nfor days and weeks. Like we have in other storms, the community \ndevelopment block grant funding provided in H.R. 1 should be used for a \nsmall business relief program to boost the region's ailing \nposthurricane economy. I will be watching to make sure that New York \nsmall businesses who need assistance receive it.\n  H.R. 1 will allow for the hardening of New York's Electric Grid. I \nbelieve it is critical that drastic rate increases are prevented. The \nLong Island Power Authority and Con Edison need help elevating \nsubstations, installing smart grid sensors, and building stormproof \npoles. The duration of power outages in New York was one of the worst \ncatastrophes of Hurricane Sandy, and we hope that these funds will mean \nNew Yorkers never have to experience that again.\n  H.R.1 also will protect and improve the gasoline infrastructure in \nNew York Harbor. Hurricane Sandy's wrath destroyed unprotected gas \nterminals and pipelines in New York harbor and gas shortages brought \nwhole communities to their knees. Federal mitigation funding should and \nmust be used to protect our gasoline infrastructure from the next storm \nby providing backup power and booster systems for facilities like the \nBuckeye pipeline.\n  H.R. 1 includes $10.8 billion for public transportation. New York has \none of the largest public transit systems in the country and suffered \nover $5 billion in damage from the storm. Experts have said that much \nof this damage could be prevented in the future with new mitigation \ntechniques H.R. 1 provides to ensure that our transit systems build \nsubway seals, erect flood gates in tunnels, and establish advanced \ndrainage systems.\n  H.R. 1 also includes $200 million for the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. I hope that at least $150 million will be provided to \nthe National Institutes of Health for repair and recovery of New York \nUniversity's medical research program. The Smilow Research Center is \none of NYU's three animal research facilities, and because of Hurricane \nSandy, an untold amount of medical discovery and hard work has been \nlost. According to NYU, an estimated 10 million gallons of water poured \ninto the ground and the basement of the institution, bending 3-inch \nsteel doors in half, washing away walls as well as sandbags, and \ndestroying everything in its wake.\n  Because of a power outage, the animal labs went dark where the best \nand brightest researchers search for cures and treatments. The center \nheld specimens critical to NYU scientists' research in heart disease, \ncancer, and neurodegeneration. Dr. Francis Collins, the head of the \nNIH, said this: ``The damage is truly appalling. The infrastructure has \nbeen essentially obliterated.'' I appreciate how much assistance the \nNIH has already provided to NYU's researchers, and I will continue to \nensure that NYU can be rebuilt.\n  H.R. 1 also includes Federal funds through FEMA and through the HHS \nsocial services block grant to help New York's hospitals. Hurricane \nSandy caused 36 health care facilities to be closed completely, \nincluding 4 hospitals, 17 nursing homes, and 4 health clinics. It is \nessential that FEMA and New York State do everything they can to help \nour health care facilities get back on their feet.\n  In the blink of an eye, the Atlantic Ocean turned from our greatest \nnatural resource into a nightmarish monster, but with the Senate \npassage of H.R. 1, New York is on its way to recovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/30/senate-section/article/S8545-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8545-S8547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n\n                             Richard Lugar\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

On this bill, as on all other issues throughout his Senate \ncareer, Senator Lugar worked to develop practical solutions to the \nchallenges we face regarding energy.\n  Senator Lugar is the longest serving Member of Congress from his home \nState of Indiana. He graduated first in his class from Shortridge High \nSchool in Indianapolis and after attending college, he began his \nservice to our country as an intelligence briefer in the U.S. Navy. He \nlater served as mayor of Indianapolis, on the U.S. Advisory Commission \non Intergovernmental Relations, and as President of the National League \nof Cities before beginning his 36 year Senate career.\n  He has clearly served the people of Indiana well. Just last month, \nthe Indianapolis Monthly Magazine published ``By the Numbers: Richard \nLugar's Legacy,'' which listed many of Senator Lugar's accomplishments. \nThe article noted that Indianapolis gained 57,000 jobs during Senator \nLugar's tenure as mayor and 7,500 nuclear warheads were deactivated as \na result of the Nunn-Lugar program. According to the article, Senator \nLugar has cast more than 13,000 votes in the Senate and worked with 7 \ndifferent Presidents. He has been recognized for his service with the \nGuardian of Small Business award, the Spirit of Enterprise award, the \nWatchdog of the Treasury award, and more than 45 honorary degrees from \ncolleges and universities in 15 States and the District of Columbia. \nThe American Political Science Association got it right when they named \nhim an Outstanding Legislator, and he won his last general election \nwith 87 percent of the vote.\n  I will miss Senator Lugar's friendship, commonsense approach to \ngetting things done, and commitment to the\n\n[[Page S8546]]\n\npeople of Indiana and the people of the United States. I will miss his \nalways congenial personality and his gracious and respectful manner \ntowards others. I will close by noting what I think may be the biggest \naccomplishment noted by Indianapolis Monthly Magazine, his 56-year \nmarriage to his wife Char. I wish them the best in the coming years.\n\n\n                          Kay Bailey Hutchison\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor my colleague and friend from the \nState of Texas, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, as she prepares to retire \nfrom the Senate after almost 20 years serving her beloved State. I have \nbeen honored to serve with Senator Hutchison and will truly miss her \npresence and the guidance she has shared over the last 10 years.\n  Senator Hutchison is a Texan through and through. She is the \ndescendant of Texas pioneers, which might account for the fighting \nspirit she has displayed here in the Senate. She is a trail blazer, and \nin finding her own path broke barriers and overcame the challenges she \nfaced early in her career. She was one of only 13 women in a class of \nnearly 400 who graduated from the University of Texas Law School in \n1967. After graduating, she faced a harsh reality of the time as no law \nfirm in Houston would hire a woman; however she did not let this break \nher spirits. In 1972 she became the first Republican woman elected to \nthe Texas State House, where she learned the value of bipartisanship, \nworking across the aisle to address the inequities and stigma that rape \nvictims faced in the legal system--and carried legislation which would \nbecome a model for states across the country. This is one of the many \nreasons I have come to respect and admire the senior Senator from \nTexas--her ability to bring people together to benefit those we serve.\n  After being elected Texas state treasurer in 1990, she again made \nhistory in 1993 by becoming the first, and only, woman to be elected to \nthe Senate from Texas. Here in the Senate, she has been a champion for \nour military forces, serving on the Intelligence and Armed Services \nCommittees, and as chairman and ranking member of the Military \nConstruction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee. In those \nroles she has worked to ensure our servicemembers and their families \nhave the support they need. She has also made major contributions \nthrough her work to expand science and education, consistently \nadvocating for needed improvements so that our students stay \ncompetitive. Her commitment to education has led her to play a role in \ncreating a program at the National Science Foundation which will expand \ntraining for math and science teachers of tomorrow, and she was a \ndriving force in establishing the Academy of Medicine, Engineering and \nScience of Texas.\n  In addition to her legislative accomplishments, Senator Hutchison is \nto be recognized for her efforts to keep the Senate schedule workable \nfor families. Kay's children are now 11 years old and many of us have \nwatched as they have grown. One of my favorite pictures is of Senator \nHutchison, the only woman in a sea of men, holding the hands of Bailey \nand Houston as toddlers. Whether it was late nights or flights to \ncatch, Kay reminded the leaders that we have an obligation to our \nfamilies as well.\n  Throughout her career Senator Hutchison has tackled challenges with \ngrace, resilience, and perseverance. As a tireless advocate for her \nState, we can learn a lot from Senator Hutchison's example of what a \npublic servant should be, and she certainly leaves an impressive legacy \nhere in the Senate. In her book, American Heroines, which chronicles \nsome of the first American women trailblazers, she wrote that she \nbelieves America is the best place on earth to be a woman that--the \nopportunities are endless. These opportunities are due to Senator \nHutchison and women like her, women whose independence and integrity \nhave set an example for those who will follow in their footsteps. I \nthank Senator Hutchison for her leadership and her friendship, and wish \nher the best.\n\n\n                             Olympia Snowe\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to recognize my colleague and friend, Senator \nOlympia Snowe, as she plans to retire from the U.S. Senate. Her nearly \nfour-decade career in Congress has been one of distinction and \nunwavering public service to Maine and the United States.\n  Senator Snowe's achievements are numerous. In 1978, she became the \nyoungest Republican and first Greek-American woman to be elected to the \nU.S. House of Representatives. In 1994, when she was first elected to \nthe U.S. Senate, she became the fourth woman to serve in both Houses of \nCongress. She also has the distinction of being the first Republican \nwoman to secure a full-term seat on the Senate Finance Committee. In \ntotal, she has won more Federal elections in Maine than any other \nperson since World War II--a testament to how loved she is by her \nconstituency.\n  Senator Snowe has worked extensively on a number of issues, including \nbudget and fiscal responsibility, veterans, education, national \nsecurity, welfare reform, oceans and fisheries issues, and campaign \nfinance reform. It has been my pleasure to work with Senator Snowe on \nthe Senate Oceans Caucus, where together we have stressed the \nimportance of ocean policy and the crucial role our oceans play in all \naspects of life in our respective States and across America.\n  I also appreciate Senator Snowe's leadership on the Small Business \nCommittee, where she has been a strong advocate for small businesses in \nMaine and across the country.\n  I know that I speak for all the female Senators in the U.S. Senate \nwhen I say it is sad to see such a well-respected female colleague \nretire. Senator Snowe deserves the highest accolades for her service to \nthis Nation. This is a woman who has done remarkably well by the \nAmerican people, by her constituents in Maine, and by her colleagues in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  I personally admire her efforts to work--always--in a bipartisan \nmanner. Her moderation and willingness to listen to all sides of an \nissue are examples for us all. I am encouraged that she intends to \ncontinue her efforts to advance good public policy by working to help \nelect those who are unafraid to stand in the middle and work to build \nconsensus.\n  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I thank Senator Snowe for her \ndedication to her country, and I congratulate her on her retirement. I \nalso want to recognize her husband Jack, who has also been an amazing \npublic servant.\n\n\n                              Scott Brown\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to recognize Senator Scott Brown's service to \nthe Senate. While we have only had the opportunity to work together for \n2 years, I have truly appreciated Senator Brown's insight, leadership, \nand friendship.\n  Senator Brown moved to Massachusetts as a young boy. He graduated \nfrom Wakefield High School, then joined the Massachusetts National \nGuard when he was 19. After attending Northwestern University and \ngraduating from Tufts University and Boston College Law School, Senator \nBrown began serving the people of Massachusetts in 1992, first as a \nreal estate assessor and then as a selectman in Wrentham. In 1998, he \nwas elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, and after \nthree terms he was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate. In each \nof his State Senate reelection bids, he ran unopposed. As a State \nlegislator, he advocated for children's and victims' rights as well as \nveterans affairs and worked to promote good government initiatives.\n  Senator Brown came to the United States Senate in 2010. He quickly \nfound his voice on the Armed Services and Veterans Affairs Committees \nthanks to more than 30 years of service in the National Guard. I was \nproud to join more than 30 of my colleagues in cosponsoring his Stolen \nValor Act, which would make it a crime to knowingly misrepresent \nmilitary service if a person wanted to profit from his or her lie.\n  Senator Brown also worked on good government initiatives in the \nSenate, leading bipartisan efforts to repeal a provision of law \nrequiring Federal, State, and local governments to withhold 3 percent \nof payments due to contractors. I was proud to cosponsor his bill to \navoid making infrastructure improvements more costly and business more \nchallenging for healthcare professionals who accept Medicare payments.\n  I have also been proud to work with Senator Brown on another \ncommonsense initiative in this Congress, the Prompt Notification of \nShort Sales\n\n[[Page S8547]]\n\nAct. Our bill would improve the housing market by requiring banks to \nprovide a written response to an short sale offer within 75 days of a \nrequest from a homeowner. There are neighborhoods across the country \nfull of empty homes and underwater owners who have legitimate offers, \nbut unresponsive banks, and I commit to Senator Brown that I will \ncontinue to work on this issue in the coming year.\n  Clearly Senator Brown has served the people of Massachusetts and the \npeople of the United States well, and he will be missed. I wish the \nbest to him, his wife Gail, and their daughters Ayla and Arianna.\n\n\n                             Jeff Bingaman\n\n  Mr. President, today I rise to recognize one of our most \ndistinguished Senators as he prepares to retire from this body after \nfive terms. Senator Jeff Bingaman has earned the reputation of being a \nstrong and effective leader during his time in the Senate. He has \nachieved what all of us try to achieve as advocates of our States--\ngetting results in Washington while staying closely connected to our \nconstituents who sent us here to represent them. I have admired his \nintelligence, courage, pragmatism, and willingness to solve problems \nwith bipartisan solutions.\n  Senator Bingaman and I have worked together on many issues and \nprojects, and I have never questioned his steadfast commitment to do \nwhat he believes is right for New Mexico and this country. During his \n30 years in the Senate he has worked tirelessly on a number of \ncommittees, including the Armed Services Committee, the Finance \nCommittee, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which he currently \nchairs.\n  While most of my work with Jeff has been on energy issues, working \nwith Senator Bingaman on the Senate HELP Committee was also a great \npleasure. He has been an excellent partner, for example, on issues that \nare important to our American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and Alaska \nNative constituents, who often live in communities that face multiple \nchallenges. There have been many times in the HELP Committee when it \nhas been necessary for me to explain why a proposed solution won't work \nin Alaska. As I begin to explain about the Federal trust \nresponsibility, or tribal sovereignty, the lack of health care and \nbasic infrastructure, or how difficult it is to get and keep teachers, \nnurses, and others in those communities, there have been times when I \nhave seen my colleagues think--here we go again, the ``It is different \nin Alaska'' speech. But whether we have been discussing education, \nhealth care, job creation, or any one of the innumerable challenges \nAmericans face when they live in Indian Country, Jeff Bingaman gets it. \nHe and I have been able to speak with our colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle with one voice about what will work, what will not work, and \nwhy. We can explain the complexities of the Federal trust \nresponsibility and tribal sovereignty as a bipartisan team because \nwhether our constituents live on a reservation in New Mexico or a \nremote village in Alaska or in one of our larger cities, the challenges \nthey face are often the same, and what will work in other places in \nAmerica often won't work in our Native communities. That partnership \nhas been so important in making sure that the good work we are trying \nto do for all Americans works for America's first peoples in every \nState.\n  In addition to our work on HELP, our strongest collaboration has been \nwhile working together in our leadership roles on the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee. Senator Bingaman has been tireless in \nensuring that our Nation has the energy resources it needs to meet our \ngrowing demands well into the 21st century. He was a leader in the \ndevelopment of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007, both major blueprints for the \nexpansion of all forms of renewable energy, especially biomass, \ngeothermal, and marine hydrokinetic power. I am happy to have had the \nchance to work closely with Senator Bingaman in those efforts. In 2008 \nand 2009 we also worked to pass a package of major public land \nlegislation that will be a legacy for the Senator for decades to come.\n  When Senator Bingaman announced he was retiring from the Senate, I \ntook note that he vowed to finish out the remainder of Congress with \nsubstantive achievements. Since then, he has affirmed this promise and \nhas again driven productive discussions on several issues that will \nlast beyond his time here, such as his efforts to move forward our \nNation's program on spent nuclear fuel. The legislation that he \nintroduced is indicative of months of thoughtful and productive \ndiscussions aimed to address the back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle. I \ncongratulate him on constantly moving the conversation forward and \nputting a marker out there toward reaching an equitable goal.\n  Senator Bingaman should be very proud of his nearly four decades of \npublic service as New Mexico's attorney general and U.S. Senator. From \nfighting for our energy future to standing with the people of New \nMexico through difficult economic times, Senator Bingaman has been a \ntrusted leader for the people of his State. He has been a champion for \nhis constituents, a powerful voice for Native American concerns, and a \nleader on science research and energy tax policy.\n  He has been unfailingly and personally considerate to me, and I \nextend my gratitude for his service and thank him for his gracious aid \non issues of concern to me and my home State. I wish him and his family \ngood health and best wishes in the future and great happiness in \nwhatever he and Anne now decide to do. The Senate has been a better \nplace due to his civilized manner, his wit, and his intelligent \nsolutions for the Nation's problems. We will miss Senator Bingaman's \npresence here in the Senate.\n\n\n                               Herb Kohl\n\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to recognize Senator Kohl as he \nprepares to retire after 24 years in the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Kohl was born and raised in Wisconsin, the State he \ntirelessly represents to this day. He attended public school in \nMilwaukee and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison before obtaining \nhis MBA from Harvard University in 1958. His business ventures proved \nincredibly successful and he was acting President of Kohl's grocery and \ndepartment stores for nearly a decade. In 1988, he took his business \nand education experience to the U.S. Senate.\n  I have had the pleasure of serving with Senator Kohl on the \nAppropriations Committee for the past 4 years. His bipartisan \ncooperation is outstanding and together we have worked on numerous \nhearings and bills. He has been an asset on the committee and we will \nmiss his dedication, intuition, and eagerness to work with others to \nfind solutions.\n  As a mother of two and former PTA member, I also appreciate Senator \nKohl's zeal in advocating children's issues. He authored legislation to \nexpand the school breakfast program, strengthened child nutrition \nprograms, and has worked to meet the growing demand for child care. His \nwork on the Appropriations Committee ensured the continuation of \nimportant programs such as the Boys and Girls Club and the Families and \nSchools Together Program. This hard work did not go unrecognized. In \n2010, Senator Kohl received the Best of Congress Award from Working \nMother Magazine and Corporate Voices for Working Families. I will \nalways admire Senator Kohl for his hard work on behalf of families and \nchildren across the U.S.\n  Senator Kohl's charitable endeavors will also remain an important \npart of his legacy. In 1990, he established the Herb Kohl Educational \nFoundation Achievement Award Program. This program provides annual \ngrants to 200 graduating high school seniors, 100 Wisconsin teachers, \nand 100 schools in his home State.\n  I cannot thank Senator Kohl enough for his service over the past few \ndecades. I am honored to have worked by his side and wish him the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/30/senate-section/article/S8547-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8547-S8548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n               Enrolled Bills and Joint Resolution Signed\n\n  At 2:39 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills and joint resolution:\n\n       S. 925.

A bill to alleviate the fiscal cliff, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise today frustrated, embarrassed, and \nangry. It is absolutely inexcusable that all of us find ourselves in \nthis place at this time standing on the floor of the Senate in front of \nthe American people, hours before we plunge off the fiscal cliff, with \nno plan and no apparent hope, but here we are, and we have to do \nsomething.\n  If we are as determined to go over the cliff as we seem, we have to \ndo something to soften the landing because at the bottom of the fiscal \ncliff are immediate and massive tax increases, deep and indiscriminate \nspending cuts, and the risk of another recession. So, as we come down \non the final hours, we have two choices--to do nothing and cause an \nunbelievable amount of hardship for our fellow Americans or to do \nsomething to reduce the suffering inflicted on our citizens by an \ninflexible political system.\n  I choose to do something. Today I am introducing the CALM Act, which \nstands for the Cliff Alleviation at the Last Minute Act. The CALM Act \nwill do three important things: It will soften the financial blow of \nthe fiscal cliff, it will calm our financial markets, and it gives us \nthe certainty of a plan now but allows us, if we ever find the courage, \nto pursue the fiscal grand bargain that has eluded us so far. Make no \nmistake, the financial markets are watching us, and they are getting \nmore nervous by the hour. We need to reassure them that we are capable \nof making big financial decisions.\n  This bill, the CALM Act, is not something I am excited about or proud \nto offer. This is not a great plan, but it is merely a better plan than \ngoing over the cliff. It should never have come to this. We have known \nfor more than a year that this day was coming. For more than a year, I \nhave asked Congress for a big fix to our Nation's fiscal challenges. I \npushed strongly for the Simpson-Bowles framework for deficit reduction. \nYet here we are, no closer to a sensible decision on how to bring our \n$1.1 trillion budget deficit and our $16.1 trillion public debt under \ncontrol.\n  Guess what. Time is up. No more games. No more excuses. No more \nkicking the can down the road. We have to act, and we have to act in a \nway that puts our fiscal house in order, reassures the financial \nmarkets, and puts the people ahead of politics. We have to deal with \nthese tax increases and spending cuts in a humane and tolerable way. \nThe CALM Act does all of that. Just look at what happens to people in \nneed if we go over the cliff and just do nothing. On New Year's Day the \nlowest income tax rate will jump from 10 percent back to the Clinton-\nera rate of 15 percent. That is a pretty big financial bite for people \nin West Virginia, and I know in Ohio, too, sir. These are people who \nare struggling right now.\n\n  Instead of an overnight tax hike of 5 percent, the CALM Act smoothes \nthe transition by phasing in increases over 3 years. So instead of a 5-\npercent increase, the 10-percent bracket would only go to 11.6 percent \nthe first year. The CALM Act does the same with the other tax rates, \nphasing them in over 3 years under the same proportions.\n  The CALM Act also puts the Senate on record in support of \ncomprehensive overhaul of our tax system. We can still work toward a \nbig fix like the Simpson-Bowles framework. If we can do that next year, \nwe could stop the full increase from ever occurring.\n  Another important feature of the CALM Act is the way it treats \nsequestration. Again, if we go over the cliff and do nothing, nearly \nevery government program will be hit with the same percentage cut, and \nthat includes social services, education, research, and infrastructure. \nThose are all the things we need to grow our fragile economy.\n  The CALM Act gives the Office of Management and Budget discretion and \nflexibility to recommend what programs, agencies, and accounts to cut. \nIf OMB fails to do the job, then the sequestration across-the-board \ncuts kick back in. Of course, the final word rests with Congress. OMB's \ndecision can be overridden by a joint resolution.\n  Every provision of the CALM Act is familiar to the Senate. In fact, \nat one time or another nearly every feature of this plan has been \noffered by both Republicans and Democrats, including President Obama \nand Speaker Boehner. All I have done is pull them together to offer \nthem as a compassionate alternative to what happens if we go over the \nfiscal cliff.\n  It is true that from the very beginning I have favored a \ncomprehensive solution to put our fiscal house in\n\n[[Page S8549]]\n\norder, which was something along the lines of the Bowles-Simpson plan. \nWe don't have that luxury right now. Perhaps the CALM Act will not only \nsoften the blow of the fiscal cliff, but it will also give us a sense \nof urgency about a grand bargain to repair our financial house.\n  I am not so naive as to believe everybody is going to check their \npolitics at the door, even at this late hour, but this is not a time \nfor politicking, bickering, or partisan games. To allow the country to \nplunge over the fiscal cliff without any alternative plans to soften \nthe landing is completely unacceptable. I cannot think of anything more \nirresponsible than to play games with the lives of Americans in such a \ncallous way and let this great country go over the fiscal cliff. This \nwould jeopardize the financial standing of our country and alarm our \nfinancial markets in ways that could trigger another recession.\n  Something has gone terribly wrong when the biggest threat to the \nAmerican economy is the American Congress. I repeat: Something has gone \nterribly wrong when the biggest threat to our American economy is our \nAmerican Congress.\n  It does not have to be that way. I am putting something on the table \nthat is fair and balanced. It includes a slow phase-in of the tax \nincreases that are going to happen inevitably if we go over the cliff. \nIt includes a slow phase-in of all the tax increases, it includes \ntargeted spending decreases, and it moves us closer to tax reforms. \nEverybody helps, and we do it in a way that keeps our country strong \nand prosperous.\n  This is one of those moments that the Senate was intended to live up \nto and provide leadership, find common ground, level with the American \npeople, and be honest with each other. With our debt continuing to soar \nand too many Americans still looking for jobs, these are times that \ndemand the very best of the Senate.\n  Everywhere in West Virginia--and, in fact, all over this country--\nfamilies are making tough choices about how to make ends meet. It is \ntime for Washington to do the same.\n  Here in the Senate it seems to me that we are always fighting about \nsomething. Well, that might not change anytime soon, but more often \nthan not, I believe we can rise to the common ground of great national \npurpose. I believe with all of my heart that this is one of those \ntimes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2012/12/30/senate-section/article/S8549-1", "month": "12", "year": "2012", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3445.

Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3250) to amend the DNA Analysis Backlog \n     Elimination Act of 2000 to provide for Debbie Smith grants \n     for auditing sexual assault evidence backlogs and to \n     establish a Sexual Assault Forensic Evidence Registry, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                  On Passage of S. 3250, the SAFER Act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad that the Senate today will pass \nthe SAFER Act with important amendments I requested to ensure that law \nenforcement gets the support and funding it needs to make real progress \nin processing rape kits.\n  The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Reduction Program, which was a key part \nof the bipartisan Justice for All Act that passed in 2004, has been \ninstrumental in reducing the number of untested rape kits in crime \nlaboratories around the country. However, large numbers of additional \nuntested kits have come to light in police departments, many of which \nnever make their way to crime labs at all. It is unacceptable to let \nvictims of these terrible crimes live in fear while evidence languishes \nin storage and criminals remain on our streets.\n  I have made fixing this significant problem a priority. I included \nimportant new provisions addressing backlogs of rape kits in law \nenforcement offices in my Justice for All Reauthorization Act, which \nthe Judiciary Committee reported with bipartisan support earlier this \nyear. My bill would provide law enforcement with access to funding to \nactually reduce their backlogs, along with best practices, training, \nand technical assistance they have requested to help them do so.\n  Senator Cornyn and others have attempted to address this same problem \nthrough the SAFER Act. The audit provisions included in the SAFER Act \ncan help shed light on the problem, but I believe it is crucial that \nfunding and assistance actually reach law enforcement agencies to help \nthem address their backlogs and get kits tested. That is why it is so \nimportant that the provisions from the Justice for All Reauthorization \nAct doing just that were incorporated into the SAFER Act. I thank \nSenator Cornyn for working with me and agreeing to this amendment to \nensure that this legislation will result in more kits being processed. \nI also thank Senator Grassley for helping to facilitate this agreement \nand for adding important accountability measures.\n  I want to thank Debbie Smith, the courageous survivor after whom the \ngrant program we modify today is named, and her husband Rob, for their \ncontinuing tireless work to ensure that others need not experience the \nordeal Debbie went through. Their efforts have made a real difference \nto countless victims all over the country.\n  The Justice for All Reauthorization Act includes many other \nsignificant measures to make the criminal justice system work better \nfor all Americans. I am disappointed that it will not pass this year. I \nappreciate Senator Grassley's support for the bill when it was reported \nfrom committee, and I look forward to working with him and with Senator \nCornyn and others to pass the full bill next year.\n  I am glad we take an important step to help achieve justice for \nvictims of rape and sexual assault. I hope we will go still further and \nbeyond next year.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Cornyn substitute at the \ndesk be agreed to, the bill, as amended,\n\n[[Page S8552]]\n\nbe read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements related to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
