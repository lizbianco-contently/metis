Mr. President, we have a long way to go before our economy \nis back to normal. Ask any American and they will tell you: We have a \nlot more jobs to create and fill, a lot more homes to save, and a lot \nmore consumer confidence to recover.\n  I hear every day from families in Nevada who still need us to fight \nfor them. I know every Senator hears the same from citizens in their \nState.\n  There are currently bits and pieces of good news. They are not \nenough, that is for sure. But the Dow Jones opened this morning above \n12,000. That is the highest in many years. Manufacturing is rising more \nthan expected. Consumer spending is beating forecasts also. Corporate \nprofits are higher than anyone predicted. We got a decent jobs number\n\n[[Page S500]]\n\ntoday, better than most economists predicted--not good enough but \ndecent. So it is not all bad news. But I am not satisfied hearing that \nthings are simply better than expected. Nevada, similar to every other \nState, is still hurting, and our job is not to beat expectations, it is \nto beat unemployment and beat back the deficit. We cannot assume we are \nback to normal every time we hear encouraging news. We don't have that \nluxury because it is not true. We can't let our guard down and we can't \nwaste any more time on symbolic votes.\n  The fight to repeal the patients' rights enshrined in the health \nreform law is behind us now. The arguments have been made, the votes \nhave been counted, and similar to the majority of the American people, \nthe Senate has decided the law of the land is better than the broken \nsystem it replaced.\n  I don't wish to spend a lot of time talking about health care because \nthe vote speaks for itself, but I will say this. Those who want to deny \nAmericans the right to afford a healthy life had their say in 2008, \nwhen President Obama was elected on the promise of change. They had \ntheir say in 2009, when we first passed this law. They had their say in \n2010, when we finalized it. Now they have had their say in 2011, when \nthey tried to repeal it. Each time the votes fell on the side of \npatients, patients' rights--more rights, not fewer. The Senate voted \neach time to put people, not insurance companies, in control. The \nSenate voted each time for health, not sickness. So it is time to move \non.\n  Let's talk about jobs. We are on a jobs bill right now, the Federal \nAviation Administration authorization. The Aviation Modernization Act, \nwhich is this bill, is to bring to America modern air travel, travel \ninto the 21st century. This legislation will create hundreds of \nthousands of jobs--not hundreds, not thousands but hundreds of \nthousands. That is why we are fighting so hard for this legislation. It \nis a bipartisan piece of legislation. It is not a Democratic bill. It \nis not Republican. It is a bipartisan bill. The same bill passed the \nSenate unanimously last year. So I hope we come together in the spirit \nof compromise we all promised and finish it as quickly as possible. \nThis bill alone will not eradicate unemployment, but it will help. It \nis going to move us further toward that goal, and the quicker we pass \nit the quicker 280,000 Americans will breathe easier by knowing a good, \nconsistent paycheck is on the way.\n  We are all concerned about the deficit. There is nothing more \nimportant than creating jobs, though. We can never have a healthy \neconomy when we have 15 million people out of work. We can never have a \nbalanced budget when we have 15 million people out of work.\n  The deficit is something that is very important. Jobs, as I \nindicated, will work toward solving that problem, but it is not the \nonly way to strengthen our economy. We also need to keep digging out of \nthe fiscal hole we inherited over the last decade. In the short term, \nwe can responsibly cut spending. In the long term, we can cut our \ndeficit. There are some things we have to be careful to avoid, such as \njeopardizing the full faith and credit of our great country. That is \nwhat will happen if we don't raise our Nation's debt limit. If we don't \nact, if we allow the country to default on our legal obligations, we \nwill send our economy into default for the first time in its history. \nThat will certainly not save a single job or save a single home from \nforeclosure or encourage the domestic and foreign investment we need to \ngrow. It will be just the opposite. Each of these steps is an important \nstride toward recovery. Together, they are a powerful leap forward.\n  We might be on the right track and heading in the right direction, \nbut we still have a ways to travel. Let's avoid the temptation to get \ndistracted and derailed. Let's keep driving toward that goal. If we \nwork toward putting people back to work, soon Nevada and every other \nState will not just read good news in a headline here or there, they \nwill see it before their eyes--in their workplaces and in their wallets \nand throughout our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/03/senate-section/article/S500-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this month we celebrate the 100th \nanniversary of the birth of Ronald Reagan, our Nation's 40th President. \nHe was born in a second-story apartment above a tavern in small-town \nTampico, IL, on February 6, 1911.\n  The values he learned there he would carry with him throughout a long \nand momentous life--from the radio announcer's booth, the Hollywood \nsound stage, and the union leader's negotiating table to the Governor's \nmansion, the White House and the world.\n  One hundred years after his birth, 30 years after his inauguration as \nPresident, and only 7 years after his passing, it is already widely \nacknowledged by both sides of the aisle that Ronald Reagan was a great \nman and a great President. His role in ending the Cold War, with \nAmerica victorious and the forces of Marxism-Leninism, as he so \neloquently put it, ``on the ash heap of history,'' has been assured. \nYou could almost say we are all Reaganites now.\n  But oh, how so much has changed. For when Ronald Reagan was still a \nforce actively shaping history, and not yet a part of it, he had many \nfewer friends.\n  One opinion writer in 1986 made his disdain clear when he wrote this:\n\n       It seemed to us, the carping critics, that this man was not \n     terribly bright, not terribly thoughtful or well informed, \n     not terribly honest, and in most other ways not up to the \n     most important job in the world.\n\n  But it seems a lot of people just did not understand Ronald Reagan's \nvision at the time--not just his Communist adversaries, not just his \npolitical opponents here at home, even those in his own party, and on \nhis own staff sometimes failed to see the strength of the man's \ncommitment to freedom--or his courage in seeking it.\n  I can think of one prominent example: The words that we now think of \nas Reagan's most powerful utterance as President were almost never \nspoken. On June 12, 1987, Reagan traveled to what was then West Berlin \nto make unmistakably clear his commitment to increasing freedom in \nSoviet-dominated Eastern Europe. As the draft of his prepared remarks \nwas circulated through the many byzantine layers of bureaucracy that \ncome with the modern presidency, one little phrase kept getting edited \nout.\n  Virtually the entire foreign policy apparatus of the U.S. Government \nwas opposed to what Reagan wanted to say. His Secretary of State, his \nNational Security Adviser--they told him he would embarrass his host, \nWest German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. They said he would anger and \nprovoke Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev. They warned he would arouse \nfalse hopes among the East Germans unlucky enough to live on the wrong \nside of the Berlin Wall.\n  It finally got to the point where Reagan had to have a confrontation \nwith his own deputy chief of staff. ``I'm the president, right?'' he is \nreported to have asked. ``So I get to decide whether the line about \ntearing down the wall stays in?'' When assured that he was, and he did, \nReagan said, ``Then it stays in.''\n  Only after pulling rank on his own staff this way did Reagan finally \naddress the crowd of 20,000 gathered at the Brandenburg Gate and issue \nhis famous declaration, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.''\n  Two years later, Germans East and West did exactly that, presaging \nGerman unification and the fall of the Soviet Union. A piece of the \nBerlin Wall is preserved today at the Ronald Reagan Presidential \nLibrary in Simi Valley, CA, to remind us of the power one man's words \ncan have.\n  Ronald Reagan once said, ``We don't have to turn to our history books \nfor heroes; they are all around us.'' That is true even if you don't \nknow where to look. Thirty years ago some dismissed Reagan as a man of \nno great importance. With hindsight it is much easier to see him for \nthe giant figure in history that he was.\n  And while we are thankful that, for most of us, Ronald Reagan's \nvision and accomplishments are still within living memory, his life, \nhis vision of a freer America and a free world, and his accomplishments \nto achieve that are most assuredly in the history books.\n\n[[Page S501]]\n\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are continuing this morning on this \nimportant FAA bill, which is a very important jobs bill for America. I \nknow my colleagues have been down on the Senate floor--the chairman of \nthe full committee, Senator Rockefeller, and the ranking member, \nSenator Hutchison--and they have been doing a good job of explaining \nwhy it is so important to move ahead on something that can create \nhundreds of thousands of jobs both in construction at our airports \nacross America and on the implementation of the NextGen system, which \nis really about making a digital conversion to air transportation so \nour flights can be safer, so they can be more fuel efficient, and so \nthere can be coordination on the ground with the flights and all of our \ntransportation systems.\n  So this morning we want to keep moving through this process to get \nthis legislation done so we can get it implemented and start creating \njobs and improving our air transportation safety.\n  I think there are amendments to be offered under the agreement.

Mr. President, this amendment deals with the notion of \ncollective bargaining by TSA employees. The Transportation Security \nAdministration was formed approximately 10 years ago by the Aviation \nand Transportation Security Act of 2001, Public Law 107-71. Since that \ntime, Transportation Security Administration employees have fared very \nwell. They are a familiar sight in our airports. They are familiar to \nany of us who fly and who frequent the airports of the United States. \nIt is a good job, and they are well taken care of.\n  During that 10-year period, TSA employees have not been allowed to \ncollectively bargain. There is a reason for that. First of all, under \nthat act which I referenced, as a compromise back in that day, the \nUnder Secretary of Transportation for Security, who is now the TSA \nAdministrator, was given the ability to fix the compensation and terms \nthereof, and included in that was the determination about whether \ncollective bargaining rights would be afforded to these TSA employees.\n  In a 2003 memo, the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security at \nthat time prohibited TSA security screeners from unionizing with \ncollective bargaining rights. The Under Secretary wrote:\n\n       I hereby determine that individuals carrying out the \n     security screening function under section 44901 of Title 49, \n     United States Code, in light of their critical national \n     security responsibilities, shall not, as a term or condition \n     of their employment, be entitled to engage in collective \n     bargaining or be represented for the purpose of engaging in \n     such bargaining by any representative or organization.\n\n  The determination was made by the predecessor of the TSA \nAdministrator that in light of their critical national security \nresponsibilities, it was not appropriate for collective bargaining \nrights to be included.\n  Now we have every reason to believe that under this new \nadministration, that decision is about to be reversed. A decade of \nexperience and practice will be ended unless this Congress acts, and \nthe appropriate vehicle on which to act is this reauthorization bill \nbefore us. Wicker amendment No. 14 would simply exclude TSA personnel \nfrom forming a union with collective bargaining rights. I point out to \nmy colleagues that the FBI and the CIA and the Secret Service, which \nall have similar critical national security responsibilities, do not \nhave collective bargaining rights either. So the spirit of amendment \nNo. 14 would be to continue TSA employees in that same vein.\n  TSA workers have fared well indeed during the past decade. It is a \ngood job. I enjoy seeing them, I enjoy working with them, and we are \nglad to have them. But for good reason, they have been excluded from \ncollective bargaining rights.\n  The TSA and TSA leadership need the flexibility to innovate and to \nmove quickly during times of national emergency on issues involving the \nsecurity\n\n[[Page S502]]\n\nof the traveling public, and for that reason I submit that adding the \nburdensome responsibility of union demands and dealing with collective \nbargaining demands could limit the ability of those responsible for the \nvery important function of security at some of the most high-risk \ntargets and make it harder for our security personnel to do their job.\n  So I will be urging my colleagues during this day--we will be urging \nthe American people to contact their Senators and to let their voices \nbe heard. TSA has worked well in this regard, and we do not need to \nburden it with extra responsibilities when they need to be \nconcentrating on security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Protests In Egypt\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, over the last week, I have watched the \naffairs in Tahrir Square in Cairo, as millions of Americans have, and I \nwas deeply impressed by the peaceful demonstration of Egyptian citizens \ncalling for change in their nation--change that would respond to the \neconomic plight of ordinary citizens, change that would give ordinary \ncitizens the opportunity to be a part of the voice directing the course \nof their nation.\n  Until yesterday, those protests were absolutely peaceful. But that \ndid change yesterday when pro-Mubarak forces entered the fray. Last \nnight, I was watching as Molotov cocktails were being thrown by pro-\nMubarak forces down from adjacent buildings onto the protesters below. \nI watched as organized thugs proceeded to stone those protesters. I \nwatched as there was sporadic gunfire in the square. I watched as a \ngroup of horsemen galloped through the crowd whipping people with their \nwhips.\n  This thuggery against citizens who were peacefully protesting is \nabsolutely unacceptable. The United States has had a long and close \nrelationship with Egypt. We channel a tremendous amount of economic \ndevelopment aid to Egypt. But let me be very clear. What happened \nyesterday cannot happen again. What happened yesterday, with thugs \nattacking peaceful demonstrators on behalf of the government must not \nhappen again.\n  In no way can America turn a blind eye to this ruthless assault on \nordinary citizens. This morning, there were voices from within the \nEgyptian Government calling what happened yesterday a fatal error. \nPrime Minister Shafik called it a fatal error. This morning, there were \nsigns that the army, instead of allowing and organizing thugs and \nallowing them on the square to assault the demonstrators, was standing \nin to protect them. This is a right turn of events.\n  Let it be noted by all who would care to listen that the citizens of \nthe United States of America are not going to stand by and support a \ngovernment that is attacking peaceful demonstrators in a square in \nCairo. If we see a repeat of this violence, America must send a very \nstrong message that there will be no further aid to the Mubarak \ngovernment.\n  We do not know what the ultimate outcome of these protests will be, \nbut peaceful action against government is a hallmark of democracy, a \nhallmark of freedom. We should ensure that those protests could \ncontinue--those peaceful protests--calling for a voice for ordinary \ncitizens, and that Egypt can move toward free and fair elections.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 5\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set \naside the pending amendment so I can call up my amendment, No. 5, which \nis at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Blunt] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 5.\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security \n   to approve applications from airports to authorize passenger and \n property screening to be carried out by a qualified private screening \n                                company)\n\n       On page 311, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 733. APPROVAL OF APPLICATIONS FOR THE SECURITY SCREENING \n                   OPT-OUT PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 44920(b) of title 49, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``The Under Secretary may approve any \n     application submitted under subsection (a).'' and inserting \n     ``Not later than 30 days after receiving an application \n     submitted under subsection (a), the Under Secretary shall \n     approve the application.''\n\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, this is an amendment that deals with an \nissue going back to the beginning of the TSA screening program, almost \n10 years ago now, at the end of 2001. We had significant discussion \nbetween the House and the Senate about how that program would run. In \nfact, the House, which I was a Member of at the time and the occupant \nof the chair was a Member of at the time, passed a bill which said the \nscreening would continue to be competitive and private and determined \nby local airports. The Senate's view at the time was this was a new \nresponsibility that would be taken over everywhere by the Federal \nGovernment and the TSA.\n  The final determination was that, while the Federal Government would \ntake this responsibility, there would be allowed to be pilot airports \nthat would be determined and be monitored to determine whether a pilot \nproject would verify that another alternative would be a competitive, \nprivate screening as one of the options available to airports. In fact, \nin 2004, the screening partnership program was created.\n  The pilots had worked. The verification was that the private \nscreeners were performing at a level that was equal to that of the \ngovernment-paid screeners, that the cost was comparable, and that \nairports in the future would be able to apply to go from the \ngovernment-run program to a competitive program, and about 16 airports \nhave done that. I think the biggest one is probably the San Francisco \nairport. The Kansas City airport, which I use and that I represent, may \nbe the second biggest of those. Rochester, NY, is also in this program, \nas are a number of smaller airports.\n  In fact, as recently as a few months ago, the TSA was still telling \nairports and recommended to four airports in Montana--a State where \nseven of their airports are currently in this program--the TSA \nrecommended to four more airports in Montana that they look at this \nprogram as a potential better alternative for them. Only in recent \nweeks did TSA determine in responses to the Springfield, MO airport, \nthe four Montana airports, and perhaps as many as a handful of other \nairports that, no, we think that program is big enough. This is an \noption that is no longer available to local airport boards.\n  This amendment would reach the conclusion that the local airport \nboard is still an important determiner of which system works best in an \nairport. Essentially, this amendment would tell the TSA that if local \nairports apply, the TSA would allow them to become part of the \nscreening partnership program and treat them as they are treating the \n16 airports that have been in that program--some for as long as a \ndecade now, since the beginning of screening as we see it in airports \ntoday.\n  I hope we get to where we actually give authority back, or maintain \nauthority at the local airport level to determine which system works \nbetter for them. A competitive system allows flexibility, and \nflexibility allows more adaptability, more innovation and, frankly, I \nthink, encourages the government-run systems to be more competitive and \nresponsive.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment. I hope it becomes part of \nthis bill, and I look forward to working with the committee on this \namendment and over the next few days as we\n\n[[Page S503]]\n\ncontinue to debate FAA. This has a real impact on a number of the \nauthorities that are under the Federal Aviation Administration. I think \nthis is an important time to solve this problem. It is one that was \ncreated, in my view, totally by TSA deciding on their own something \nthat the law never envisioned. I was part of that debate a decade ago. \nI know what the intention was, and it was not the intention of the \npilot program, or of the determination we made at the end of 2001, that \nTSA would determine for local airport authorities what was best for \ntheir airport.\n  This amendment would require the TSA to work with local airports and \nimplement their desire to change from the system they have at the \ntime--totally run by TSA--to a system under the screening partnership \nprogram. That is the essence of this amendment, and I urge its adoption \nand inclusion in this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            AMENDMENT NO. 8\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator \nWhitehouse, Senator Boxer and a growing list of my colleagues in \nsupport of the Whitehouse-Kirk-Boxer amendment that will improve \nairline safety throughout the Nation.\n  Most individuals are familiar with laser pointers that are often used \nin presentations. What you may not know is the growing danger these \ndevices pose to pilots.\n  Last month, the FAA released nationwide data on lasers pointed at \naircraft. From 2009 to 2010, incidents nearly doubled from 1,527, to \n2,836. To show how quickly this has become a problem, when the FAA \nfirst began to track this problem in 2005, incidents were under 300.\n  Transportation Secretary LaHood has acknowledged this is a serious \nsafety issue. Lasers can temporarily blind pilots, which is incredibly \ndangerous, but even more so during the critical time of takeoff and \nlanding. Advancements in laser technology also are making the problem \nworse. Certain color variations, such as green lasers, are 35 times \nbrighter than comparable red lasers.\n  This is a particular worry for me and for my State's busiest \nairport--O'Hare. According to the FAA, last year O'Hare had the second-\nhighest number of laser events in the Nation at 98.\n  The Whitehouse-Kirk-Boxer amendment creates new penalties for \nknowingly pointing a laser pointer at an aircraft, or at the flight \npath of an airplane. Commonsense exemptions are provided to allow \nfurther research and testing activities.\n  Current law has not kept up to date with this new threat. It is time \nwe give law enforcement and prosecutors additional tools to reduce the \nlikelihood of a tragedy.\n  The amendment is supported by the Air Line Pilots Association and the \nNational Association of Police Organizations which includes the Federal \nFlight Deck Officers Association.\n  I thank Senator Whitehouse and his staff for their leadership on this \nissue, and I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan proposal to \nhelp make our Nation's pilots, and especially their passengers, safer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, we are sitting here, and what is good \nis we are not doing health care amendments. What is bad is we are not \ndoing any amendments.\n  The Republicans have proffered a number of amendments. We need to do \nthem by pairs so we can work them out. Some of them will be able to be \naccepted by voice vote. I expect that Senator Whitehouse's on laser use \ninto pilots' eyes will probably be accepted by voice vote. But he may \nwant a vote. If I were he, I would want a vote because it is so \nimportant to emphasize the issue.\n  But we need to have Democrats--I know we have some amendments that \nDemocrats want to offer. But they are not coming to the floor to offer \nthose amendments. So this is my plea, through the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, for Democrats please to come to the floor and do \ntheir amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, let me say that the manager has been very \nkind to me in offering to allow me to come up at some point. I do not \ncare so much when it is, but I do have two amendments I have already \ndiscussed on the floor. I would like to get them in the queue so at \nsome time we will be able to do that. So I would wait until such time \nas the majority feels it would be appropriate, and then I would be \nasking them if I can do that.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from \nOklahoma has a particularly difficult scheduling problem right now and \nfor most of the afternoon. So putting his amendments in and talking \nabout them, whatever he wishes to do, is important to him and also is \nhard to do in terms of the schedule. So that renews my offer, my \nrequest, my prayer, that Democrats who have amendments will come down \nand offer them.\n  It is called the Federal aviation bill. It reauthorizes it. It is \nmonumental, and we are kind of sitting here. So the Republicans are \nsort of doing their part, but the Democrats are not doing our part. So \nplease come down, if you have amendments, because I wish to accommodate \nnot just Senator Inhofe but all others who have amendments, many of \nwhich we can probably work out.\n  Some will be accepted by voice, others may have to be voted on. But \nwe have to have amendments before we can get to any of that. So that is \nmy request.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reclaiming my time. First of all, I thank \nyou very much. The one set of amendments I have, I would hope to get \ninto the managers' amendment or somehow have them come up and even be \nvoice voted. But they are issues I have talked about in the past quite \noften. I think we all understand--or most of us do--that when our good \nfriend Senator Glenn retired, that left me as the last active \ncommercial pilot, on a regular basis, in the Senate. So I have these \ntwo amendments I am very interested in. I will yield the floor. When \nsuch time comes--what the Senator from West Virginia said is true. \nRight now, because of the Prayer Breakfast that is taking place, I \nhappen to be hosting the African dinner tonight, so I have groups \ncoming by every 30 minutes throughout the day.\n  At some time today, I wish to be able to get two amendments, Nos. 6 \nand 7, in the queue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                         Remembering Don Tyson\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I come to the floor to honor a great man, a \ngreat Arkansan and a great American, Donald John Tyson.\n  Don Tyson was one of the three iconic Arkansans who helped move our \nState forward. Don Tyson, Sam Walton, and J.B. Hunt transformed the \nnorthwest part of our State and made Arkansas a mecca for business.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S503, February 3, 2011, the Record reads: . . . Sam \nWalton, and J. R. Hunt . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . Sam Walton, \nand J. B. Hunt . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  When I think of Don, one of his favorite phrases comes to mind. He \nwould say: ``I don't have time to have a bad time.'' Don lived life to \nthe fullest and enjoyed every minute of it. Don came to Arkansas in \nvery humble circumstances. He was born in Kansas but moved to \nSpringdale as an infant when, as Don liked to tell it, his father's \ntruck ran out of gas.\n  There in Springdale, Don took over the family business when his \nfather passed away. Don's hard work helped\n\n[[Page S504]]\n\nturn his father's small poultry business into the most successful meat \nprocessor in the world. As chairman of the board and CEO of Tyson \nFoods, Don revolutionized the poultry industry and made protein more \naccessible to Americans, helping create Chicken McNuggets, chicken \ntenders, chicken sandwiches, and much more.\n  He was responsible for developing the Rock Cornish game hen, smaller \nbirds that weigh only a few pounds that were more profitable but also \nimmensely popular. Under Don's leadership, the company's revenue \nincreased from $51 million to more than $10 billion.\n  As the Washington Post said: ``For many Americans, Tyson products \nbecame the answer to a daily question: What's for dinner?''\n  Even as he rose to great heights, Don remained true to his roots--his \ntrademark khaki Tyson uniform with ``Don'' embroidered on the front \npocket. He referred to all staff members as coworkers, never employees. \nDon understood that the truck drivers and plant workers were as \nessential to Tyson's success as the executives in the corner offices.\n  Don was also committed to giving back to his community. A noted \nphilanthropist, Don created the Tyson Family Foundation, which provides \nscholarships for students from communities where Tyson Foods operates, \nincluding many communities in Arkansas.\n  Don was a huge supporter of the University of Arkansas, helping fund \nmany of the school's educational and athletic programs. He also was a \ngreat friend to veterans. One of his most recent projects was helping \npreserve the Fayetteville National Cemetery. An avid fisherman and \ndevoted conservationist, Don created the Billfish Foundation, which \npromotes catch-and-release practices for billfish to conserve their \npopulations. Don's charitable work had a real impact on Arkansas and \ncommunities across the country.\n  Finally, Don understood the importance of family. Tyson Foods has \nalways been and remains a family-run business, starting with Don's \nfather John Tyson and continuing with his son John. Don's emphasis on \nfamily, from his father-son collaborations to the way he treated all \nhis coworkers as extended family, is what made Tyson Foods great.\n  In looking back on Don Tyson's life, I see a man who loved his \nbusiness, who loved his community, who loved his family, and who lived \nlife. Today, I join all Arkansans in celebrating a life well lived.\n  Don, you will be missed.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  One of the things that is interesting about northwest Arkansas is \nthat you were just talking about Don Tyson. You could just as well have \nbeen talking about Sam Walton, Hunt, and many others.\n  I do not know what it is about northwest Arkansas, that these great \nentrepreneurs who changed the world seem to all come from that area, as \nthe Senator from Arkansas knows. I am very familiar with that area, \nsince my daughter Molly is a professor at the University of Arkansas.\n  I have been over there many times. I was just listening to you \ndescribe the life of Don Tyson and how consistent that is with many of \nthe other entrepreneurs. I salute all those guys up there and you for \nbringing that to the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Sunday is the 100th anniversary of the birth of President \nRonald Reagan.\n  When Ronald Reagan was born, his father Jack looked at his new son \nand exclaimed, ``He looks like a fat little Dutchman but who knows, he \nmight grow up to be President some day.''\n  In fact, Ronald Reagan grew up to become not just a President but one \nof America's most memorable Presidents.\n  As we mark the 100th anniversary of his birth, much is being said and \nwritten about Ronald Reagan's White House years, and understandably so. \nBut in my State of Illinois, people are also remembering an earlier \ntime in the life of this iconic American.\n  Ronald Wilson Reagan is the only American President born in Illinois.\n  He entered this world on Feb. 6, 1911, in the little town of Tampico, \nIL, in an apartment above a bakery on Main Street.\n  His father Jack sold shoes to support his wife and two sons.\n  Over the first 9 years of his life, the Reagan family moved four \ntimes, from Tampico to Galesburg, to Monmouth, and the south side of \nChicago before finally settling in Dixon, IL, population 10,000.\n  Today, the white frame house at 810 South Hennepin Street in Dixon, \nthe Ronald Reagan Boyhood Home, draws visitors from around the world.\n  It was in Dixon that the shy boy would begin to discover self-\nconfidence and the talents that would serve him so well in life. He \nacted in his first play in Dixon, and he was elected student body \npresident during his senior year at Dixon High School.\n  From Dixon, Ronald Reagan went to Eureka College, a small college \nnear Peoria. The tuition was $180 a year, twice that much with room and \nboard, more than the Reagan family could afford. But Ronald Reagan did \nnot let that discourage him. He received a ``needy student \nscholarship'' and waited tables and washed dishes at his fraternity \nhouse to help pay his way.\n  Once again, he was elected president of his senior class.\n  1935, Ronald Reagan was working as a radio sports announcer. He \nfollowed the Chicago Cubs to spring training in California and slipped \naway one day to visit Hollywood and explore whether there might be a \nfuture for him in movies.\n  Two years later, Ronald Reagan packed his possessions into a Nash \nconvertible and moved to California, where he would become a successful \nactor and later Governor. But he never forgot his Illinois roots.\n  In his first inaugural parade in 1981, Ronald Reagan included the \nDixon High School band.\n  On a visit to Eureka College in 1992, President Reagan told students, \n``Everything good that happened to me, everything, started here on this \ncampus.''\n  In 1990, 2 years after he left the White House, President Reagan \ntravelled to Abilene, KS, for a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary \nof President Eisenhower's birth.\n  He said that day:\n\n       I learned long ago that in order to find the heart of \n     America you need only vosit the heartland of America.\n\n  It was a lesson he had learned years earlier in those small towns in \nIllinois.\n  Both the State of Illinois and the town of Dixon have created Ronald \nReagan Centennial Commissions to celebrate the 100th anniversary of his \nbirth. If you want to see the places that helped shape America's 40th \nPresident, come to Illinois this year, where it all began.\n  Ronald Reagan was President when I was first elected to the House of \nRepresentatives in 1982. While our views of government differed \nremarkably, I admired his optimism and his unshakable faith that \nAmerica's best days were ahead of us. He restored a sense of confidence \nin many Americans at a time when we really needed it.\n  He told us:\n\n       America is too great to dream small dreams.\n\n  And he was right.\n  In 1992, 2 years before he announced he had Alzheimer's disease, \nRonald Reagan addressed his party's nominating convention for the last \ntime.\n  He said then:\n\n       Whatever else history may say about me when I'm gone, I \n     hope it will recall that I appealed to your best hopes, not \n     your worst fears, to your confidence rather than your doubts.\n\n  In 1983, in one of the most important accomplishments of his \nPresidency, Ronald Reagan brought together Democrats and Republicans to \nhead off a funding crisis in Social Security. That bipartisan agreement \nhelped add years of solvency to one of the most successful programs \nthis government has ever created. It brought 50 years of solvency to \nSocial Security and is one of the crowning jewels of his leadership.\n  In 1986, he signed America's last major tax reform act to simplify \nthe Income Tax Code, broaden the tax base and eliminate loopholes that \nallowed some to avoid their obligations while unfairly increasing the \ntax burden on others.\n\n[[Page S505]]\n\n  Today we face a far greater challenge. Not only do we have to protect \nSocial Security for the long run, we also have to simplify our Tax Code \nagain, and put in place a responsible plan to reduce our deficits even \nas we invest in a stronger economic future.\n  In this centennial year of his birth, it would be a fitting tribute \nto President Reagan if Democrats and Republicans could work together to \nsolve our challenges in the same spirit of patriotic pragmatism that \nPresident Reagan and others brought to protecting Social Security a \ngeneration ago. I hope we can work together to help get Americans back \nto work today and to lay the foundation for a strong economic future so \nthat our children can continue to say, as President Reagan said so \noften, that America's best days are still ahead.\n  After Ronald Reagan clinched the delegates needed to win his party's \n1980 Presidential nomination, a newspaper reporter asked him what he \nthought he needed to do next. He replied that he wanted to dispel the \nnotion that he was a hard-nosed radical who would oppose compromise on \nprinciple.\n  These are his words. He said:\n\n       You know, there are some people so imbued with their \n     ideology that if they can't get everything they want, they'll \n     jump off the cliff with the flag flying. As Governor, I found \n     out that if I could get half a loaf, instead of stalking off \n     angrily, I'd take it.\n\n  Ronald Reagan was a man who believed deeply in his core principles. \nHe would not want any of us to compromise our own core principles in \nhis memory.\n  But there is such a thing as principled compromise. President Reagan \nunderstood that. He knew that accommodation was needed to make the \nsystem work. We would honor his memory by remembering that lesson and \nworking to restore to our politics the same civility that we associate \nwith him. Let's remember that there is no dishonor in accepting half a \nloaf. That is how democracy works.\n  Finally, I wish to express my admiration for Mrs. Reagan. Her love \nand steadfast devotion to her husband during his illness moved us all, \nand her courageous work in support of new treatments for Alzheimer's \ndisease will surely help other families. Our thoughts are with her and \nthe rest of President Reagan's family as we mark this historic \ncentennial.\n  (Mrs. HAGAN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the FAA authorization expired in October \nof 2007. For more than 3 years we have been operating on short-term \nextensions--17 total short-term extensions. The Federal Aviation \nAdministration, airlines, and the flying public, all deserve a long-\nterm authorization to provide certainty to our national aviation \nsystem. The bill before us will improve the safety of air travel, \nmodernize our air traffic control system, boost the economy, and create \nthousands of jobs. This is a jobs bill.\n  The FAA estimates commercial aviation is responsible for over 5 \npercent of our gross domestic product and generates $1.2 trillion a \nyear in economic activity. The aviation industry provides $346 billion \nin earnings and 11 million jobs. This bill will help grow those \nnumbers. The funding provided in this bill will support over 280,000 \njobs.\n  Economist Mark Zandi said:\n\n       Aviation is the glue that keeps the global economy \n     together.\n\n  We know that in Illinois. We know it because of that great airport \ncalled O'Hare, which we are currently in the process of modernizing. \nThis bill will boost our economy now and keep the United States \ncompetitive in the global marketplace. The Senate Commerce Committee, \nchaired by Senator Rockefeller, with ranking member Senator Inhofe, has \nheld dozens of hearings over the past few years on aviation. Each was \ndifferent. All of them focused on safety. Last year we passed into law \nmany safety provisions the committee recommended, but we need to do \nmore.\n  This bill will improve safety by preventing runway incursions. \nImproving runway safety, according to the NTSB, is the highest \npriority. There were 988 runway incursions last year. This year there \nhave already been 66. This bill will require the FAA to review all \ncommercial service airports in the United States and initiate action to \nimprove lighting, signage, and runway and taxiway markings.\n  Another key component of this bill is NextGen. NextGen is the term we \nuse to describe our transition to a more modern satellite-based air \ntraffic control system. I mentioned on the Senate floor before that I \nrecently read a book by Steve Johnson about innovation. He told a \nfascinating story that on October 4, 1957, when the Soviets launched \nsputnik, America was caught by surprise. Here our adversaries in the \nCold War had the capacity, with a missile, to launch a satellite that \ncircled the Earth. It was the first manmade satellite. We knew they had \nthe bomb. Now they had these missiles and the capacity to launch a \nsatellite.\n  The Russians, to prove to the world they had launched the satellite, \nhad this basketball-sized sputnik satellite emitting a signal. There \nwere two scientists near Baltimore working for the Federal Government \nwho decided they would try to track this signal. They found it. As they \ntracked it, they used their scientific expertise and the Doppler effect \nto determine not only the trajectory of this satellite but its speed. \nThey reported their findings to the Department of Defense. They could \ntell the Department of Defense where sputnik was and how fast it was \nmoving.\n  The Department of Defense challenged them and said: If you can tell \nus where that satellite is and how fast it is moving, could you tell \nwhere that signal is being received on Earth? They went to work. It \ntook them several weeks. They came up with the means to determine from \na satellite where the signal was being received on Earth. We know it as \nGPS.\n  GPS is in our pockets. We carry it with our cell phones. People can \nlocate us based on the cell phone we carry in our pockets. The problem \nis, airplanes don't have GPS. They still rely on aging technology, \nradar and the like, to locate the planes and to move them safely. This \nbill is going to move us into this new generation of technology. It is \nabout time.\n  NextGen will give pilots and air traffic controllers the ability to \naccurately pinpoint aircraft in the sky, to avoid problems, to move \nthings more smoothly, safely, and efficiently. The FAA has called for \naction on implementing NextGen.\n  Last year U.S. airlines carried 704 million passengers, including a \nlot of Senators and Congressmen. Soon those numbers will increase. The \nFAA reports that U.S. airlines will carry more than 1 billion \npassengers by 2023 and more than 1.2 billion by 2030. Our outdated air \ntraffic control system cannot handle this increase in traffic. But with \nNextGen we hope to triple the capacity of our national aviation system \nand not compromise at all when it comes to safety. This technology will \nallow planes to fly the straightest, quickest route from point A to \npoint B. With more precise information and better communication, we can \nfit more planes safely in our airspace. Doing so will save airlines \nfuel and money. It will reduce airport delays significantly.\n  Chicago's Midway Airport was ranked dead last over the past few \nmonths for ontime departures. Chicago's O'Hare has won that dubious \ndistinction more than once. The main reason is the lack of capacity in \nour aviation control system. Fully implementing NextGen could reduce \nthese delays dramatically. It will also save a lot of fuel and money \nfor the airlines. This is a great investment.\n  Illinois is in the middle of the largest airport expansion project in \nAmerican history at O'Hare. The $6.6 billion project will completely \nreconfigure the runways and make sure traffic moves in and out of \nO'Hare more efficiently. Moving this project along means a lot to the \npeople of Chicago and Illinois. O'Hare already generates 450,000 jobs \nand $38 billion in economic activity for Chicago and my State. This \nmodernization project will create 195,000 more jobs and another $18 \nbillion in annual economic activity. We need to move forward as a \nnation, with the FAA, to make certain O'Hare is modern and safe and can \naccommodate the increased capacity in air service.\n  I hope we can take up this bill and the amendments that have been \noffered to it in a timely fashion and pass the legislation soon. This \nbill will help airports the size of O'Hare, but also smaller airports \naround the United States. It has already helped us in many ways.\n\n[[Page S506]]\n\n  The Essential Air Service Program has been critical for a lot of \nsmall airports, and certainly that is true in Illinois. We need to make \nsure that communities large and small across America have access to \npassenger air service.\n  There is a provision in this bill that tries to coordinate some of \nthe bookings between Amtrak and airlines. During floor consideration of \nthis bill in the previous Congress, my amendment was adopted that I \nhope can help travelers better coordinate and use both passenger rail \nand air travel. Particularly for travel to and from less urbanized \nareas, this option will help move people more efficiently. We can do \noffer this in more communities. And we can do so at less expense to the \nFederal Government.\n  I thank both Senator Inhofe and Senator Rockefeller for their \nleadership on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me say that most everything the \nSenator from Illinois has talked about I agree with. We have been \ntalking about this bill for a long time.\n  I join Senator Rockefeller in encouraging anyone, Democrats \nparticularly, to bring any amendment down they want. Procedurally, I \ndon't think I can get my two amendments in the queue until that \nhappens.\n  For the moment, I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, the Senator from Illinois was talking \nabout our friend, our beloved Ronald Reagan. I thought I would make a \ncouple of comments that might surprise a few people.\n  I was not from Oklahoma originally. I was actually born in Iowa. When \nI was a very small child, Ronald Reagan was the sports announcer for \nWHO radio.\n  My father was a claims adjuster. They officed in the same room--not \nthe same building but the same room. They played the pinball machine \ntogether. I can remember at that time they never said Ronald Reagan; \nthey said Dutch Reagan. That was his name. That was his name as a \nsports announcer too. He would actually come by and we referred to him \nas Uncle Dutch. That was in Des Moines. That was back during the \nDepression and shortly after.\n  When my family moved to Oklahoma, we didn't have a lot of money. So \nwe never went to movies. At that time they didn't have TV. The only \ntime we would ever see a movie is if Dutch Reagan had a movie. I went \ndown once to Atoka, OK, which was probably roundtrip driving about 4 \nhours. We went down to see a Dutch Reagan movie.\n  Later on, I became the mayor of Tulsa. During that time Reagan was in \nhis first term. He had me do all of his domestic work. I was debating \nDemocratic mayors from all over the country on the policies that Ronald \nReagan had initiated and tried to perpetuate, and they were all very \nsuccessful, I might add. Now, in retrospect, a lot of people on the \nother side of the fence realize they were.\n  Saying this was a personal relationship, I look beyond what everyone \nknows about Ronald Reagan, what his persona was, and I can say he was \nsuch a warm and personable person. It never occurred to me--I thought \nof him as one of the family until the time he started running for \npolitical office.\n  It is kind of interesting because his first election, of course, was \nrunning for office out in California. At that time, we still did not \nhave a lot of money, but my father--I think that was the first race he \ngot involved with financially, and Ronald Reagan never forgot it. I can \nremember when I came to Congress he was in his second term, and he \nwould always comment: There is young Congressman Inhofe. His daddy was \none of my first financial contributors.\n  So anyway, I will just say this: When you lose somebody like him, you \ndo not just lose a leader that in retrospect looks good to everyone, \nbut you lose someone who is very warm and loving. Here is a guy who, in \nthe Oval Office, would never ever walk in without a coat and tie on. \nThis is the way he distinguished the office, and this is the way the \noffice distinguished him.\n  So we dearly miss him on this, his 100th birthday anniversary.\n  Madam President, let me make one comment about the two amendments I \nhave on the bill. I think it is important we address both of them, but \none of them is, in particular, very significant. We have a subpart S \nversion of the FARs that affects scheduled and nonscheduled airlines. A \nscheduled airline can live with the flight crew rest and duty time \nbecause they can adjust their schedules to do that. The unscheduled \ncannot. So the subpart S in the FARs today allows a subpart S to work \nlonger hours, but they also have longer rest hours in between. They \naverage out actually with longer rest hours per active hours than under \nthe law that affects the scheduled airlines.\n  Let me give you a couple examples why it is important. Ninety-five \npercent of our troop movement over in theater, where the Presiding \nOfficer and I just came back from, after having spent New Year's Eve \nwith our troops over in Kabul and Afghanistan--during that time, there \nwere several times when they had to bring blood in.\n  If a nonscheduled airline has to bring the blood in, they cannot do \nit because that is too far. They would have to leave the plane there \nand have crew rest in Kabul and come back. Well, they cannot do that \nbecause we have rules against it.\n  Ninety-five percent of the troop activity, movement, comes from \nnonscheduled airlines. Forty percent of the material comes in and out. \nThat is what we are talking about. We are talking about getting blood \nover to our troops in the AOR.\n  So it has worked well. There has not been, in 15 years, one case \nwhere an accident on a nonscheduled airline has taken place due to the \nfatigue of anyone. So it is a problem that does not exist, and I have \nalways had this hangup about fixing things that are not broken. So, \nconsequently, I am hoping we will be able to keep that.\n  What is happening today is there is a comment period and a rule that \nwould do away with that subpart S, and I would like to have this \namendment in here. It would keep that from happening. So I think it is \nvery important, and I think it means a lot to our troops over there. \nThe only alternative--if you take the blood example--is, you would have \nto find, from maybe Qatar or some other place, a military plane, a C-\n130 or a C-17, to take them in. As you know, right now the OPTEMPO of \nour lift capacity is to the point we cannot take on anything more. So I \nthink this is a life-and-death type of thing.\n  The other amendment I feel strongly about--I mentioned a minute ago \nwhen Senator Glenn retired, that left me as the last active commercial \npilot in the Senate and I still am and have been flying for 50 years. \nMany times in the past I have, at my own expense and in my own \naircraft, done things where we are helping out people because there is \nno one else to do it, either taking people for medical treatment or \ntaking, in one case, a limb that had been amputated back to be \nreattached, this type of thing.\n  So for people to do it--the pilots and the equipment, such as my \nequipment--it costs us money to do it. But we feel, in order to \nencourage them to do it, they should be exempt from liability should \nsomething happen so they do not have frivolous lawsuits. If you do, \nthen it discourages people from being generous. So this is kind of a \nGood Samaritan type of amendment.\n  These are amendments Nos. 7 and 6. I am hoping to get them in the \nqueue. I cannot do that at this time. I want to cooperate with Senator \nRockefeller, but as soon as we can, I want to get these in.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am waiting just momentarily to receive the \ndocumentation on offering an amendment. But in the meantime, I would \nlike to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S507]]\n\n                                 Egypt\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, it is very apparent that \nPresident Mubarak must step down. The longer he waits to realize he has \nto step down, the more difficult it is going to be in order to have an \norderly transition and to keep the peace in Egypt. The longer he waits \nto announce he is stepping down immediately, the more difficult it is \nto transfer power to his Vice President, General Omar Suleiman.\n  If he had done this several days ago, then that transition would have \nbeen so much easier because General Suleiman is well respected in \nEgypt, certainly by the military. He is well respected by the Arab \nneighbors in the region, and he is well respected in Israel, as well as \nthe United States.\n  But every day there is violence and bloodshed in these clashes, it \nmakes the Arab street much more difficult to accept any semblance of \nauthority that would come from Mubarak, even though, under the Egyptian \nConstitution, there is a Vice President, albeit that Vice Presidency \nhas been vacant for years and years and years. But, nevertheless, there \nis a Vice President who is in the constitutional line of succession to \nbecome President.\n  Again, I say what I said several days ago: President Mubarak needs to \nrecognize, despite his long years of great service in keeping Egypt \nstable, especially in the aftermath of the assassination of President \nAnwar Sadat, that it is time for him to step down, that there is a new \nnation of Egypt out there and they want reform and they want free and \nfair elections and most of them want a peaceful and orderly transition \nof power.\n  I would again call on the President of Egypt to step down and step \ndown immediately and let the Presidency be assumed by his Vice \nPresident, with the guarantee of free and fair elections in September \nand the guarantee that President Mubarak is not going to run for \nreelection.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 34\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending amendment be set aside in order to call up amendment No. \n34.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Nelson] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 34.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                    (Purpose: To strike section 605)\n\n       Beginning with line 1 on page 236, strike through line 14 \n     on page 237.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, the NASA bill we passed last \nfall strongly reaffirmed that aeronautics research is an integral part \nof the agency and made the point in that bill of increasing a focus on \nNASA's aeronautics research programs. As a matter of fact, what does \nNASA stand for? It has become a noun, but it actually stands for the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration. The first A in NASA \nstands for ``aeronautics.'' It is vital to our research programs in \nboth air and space, the research that is going on.\n  We have existing aeronautics research facilities that are national \nassets, and they are in places such as the Ames Research Center in \nCalifornia; the Glenn Research Center named after our former colleague, \nSenator John Glenn, which is in Cleveland; Langley Research Center in \nVirginia; the Dryden Flight Research Center, and that is at Edwards Air \nForce Base in California.\n  These NASA centers are unique in their ability to leverage the \ncomplementary and ever-increasing synergies between space and aviation \nsystems through these incredibly experienced technical researchers, and \nthey make remarkable advances in aerospace-related disciplines such as \nmaterials and structures, flight controls, aerospace systems health \nmanagement, and high speed aerothermal analysis tools. We take for \ngranted when we get on commercial airliners some of the improvements \nthat have been made. Well, where do we think a lot of that came from? \nIt came from NASA and the research there. These advances not only \naccelerate space and aviation systems but also other very complex \nsystems such as the smart grid, remote medicine and medical robotics, \nsmart cars, a whole bunch of things.\n  NASA's fundamental aeronautics research capability happens to be also \nintegrated with enabling the future space missions of NASA. The \nNation's aeronautics research and development investment currently is \nplanned and well coordinated through the National Aeronautics Research \nand Development Policy as well as in Executive Order 13419 in which the \nroles and responsibilities of executive departments and agencies in \nFederal aeronautics R are clearly defined and delineated all the way \nthrough the rest of this decade, until 2020.\n  What happened when this FAA bill was put together years ago is that \nit had a transfer to some committee of NASA's successful aeronautics \nR investment leadership and this competitiveness, this investment has \nsupported springing forth key technologies that directly contradict a \nnational policy of doing this in a committee instead of doing it in \nNASA. The unnecessary reassignment, when this bill was crafted some \ntime ago, of those responsibilities to other agencies of government \nwould clearly jeopardize the success of this extraordinary R program.\n  The amendment, to which we have no objection, is to take this part \nout of the bill with the new NASA bill that was passed, with the robust \naeronautics research and development that is within NASA, be the \noperative policy.\n  If it is appropriate, if this is the proper parliamentary procedure, \nI ask for the yeas and nays--or I would ask for a voice vote. I am told \nwe are not in the proper venue for that. So I have offered the \namendment, it is laid down, and we will deal with it appropriately.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Remembering President Ronald Reagan\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, as a native Californian, I come to \nthe floor now to honor the 100th birthday of President Ronald Reagan.\n  Former First Lady Nancy Reagan asked that I serve on the Ronald \nReagan Centennial Commission and I was very honored to accept. Today, I \njoin Senator Jim Webb, also a member, and Orrin Hatch, to continue \nPresident Reagan's spirit of bipartisanship. We have invited Senators \non both sides of the aisle to join us here on the floor.\n  From Simi Valley, in his beloved California, to our Nation's capital, \nAmericans this month are honoring President Ronald Reagan. These \ncentennial events are intended to reach all Americans, including many \nborn after President Reagan left office. Those who remember Ronald \nReagan as Governor or as President know how he impacted history. But \nthere are some who may not realize that the society we live in today \nis, in part, due to the policies of President Reagan. Young adults \ntoday grow up without the fear of nuclear war in the back of their \nmind, and students of tomorrow will work to achieve President Reagan's \ndream of a world without nuclear weapons.\n  It can be said that every great President can be remembered in just \none sentence. Some examples: ``He freed the slaves;'' ``He made the \nLouisiana Purchase.'' Yet, 22 years after he left office and 7 years \nafter his death, the name Ronald Wilson Reagan can still provoke a \ncomplex debate. There is no one phrase that can describe his legacy. \nSome come to mind: ``The great\n\n[[Page S508]]\n\ncommunicator.'' Or: ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.'' That is the \none that does it for me.\n  There is much debate over President Reagan because we all think of \nhim differently, and over time, history sweetens our memories. But no \nmatter what policy disagreements one may have had with him, one has to \nadmire his style of politics. He was a conservative Republican, but he \nunderstood that in order to get anything done, he had to work across \nthe aisle, which he did.\n  In his 1983 State of the Union Address, President Reagan said:\n\n       Let us, in these next 2 years--men and women of both \n     parties, every political shade--concentrate on the long-\n     range, bipartisan responsibilities of government, not the \n     short-range or short-term temptations of partisan politics.\n\n  Also, Ronald Reagan had commonsense conviction that helped his \nachievements.\n  He was a true gentleman in American politics. You would not have seen \nhim giving a speech--like some do today--calling his opponents names or \ngiving out generalized insults. Dignity and wit were his weapons of \nchoice.\n  Also, President Reagan served during times of divided government, \nwhen one party had the White House and the other controlled at least \none Chamber of Congress, giving each side some governing responsibility \nto find solutions.\n  It was a time when a financial and fiscal crisis brought the two \nparties together to compromise on tough choices about taxes and \nspending. In 1983, President Reagan and Speaker Tip O'Neill came \ntogether to compromise on Social Security, based on proposals from a \ncommission led by Alan Greenspan. President Reagan is credited with \ncreating the conditions that led to the end of the Cold War, reviving \nthe economy, and returning a sense of optimism to our country.\n  One of the things I most admired was his work to reduce the number of \nnuclear weapons in the world and his dream of a world one day free of \nthese awful weapons.\n  President Reagan expressed this vision during his second inaugural \naddress on January 21, 1985. He declared:\n\n       We seek the total elimination one day of nuclear weapons \n     from the face of the Earth.\n\n  It was a remarkable statement from a President who had deployed \ntactical nuclear missiles in Europe to counter the Soviet Union's \nfearsome SS-20 missile fleet. But President Reagan understood the grave \nthreat that nuclear weapons pose to humanity, and he boldly set himself \nto achieve their eventual elimination.\n  My good friend, George Shultz, who was Secretary of State under \nPresident Reagan, remembers that many at that time thought the \nPresident's initial negotiations to reduce strategic arms were not \nserious--even quite ridiculous. A classified report released recently \nshowed that President Reagan asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff about the \ncost of an all-out Soviet attack and plans for retaliation. He asked \nSecretary Shultz:\n\n       What's so good about keeping the peace after wiping each \n     other out?\n\n  Mr. Shultz believes if he were around today, President Reagan would \nhave been in favor of the New START treaty. At the famous Reykjavik \nSummit with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in October 1980, \nPresident Reagan went far beyond Gorbachev's proposal to slash \nstrategic arms by 50 percent. He truly believed we should go to zero. \nThe Reykjavik talks may not have worked out, but the idea that we \nshould create a world free of nuclear weapons endures to this day.\n  Secretary Shultz thinks President Reagan would want to be remembered \nfor his complete faith in freedom and his conviction that you had to be \nstrong to defend that freedom. And that is certainly true.\n  Ronald Reagan came into office with character and charisma, traits \nthat take other elected officials years to develop. It was that \ncharisma that impressed California's Republicans and led to his \nnomination as Governor of my great State.\n  Ronald Reagan was elected Governor of California in 1966 by nearly a \n1 million-vote margin. He was elected to a second term in 1970. He did \nnot seem to mind that people underappreciated him at the time.\n  Decades later, as volumes of his handwritten essays were released to \nthe public, Americans saw just what a thoughtful and visionary man he \nwas. If we remember Ronald Reagan with one sentence, let's remember him \nas one who took big ideas, a crafting of words, and a conviction of \nfreedom to change the entire world.\n  On the 100th anniversary of the birth of ``The Great Communicator,'' \nI hope we can embody his spirit of bipartisanship to keep our country \nstrong and united today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to speak also on the 100th \nanniversary of the birth of Ronald Reagan, and I am so pleased to \nfollow my colleague from California who has been under the weather for \na little while. We are very glad she is back.\n  I think all of us will have an opportunity to talk about one of the \ngreat Presidents of the last century and to mark the 30 years since \nRonald Reagan's inauguration.\n  When Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980, America faced an anemic \neconomy, high unemployment, and a sense of malaise emanated from \nWashington. But President Reagan never doubted that America's potential \nwas unlimited. During his second inaugural address, he said America \n``can out-produce, out-compete and out-sell anybody, anywhere in the \nworld.'' The Reagan Revolution was fueled by the understanding that, \ngiven the opportunity, Americans would dream, create, and build. He \nalso knew the road to greatness was through an individual's effort, not \nthrough expanded government. So President Reagan set about \nreinvigorating the stagnant economy.\n  He cut government spending. He reduced government regulation. He \nended the practice of wage and price controls. He passed tax cuts for \nall Americans. He famously noted that ``Government's first duty is to \nprotect the people, not run their lives.'' The American economy \nresponded with sustained growth, and a new era of economic prosperity \nhad been ushered in.\n  Reagan's vision of the greater good also extended beyond our shores. \nHe was a fierce advocate for freedom. With our Cold War adversary, the \nSoviet Union, imposing the tight grip of communism on much of the \nworld, President Reagan launched a resurgence of American military \nmight through the Strategic Defense Initiative. As he said:\n\n       Of the four wars in my lifetime, none came about because \n     the United States was too strong.\n\n  It was his firm resolve to negotiate from a position of strength that \nled to successful arms talks with the Soviets and ultimately to the \ndownfall of the Soviet Empire. During his first inaugural address, he \nclearly stated where America stood:\n\n       As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential \n     adversaries, they will be reminded that peace is the highest \n     aspiration of the American people. We will negotiate for it, \n     sacrifice for it; we will not surrender for it--now or ever.\n\n  President Reagan understood that all people, regardless of where they \nlive, long for liberty and freedom. He believed that America was a \nbeacon of hope to all of the oppressed people of the world, a ``shining \ncity on the hill,'' as he described it. As Jeffrey Bell wrote in the \nWeekly Standard, Ronald Reagan ``believed that people all over the \nworld craved self-government just as much as Americans did.'' Even \ntoday, he is still being proven right. He said:\n\n       Concentrated power has always been the enemy of liberty.\n\n  These words still echo in today's tumultuous times. We witnessed the \npoignant photographs of women in Iraq voting and joyously holding up \ntheir purple-stained thumbs. We are now seeing the marches of people in \nEgypt who long to be able to vote in a real election for the first time \nin 30 years. He also understood the importance of information in \npromoting freedom, calling it the ``oxygen of the modern age. It seeps \nthrough the walls topped by barbed wire; it wafts across the \nelectrified borders.''\n\n  His words are as true today as when he uttered them. Freedom and \nindividual liberty are America's greatest assets. They are the core of \nour national identity. They are the foundation of our economic \nprosperity, and these precious assets have been protected by the \nservice and sacrifice of\n\n[[Page S509]]\n\npatriots in every generation from the beginning of America's history to \ntoday. Ronald Reagan understood and appreciated the duty we all have to \npreserve these American ideals.\n  As he said:\n\n       Democracy is worth dying for, because it is the most deeply \n     honorable form of government devised by man.\n\n  When President Reagan died in 2004, there was a spontaneous, \nworldwide outpouring of grief and tribute that caught some seasoned \npolitical pundits by surprise. Throughout his political career, Ronald \nReagan was underestimated by ``establishment'' political intellectuals \nof the day. He was dismissed sometimes by the media. But when he spoke, \nthe American people listened, they understood, and they agreed with \nthis down-to-Earth but very profound man. And so did the world.\n  We all remember him fondly, with great respect, and are honored to \nhave known him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I want to take a quick minute or two to \ntalk about an amendment that will be called up later in the afternoon \non my behalf to expand and improve the unmanned aerial systems--known \nas UAS programs--that are part of the Federal Aviation Administration \nreauthorization bill. My amendment is No. 27.\n  I thank Chairman Rockefeller and his staff because they have worked \nclosely with me on this and several other amendments.\n  Growth in the unmanned aerial systems sector of the aviation business \nhas been extraordinary in the last few years. I think it is well known \nthat these systems are proven critical to military operations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. But they also have tremendous potential in the \ncivilian sector whether it is for firefighting, law enforcement, border \ncontrol, search and rescue, or environmental monitoring.\n  Law enforcement uses for this technology would be especially helpful \nin rural areas like much of my home State of Oregon. Unfortunately, the \nFAA has not yet been able to come up with a real plan for how to \nintegrate these unmanned aerial systems vehicles into our airspace. \nThat is why I am pleased the Rockefeller bill before us includes \nrequirements for the FAA to get to work on a plan in this area and to \nestablish test sites for unmanned aerial systems research.\n  The bill, however, includes only four of these sites. I would like to \nsee us be bolder, particularly in an area where I think there is so \nmuch opportunity for innovation, development, and job creation.\n  This amendment would expand the number of sites to 10, which would \nrequire the FAA to explore the most useful and safest way for unmanned \naerial systems to be integrated into the airspace.\n  The amendment would require at least one of these test sites to \ninvestigate how unmanned aerial systems can be useful in monitoring \npublic land. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Public Lands and \nForests, I have heard repeatedly from law enforcement officials that \nremote public lands are too often being used as a place for criminals \nto grow drugs without detection. The Bureau of Land Management and the \nForest Service, two agencies that work in this field, simply don't have \nthe resources to use expensive helicopters and do all the necessary \nwork to root out these illegal operations.\n  I will conclude by saying that I believe unmanned aerial systems \ncould be a cost-saving way to address this problem. By getting the ball \nrolling with my amendment, I believe it will be possible to more \nsignificantly fight these reprehensible drug operations that are taking \nplace on public lands.\n  I hope this amendment, No. 27, will be accepted as part of the \nRockefeller legislation, and I look forward to working with the bill's \nmanagers to encourage the development in this sector, which I think is \nright at the heart of what we need to do to promote innovation in the \naviation field. I thank Chairman Rockefeller.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/03/senate-section/article/S509-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, there are many of us who will come to \nthe floor this afternoon to pay tribute to one of the great Presidents \nin American history. Many of us will recollect times and experiences \nand contacts we had with President Reagan and the way he inspired us \npersonally as well as a nation.\n  When I was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, the Vietnamese went to \ngreat lengths to restrict the news from home to the statements and \nactivities of prominent opponents of the war in Vietnam. They wanted us \nto believe America had forgotten us. They never mentioned Ronald Reagan \nto us or played his speeches over the camp loud speakers. No matter. We \nknew about him. New additions to our ranks told us how the Governor and \nMrs. Reagan were committed to our liberation and our cause.\n  When we came home, all of us were eager to meet the Reagans, to thank \nthem for their concern. But more than gratitude drew us to them. We \nwere drawn to them because they were among the few prominent Americans \nwho did not subscribe to the then-fashionable notion that America had \nentered her inevitable decline.\n  We prisoners of war came home to a country that had lost a war and \nthe best sense of itself, a country beset by social and economic \nproblems. Assassinations, riots, scandals, contempt for political, \nreligious, and educational institutions gave the appearance that we had \nbecome a dysfunctional society. Patriotism was sneered at, the military \nscorned. The world anticipated the collapse of our global influence. \nThe great, robust, confident Republic that had given its name to the \nlast century seemed exhausted.\n  Ronald Reagan believed differently. He possessed an unshakable faith \nin America's greatness, past and future, that proved more durable than \nthe prevailing political sentiments of the time. His confidence was a \ntonic to men who had come home eager to put the war behind us and for \nthe country to do likewise.\n  Our country has a long and honorable history. A lost war or any other \ncalamity should not destroy our confidence or weaken our purpose. We \nwere a good nation before Vietnam, and we are a good nation after \nVietnam. In all of history, you cannot find a better one. Of that, \nRonald Reagan was supremely confident, and he became President to prove \nit.\n  His was a faith that shouted at tyrants to ``tear down this wall.'' \nSuch faith, such patriotism requires a great deal of love to profess, \nand I will always revere him for it. When walls were all I had for a \nworld, I learned about a man whose love of freedom gave me hope in a \ndesolate place. His faith honored us, as it honored all Americans, as \nit honored all freedom-loving people.\n  Let us honor his memory especially today by holding his faith as our \nown, and let us too tear down walls to freedom. That is what Americans \ndo when they believe in themselves.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I was honored to hear Senator McCain's \ncomments on Ronald Reagan. This Sunday is indeed the 100th anniversary \nof his birth. It is an opportunity for the whole Nation to honor the \nmemory of a man who honored us with his leadership.\n  In the 1980s, we were a weakened country. Inflation and unemployment \nwere in double digits. The hostage crisis in Iran dragged on, with no \nend in sight. Our standing abroad was waning\n\n[[Page S510]]\n\nand so too was our military strength. Challenges at home were answered \nwith one failed Washington program after another. We had lost \nconfidence in our future and really in the principles that made us \nexceptional.\n  Ronald Reagan changed that. Part of that change began with 12 simple, \ncrucial words:\n\n       Government is not the solution to our problem; government \n     is the problem.\n\n  It is a big part of our problem.\n  He stirred the passions of our country, revitalizing not only our \neconomy but our identity and confidence as free people. What some have \ncalled the Reagan revolution he called the great rediscovery. He \ninstilled us with a new confidence in our future and in America's role \nas the last best hope of mankind.\n  His achievements are well known, but they bear repeating.\n  Working with Paul Volcker, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, he tamed \nthe inflation which was robbing Americans of their life's work and \nsavings. It was a tough course, a tough road, but he saw it through. He \nstayed on the course, and we were stronger as a result. We need to get \non a tough road and stay the course today.\n  He lowered taxes dramatically, including a reduction in the top rate \nfrom nearly 70 percent, and he reined in a runaway bureaucracy that had \ntrapped innovation and productivity in a labyrinth of regulation and \nredtape.\n  His faith in the free market was not misplaced. It rewarded us. He \ncreated 20 million new jobs, grew our gross national product by 26 \npercent, and began the longest peacetime boom in our history. \nConditions improved for Americans in every walk of life. The net worth \nof families earning between $20,000 and $50,000 rose by 27 percent.\n  Reagan's stunning success debunked every myth of those who believe a \nbigger government is more compassionate and can do more for more \npeople. The growth and potential productivity of the private sector is \nwhat has made America the most prosperous Nation.\n  This success at home was matched by his success abroad. He defended \nour principles and our way of life with clarity, confidence, and vigor. \nHis policies brought down the Soviet Empire. ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down \nthis wall'' still resonates in our minds, and it liberated untold \nmillions.\n  Today, more than 20 years after President Reagan left office, we find \nourselves facing many of the same challenges: a sagging economy, a \ngrowing government, and a diminished standing in the world. We would be \nwise to remember the lessons of that era: peace through strength, \nprosperity through freedom. He understood that our future greatness \nlies in the same place it always has--through our pioneering, restless, \nenterprising spirit that is filled with ambition and excitement, and a \ndeep sense of honor and decency that defines who we are as a people and \nwho we will be tomorrow.\n  In President Reagan's farewell address, he issued a word of caution:\n\n       If we forget what we did, we won't know who we are. I am \n     warning of an eradication of that--of the American memory \n     that could result, ultimately, in an erosion of the American \n     spirit.\n\n  As we face daunting, defining challenges of our time, I hope we look \nback to the leadership he provided.\n  On a personal note, I was tremendously honored to have been appointed \na U.S. attorney in the Southern District of Alabama by President Reagan \nin 1981. It was an office in which I had served as an assistant a \nnumber of years before. To be able to come back and lead that office \nwas such a personal thrill.\n  The President did not give me any directions as to what we were to \ndo, but I absolutely knew--and I have often said it is a great example \nof true leadership--I knew exactly what he wanted me to do. I gathered \nthe staff, many of whom I had worked with years before, and used these \nwords: President Reagan sent me here to prosecute criminals and protect \nthe U.S. Treasury. I believe that is what he did. I believe that was \nimplicit in his campaign, his consistent leadership, that he believed \nin law and order and efficiency, and he wanted us to fight corruption \nand try to help produce a more efficient government.\n  I remember in those days we went to a U.S. attorneys conference. I \nattended with my good friend, recently the Deputy Attorney General of \nthe United States, Larry Thompson. We would share rooms on the trips to \nsave money because we knew and believed President Reagan wanted us to \nsave money. Our spending was out of control, and we had a serious \nfinancial problem. Our budgets were frozen. But we worked harder and we \nproduced more.\n  That can be done today. This whining that we cannot reduce spending--\nand many times, they define ``reducing spending'' as a reduction of the \nprojected rate of growth. It is not even a reduction of current level \nspending.\n  These kinds of things happened throughout the government. It \nincreased productivity of our government. It reduced the take of the \nFederal Government of the private economy. The private economy grew, \nand the government sector became more efficient and more productive. \nThat is what we need to return to.\n  It was such a fabulous honor to have the opportunity to serve in that \nposition. I hope I was faithful to the values of the President who \nappointed me. I have to say, I think I knew what they were, and I know \nI gave my best effort to be worthy of the trust he placed in me. That \nwas true of many more people throughout the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise for a moment to join my colleagues \nin paying tribute to the late Ronald Reagan, President of the United \nStates--a great conservative leader of our country and an inspiration \nto many, many Americans.\n  I want to dedicate my remarks to a lady named Kathie Miller. Kathie \nworks for me here in Washington. She has loved Ronald Reagan since the \nday he came on the scene and can probably quote him verbatim much \nbetter than I can. He had a meaningful impact on her life, and so I \ndedicate these remarks to her today.\n  My speech will be about two events I happened to attend where Ronald \nReagan was speaking and the impact of those events not only on me but \non everybody else who was there, and actually on the future of our \ncountry. One took place in 1975, when he was beginning his pursuit of \nthe nomination for the Presidency of the United States. Gerald Ford was \nstill President at that time and Ronald Reagan was running for the \nnomination for a full term.\n  Ronald Reagan came to Cobb County, GA. Cobb County, GA, is where I \nlive. It is a very Republican county right now, but in 1975 it was not \na very Republican county. In fact, there was only one elected official \nin the entire county who was a Republican, out of literally 100 or more \nwho were Democratic officials.\n  Ronald Reagan came to the civic center in Cobb County, and an \nunanticipated thing happened, not by plan, certainly, not by the \ngeneration of politicians, but a crowd so large came to hear him that \nthe fire marshals shut the building down. This is a very good-sized, \n4,000-seat auditorium. People came to hear a positive message about \nAmerica.\n  I was fortunate enough, because I had been in politics a little bit, \nto be able to get in that room and listen to his speech. In 1975, for \nAmerica, it was not the most prosperous of times. In fact, a lot of the \nthings we have been suffering through these last couple of years we \nwent through in 1974 and 1975. We had a difficult housing market, \nhigher interest rates, higher unemployment, and things of that nature.\n  So this former actor came to Cobb County and he lit a fire under \neverybody, and not necessarily about him but about ourselves. He \nuplifted people who needed uplifting and he did it with a message of a \nbelief in ourselves, a belief in our country, pride in America, and \ndefense through strength. Those messages were so clearly Ronald Reagan. \nIt inspired me. And it inspired me so much that I hoped he would get \nthat nomination and be elected President of the United States. But he \nfailed. He did not get the nomination. Ultimately, Gerald Ford got it, \nnot\n\n[[Page S511]]\n\nRonald Reagan. But Ronald Reagan didn't go home and pout. He did not \nstop participating. He didn't drop out. He set his sights on the 1980 \nRepublican nomination for President of the United States, and history \nreflects that he achieved it. He won it, and it was 8 great years for \nour country, 8 great years with a man who could inspire and who could \nlead.\n  I have oftentimes said that two of the truly great Presidents we have \nhad--John Kennedy and Ronald Reagan--had something in common. They were \nfrom different parties, but they could stand before a group of people \nand make a speech about a subject they didn't agree with and, by the \ntime they finished, they got a standing ovation. So, first, they were \ngreat communicators. Second, they were committed to a safe and \nprosperous America. They were hawks on defense. They confronted our \nenemies straight up, as Kennedy did with Khrushchev and President \nReagan did. Third, and most important, they reduced taxes and brought \nprosperity to the economy of the United States.\n  The second occasion I met Ronald Reagan was an interesting one. It \nwas in the Omni Coliseum in Atlanta, where professional basketball was \nplayed at the time. The coliseum seats 16,000 people. I was then the \nminority leader of the Georgia House of Representatives and was elected \nto be the MC of a program that featured Senator Mack Mattingly, running \nfor reelection from Georgia, but the keynote speaker was Ronald Reagan. \nIn fact, he flew from Washington to Atlanta to make that speech and \nthen went to Reykjavik, Iceland where he confronted Gorbachev and \nBrezhnev and the Russians and he stood for peace through strength, and \na strong buildup of forces in America so we could be a strong country \nthat could defend ourselves, not a weak country subservient to anybody \nelse.\n  In that auditorium of 16,000 people, he stood up before them and did \nthe same thing he did in the auditorium in 1975. He inspired them to \nbelieve in their country, inspired them to believe in what was right, \nand inspired them to believe in peace through strength. And when he \nleft, everybody was uplifted.\n  I think when Ronald Reagan left the Presidency in 1988, we would all \nagree our country was uplifted. It was a period of prosperity and a \nperiod of strength, and it was a renaissance of the American spirit. \nThat is the test of true leadership. So I am honored and privileged to \njoin many of my colleagues on the floor today to pay tribute to the \nmemory and the commitment of Ronald Reagan, President of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I wish to join my other colleagues who have \ncome to the floor at this time to speak in honor of our late President, \nRonald Reagan, on the occasion of his 100th birthday. I wish to begin \nby giving my best wishes to Mrs. Reagan and wish her all the best for \nher continued health. Also, as someone who had three different \npositions in the Reagan administration, I am thinking of a lot of very \nfine people with whom I had the opportunity to serve, especially Cap \nWeinberger whom I met and worked with every day for about 4 years, who \nis one of the finest people I ever worked with, and also John \nHerrington, who was the Director of White House Personnel, who first \nbrought me into the Reagan administration and later served our country \nas Secretary of Energy.\n  As I mentioned, I had three different positions in the Reagan \nadministration, first as a member of the National Advisory Committee, \nand then I spent 4 years to the day in the Pentagon as Assistant \nSecretary of Defense, and then as Secretary of the Navy. It was truly \nan inspiring time in my life, to have worked for an individual who had \nthe leadership qualities Ronald Reagan demonstrated. He knew how to \ninspire our country. He knew how to bring strong personalities together \nto work toward the good of the country and for its future. He knew how \nto make decisions, he knew how to make hard decisions, and one of the \ngreat qualities he had was he was never afraid to take responsibility \nfor the consequences of any of those decisions. That is something which \nI think motivated everyone who served in his administration.\n  If we go back to that time period, those of us who were of age, 1980 \nwas a bad time in this country. Our country was in tremendous turmoil. \nWe were demoralized in the wake of the fall of South Vietnam and the \nbitterness that had affected so many of us along class lines, \nparticularly between those who opposed the Vietnam war and those who \nhad fought it, and what we were going to do in terms of resolving those \nissues here in this country and then our reputation internationally. \nInflation was rampant, sometimes in the high teens. People were saying \nthat the Presidency was too big a job for any one person. Our military \nwas overworked, underpaid, and dramatically underappreciated.\n  I had friends with whom I had served or I had gone to the Naval \nAcademy with, who had gone into the Navy, who were saying during this \ntime period if you make commander you may as well get your divorce \nbecause you are going to go to sea for 4 years. The Navy had gone from \n930 combatant ships during the Vietnam war down to 479, precipitously, \nat the same time our country had assumed the obligations in the Indian \nOcean and the Persian Gulf, obligations it didn't have before.\n  The Soviet Union, it is hard to remember right now, was in a state of \nhigh activity, diplomatically and militarily. It had invaded \nAfghanistan, threatening instability in that part of the world. It had \na massive naval buildup in the Pacific following our withdrawal from \nVietnam. Our diplomatic and military personnel in Tehran had been taken \nhostage by the Iranian regime and were being taunted daily on TV. Our \nnational self-image was in a crisis state. Who were we as a country? \nDid we really have a future?\n  Ronald Reagan campaigned based on our national greatness and on the \nintrinsic good of our society and on restoring our place at the top of \nthe world community. I can vividly remember in the summer of 1980 when \nRonald Reagan made a speech at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention \nand mentioned, as he was so wont to do, with symbolic phrases that \nVietnam had been a noble cause. He had the media following him around \nthe country mocking the comment at this point, only 5 years after the \nfall of South Vietnam, but for those of us who had stepped forward and \nserved in order to attempt to bring democracy to South Vietnam, that \nwas a great moment of inspiration.\n  Once he was elected, Ronald Reagan governed with the same sense of \ncertainty about the greatness of our system and the goodness of our \npeople. He convinced strong, talented people to join his \nadministration. With George Shultz as Secretary of State and Cap \nWeinberger as Secretary of Defense, he brought two lions into his \nCabinet who did not always agree--which was rather famous in Washington \nat the time--but who were able to combine fierce competitive intellects \nwith decades of valuable experience.\n  When Ronald Reagan left the White House, our military had been \nrebuilt, our people had regained their pride in our country and their \noptimism for its future. The United States was again recognized as the \nleading nation in the world community and the failed governmental \nconcept that had produced the Soviet Union was on the verge of \nimploding, not because of external attack but soon to disappear at the \nhands of its own citizens, who could look to the West and see a better \nway of life. To paraphrase an old saying, ``You never know when you are \nmaking history. You only know when you did.''\n  Ronald Reagan did make history and I was proud to be a small part of \nit.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S512]]\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, as the junior Senator representing the State \nof Illinois, and one who will lead a celebration of President Reagan's \nlife in Chicago Saturday night, for Sunday, the 100th birthday of our \nnative Illinoisan, our 40th President, Ronald Reagan, I want to talk \nfor a moment about his life and what he has meant to the United States, \nnow on the 100th anniversary of President Reagan's birth.\n  On February 6, 1911, in Tampico, IL, with a population of 820, John \nand Nelle Reagan welcomed a child who would one day change the \ndirection not just of our country but the world. According to the \nReagan family lore, when he first gazed upon his son, John Reagan \nprophetically quipped: ``He looks like a fat little Dutchman. But who \nknows, he might grow up to be President someday.''\n  His father was a strong believer in the American dream and Nelle \nReagan passed on to her son her penchant to always look for the good in \npeople, regardless of their current position.\n  It was those early lessons in perseverance and faith that would \ninspire Ronald Reagan to pursue his dream of becoming a Hollywood \nactor. He signed his first professional acting contract in 1935 and \nwent on to enjoy a successful career on the silver screen. But by 1946, \nafter serving 3 years in the Army Air Force Intelligence Corps during \nthe height of World War II, he began to have ambitions beyond \nHollywood. A 5-year stint as the president of the Screen Actors Guild \nlaid the foundation for Ronald Reagan's political career. During the \nturmoil of the Hollywood communism craze, Reagan proved himself to be a \nskilled dealmaker and an influential leader as he successfully \nnavigated the upheaval in the Hollywood community.\n  In 1964, Ronald Reagan was thrust into the national spotlight as he \ngave his televised speech entitled, ``A Time for Choosing,'' in support \nof the Presidential nominee Barry Goldwater.\n  Following his speech, a group of influential citizens became \nconvinced that Ronald Reagan should become the next Governor of \nCalifornia. After winning in the primary and enduring a very hard-\nfought campaign, Ronald Reagan unseated the two-time Governor of \nCalifornia, Pat Brown, to become the 33rd Governor in California's \nhistory.\n  During his 2 terms as Governor, Californians enjoyed a smaller, less \ncostly, and more efficient State government. Governor Reagan returned \n$5 billion to the taxpayers and used his line-item veto authority 943 \ntimes to ensure that the State's budget matched its priorities.\n  Ronald Reagan had once again proved himself a determined and capable \nleader in difficult times, but soon the American people would learn \nthat his best days were very much ahead of him. After an unsuccessful \nRepublican Presidential attempt in 1976, he knew that he wanted to be \nPresident but would only enter the race if the people of the United \nStates actually wanted him to run. In the years following the 1976 \nprimary, Ronald Reagan became increasingly concerned about the \ndirection the country was headed, especially in the areas of national \nsecurity, unemployment, and the economy. More than anything, Reagan \nsensed that Americans had lost their sense of confidence, not just in \nthemselves but also in the country.\n  Interestingly, the concerns Mr. Reagan felt as he weighed the \ndecision to run for President are not unlike many of the challenges we \nface today.\n  Ronald Reagan was confident that he was the man who could lead the \ncountry out of a dark recession and into the light of a new prosperity \nand national pride. After winning a landslide election in November, \nRonald Reagan was sworn in as our 40th President on January 20, 1981. \nHe immediately went to work on repairing a broken economy by enacting \nthe Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, with his solid belief being that \nif people had more money in their pockets and confidence to invest, the \ncountry would get back on a sound financial footing. During his first \nmonths in office, Reagan was as much to thank for the new found \neconomic stability as he was for a heightened sense of optimism that \nwas returning to the United States after very hard times.\n  He thoughtfully guided the country through a series of national \ntragedies and terrorist attacks on our military forces abroad. Yet \nthrough it all, President Reagan's resolve never wavered, his \nconfidence that the American people would meet the myriad challenges \nthey faced never faltered. This was a man who, after surviving an \nassassination attempt, continued to meet with congressional leaders in \nhis hospital room as he recovered because he believed it in the best \ninterest of the American people that he continue working to the extent \nhis body would allow. It was that type of steadfast determination that \nallowed the negotiations with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to move \nforward and eventually led to the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, the \nsigning of the I.N.F. Treaty and eventually the end of Soviet \noppression in Eastern Europe. The issue that got him into politics, \nending the spread of communism, became the crowning achievement of his \nPresidency.\n  His constant refrain throughout his time in the White House was that \ngovernment was becoming too big, too inefficient, too unresponsive and \ntoo wasteful. As Governor, Reagan demonstrated the ability to exercise \nfiscal restraint and he urged leaders in Congress to do the same thing. \nI think it appropriate that we are celebrating Reagan's 100th birthday \nat a time when national debt and the deficit are at an all-time high. \nWhile we know that Reagan possessed the willingness to tackle such \nissues, I believe the lesson we can learn most from his Presidency is \nthe endlessly optimistic attitude he had that the United States and its \npeople would meet challenges of the day and emerge stronger because of \nthe struggle to overcome.\n  His assertion that America was ``the shining city on a hill'' guided \nhim, as it should us. A hard-nosed, gritty politician, Reagan would \nhave jumped at the chance to take on the responsibility of leading this \ncountry out of this recession, just as he did in 1981. So as we \ncelebrate Ronald Reagan's 100th birthday, let us take a moment to \nreflect upon the life of a man who, as President, always did what was \nnecessary to move the country forward in the way he felt was most \nbeneficial to those who mattered most, the people.\n  I know his legacy is most associated with the people of California, \nbut as the junior Senator for Illinois, we will claim our right to note \nhis birth in Tampico, his childhood in Dixon, and his college years at \nEureka College. We will be very happy to mark the 100th birthday on \nSaturday in Chicagoland and through celebrations in other parts of the \nState, one of our great Presidents who very much changed the course and \ndirection of this country and this world for the better.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in 3 days' time, across our country, \nfrom the North Country of New Hampshire to his final resting place in \nSimi Valley, CA, Americans will celebrate the legacy of President \nRonald Reagan. It will be the occasion of the 100th anniversary of his \nbirth. I am very honored to rise today to join other colleagues of both \nparties and others throughout the United States and, I am sure, the \nworld in paying tribute to America's 40th President.\n  I cannot speak as personally about President Reagan as some in this \nChamber can. I met him only a few times when, as a visiting State \nattorney general during the eighties, I was at the White House. He was \nalways gracious, always responsive to us. But I did have one meeting \nthat I might call a virtual meeting with President Reagan that reminds \nme of his enduring importance for our country today.\n  Twenty-two years ago, on January 4, 1989, as President Reagan was \ndeparting the White House, having completed his second term, I had just \narrived in Washington as a freshman Senator from Connecticut. President \nReagan was set to give his final weekly radio address on that brisk \nSaturday morning, and then-Senate majority leader George Mitchell had \nhonored me by\n\n[[Page S513]]\n\nasking me if I would give the Democratic response. It was a real honor, \nalthough a daunting one, for me to be asked to do that on that \noccasion.\n  Looking back, I believe President Reagan's 331st and final radio \naddress on that January morning was among the most masterful and moving \nof his career. In it, he captured the very essence of the American \nspirit. He said:\n\n       Whether we seek it or not, whether we like it or not, we \n     Americans are keepers of the miracles. We are asked to be \n     guardians of a place to come to, a place to start again, a \n     place to live in the dignity God meant for his children. May \n     it ever be so.\n\n  President Reagan concluded that morning. Needless to say, President \nReagan's final radio address was quite literally a tough act to follow. \nIn my remarks, I praised him for his love of country, for his fervent \ndevotion to freedom, and for his commitment to the values of faith, \nflag, and family. I was, as I put it then, inspired and encouraged by \nhis patriotism, and I urged all Americans to ``work on our unfinished \nbusiness and the challenges ahead with the spirit of purpose and \nconfidence that is the legacy of the Reagan years.''\n  Today, 22 years later, I continue to feel deeply honored that I was \nable to deliver those remarks and evermore confident of the importance \nof Ronald Reagan's legacy to us and the generations of Americans to \ncome. The optimism, moral clarity, and confidence President Reagan \nradiated inspired a generation, and they are precisely the ideals we \nneed today to rekindle and reinspire the current generation of \nAmericans and others, frankly, living without freedom around the world.\n  I didn't always agree with President Reagan. That is a matter of \npublic record. But I always understood the enduring value and strength \nand sincerity of his faith in America's values and America's destiny. \nIn 1980, Ronald Reagan promised to make America great again. And he \ndid. He expressed with total confidence that those who would challenge \nour hard-won freedoms would collapse. And they did.\n  He led our country and the free world to victory in the Cold War \nagainst Soviet communism, and he never doubted for a moment that \nAmerica and our cause could and would prevail. When in 1977 Ronald \nReagan was asked about his vision for the end of the Cold War--\nremember, he was not yet President--he responded with characteristic \nand refreshing directness. He said:\n\n       My idea of American policy toward the Soviet Union is \n     simple, and some would say simplistic. It is this: We win and \n     they lose.\n\n  Well, President Reagan's understanding of world affairs was far from \nsimplistic. He was an optimist without illusions, who guided by and, \nfrankly, expressed moral judgments about what was right and what was \nwrong. We do not see that enough today. There is a kind of relativism \nafoot. But some things are just plain wrong, and some things, thank \nGod, are just plain right.\n  President Reagan had the moral clarity to make distinctions between \ngood and evil and the moral courage to speak the truth of those \ndistinctions unambiguously and to support them unwaveringly.\n  When he addressed an audience of veterans and world leaders \ncommemorating the 40th anniversary of D-day, standing as he spoke on \nthe windswept coast of northern France, the very clifftop in Normandy \nwhere courageous allied soldiers fought to liberate Europe from the \nyoke of Nazi tyranny, President Reagan magnificently, masterfully, \ncompellingly revealed again his moral clarity, and I am honored to \nquote these words today on this floor.\n\n       The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was \n     right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a \n     just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead, or on the \n     next. It was the deep knowledge--and pray God we have not \n     lost it--that there is a profound moral difference between \n     the use of force for liberation and the use of force for \n     conquest. You were here--\n\n  He said to the veterans--\n\n     to liberate, not to conquer, and so you and those others did \n     not doubt your cause. And you were right not to doubt. You \n     all knew that some things are worth dying for. One's country \n     is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, because \n     it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever \n     devised by man. All of you loved liberty. All of you were \n     willing to fight tyranny, and you knew the people of your \n     countries were behind you.\n\n  It is thrilling just to read those words again. Yet President Reagan \nnever spoke about America's enemies belligerently; rather, he spoke \nfirmly and frankly about the deep divide between our morality and that \nof the Soviet Union. In doing so, I think he reawakened in all of us \nthe belief that every human being has the potential to change history \nbecause history, as Reagan knew, was not by abstract inexorable forces, \nbut by real live men and women.\n  It was President Ronald Reagan who came to the defense of the \ndissidents in their fight against the Soviet Union and reminded the \nworld that a single courageous human face, a single courageous voice \ncan tear down the faceless inhumanity of a massive repressive system \nsuch as the Soviet Union.\n  The great Soviet dissident and later Israeli leader and human rights \nactivist Natan Sharansky once shared with me his memory of the moment \nhe first learned of President Reagan's 1982 speech before the British \nParliament, the speech in which Reagan described the Soviet Union as an \nevil empire.\n\n  There were some in this country who thought that was much too stark \nand disrespectful. But Sharansky, who was a prisoner for nearly a \ndecade in the Soviet gulag, described to me how word of Reagan's speech \nspread through that heartless prison and he and his fellow dissidents \ntapped on walls and talked through pipes and even toilets to \ncommunicate the extraordinary news that the leader of the free world \nhad spoken the truth, a truth, as Sharansky put it, ``that burned \ninside the heart of each and every one of us.''\n  Indeed, President Reagan was willing to expose an inconvenient truth \nabout the Soviet Union that unsettled and unnerved some of his \ncontemporaries who feared his undiplomatic words were a threat to \nstability. The truth is, they were. President Reagan refused to accept \nthe stability of an authoritarian status quo that consigned millions of \npeople to live under perpetual tyranny. So he did challenge the \nstability of the Berlin Wall and the gulag as the Stasi. In doing so, \nhis moral courage helped inspire the men and women who brought down the \nIron Curtain and expanded the frontiers of freedom.\n  In his approach to foreign policy, President Reagan embodied that \nquintessentially American combination of idealism and pragmatism. He \nunderstood what America was about, which is freedom and opportunity. He \nfought to extend those great values here at home and throughout the \nworld.\n  In his final words to the Nation as our President, in a radio address \non that January morning 22 years ago, President Reagan shared a story \nabout a meeting Winston Churchill had with a group of American \njournalists in 1952. It was a time when many doubted whether the West \ncould meet the challenges of the Cold War and prevail.\n  Churchill asked the reporters:\n\n       What other nation in history, when it became supremely \n     powerful, has had no thought of territorial aggrandizement, \n     no ambition but to use its resources for the good of the \n     world? I marvel at America's altruism, her sublime \n     disinterestedness.\n\n  Churchill's friend and physician, Lord Moran, described the Prime \nMinister's demeanor as he spoke:\n\n       All at once I realized Winston was in tears. His eyes were \n     red. His voice faltered. He was deeply moved.\n\n  President Reagan was drawn to that story in his final radio address \nto the Nation 22 years ago because he understood that in that moment \nChurchill understood and acknowledged the greatness of the American \nspirit. Imperfect though we are as human beings, it is the spirit that \nexplains who we are and expresses all we aspire to be. He saw America's \ndevotion to a cause that has defined us for over two centuries, a cause \ngreater than our own individual self-interest or even national self-\ninterest very often and that has given an enduring purpose to our \nnational destiny. That is the cause of human dignity and human freedom.\n  At a time when we face many challenges both at home and abroad and \nwhen it has, unfortunately, become fashionable to suggest that our best \ndays as a nation are behind us, President Reagan's optimism and his \nabiding faith in America are more important to remember than ever \nbefore. They are as wise as they are true. Our shared national destiny \nhas always inspired us as Americans and propelled\n\n[[Page S514]]\n\nus forward together. It is the spirit that Ronald Reagan reinspired in \nAmerica at a time of great peril. It is spirit, at this time of peril \nhere at home and around the world, that can carry us forward and \ncontinue to make us the greatest Nation on Earth and the last best hope \nof mankind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Connecticut. I am glad I had the opportunity to hear them.\n  I, too, am here to celebrate Ronald Reagan's life, born 100 years \nago, but also his nearly 50 years of influence on American public \npolicy. I begin in this way. A few years ago when he was President, \nPresident Reagan attended one of the many Washington press dinners held \nhere. I think it was the Gridiron dinner. It was well known to 90 \npercent of the people in the audience that members of the press had a \ndifferent point of view on politics than he did, but they liked him \nanyway, and they respected him, just as he respected them. I remember \nthat evening that he strode into the Gridiron dinner smiling and \nlooking like a million bucks. The press rose and smiled back and \napplauded him. President Reagan stood in front of the media until the \napplause subsided and then he said:\n\n       Thank you very much. I know how hard it is to clap with \n     your fingers crossed.\n\n  The media laughed. They had a wonderful time with President Reagan.\n  The first thing we think about, those of us who had a chance to know \nhim--and that was a great many of us--is that Ronald Reagan was a very \nfriendly, congenial man, an easy person to know, the kind of person one \nwould enjoy spending time with. He was very comfortable, as we say, in \nhis own skin. What we saw in private was what everybody else saw in \npublic.\n  Ronald Reagan was about more than being friendly and congenial. Each \nof us has a personal story of his or her connection to President \nReagan. I have mine, and I wish this as an example.\n  Sixteen years ago this month I stood, as a great many Members of this \nbody have, on the front porch of my hometown courthouse. In my case, it \nwas in Maryville, TN. There I announced my candidacy for President of \nthe United States. It was an offer the people of the United States did \nnot accept. My preacher brother-in-law said I should consider that \ndefeat as a reverse calling. I have, and I have gone on to other \nthings.\n  As an example of the influence President Reagan had on my generation \nand others, let me read an example of what I said in 1995, 16 years \nago:\n\n       Thirty years ago Ronald Reagan, before he was elected to \n     any public office, made an address called ``A Time For \n     Choosing.'' He said that in America freedom is our greatest \n     value, and that then there were two great threats: communism \n     abroad and big government at home.\n       Looking back over those last 30 years, I suppose we could \n     say, one down and one to go. Communism, the evil empire, has \n     virtually disappeared. But big government at home has become \n     an arrogant empire, obnoxious and increasingly irrelevant in \n     a telecommunications age. In every neighborhood in America, \n     the government in Washington is stepping on the promise of \n     American Life. The New American Revolution is about lifting \n     that yoke from the backs of American teachers, farmers, \n     business men and women, college presidents, and homeless \n     shelter directors and giving us the freedom to make decisions \n     for ourselves.\n       Ronald Reagan put it this way in 1964: ``This is the issue \n     of the election. Whether we believe in our capacity for self \n     government or whether we abandon the American Revolution and \n     confess that a little intellectual elite in a far distant \n     capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan \n     ourselves.''\n       That was also the issue of the election in 1994. It will be \n     the issue of 1996, and for years to come. It took 30 years of \n     unfashionable principled leadership by the last Republican \n     Washington outsider who became President to help collapse the \n     evil empire. Now is a good time to give another Republican \n     Washington outsider the opportunity to help put some humility \n     into the arrogant empire in Washington, D.C.\n\n  So we see that the issues of 1964, the issues of 1994, the issues of \n2010, and most likely the issues of 2012 and 2016 and beyond have a lot \nof similarities.\n  Over that half century, Ronald Reagan was the finest spokesman for \nthat point of view, the finest and the most persuasive.\n  We Americans say anything is possible. Nothing symbolizes that more \nthan the American Presidency. We see it in President Obama today, we \nsaw it in President Lincoln, we saw it in President Truman, we saw it \nin President Eisenhower, and we saw it in Ronald Reagan. No President \nsymbolized that more in the last half century than President Reagan \ndid, though. He reminded us of what it means to be an American. He \nlifted our spirits, he made us proud, he strengthened our character, \nand he taught us a great many lessons. We celebrate the centennial of \nhis birth and the half century of his influence in public life.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Ronald Reagan's \nspeech ``A Time for Choosing,'' given on October 27, 1964, which \nlaunched him into public debate in the United States.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Ronald Reagan--``A Time for Choosing''\n\n                           (October 27, 1964)\n\n       Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you and good evening. \n     The sponsor has been identified, but unlike most television \n     programs, the performer hasn't been provided with a script. \n     As a matter of fact, I have been permitted to choose my own \n     words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we \n     face in the next few weeks.\n       I have spent most of my life as a Democrat. I recently have \n     seen fit to follow another course. I believe that the issues \n     confronting us cross party lines. Now, one side in this \n     campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election \n     are the maintenance of peace and prosperity. The line has \n     been used, ``We've never had it so good.''\n       But I have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity \n     isn't something on which we can base our hopes for the \n     future. No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden \n     that reached a third of its national income. Today, 37 cents \n     out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax \n     collector's share, and yet our government continues to spend \n     17 million dollars a day more than the government takes in. \n     We haven't balanced our budget 28 out of the last 34 years. \n     We've raised our debt limit three times in the last twelve \n     months, and now our national debt is one and a half times \n     bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the \n     world. We have 15 billion dollars in gold in our treasury; we \n     don't own an ounce. Foreign dollar claims are 27.3 billion \n     dollars. And we've just had announced that the dollar of 1939 \n     will now purchase 45 cents in its total value.\n       As for the peace that we would preserve, I wonder who among \n     us would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or \n     son has died in South Vietnam and ask them if they think this \n     is a peace that should be maintained indefinitely. Do they \n     mean peace, or do they mean we just want to be left in peace? \n     There can be no real peace while one American is dying some \n     place in the world for the rest of us. We're at war with the \n     most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long \n     climb from the swamp to the stars, and it's been said if we \n     lose that war, and in so doing lose this way of freedom of \n     ours, history will record with the greatest astonishment that \n     those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent its \n     happening. Well I think it's time we ask ourselves if we \n     still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the \n     Founding Fathers.\n       Not too long ago, two friends of mine were talking to a \n     Cuban refugee, a businessman who had escaped from Castro, and \n     in the midst of his story one of my friends turned to the \n     other and said, ``We don't know how lucky we are.'' And the \n     Cuban stopped and said, ``How lucky you are? I had someplace \n     to escape to.'' And in that sentence he told us the entire \n     story. If we lose freedom here, there's no place to escape \n     to. This is the last stand on earth.\n       And this idea that government is beholden to the people, \n     that it has no other source of power except the sovereign \n     people, is still the newest and the most unique idea in all \n     the long history of man's relation to man.\n       This is the issue of this election: Whether we believe in \n     our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the \n     American revolution and confess that a little intellectual \n     elite in a far-distant capitol can plan our lives for us \n     better than we can plan them ourselves.\n       You and I are told increasingly we have to choose between a \n     left or right. Well I'd like to suggest there is no such \n     thing as a left or right. There's only an up or down--[up] \n     man's old--old-aged dream, the ultimate in individual freedom \n     consistent with law and order, or down to the ant heap of \n     totalitarianism. And regardless of their sincerity, their \n     humanitarian motives, those who would trade our freedom for \n     security have embarked on this downward course.\n       In this vote-harvesting time, they use terms like the \n     ``Great Society,'' or as we were told a few days ago by the \n     President, we must accept a greater government activity in \n     the affairs of the people. But they've been a little more \n     explicit in the past and among themselves; and all of the \n     things I now will quote have appeared in print. These are not \n     Republican accusations. For example, they have voices that \n     say, ``The cold war\n\n[[Page S515]]\n\n     will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic \n     socialism.'' Another voice says, ``The profit motive has \n     become outmoded. It must be replaced by the incentives of the \n     welfare state.'' Or, ``Our traditional system of individual \n     freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the \n     20th century.'' Senator Fullbright has said at Stanford \n     University that the Constitution is outmoded. He referred to \n     the President as ``our moral teacher and our leader,'' and he \n     says he is ``hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power \n     imposed on him by this antiquated document.'' He must ``be \n     freed,'' so that he ``can do for us'' what he knows ``is \n     best.'' And Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, another articulate \n     spokesman, defines liberalism as ``meeting the material needs \n     of the masses through the full power of centralized \n     government.''\n       Well, I, for one, resent it when a representative of the \n     people refers to you and me, the free men and women of this \n     country, as ``the masses.'' This is a term we haven't applied \n     to ourselves in America. But beyond that, ``the full power of \n     centralized government''--this was the very thing the \n     Founding Fathers sought to minimize. They knew that \n     governments don't control things. A government can't control \n     the economy without controlling people. And they know when a \n     government sets out to do that, it must use force and \n     coercion to achieve its purpose. They also knew, those \n     Founding Fathers, that outside of its legitimate functions, \n     government does nothing as well or as economically as the \n     private sector of the economy.\n       Now, we have no better example of this than government's \n     involvement in the farm economy over the last 30 years. Since \n     1955, the cost of this program has nearly doubled. One-fourth \n     of farming in America is responsible for 85 percent of the \n     farm surplus. Three-fourths of farming is out on the free \n     market and has known a 21 percent increase in the per capita \n     consumption of all its produce. You see, that one-fourth of \n     farming--that's regulated and controlled by the federal \n     government. In the last three years we've spent 43 dollars in \n     the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we \n     don't grow.\n       Senator Humphrey last week charged that Barry Goldwater, as \n     President, would seek to eliminate farmers. He should do his \n     homework a little better, because he'll find out that we've \n     had a decline of 5 million in the farm population under these \n     government programs. He'll also find that the Democratic \n     administration has sought to get from Congress [an] extension \n     of the farm program to include that three-fourths that is now \n     free. He'll find that they've also asked for the right to \n     imprison farmers who wouldn't keep books as prescribed by the \n     federal government. The Secretary of Agriculture asked for \n     the right to seize farms through condemnation and resell them \n     to other individuals. And contained in that same program was \n     a provision that would have allowed the federal government to \n     remove 2 million farmers from the soil.\n       At the same time, there's been an increase in the \n     Department of Agriculture employees. There's now one for \n     every 30 farms in the United States, and still they can't \n     tell us how 66 shiploads of grain headed for Austria \n     disappeared without a trace and Billie Sol Estes never left \n     shore.\n       Every responsible farmer and farm organization has \n     repeatedly asked the government to free the farm economy, but \n     how--who are farmers to know what's best for them? The wheat \n     farmers voted against a wheat program. The government passed \n     it anyway. Now the price of bread goes up; the price of wheat \n     to the farmer goes down.\n       Meanwhile, back in the city, under urban renewal the \n     assault on freedom carries on. Private property rights [are] \n     so diluted that public interest is almost anything a few \n     government planners decide it should be. In a program that \n     takes from the needy and gives to the greedy, we see such \n     spectacles as in Cleveland, Ohio, a million-and-a-half-dollar \n     building completed only three years ago must be destroyed to \n     make way for what government officials call a ``more \n     compatible use of the land.'' The President tells us he's now \n     going to start building public housing units in the \n     thousands, where heretofore we've only built them in the \n     hundreds. But FHA [Federal Housing Authority] and the \n     Veterans Administration tell us they have 120,000 housing \n     units they've taken back through mortgage foreclosure. For \n     three decades, we've sought to solve the problems of \n     unemployment through government planning, and the more the \n     plans fail, the more the planners plan. The latest is the \n     Area Redevelopment Agency.\n       They've just declared Rice County, Kansas, a depressed \n     area. Rice County, Kansas, has two hundred oil wells, and the \n     14,000 people there have over 30 million dollars on deposit \n     in personal savings in their banks. And when the government \n     tells you you're depressed, lie down and be depressed.\n       We have so many people who can't see a fat man standing \n     beside a thin one without coming to the conclusion the fat \n     man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one. So \n     they're going to solve all the problems of human misery \n     through government and government planning. Well, now, if \n     government planning and welfare had the answer--and they've \n     had almost 30 years of it--shouldn't we expect government to \n     read the score to us once in a while? Shouldn't they be \n     telling us about the decline each year in the number of \n     people needing help? The reduction in the need for public \n     housing?\n       But the reverse is true. Each year the need grows greater; \n     the program grows greater. We were told four years ago that \n     17 million people went to bed hungry each night. Well that \n     was probably true. They were all on a diet. But now we're \n     told that 9.3 million families in this country are poverty-\n     stricken on the basis of earning less than 3,000 dollars a \n     year. Welfare spending [is] 10 times greater than in the dark \n     depths of the Depression. We're spending 45 billion dollars \n     on welfare. Now do a little arithmetic, and you'll find that \n     if we divided the 45 billion dollars up equally among those 9 \n     million poor families, we'd be able to give each family 4,600 \n     dollars a year. And this added to their present income should \n     eliminate poverty. Direct aid to the poor, however, is only \n     running only about 600 dollars per family. It would seem that \n     someplace there must be some overhead.\n       Now--so now we declare ``war on poverty,'' or ``You, too, \n     can be a Bobby Baker.'' Now do they honestly expect us to \n     believe that if we add 1 billion dollars to the 45 billion \n     we're spending, one more program to the 30-odd we have--and \n     remember, this new program doesn't replace any, it just \n     duplicates existing programs--do they believe that poverty is \n     suddenly going to disappear by magic? Well, in all fairness I \n     should explain there is one part of the new program that \n     isn't duplicated. This is the youth feature. We're now going \n     to solve the dropout problem, juvenile delinquency, by \n     reinstituting something like the old CCC camps (Civilian \n     Conservation Corps), and we're going to put our young people \n     in these camps. But again we do some arithmetic, and we find \n     that we're going to spend each year just on room and board \n     for each young person we help 4,700 dollars a year. We can \n     send them to Harvard for 2,700! Course, don't get me wrong. \n     I'm not suggesting Harvard is the answer to juvenile \n     delinquency.\n       But seriously, what are we doing to those we seek to help? \n     Not too long ago, a judge called me here in Los Angeles. He \n     told me of a young woman who'd come before him for a divorce. \n     She had six children, was pregnant with her seventh. Under \n     his questioning, she revealed her husband was a laborer \n     earning 250 dollars a month. She wanted a divorce to get an \n     80 dollar raise. She's eligible for 330 dollars a month in \n     the Aid to Dependent Children Program. She got the idea from \n     two women in her neighborhood who'd already done that very \n     thing.\n       Yet anytime you and I question the schemes of the do-\n     gooders, we're denounced as being against their humanitarian \n     goals. They say we're always ``against'' things--we're never \n     ``for'' anything.\n       Well, the trouble with our liberal friends is not that \n     they're ignorant; it's just that they know so much that isn't \n     so.\n       Now--we're for a provision that destitution should not \n     follow unemployment by reason of old age, and to that end \n     we've accepted Social Security as a step toward meeting the \n     problem.\n       But we're against those entrusted with this program when \n     they practice deception regarding its fiscal shortcomings, \n     when they charge that any criticism of the program means that \n     we want to end payments to those people who depend on them \n     for a livelihood. They've called it ``insurance'' to us in a \n     hundred million pieces of literature. But then they appeared \n     before the Supreme Court and they testified it was a welfare \n     program. They only use the term ``insurance'' to sell it to \n     the people. And they said Social Security dues are a tax for \n     the general use of the government, and the government has \n     used that tax. There is no fund, because Robert Byers, the \n     actuarial head, appeared before a congressional committee and \n     admitted that Social Security as of this moment is 298 \n     billion dollars in the hole. But he said there should be no \n     cause for worry because as long as they have the power to \n     tax, they could always take away from the people whatever \n     they needed to bail them out of trouble. And they're doing \n     just that.\n       A young man, 21 years of age, working at an average \n     salary--his Social Security contribution would, in the open \n     market, buy him an insurance policy that would guarantee 220 \n     dollars a month at age 65. The government promises 127. He \n     could live it up until he's 31 and then take out a policy \n     that would pay more than Social Security. Now are we so \n     lacking in business sense that we can't put this program on a \n     sound basis, so that people who do require those payments \n     will find they can get them when they're due--that the \n     cupboard isn't bare?\n       Barry Goldwater thinks we can.\n       At the same time, can't we introduce voluntary features \n     that would permit a citizen who can do better on his own to \n     be excused upon presentation of evidence that he had made \n     provision for the non-earning years? Should we not allow a \n     widow with children to work, and not lose the benefits \n     supposedly paid for by her deceased husband? Shouldn't you \n     and I be allowed to declare who our beneficiaries will be \n     under this program, which we cannot do? I think we're for \n     telling our senior citizens that no one in this country \n     should be denied medical care because of a lack of funds. But \n     I think we're against forcing all citizens, regardless of \n     need, into a compulsory government program, especially when \n     we have such examples, as was announced last week, when \n     France admitted that their Medicare program is now bankrupt. \n     They've come to the end of the road.\n       In addition, was Barry Goldwater so irresponsible when he \n     suggested that our government give up its program of \n     deliberate, planned inflation, so that when you do get\n\n[[Page S516]]\n\n     your Social Security pension, a dollar will buy a dollar's \n     worth, and not 45 cents worth?\n       I think we're for an international organization, where the \n     nations of the world can seek peace. But I think we're \n     against subordinating American interests to an organization \n     that has become so structurally unsound that today you can \n     muster a two-thirds vote on the floor of the General Assembly \n     among nations that represent less than 10 percent of the \n     world's population. I think we're against the hypocrisy of \n     assailing our allies because here and there they cling to a \n     colony, while we engage in a conspiracy of silence and never \n     open our mouths about the millions of people enslaved in the \n     Soviet colonies in the satellite nations.\n       I think we're for aiding our allies by sharing of our \n     material blessings with those nations which share in our \n     fundamental beliefs, but we're against doling out money \n     government to government, creating bureaucracy, if not \n     socialism, all over the world. We set out to help 19 \n     countries. We're helping 107. We've spent 146 billion \n     dollars. With that money, we bought a 2 million dollar yacht \n     for Haile Selassie. We bought dress suits for Greek \n     undertakers, extra wives for Kenya[n] government officials. \n     We bought a thousand TV sets for a place where they have no \n     electricity. In the last six years, 52 nations have bought 7 \n     billion dollars worth of our gold, and all 52 are receiving \n     foreign aid from this country.\n       No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. So \n     governments' programs, once launched, never disappear.\n       Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to \n     eternal life we'll ever see on this earth.\n       Federal employees--federal employees number two and a half \n     million; and federal, state, and local, one out of six of the \n     nation's work force employed by government. These \n     proliferating bureaus with their thousands of regulations \n     have cost us many of our constitutional safeguards. How many \n     of us realize that today federal agents can invade a man's \n     property without a warrant? They can impose a fine without a \n     formal hearing, let alone a trial by jury? And they can seize \n     and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of \n     that fine. In Chico County, Arkansas, James Wier over-planted \n     his rice allotment. The government obtained a 17,000 dollar \n     judgment. And a U.S. marshal sold his 960-acre farm at \n     auction. The government said it was necessary as a warning to \n     others to make the system work.\n       Last February 19th at the University of Minnesota, Norman \n     Thomas, six-times candidate for President on the Socialist \n     Party ticket, said, ``If Barry Goldwater became President, he \n     would stop the advance of socialism in the United States.'' I \n     think that's exactly what he will do.\n       But as a former Democrat, I can tell you Norman Thomas \n     isn't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism \n     with the present administration, because back in 1936, Mr. \n     Democrat himself, Al Smith, the great American, came before \n     the American people and charged that the leadership of his \n     Party was taking the Party of Jefferson, Jackson, and \n     Cleveland down the road under the banners of Marx, Lenin, and \n     Stalin. And he walked away from his Party, and he never \n     returned til the day he died--because to this day, the \n     leadership of that Party has been taking that Party, that \n     honorable Party, down the road in the image of the labor \n     Socialist Party of England.\n       Now it doesn't require expropriation or confiscation of \n     private property or business to impose socialism on a people. \n     What does it mean whether you hold the deed to the--or the \n     title to your business or property if the government holds \n     the power of life and death over that business or property? \n     And such machinery already exists. The government can find \n     some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to \n     prosecute. Every businessman has his own tale of harassment. \n     Somewhere a perversion has taken place. Our natural, \n     unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of \n     government, and freedom has never been so fragile, so close \n     to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment.\n       Our Democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these \n     issues. They want to make you and I believe that this is a \n     contest between two men--that we're to choose just between \n     two personalities.\n       Well what of this man that they would destroy--and in \n     destroying, they would destroy that which he represents, the \n     ideas that you and I hold dear? Is he the brash and shallow \n     and trigger-happy man they say he is? Well I've been \n     privileged to know him ``when.'' I knew him long before he \n     ever dreamed of trying for high office, and I can tell you \n     personally I've never known a man in my life I believed so \n     incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable thing.\n       This is a man who, in his own business before he entered \n     politics, instituted a profit-sharing plan before unions had \n     ever thought of it. He put in health and medical insurance \n     for all his employees. He took 50 percent of the profits \n     before taxes and set up a retirement program, a pension plan \n     for all his employees. He sent monthly checks for life to an \n     employee who was ill and couldn't work. He provides nursing \n     care for the children of mothers who work in the stores. When \n     Mexico was ravaged by the floods in the Rio Grande, he \n     climbed in his airplane and flew medicine and supplies down \n     there.\n       An ex-GI told me how he met him. It was the week before \n     Christmas during the Korean War, and he was at the Los \n     Angeles airport trying to get a ride home to Arizona \n     for Christmas. And he said that [there were] a lot of \n     servicemen there and no seats available on the planes. And \n     then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said, ``Any men \n     in uniform wanting a ride to Arizona, go to runway such-\n     and-such,'' and they went down there, and there was a \n     fellow named Barry Goldwater sitting in his plane. Every \n     day in those weeks before Christmas, all day long, he'd \n     load up the plane, fly it to Arizona, fly them to their \n     homes, fly back over to get another load.\n       During the hectic split-second timing of a campaign, this \n     is a man who took time out to sit beside an old friend who \n     was dying of cancer. His campaign managers were \n     understandably impatient, but he said, ``There aren't many \n     left who care what happens to her. I'd like her to know I \n     care.'' This is a man who said to his 19-year-old son, \n     ``There is no foundation like the rock of honesty and \n     fairness, and when you begin to build your life on that rock, \n     with the cement of the faith in God that you have, then you \n     have a real start.'' This is not a man who could carelessly \n     send other people's sons to war. And that is the issue of \n     this campaign that makes all the other problems I've \n     discussed academic, unless we realize we're in a war that \n     must be won.\n       Those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of \n     the welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution \n     of peace without victory. They call their policy \n     ``accommodation.'' And they say if we'll only avoid any \n     direct confrontation with the enemy, he'll forget his evil \n     ways and learn to love us. All who oppose them are indicted \n     as warmongers. They say we offer simple answers to complex \n     problems. Well, perhaps there is a simple answer--not an easy \n     answer--but simple: If you and I have the courage to tell our \n     elected officials that we want our national policy based on \n     what we know in our hearts is morally right.\n       We cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of \n     the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a \n     billion human beings now enslaved behind the Iron Curtain, \n     ``Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own \n     skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave \n     masters.'' Alexander Hamilton said, ``A nation which can \n     prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and \n     deserves one.'' Now let's set the record straight. There's no \n     argument over the choice between peace and war, but there's \n     only one guaranteed way you can have peace--and you can have \n     it in the next second--surrender.\n       Admittedly, there's a risk in any course we follow other \n     than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the \n     greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our \n     well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face--that their \n     policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no \n     choice between peace and war, only between fight or \n     surrender. If we continue to accommodate, continue to back \n     and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand--the \n     ultimatum. And what then--when Nikita Khrushchev has told his \n     people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them \n     that we're retreating under the pressure of the Cold War, and \n     someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, \n     our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will \n     have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and \n     economically. He believes this because from our side he's \n     heard voices pleading for ``peace at any price'' or ``better \n     Red than dead,'' or as one commentator put it, he'd rather \n     ``live on his knees than die on his feet.'' And therein lies \n     the road to war, because those voices don't speak for the \n     rest of us.\n       You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and \n     peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and \n     slavery. If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this \n     begin--just in the face of this enemy? Or should Moses have \n     told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the \n     pharaohs? Should Christ have refused the cross? Should the \n     patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and \n     refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world? The martyrs \n     of history were not fools, and our honored dead who gave \n     their lives to stop the advance of the Nazis didn't die in \n     vain. Where, then, is the road to peace? Well it's a simple \n     answer after all.\n       You and I have the courage to say to our enemies, ``There \n     is a price we will not pay.'' ``There is a point beyond which \n     they must not advance.'' And this--this is the meaning in the \n     phrase of Barry Goldwater's ``peace through strength.'' \n     Winston Churchill said, ``The destiny of man is not measured \n     by material computations. When great forces are on the move \n     in the world, we learn we're spirits--not animals.'' And he \n     said, ``There's something going on in time and space, and \n     beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, \n     spells duty.''\n       You and I have a rendezvous with destiny.\n       We'll preserve for our children this, the last best hope of \n     man on earth, or we'll sentence them to take the last step \n     into a thousand years of darkness.\n       We will keep in mind and remember that Barry Goldwater has \n     faith in us. He has faith that you and I have the ability and \n     the dignity and the right to make our own decisions and \n     determine our own destiny.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record as well \nremarks I made in Orange County, CA,\n\n[[Page S517]]\n\non October 28, 1994, on the 30th anniversary of the speech ``A Time for \nChoosing.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              30th Anniversary of Ronald Reagan Revolution\n\n                  (By Lamar Alexander, Oct. 28, 1994)\n\n       I don't think Ronald Reagan would mind if before we get \n     down to business, I told you one Minnie Pearl story. They are \n     pretty good friends. Most people who have run for governor of \n     Tennessee in the past 30-40 years have done so in order to \n     live next door to Minnie Pearl. Her house is next door to the \n     governor's mansion. And, you learn very quickly living next \n     door to Minnie that you don't try to tell a better story than \n     she can; because, she'll one up you.\n       I was telling her after I left office about how people \n     would look at me, but they could not remember why they knew \n     they had seen me before. One man up in the mountains walked \n     up and stared me in the face and said, ``Ain't you \n     Alexander?'' I said, ``Yes, sir.'' He stared a while longer \n     and said, ``Well, you sure don't favor yourself.''\n       Minnie said, ``Well, let me tell you what happened to me. . \n     . . I was in the elevator in Opryland Hotel, minding my own \n     business, and this tourist from California gets on and looks \n     me up and down and says, `I'll bet a lot of people tell you \n     that you look like Minnie Pearl.' '' She said, ``and I said \n     very sweetly, `Yes, sir, they do,' and, he looked me down a \n     while longer and said, `And, I'll bet it makes you mad, don't \n     it?' ''\n       It was reported that several Goldwater aides warned against \n     letting Ronald Reagan make a speech this summer. He'll be \n     inflammatory, they said. Sen. Goldwater intervened and made \n     sure he didn't. And, Ronald Reagan didn't disappoint those \n     aides. He began in this way, ``I am going to speak of \n     controversial things and I make no apologies for this.'' The \n     speech that we saw has made a landmark. It defines the things \n     we Americans value most, our freedom. And, what most menaced \n     that freedom, communists abroad and big government at home. \n     It became a call to arms for conservatives, a rallying point, \n     a promise of hope for the future.\n       We are here tonight less than two weeks before another \n     election, one that has taken on all the characteristics of a \n     presidential election. It's become a referendum on the \n     direction of our country. I would like to talk tonight for a \n     few minutes about what the speech, ``A Time for Choosing,'' \n     has meant to America during the last thirty years and what \n     lessons we might learn for the next thirty.\n       If I had to put it in one sentence, what we have learned \n     from the last thirty, that the principle threat to freedom \n     abroad has been defeated and the principle of threat at home \n     has gotten more menacing. The evil empire in the Kremlin has \n     collapsed but the government in Washington has become an \n     arrogant empire; spreading its tentacles into our everyday \n     lives.\n       I was a student at New York University on October 27, 1964. \n     And, to tell you the truth, I wasn't paying much attention to \n     politics. So, I was struck when I read what we just saw, what \n     Ronald Reagan said about the 1964 campaign. He said, ``This \n     is the issue of the election whether we believe in our \n     capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the \n     American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual \n     elite in a far distant Capitol can plan our lives better than \n     we can plan our lives ourselves.''\n       Replace the words ``little intellectual elite'' with an \n     arrogant empire and you have the issue of this election, the \n     one in 10 days, as well. In 1964, Ronald Reagan's talk of \n     peace overseas could have just as easily applied to the \n     dangers of the approaching encroachments of Washington, DC, \n     into our everyday lives at home. He said it. ``Every lesson \n     of history teaches us that the greater risk lies in people. \n     There is a price we will not pay. There is a point beyond \n     which our enemies must not advance. You and I have a \n     rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for our children \n     this, the last best hope of man on earth that we will \n     sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of \n     darkness.''\n       Those were dramatic words, but these are dramatic events \n     with dramatic consequences. Sometimes we forget just how \n     unproven Ronald Reagan's thinking generally was. Even after \n     he was president. At Westminster, he predicted that the \n     Soviet Union would wind up in the ash heap of history. No \n     other world leader would say anything like that.\n       I remember one Sunday in 1984, when I was sitting in a \n     church in Amsterdam, our family had just left Anne Frank's \n     house and were remembering the stories how on another Sunday \n     morning the German tanks had unexpectedly arrived in 1940. \n     I was listening to the minister in that church in \n     Amsterdam denounce the cold war policies, as he said, of \n     Reagan and Begin and Hitler.\n       In 1987, when Pres. Reagan was preparing for his speech at \n     the Brandenburg gate, some nervous aides wanted to eliminate \n     the phrase, ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.'' They were \n     afraid it was so unlikely that it would seem un-presidential. \n     Pres. Reagan told Martin Anderson, not long ago, that, ``When \n     I called them the evil empire I did it on purpose. I wanted \n     them to know that we saw them for what they were.''\n       The evil empires collapsed; the Berlin Wall has come down. \n     And we should never forget that Germany would not be united, \n     that we and the Russians would not be dismantling weapons of \n     mass destruction, that Arafat and Rapine would not have \n     shaken hands, if the Cold War hadn't ended, and the Cold War \n     would not have ended unless President Reagan had persisted in \n     that bold and unfashionable thinking that he outlined in his \n     speech in 1964.\n       Unfortunately, the second great menace that Ronald Reagan \n     pointed to in 1964 is if anything more menacing. He said in \n     '64, ``Our government continues to spend $17 million a day \n     more than our government takes in.'' 30 years later our \n     government spends $643 million a day more than our government \n     takes in. Ronald Reagan said in 1964, we haven't balanced our \n     budget for 28 out of the last 34 years. Well, that is still \n     true today, except it is 57 out of the last 64.\n       But we don't need statistics to prove that, we see that in \n     our everyday lives. I saw it this summer. Between the 4th of \n     July and Labor Day when I did something many Americans do, I \n     drove across the country. I came to Orange County on that \n     drive. I spent many of the nights on that drive with families \n     I had never met before; eating supper; staying up late \n     talking.\n       Driving across America, there are several ways to take the \n     temperature of the country. Bumper stickers, for example. One \n     of them on Interstate 10 in Louisiana said, ``Make welfare as \n     hard to get as a building permit.'' Another one, in Florida \n     said, ``I love my country but I fear my government!' But, as \n     I drove along, I found a better way to take the temperature \n     of the country. And that was by asking a question of the \n     families with whom I stayed, and tonight I would like to ask \n     you to ask yourselves that question, and it is this: \n     ``Looking ahead 30 years, do you believe your children and \n     your grandchildren will have more opportunities growing up in \n     this country than you have had?''\n       When I asked that question this summer, I got a lot of long \n     pauses and most people were afraid to say yes. This \n     ambivalence about our future, if it is allowed to persist, \n     will destroy what is special about this country. Namely, our \n     almost irrational belief in the unlimited future of America \n     and that every one of us, no matter where we come from, no \n     matter what our station in life is, has a chance to have a \n     piece of that future. On my drive, I was reminded that we \n     Americans know exactly what is causing that loss of optimism. \n     It is, first, the government in Washington, and it is, \n     second, our drift away from standards and principles and \n     values that have made this such a remarkable country in the \n     first place.\n       This is not something that I just heard at Republicans \n     dinners. Father Jerry Hill, for example, runs a homeless \n     shelter in Dallas, Texas. He won't take a federal grant \n     anymore because he has grown tired of filling out forms all \n     day Friday to justify what he has done Monday through \n     Thursday. He says federal grants have made a nation of liars \n     of us; applying for money that we don't need to spend for \n     things we do need. And he is absolutely outraged that the \n     government in Washington is paying $446 a month in Social \n     Security disability benefits to drug addicts. He says, ``I \n     can't help it when they have that kind of support for their \n     addiction.''\n       Whether it is a school board member, whether it is a small \n     business man or woman, a teacher, a hospital director, a \n     housing project director, a former Cherokee Indian Chief--I \n     have visited them all and they have had it up to here. They \n     have had it up to here, and they can hardly say in civil \n     terms how much they resent, not just the meddling, but the \n     arrogance of the government in Washington, DC.\n       Let me give you an example close to home. Many of you are \n     candidates for the school boards of Orange County. I salute \n     you. I cannot think of anything more important, but, let me \n     ask you this in very blunt terms: Do you really believe that \n     you are too stupid to set the weapons policy for the schools \n     of Orange County? Well, your United States Senator does and \n     most of the Congress agrees with her.\n       In fact, the entire Congress passed a thousand-page \n     education bill that takes a great many decisions from you, if \n     you should be elected: The decision about what to say in a \n     parent/teacher conference. The decision about how much \n     school choice could be granted to parents. A definition of \n     what a family is. The decision about whether text books \n     should be replaced with new textbooks that focus on gender \n     equity as defined by the new Assistant Secretary of \n     Education. That all passed in the last week of this \n     session of this Congress. Congress decided all of it and \n     established in addition a sort of national school board, \n     and they are not even embarrassed about it.\n       President Clinton and Senator Feinstein held a press \n     conference here in California to say, in effect, that they \n     were proud of the fact that they had taken away the freedom \n     of a thousand California school boards to assign a weapons \n     policy for 7,100 schools and more than 5 million children. \n     Senator Kennedy and President Clinton held a press conference \n     of their own in Massachusetts. And for what? To pat \n     themselves on the back for taking away your freedoms to make \n     decisions in your own neighborhoods in your own schools about \n     how to educate your own children.\n       Here is the most powerful lesson of ``A Time for Choosing'' \n     in the last 30 years. With the evil empire, President Reagan \n     did exactly what a president ought to do. He solved\n\n[[Page S518]]\n\n     the menace to freedom. He put aside less important issues. He \n     developed a strategy. He persuaded at least half the people \n     he was right. He persisted. He threw himself unfashionably \n     into it until he wore everyone else out, and then he \n     succeeded.\n       Now we must do the same at home. We should train our sights \n     on the arrogant empire in Washington, DC. That is the issue \n     of this election, and it will be issue of 1996 as well.\n       In 1992, Bill Clinton had a wonderful opportunity. This \n     country was ready for a new generation of leadership; it \n     wanted to look outside Washington for its answers. President \n     Clinton gave us five minutes of hope and then proceeded to \n     lead us in exactly the wrong direction. Washington taxes, \n     Washington healthcare, a national school board, reinventing \n     everything in Washington, DC. He has help in 2 years to \n     create an even more arrogant empire. Which is why in \n     California, and why in this country, we will be having a \n     Republican sweep in 10 days.\n       Whether that dream comes, something else will have been \n     created which is an opportunity a mile wide for the \n     Republican Party. Because the voters will then turn around to \n     us and say, ``Well, what are you guys for?'' And we should \n     not kid ourselves. The voters are not going to be expecting \n     too much from us because our Republican agenda has either \n     been non-existent, or too tempered, so much so that it sounds \n     like usually that about all we can do is be against what the \n     Democrats are for.\n       So let us remember Ronald Reagan's example and his boldness \n     and train our sights on the menace of freedom at home in the \n     same way he trained his sights on the mask of freedom abroad. \n     For example, instead of congressional reform at the margins, \n     I say we should cut their pay and send them home. I mean by \n     that that the United States Congress should spend six months \n     in Washington; six months at home and have half as much pay. \n     Let them take a real job, live alongside the rest of us. If \n     you want a Congress of citizens who's more responsive to you \n     than to the lobbyist in Washington, this is the way to do it. \n     The eleven states with the lowest taxes have a legislature \n     that is limited to meeting for 90 days. That would be one \n     thing.\n       Instead of reforming welfare in Washington, DC; let's end \n     welfare in Washington, DC. Send them home and send the tax \n     base with them back to the states. Send most of elementary \n     and secondary education and jobs-related there as well. Send \n     some of the departments and agencies, too. No more \n     entitlements, period. Not one more law that imposes an \n     unfunded mandate on a state government or a federal \n     government. Term limits; balanced budget; line-item veto; a \n     wholesale review of the federal rule making authority and an \n     education bill that would free local schools from Washington \n     control; privatize all public housing. All of this will \n     increase our freedoms at home by preventing someone in \n     Washington, DC, from making those decisions for us.\n       An agenda like this will catch plenty of flak. Remember \n     Reagan and Begin and Hitler. Already the Washington \n     establishment has said it can't imagine a dumber idea than a \n     citizen Congress. I cannot count the number of nights that I \n     have been in editorial board meetings and been accused of \n     trying to destroy public schools because I suggested that at \n     least poor children ought to have more of the same choices of \n     the best schools--the ones that the members of the editorial \n     board send their children to.\n       Approved thinking is not always right thinking. We'll be \n     accused of turning and taking America back to the dark ages. \n     We have already been accused by the Democrats in this \n     election of going as far back as the days of Ronald Reagan. \n     If that is an issue on Election Day, I think I know how the \n     referendum will come out. But, eventually, we will be seen \n     for what we are. Painters of a picture of America's future \n     based on freedom and opportunity.\n       I have this prediction to make. The arrogant empire at home \n     will also be consigned to the ash heap. It will for a while \n     be unfashionable to say this and it will seem overly dramatic \n     to suggest that calling a halt to this ``too big for its \n     britches'' government in Washington, DC, is a rendezvous with \n     destiny for this generation but I believe that it is so. And, \n     just as the collapse of the Soviet Union didn't solve all of \n     our problems abroad--in fact it created a much more uncertain \n     and unstable world that we have yet to learn how to grapple \n     with--the devolution of responsibility from Washington, DC, \n     to families, to churches, neighborhoods and schools will put \n     plenty of problems in your hands; the problems that trouble \n     us the most every day. But that is where the responsibility \n     ought to be.\n       I was reminded every day, on that drive across America, \n     that we know exactly what to do in this country to put our \n     nation back on track. We will have to do it community by \n     community; family by family; school board by school board. In \n     Murfreesboro, TN, families now have choices of schools 12 \n     hours a day; all day, every year at no extra cost to the \n     taxpayer. Reuben Greenberg, the police chief of Charleston, \n     SC, has made even the housing projects as safe as any part of \n     Charleston now that the government lets him kick criminals \n     out of the housing projects. Reverend Henry Delaney has \n     cleaned up the crack houses on 32nd street in Savannah and he \n     knows what to do about welfare if someone in Washington will \n     stop reinventing it long enough to ask him. And, Dan \n     Biederman is taking whole blocks of New York City and with a \n     private company making those blocks safe and clean and free \n     from homeless. My own answer to the question, ``Looking ahead \n     30 years, do you believe your children and grandchildren will \n     have more opportunity growing up in this country than you \n     have had?'' is absolutely yes, because I am going to do \n     everything in my power to see that they do, because that was \n     done for me.\n       When I was appointed Secretary of Education, the New York \n     Times felt obligated to write that, Mr. Alexander grew up in \n     a lower-middle class family in the mountains of Eastern \n     Tennessee. That was alright with me, but not, I discovered, \n     when I called home the next week, alright with my mother, who \n     was literally reading Thessalonians to gain strength for how \n     to deal with this slur on the family. ``We never thought of \n     ourselves that way,'' she said. ``You had a library card from \n     the day you were three and music lessons from the day you \n     were four; you had everything you needed that was \n     important.''\n       And, I also had a grandfather who ran away from home when \n     he was eight; somehow got to Oklahoma and became a railroad \n     engineer and finally retired back to the mountains just in \n     time to instruct us growing up in Maryville, ``Aim for the \n     top there's more room there.'' So we grew up thinking we \n     could be the railroad engineer, or the English teacher, or \n     the school board member, or the principal or the governor or \n     even the President of the United States.\n       If some president had come on the radio offering me and my \n     friends growing up a government credit card with benefits for \n     the rest of my life, my grandfather would have thrown his \n     boot through the radio because that was not his idea of \n     America's future. When I was 5 years old, I visited my \n     grandfather who was then a switch engineer in Newton, Kansas, \n     a division point of the Santa Fe Railway. His job was to push \n     and pull those huge belching steam engines into the round \n     house put them on the turntable, turn them around and head \n     them in the right direction.\n       Our country today is like one of those steam engines. It is \n     headed in exactly the wrong direction, and in the election 10 \n     days from now, we have to slow it down and get it on the \n     turntable and turn it around and, at least by 1996, get it \n     headed in the right direction. That is the challenge for our \n     party and for our country.\n       I couldn't conclude this evening without acknowledging the \n     magic of Ronald Reagan. The storyteller in this case was at \n     least as important as the story. The speech would have just \n     been a speech in anyone else's hands. He made sure he had his \n     feet planted firmly on the ground before he entered public \n     life and he kept them there. He knew and we knew where he \n     stood. He assumed no false importance.\n       He seemed to know his job was not to change everyone's mind \n     but to speak the mind of the voters, of the citizens, and not \n     be swayed by elites who told ordinary people they were too \n     stupid to know what to do. He was firm and civil and eloquent \n     and optimistic in his presidency. He appealed to the best of \n     us. He knew and knows the value of a good story. And he knew, \n     as President, that with the right purpose in that office, if \n     he threw everything he had into it, he could wear everybody \n     else out. That is how he helped to defeat the evil empire \n     that threatened freedom in his generation and that is how in \n     this generation that we, standing on Ronald Reagan's \n     shoulders, can finish his work and expand our freedoms by \n     dismantling the arrogant empire at home.\n       Thank you.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord remarks I made in tribute to President Reagan in June of 2004.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Senate Floor Remarks of Sen. Lamar Alexander--Tribute to Former \n                        President Ronald Reagan\n\n                             (June 7, 2004)\n\n       Mr. President, a few years ago when Ronald Reagan was \n     President of the United States, he attended one of the many \n     press dinners which are held. I think it was the Gridiron \n     Dinner. I think it is well known that maybe 90 percent of the \n     press corps in Washington had a different point of view on \n     issues than Pres. Reagan did, but they liked him anyway, and \n     they respected him and he had fun with them, just as they did \n     with him.\n       I remember on that evening he strode into the Gridiron \n     Dinner looking like a million dollars, smiling big. The press \n     rose, smiling back, applauding. Pres. Reagan stood in front \n     of them until it subsided, and then he said to his \n     adversaries in the media, ``Thank you very much--I know how \n     hard it is to clap with your fingers crossed.'' And they \n     laughed, and they had a wonderful time with Pres. Reagan.\n       The first thing we think about, those of us who had any \n     opportunity to get to know him--a great many of us--was that \n     Ronald Reagan was a very friendly man. He was a congenial \n     person, an easy person to know, the kind of person you want \n     to spend a lot of time with, if you had the opportunity, and \n     that what you saw in private was what everyone else saw in \n     public.\n       Howard Baker, the former majority leader of the Senate when \n     Ronald Reagan was president, got to know him especially well. \n     And\n\n[[Page S519]]\n\n     then in 1987, Pres. Reagan invited former Sen. Baker to come \n     to be his chief of staff, which he was for nearly two years.\n       I remember Sen. Baker telling me that, to his surprise, \n     when his 9 a.m. meetings came every morning with Pres. \n     Reagan, he discovered that Mr. Reagan had a funny little \n     story to tell to Sen. Baker, his chief of staff. What \n     surprised Sen. Baker even more was Pres. Reagan expected Sen. \n     Baker to have a funny little story to tell back. So for that \n     two years, virtually every morning at 9 a.m., when the \n     president of the United States and the chief of staff of the \n     White House met, they swapped funny little stories. It is \n     very reassuring to me that two men who have maybe the two \n     biggest jobs in the world were comfortable enough with \n     themselves, each other, and their responsibilities to begin \n     the day in that sort of easy way. That is the part of Ronald \n     Reagan we think more about.\n       Another part of Ronald Reagan which I think is often \n     overlooked is that he was a man of big ideas. I would say \n     intellectual, although I guess there is a little difference \n     between being devoted to ideals and being intellectual but \n     not much difference.\n       Unlike most people who are candidates for president of the \n     United States, Ronald Reagan wrote many of his own speeches. \n     When he had a few minutes, he would sit in the back of a \n     campaign airplane and make notes on cards in the shorthand \n     that he had. His former aide, Marty Anderson, has written a \n     book about that and told that, to a great extent, Ronald \n     Reagan's words were his own words, ideas he expressed or \n     ideas he gathered himself and ideas he had thought through \n     and wanted to promulgate.\n       Maybe that is partly why he seemed so comfortable with \n     himself when he finally entered public life. He came to it \n     late in life. He was age 55 when he became governor of \n     California, so by then he knew what he thought, and he had a \n     sense of purpose, and he knew what he wanted to do.\n       I got an idea of that kind of big thinking when I went to \n     see Pres. Reagan in my third year as governor, his first year \n     as president in 1981. I talked to him about a big swap which \n     I thought would help our country.\n       I suggested, the Federal Government take over all of \n     Medicaid and let the State and local governments take over \n     all responsibility for kindergarten through 12th grade. That \n     would make it clear, I said, where the responsibility lies. \n     You cannot fix schools from Washington, and it would make \n     more efficient our health care system if we did things that \n     way. He liked the idea. It fit his unconventional brand of \n     thinking. He advocated it. It was a little too revolutionary \n     for most people in Washington in the early 1980s.\n       He had the same sort of unconventional attitude toward \n     national defense policy. Many people overlooked the fact that \n     Ronald Reagan did not just want us to have as many nuclear \n     weapons as the Soviet empire did; he wanted to get rid of \n     nuclear weapons. He saw them as wrong, as bad, and he wanted \n     a world without nuclear weapons. Instead of mutual assured \n     destruction, which was the doctrine at the time, he built up \n     our strength so we could begin to reduce nuclear weapons and \n     then unilaterally begin to do it before the Soviets did, \n     hoping they would then follow. We can see the results.\n       At the time, some people said Ronald Reagan was naive to \n     think we could transfer power from Washington, from an \n     arrogant empire at home or naive to think we could face down \n     an evil empire abroad. And especially naive to think our \n     policy should be based upon getting rid of nuclear weapons. \n     It turned out Ronald Reagan saw further than most of those \n     critics did.\n       Perhaps his most famous speech, not my favorite speech--my \n     favorite speech is the one we heard a lot about this weekend, \n     20 years ago at Normandy, which moved the whole world to \n     tears and reminded Americans why we are Americans and what we \n     fought for--but his most famous speech may be the one in 1987 \n     at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin where he said, ``Mr. \n     Gorbachev, tear down this wall.''\n       Earlier this year, I visited Berlin with John Kornblum who \n     at the time was U.S. minister and deputy commandant in the \n     American sector of West Berlin where tanks challenged tanks \n     and white crosses marked grave sites of those who were killed \n     trying to escape over the wall from East Berlin. Mr. Kornblum \n     talked about the development of that speech that Ronald \n     Reagan gave that day. Those words, or the thought, ``tear \n     down this wall,'' went into the speech at an early stage. \n     Some fought to keep it in. Many fought to take it out. Those \n     who had thought Ronald Reagan was wrong to say the Soviet \n     Union was an evil empire were not anxious for him to say, \n     ``tear down this wall.''\n       Some suggested that Pres. Reagan try his hand at German as \n     Pres. Kennedy had in a memorable speech at the Berlin Wall in \n     the early 1960s. Some suggested that the speech should not be \n     made at the Brandenburg Gate. That was too provocative, Mr. \n     Kornblum remembers. But the speech was made at the \n     Brandenburg Gate, and Mr. Reagan did keep his words in that \n     speech. He did make his point, and his point was clear, ``Mr. \n     Gorbachev, tear down this wall.''\n       For those of us who had a chance to see the new countries \n     of Eastern Europe and their enthusiasm for freedom and for a \n     free market system, we can see the legacy of Ronald Reagan \n     and his unconventional thinking.\n       I think it is important for us to remember that this genial \n     president was a man of ideas, of all the presidents I have \n     worked with, as much a man of ideas as any one of those \n     presidents.\n       Ronald Reagan also taught us something about leadership. I \n     recall in 1980 when he and Mrs. Reagan visited the Tennessee \n     governor's mansion during the presidential campaign. I had \n     not known him very well. He had served as governor. He was \n     several years older. He was from the west. It was really my \n     first chance to meet him. After one hour or an hour-and-a-\n     half of breakfast with him the next morning, I remember going \n     away thinking this man has a better concept of the presidency \n     than anyone I have ever been privileged to meet.\n       Ronald Reagan understood what George Reedy said in his \n     book, ``The Twilight of the Presidency,'' is the definition \n     of presidential leadership: First, see an urgent need; \n     second, develop a strategy to meet the need; and, third, \n     persuade at least half the people that you are right. Ronald \n     Reagan was as good as anyone at persuading at least half the \n     people that he was right. He taught that and he also taught \n     us the importance of proceeding from principles.\n       Sometimes we are described in Washington these days as \n     being too ideological, too uncompromising, too partisan. \n     Pres. Reagan was a principled man. He operated from \n     principles in all of his decisions, insofar as I knew. He \n     advocated his principles as far as he could take them, but he \n     recognized that the great decisions that we make here are \n     often conflicts between principles on which all of us agree. \n     It might be equal opportunity versus the rule of law. And \n     once we have argued our principle and the solution, and \n     strategy has been taken as far as it could go, if we get, as \n     he said 75, 80, or 85 percent of what we advocated, well, \n     then that is a pretty good job.\n       So, he was very successful because he argued from \n     principles. He argued strenuously. He was good at persuading \n     at least half the people he was right. Then he was willing to \n     accept a conclusion because most of our politics is about the \n     conflict of principles.\n       There is another lesson that he taught us, and that was to \n     respect the military. Now, that seems unnecessary to say in \n     the year 2004 where we have a volunteer military that is \n     better than any military we have ever had in our history; \n     when we have witnessed the thousands of acts of courage, \n     charity, kindness, and ingenuity in Iraq and Afghanistan \n     recently; when the men and women of our National Guard and \n     reserves are also being called up. We have a lot of respect \n     for our military.\n       In 1980, we were showing a lot less respect for the men and \n     women of our military. I remember riding with Pres. Reagan in \n     a car in Knoxville during the 1980 campaign. As we pulled out \n     of the airport by the National Guard unit, there were a \n     number of the soldiers waving at him, understanding and \n     sensing that he respected them. He turned to me and said \n     something like this: I wish we could think of some way to \n     honor these men and women more. He said we used to do that in \n     the movies in the 1930s and 1940s. We would make movies \n     honoring men and women in the military and that is how we \n     showed our respect for them.\n       Well, he did find a way to honor them during his presidency \n     in the 1980s, and by the time he left at the end of that \n     decade, there was no question that the American people \n     remembered to honor the men and women in the military.\n       There is one other aspect of Pres. Reagan's leadership that \n     I would like to mention, which is probably the most important \n     aspect of the American character, and that is the belief that \n     anything is possible. The idea that we uniquely believe in \n     this country, and people all around the world think we are a \n     little odd for believing it, is that no matter where you come \n     from, no matter what race you are, no matter what color your \n     skin, if you come here and work hard, anything is possible.\n       That is why we subscribe to ideals such as all men are \n     created equal, even though we know achieving that goal will \n     always be a work in progress, and we may never reach it. That \n     is why we say we will ``pay any price, bear any burden,'' as \n     Pres. Kennedy said, to defend peace, even though we know that \n     is a work in progress, and we may never reach it.\n       That is why we say more recently we want to leave no child \n     behind when it comes to learning to read. We know that is a \n     work in progress, and we may not reach it, but that is our \n     goal.\n       We Americans say that anything is possible, and nothing \n     symbolizes that more than the American presidency. And no \n     president has symbolized that more in the last century than \n     Ronald Reagan. He has reminded us of what it means to be an \n     American. He lifted our spirits, he made us proud, he \n     strengthened our character, and he taught us a great many \n     lessons.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleagues. I \nappreciate what the Senator from Tennessee had to say about our former \nPresident, as we look upon his 100th birthday coming up this weekend \nand all of us pay tribute to the legacy he gave this country and the \ntremendous contributions he made during his time in office.\n  We all have different remembrances of his Presidency. I was a \nsophomore in college when he was elected to his first term as \nPresident. It was the first election in which I had the opportunity to\n\n[[Page S520]]\n\nvote. I guess I could say I was sort of coming of age at the time he \nwas coming on the national political stage. He had run for President 4 \nyears earlier.\n  I remember, as a young person, beginning to pay a little bit of \nattention to politics, at the time being so impressed with the \nattributes that characterized him personally and were primarily \nresponsible for his tremendous success as President and for the great \nlegacy he left behind.\n  I was someone who grew up in a small town in South Dakota, and my \nfather and mother had both come through the Great Depression. They were \nsimilar in terms of their remembrances of that period and could \nidentify in many respects with some of the things President Reagan \ntalked about.\n  But he was a person of strong convictions. I think he had a strength \nof conviction that was really appealing to a lot of Americans. He was \nsomeone who believed in American exceptionalism. He understood that the \ngreatness of this country was not in its government institutions but in \nits peoples and its ideals.\n  He was someone who was willing to confront the threats we faced \naround the world. The way he took on the threat of communism and \npromoted freedom and democracy around the globe is something for which \nhe will always be remembered, not only here at home but by other \ncountries around the world.\n  I think he possessed, in many respects, a lot of the qualities we \nvalue in the Midwest. He was a very humble person. I think his humility \nis something that really stood out. He was always referred to as \n``Dutch Reagan'' in his growing up, his formative years. I think the \nimpact he had on this country was because he saw himself as just an \nordinary American like every other American, and he was able to connect \nand identify with the challenges and the opportunities that were facing \nAmericans across this country at the time.\n  I think he also possessed, although he was the Governor of \nCalifornia, a midwestern sensibility that never left. He had, in many \nrespects, values that, as I said before, many of us in the Midwest find \nreally important--his belief that you ought to live within your means. \nHis sort of midwestern bedrock values of individual responsibility were \nthings he always touched upon, themes he referenced in his remarks. I \nthink those were the types of qualities that really differentiated him \non the national stage.\n  I remember, too, as a young person being impressed with his sense of \nhumor. Often today there are serious matters we deal with, matters of \ngreat gravity and great weight, and they need to be taken with the \nright level of seriousness. But he also was able to see the best in \npeople and to use his sense of humor to connect with people about what \nwas really distinctive and really unique about America.\n  I remember the story that was told while we were fighting the Cold \nWar about the guy in the Soviet Union who went in to buy a car, and he \nsaid: I want to buy a car.\n  The guy at the transportation bureau said: Well, you can have your \nblack sedan and you can pick it up 10 years from today.\n  The guy thought about it for a minute, and he said: Will that be in \nthe morning or in the afternoon?\n  The guy at the transportation bureau said: What difference does it \nmake? It is 10 years from now.\n  And the guy said: Well, because I have the plumber coming in the \nmorning.\n  Ronald Reagan had a way of putting into very simple and \nunderstandable and sometimes humorous terms what was so distinctive and \nunique about the American experience. I think that is something that \nalso really set him apart.\n  When it came to the big issues of the day, he had a statement he made \nthat I quote. He said: There are no easy answers, but there are simple \nanswers. I think oftentimes we face these complex problems, and we \noveranalyze a little bit. And the truth is, in a lot of the challenges \nwe face today, not unlike the times when he was President, there are \nnot easy answers, but I believe there are simple answers. Those very \nbasic, core principles and those values that helped shape his \nPresidency and the things he never lost sight of are what made him an \neffective President. I believe that is a lesson we can apply today. \nThere are no easy answers, but there are simple answers.\n  When we believe in the greatness of America, when we look at the \nfoundation of this country--personal freedom, personal liberty, coupled \nwith individual responsibility--he believed profoundly that you achieve \npeace through strength. He was willing to confront communism at a point \nin this Nation's history when it posed a great threat to freedom-loving \ncountries around the world. I think those are the types of qualities \nfor which President Reagan will be remembered.\n  As, again, someone who was very impressionable at that time, he was a \ngreat inspiration to public service. I think he represented the very \nbest of public service. He got into it for all the right reasons. He \nunderstood the importance of what he was doing, the issues with which \nhe was dealing, but always had an eye toward making a difference and \nproviding a better future for the next generation. That is a lesson \nthat I think all of us need to remember: that sometimes we have a \ntendency to believe it is about us, it is about today. We always have \nto keep an eye on tomorrow, on the future, and what we are doing to \nbuild a better and brighter and more prosperous and stronger nation for \nfuture generations.\n  When I think about and remember President Reagan as we come upon his \n100th birthday, those are the types of things that strike me as really \nstanding out--his humility, his sense of humor, his belief in American \nexceptionalism. Those are what history has already written about him, \nbut they certainly are permanently impressed upon my mind, my \nexperience, in my time in public life--just the types of qualities I \nwant to apply and bring to the work we do in the U.S. Senate.\n  So I rise along with many of my colleagues today to pay tribute to \nour 40th President and to his family. Of course, we thank them for \ntheir great service and sacrifice too, because anybody who has been in \nthis arena knows the sacrifice that comes with public service. But we \nare indeed grateful for his great service to our country, for the way \nhe impacted so many, both here at home and around the world, and for \nthe way he continues through his legacy to impact generations of \nAmericans today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few minutes today \nabout Ronald Reagan.\n  Ronald Reagan inspired freedom and changed the world. Maybe nobody \nsaid that better than former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher \nin a prerecorded eulogy that was played at President Reagan's funeral \nat the National Cathedral. I would like to read just a little of that \neulogy. It starts:\n\n       We have lost a great president, a great American and a \n     great man. And--\n\n  Mrs. Thatcher said--\n\n       I have lost a dear friend.\n       In his lifetime, Ronald Reagan was such a cheerful and \n     invigorating presence that it was easy to forget what \n     daunting historic tasks he set for himself. He sought to mend \n     America's wounded spirit, to restore the strength of the free \n     world and to free the slaves of communism. These were causes \n     hard to accomplish and heavy with risk.\n\n  Mrs. Thatcher went on:\n\n       Yet they were pursued with almost a lightness of spirit. \n     For Ronald Reagan also embodied another great cause--what \n     Arnold Bennett once called ``the great cause of cheering us \n     all up.'' His politics had a freshness and optimism that won \n     converts from every class and every nation--and ultimately \n     from the very heart of the evil empire.\n       Yet his humor often had a purpose beyond humor. In the \n     terrible hours after the attempt on his life, his easy jokes \n     gave reassurance to an anxious world. They were evidence \n     that in the aftermath of terror and in the midst of \n     hysteria, one great heart at least remained sane and \n     jocular. They were truly grace under pressure.\n       And perhaps they signified grace of a deeper kind.\n\n  Mrs. Thatcher said:\n\n\n[[Page S521]]\n\n\n       Ronnie himself certainly believed that he had been given \n     back his life for a purpose. As he told a priest after his \n     recovery, ``Whatever time I've got left now belongs to the \n     Big Fella Upstairs.''\n       And surely it is hard to deny that Ronald Reagan's life was \n     providential, when we look at what he achieved in the eight \n     years that followed.\n       Others prophesied the decline of the West; he inspired \n     America and its allies with renewed faith in their mission of \n     freedom.\n       Others saw only limits to growth; he transformed a stagnant \n     economy into an engine of opportunity.\n       Others hoped, at best, for an uneasy cohabitation with the \n     Soviet Union; he won the Cold War--not only without firing a \n     shot, but also by inviting enemies out of their fortress and \n     turning them into friends.\n\n  Mrs. Thatcher goes on to say:\n\n       I cannot imagine how any diplomat, or any dramatist, could \n     improve on his words to Mikhail Gorbachev at the Geneva \n     summit--\n\n  Quoting President Reagan--\n\n       ``Let me tell you why it is we distrust you.''\n\n  Mrs. Thatcher said:\n       Those words are candid and tough and they cannot have been \n     easy to hear. But they are also a clear invitation to a new \n     beginning and a new relationship that would be rooted in \n     trust.\n\n  Ronald Reagan's truly ``only in America'' life story began 100 years \nago this weekend.\n  During his lifetime, he was a Democrat and later a Republican, he was \na liberal and then a conservative, he was a labor union president and \nthen President of the United States. During his lifetime, he developed \na philosophy of faith, life, and government that Americans understood.\n  During his Presidency, the people of this country had an \nextraordinary understanding of what their President would think and how \ntheir President would react to events and circumstances. The strength \nof the certain trumpet, the strength of the clarion call is, I believe, \nimpossible to overestimate. Knowing how your President, how your leader \nviews the world and views the circumstances that may meet us in the \nworld is an incredibly comforting feeling.\n  In fact, there is an epic Greek fable, more often applied to \nPresident Lincoln, about the fox and the hedgehog. In the epic Greek \nfable of the fox and the hedgehog, the fox is wily, the fox is clever, \nthe fox knows lots of little things, but the hedgehog knows one really \nbig thing. In that fable and in reality, the fox can never defeat the \nhedgehog.\n  Now, neither Lincoln--I am really not comfortable referring to either \nLincoln or Reagan and characterizing them as a hedgehog, but I am \ncomfortable characterizing them as men of big ideas, men who understood \nthe big things, leaders who understood the big things. With President \nLincoln, it was the Union. With President Reagan, it was a focus on the \nbig things, with an understanding that you measured the circumstances \nand events that came up by your view of the big things that guide the \ncountry, that guide us individually, that guide lives and, in fact, \nguide the lives of a nation.\n  President Reagan understood big things. He could quickly evaluate any \nissue or challenge through that prism and the prism of those core \nvalues.\n  Ronald Reagan inspired freedom and changed the world. The centennial \ncelebration of his birth that begins this week and officially begins \nthis weekend gives us an opportunity to think about what it was that \nmade this President great; what it was that puts this President on the \ncover of news magazines, in the decade before the centennial, in one \nrecent cover arm in arm with the current President of the United \nStates; and what it was that made this extraordinary man so \nextraordinary.\n  I will just say again, Ronald Reagan inspired freedom and changed the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nCalifornia's own, President Ronald Reagan.\n  It has been nearly 7 years since President Reagan passed away, but he \nis still fondly remembered by so many in California, across this \ncountry and across the globe.\n  The first time I met President Reagan was right after I was elected \nto Congress in 1982. I was invited to the White House as part of a \nlarge Democratic freshman class, and I wondered how President Reagan \nwould greet us. After all, he had campaigned hard for a Republican \nCongress. When we arrived at the White House, he and First Lady Nancy \nReagan could not have been more warm and gracious to us. I still have \nthe photo from that evening hanging in my home office.\n  Ronald Reagan showed all of us that you can disagree without being \ndisagreeable, and that even if you have sharply different views on some \nissues, you can still work to find common ground.\n  President Reagan once said: ``I've always believed that a lot of the \ntroubles of the world would disappear if we were talking to each other \ninstead of about each other.''\n  He believed if we were all respectful to each other, we could find \nthose areas of agreement. We could get things done. That was an \nimportant lesson for me and for all of us that evening because, in the \nSenate, with the rules of the Senate, the only way to get things done \nfor our constituents and for our country is by working together.\n  I believe he had learned this lesson in California, where as a \nRepublican Governor, he worked with a Democratic State legislature. He \nbrought that same approach from Sacramento to the Nation's Capital.\n  As Governor, in keeping with the values and wishes of most \nCalifornians, he helped to establish the Redwood National Park. He \nregulated auto emissions to reduce pollution. He opposed the State \nproposition that discriminated against teachers based on sexual \norientation. He was willing to reach across party lines and find \nconsensus.\n  He continued these efforts to work across the aisle when he became \nPresident. Although there were serious disagreements on important \nissues, President Reagan worked closely with a Democratic House to \nratify and sign important arms control agreements, increase investments \nin math and science education, and reauthorize the Superfund hazardous \nwaste cleanup program.\n  President Reagan was a conservative, but he was not an ideologue. He \nfulfilled his campaign promise to appoint the first woman to the \nSupreme Court, choosing Sandra Day O'Connor as the first female Justice \nof the U.S. Supreme Court, even though she was considered too moderate \nby many conservatives.\n  Of course, there were many areas of disagreement--from offshore oil \ndrilling to the role of the national government, to the fight against \nAIDS, to policies in Central America. Those disagreements were deep, \nbut they were never taken personally by President Reagan. He and House \nSpeaker Tip O'Neill were genuinely fond of each other. They often \nshared a drink after work, and they laughed after a day of locking \nhorns. Their good nature was infectious. It raised the level of comity \nthroughout the Nation's Capital.\n  I believe that President Reagan will be remembered for his focus on \nfreedom for the people behind the Iron Curtain. He saw in Soviet \nPresident Mikhail Gorbachev a leader he could successfully challenge to \nstep to the plate. And when President Reagan said, tear down this wall, \nhe said it directly to Mr. Gorbachev. He touched Mr. Gorbachev, he \ntouched America, and he touched people all around the world.\n  After President Reagan passed away, Mr. Gorbachev wrote in the New \nYork Times: ``Reagan was a man of the right. But, while adhering to his \nconvictions, with which one could agree or disagree, he was not \ndogmatic; he was looking for cooperation. And this was the most \nimportant thing to me: he had the trust of the American people.''\n  As we honor President Reagan today, I believe the greatest tribute we \ncan pay is to find a cure for the disease that took his life, took him \naway from his loved ones and from the world.\n  Ten years before his death, Ronald Reagan knew he was battling \nAlzheimer's. He knew he was losing the battle. In an act of enormous \ncourage\n\n[[Page S522]]\n\nand in a handwritten open letter, he told the American people he was \nsuffering from the illness. He wrote: ``I now begin the journey that \nwill lead me into the sunset of my life.''\n  And he movingly wrote: ``I know that for America there will always be \na bright dawn ahead.'' Even in his darkest hour, President Reagan's \neternal optimism shone through.\n  Nancy Reagan stood by her husband throughout his long ordeal and \nprotected him in his most vulnerable time. She has become a leading \nchampion for increased funding for medical research to fight \nAlzheimer's and other diseases. She has been brave and courageous in \nher advocacy.\n  In memory of Ronald Reagan, in honor of Nancy Reagan and all of the \nfamilies who have lost loved ones to Alzheimer's, we must continue to \nseek a brighter dawn for Alzheimer's victims and their families.\n  As a California Senator, certainly Ronald Reagan is one of our most \nfamous residents as Governor and then as President. I was in the House \nof Representatives while he was the President. Clearly, there were a \nlot of disagreements between President Reagan and many of those in \nCongress such as myself who didn't believe government was the problem, \nwhich was his definite belief at that time. We certainly had a loyal \nopposition, and we certainly worked together when we could.\n  One of the things that was so interesting to me compared to working \nwith other Presidents--because I have had the honor of serving for so \nlong that actually President Obama is the fifth President I have had \nthe honor of serving with. I went to every State of the Union Address, \nall of which were very impressive.\n  I think the thing about Ronald Reagan that I grew to admire was, as \nhard as one might debate with him on his vision of what the priorities \nshould be--what should we invest in, what was important--when those \ndebates were over and a decision was made, regardless of who won the \nday, we just moved on to the next issue. We tried to find common \nground, and if we didn't we had the respectful debate. It was never \ntaken personally.\n  Again, there were many things I disagreed with him about. I remember \nbeing a young Member of Congress at the time when the AIDS epidemic \ncame out, and I remember I was so frustrated because President Reagan \nwas very compassionate, but he didn't want to discuss the issue of \nAIDS. We had to work very hard with the Surgeon General at the time, \nand we finally made a little bit of progress.\n  So, yes, there were many tough debates. Of course, his presence, his \nvery sunny presence, his optimism about the country's future was very \nimportant to a Nation that had been torn asunder because of many tough \nissues that separated the generations.\n  I add my voice on this day when we remember former President Ronald \nReagan, someone whom California is very proud of and someone who has \nobviously gone down in history for the many things he accomplished, \nparticularly his rapprochement with the Soviet Union at that time. It \nwas a big contribution to the world.\n  Thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, just over 30 years ago, Ronald Reagan was \ninaugurated as the 40th President of the United States. It is hard to \nbelieve that three decades have passed since he stood in front of this \nCapitol, just yards away, and announced to this Nation and the world \nthat America's moment had not passed. It is hard to think that we have \nbeen without him now for over 6 years. I think of him and his \nwonderful, lovely wife Nancy quite often. I knew them both very well. I \nknow Nancy very well to this day. She is a terrific human being, as was \nhe.\n  One of my first campaign trips for Ronald Reagan was with Nancy, and \nI can tell my colleagues there never was a stronger advocate for her \nhusband.\n  As a man, he had the rare combination of good humor and a commitment \nto principle. As the leader of his party and as President, he reminded \nus of the need for constant recommitment to our constitutional ideas, \nand as a couple Ron and Nancy were a pair for the ages. If there was \nany doubt, my colleagues have confirmed today in their tributes to \nPresident Reagan on the centennial of his birth that Ronald Reagan \nmight have passed on, but he is most certainly not forgotten--not by a \nlong shot.\n  When Reagan was President, he inspired great reactions from both \nparties. I can attest, particularly with respect to my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle, that not all of those reactions were \npositive. Yet today's bipartisan celebration of President Reagan's \nlegacy shows that he has become as much a part of the American story as \nhis greatest predecessors in office.\n  Like other great men before him, Ronald Reagan seemed to embody the \ntimes during which he lived. The man himself, his personal story, in \nmany ways personified America's 20th century.\n  Ronald Wilson Reagan was born in the Midwest and became a westerner, \nmoving to California like so many other of his fellow Americans. The \ncountry he grew up in looked very different from our own today. As \nMichael Barone recently reminded us in an article in the Claremont \nReview of Books, when America entered the Second World War, one-quarter \nof Americans still lived on farms, and half of those were either \nwithout electricity or only recently acquired electricity.\n  America's population was at the same time both more diffuse and more \nconcentrated than it is today. America's nonrural population was \nclustered in a few great cities. Again, as Barone explained, at the \noutbreak of the Second World War, 2 percent of all Americans lived in \nBrooklyn, NY. America in the 20th century became a less rural, less \nagricultural nation. Yet instead of concentrating in existing urban \ncenters, new communities grew and suburbs expanded.\n  That was the story of Ronald Reagan, who was born in tiny Tampico, \nIL, population 772 as of the 2000 census, and came to the world's \nattention in California, home of suburban life and the American \nhighway. He became a Californian through and through. He loved his \nranch, and he loved being on the back of a horse. The large landscapes \nof California and of the entire West suggested the boundless \nopportunity that is afforded those who work hard in this country. It \nwas there that Ronald Reagan found his professional and political \nsuccess. It was where he met Nancy and raised his family, and it is \nwhere he was finally laid to rest.\n  Ronald Reagan did not have it easy. As he put it, he did not grow up \non the wrong side of the tracks. But he could hear the train. He lived \nthrough the Great Depression. Yet like countless Americans before and \nafter him, with dogged determination and a good deal of pluck, he \nsucceeded.\n  At a time when college was a luxury, Ronald Reagan graduated from \nEureka College. He went on to have a successful career in radio as a \nsportscaster. But that was not enough, so he moved to Hollywood where \nhe became an actor. Of all the roles Ronald Reagan would play, we \neventually identified him most closely with the character of George \nGipp in ``Knute Rockne: All American.'' It should come as little \nsurprise that we would associate a good Irishman such as Ronald Reagan \nwith a movie about Notre Dame and the Fighting Irish.\n  When George Gipp first appears on screen, Knute Rockne, the head \ncoach of the Irish, is at his wit's end with his team. Seeing Gipp--who \nwas not a member of the team--lying around, Rockne asked him if he \ncould go in and run the ball against the varsity. Reagan's Gipp \nresponded, with an Irish twinkle in his eye: How far? Naturally, he ran \ndown the field, scored a touchdown, and took his place in Notre Dame \nlore.\n  For Ronald Reagan, like George Gipp, there was no challenge too big. \nIt is a good thing he thought that way because he faced plenty of \nobstacles. With the outbreak of World War II, his promising acting \ncareer was put on hold. Yet he would go on to serve as President of the \nScreen Actors Guild,\n\n[[Page S523]]\n\nand later he worked in television as the host of ``General Electric \nTheater.'' It was that association with General Electric that sent \nReagan on his path toward the Presidency.\n  Going on what he called the ``mashed potato circuit,'' he spoke \nacross the country to the thousands of GE employees, giving what would \nlater be called ``The Speech.'' Giving these after dinner remarks, \nReagan honed his thoughts about freedom, the size of government, and \nthe Soviet menace.\n  In 1964, on the eve of the Presidential election, he would deliver \nthat speech to the Nation. Senator Barry Goldwater went on to lose that \nelection in an epic landslide.\n  Today we know that conservatives might have lost that battle, but \nthey would ultimately win the war.\n  A week before the election, Ronald Reagan delivered a taped address--\n``A Time for Choosing''--on Goldwater's behalf. He spoke as a partisan \nfor liberty, and he urged his fellow Americans to join him in that \nstruggle. He concluded his remarks telling a national television \naudience:\n\n       You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We'll preserve \n     for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth.\n\n  This speech resonated with the American people. It raised $8 million \nfor Goldwater, an astronomical sum at the time. More importantly, it \nmade Ronald Reagan a formidable presence on the political scene.\n  I knew Barry Goldwater. I knew him well. When I ran for the Senate, \nhe was one of two people I came to visit in Washington just to get some \nadvice. I admired him so much, and it was a privilege to serve with \nhim. The other one was Chuck Grassley who was then in the House, and I \ncount him as one of my dearest friends on Earth.\n  Against the odds and conventional wisdom, Ronald Reagan ran for \nGovernor of California in 1966. The California establishment made the \nmistake of underestimating this actor from the Midwest, and he went on \nto beat his more liberal primary opponent and the popular incumbent \nGovernor.\n  Underestimating Reagan was a mistake that the Washington \nestablishment would make time and again when he arrived there 14 years \nlater. They never seemed to understand what was so obvious to President \nReagan.\n  For all of the superficial differences, Americans of his age were not \nso different than the generation that founded this Nation, fought the \nCivil War, worked through the Great Depression, and struggled for civil \nrights. In the end, Americans of today are committed to the same \nprinciples of liberty and equality that animated the authors of our \nDeclaration of Independence and Constitution.\n  This shared commitment to our founding principles served him well, \nbecause he took office at a time of great uncertainty, a time not \nunlike our own. A combination of factors seemed to be putting the \naspirations of Americans out of reach.\n  To be blunt, America was on its heels. The prime interest rate was 15 \npercent. Inflation was 12\\1/2\\ percent. And civilian unemployment was \nat 7 percent. Government regulations and tax rates were smothering \nAmerican innovation, and with it the American dream. And abroad the \npicture was just as grim. An imperialist Soviet Union had invaded \nAfghanistan, and was supporting revolutionary movements across the \nglobe. The American hostages had not yet been freed from Iran.\n  Yet when Ronald Reagan left office 8 years later, he had left his \nmark. According to his biographer, Lou Cannon, when he came into \noffice, there were 4,414 individual tax returns with an adjusted gross \nincome of more than $1 million. By 1987, fueled by tax cuts, the \nbreaking of inflation, and explosive economic growth, there were 34,944 \nsuch returns. When he entered the White House, only 1 in 6 Americans \nowned a microwave, and VCRs were a luxury for the wealthy. By the time \nhe left office, these were common household goods. He helped to restore \nour understanding of a limited judiciary that respects the traditions \nof the American people and their elected representatives. And he \nrestored faith in our men and women in uniform.\n  Just before he left office, President Reagan reviewed the troops at \nAndrews Air Force Base one last time. During that visit, he said that \nserving as commander-in-chief was ``the most sacred, most important \ntask of the presidency.''\n  Barely five years after America left South Vietnam, Reagan spoke at \nthe Veterans of Foreign Wars convention and reminded America that \nVietnam had been a ``noble cause.'' The rush to ``blame America first'' \nin our conflict with totalitarian regimes, and the days of holding our \nmilitary men and women in low esteem, came to an end with the Reagan \nPresidency. And though his greatest achievement--the collapse of the \nSoviet Empire--would occur on his successor's watch--the writing was on \nthe wall by the time Ronald Reagan left office. His recommitment to \nfreedom during our twilight struggle with what was truly an evil empire \nquite literally saved the world and liberated millions.\n  It is no surprise that he will be honored in Prague, Budapest, and \nKrakow--the home of his great partner Pope John Paul II--later this \nsummer for his role in exposing the great lie that was the Soviet \nUnion.\n  Ronald Reagan succeeded as president because he knew what he was \nabout. In his farewell address from the Oval Office, he said, ``I went \ninto politics in part to put up my hand and say, Stop. I was a citizen \npolitician, and it seemed the right thing for a citizen to do. I think \nwe have stopped a lot of what needed stopping. And I hope we have once \nagain reminded the people that man is not free unless government is \nlimited. There's a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and \npredictable as a law of physics: As government expands, liberty \ncontracts.''\n  I could not agree more.\n  And that Reagan Revolution--the aspiration of citizens for greater \nfreedom and greater futures for the generations that follow--continues. \nI am proud to be a part of that revolution.\n  President Reagan took a flyer on me when I first ran for the Senate, \nsupporting me in my primary. I have tried to do him proud. I remember \nwell the blistering hot day in the Rose Garden when he signed the \nHatch-Waxman legislation into law in 1984. In his signing statement, he \njoked that with this law ``[e]veryone wins, particularly our elderly \nAmericans. Senior citizens require more medication than any other \nsegment of our society. I speak with some authority on that.''\n  In my opinion, that law typified the commitments of President Reagan. \nSince its passage it has saved the Federal Government and consumers \nhundreds of billions of dollars--some say trillions--and it essentially \ncreated the generic drug industry and incentives for the creation of \nthe next generation of life saving drugs.\n  I worked with him when he was in office. And as I work today for the \ncitizens of Utah, his principled example is always on my mind. We still \nhave work to do. Reagan understood the danger of what is today called \nprogressivism, but was then called liberalism. It knows no bounds.\n  As he put it, ``No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in \nsize. Government programs, once launched, never disappear. Actually, a \ngovernment bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see \non this Earth.''\n  In some respects, Ronald Reagan belonged to a different age. He was \ngovernor during the student protests of the 1960s. He entered the \nnational political consciousness during a presidential campaign where \nthe possibility of global nuclear conflict was an imminent threat. When \nhe became President, he was only a few years removed from widespread \nurban riots and the end of the Vietnam war. When he spoke at Pointe-du-\nHoc on the 40th anniversary of D-Day, he spoke to the men who actually \nscaled those cliffs and liberated a continent. Today, most of those \nveterans have passed on. But ultimately, Reagan remains one of us. I \nthink that his advisor, David Gergen, got it wrong when he mused that \nReagan's legacy was how much he changed our minds.\n  In my view, Ronald Reagan was a success because he understood that \nthe American people did not need to change their minds. Americans, in \n1980, had the same beliefs and hopes that we have always had. Ronald \nReagan's genius was in giving voice to those hopes.\n  Ronald Reagan was a big man, made for a big screen, and eventually \nthe biggest stage. He played his part well. To borrow from Hollywood, \nhe knew\n\n[[Page S524]]\n\nthat even as time goes by . . . the fundamental things apply.\n  Before leaving office, President Reagan addressed the Nation one last \ntime. Speaking to the citizens of this shining city upon a hill, he \ntold us, ``[w]e did it. We weren't just marking time. We made a \ndifference. We made the city stronger. We made the city freer, and we \nleft her in good hands. All in all, not bad, not bad at all.''\n  Indeed.\n  It has been said that Ronald Reagan had a love affair with the \nAmerican people. He did. But it took two to tango. Ronald Reagan loved \nhis country. But I think his country loved him more. That includes \npeople on both sides of the aisle.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, in early 1983, the Soviet dissident Natan \nSharansky was in an 8-by-10 foot cell in a Siberian prison when jailers \npermitted him to read the latest issue of the official Communist Party \nnewspaper.\n  The front page was filled with global condemnations of American \nPresident Ronald Reagan for calling the Soviet Union an ``evil \nempire.'' Tapping on the walls and whispering through plumbing pipes, \npolitical prisoners spread the word. Rather than being demoralized by \nthe criticisms, they were ecstatic. The leader of the free world had \nspoken the truth. There was hope.\n  By the end of the decade, hope became freedom, freedom for the \nhundreds of thousands imprisoned in the Soviet gulag and for the \nhundreds of millions trapped behind the Iron Curtain. Countless men and \nwomen of courage and determination, their names lost to history, stood \nup to tyranny and won a great victory with a leader whose name will \nforever be remembered by history. Lech Walesa, the founder of the \nvaliant Solidarity movement, said this of President Reagan: ``We in \nPoland . . . owe him our liberty.''\n  In this centennial year, we are experiencing something rare. While \nmany great figures of their time diminish over time, our regard for \nRonald Reagan only grows. This cannot be explained by merely citing the \nqualities for which he was so well known: his confidence in America, \nhis wit, and his optimism. It goes beyond his courage when attacked by \nan assassin's bullet or, at the end, a devastating disease or even his \nskills as the ``Great Communicator.'' Ronald Reagan looms ever larger \nbecause of his ideas and the enduring convictions that gave those ideas \ntheir power. ``History comes and goes,'' he said, ``but principles \nendure and inspire future generations to defend liberty, not as a gift \nfrom government, but a blessing from our Creator.''\n  Ronald Reagan knew that liberty was not a blessing merely to enjoy \nbut one that must always be defended. He expressed his faith in our \nability to rise to its defense with these words: ``No weapon in the \narsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of \nfree men and women.'' His optimism sprang from his belief in the \nnobility of the human spirit.\n  The very ideas that are the foundation of this great Nation were the \nfoundation of Ronald Reagan's character. He became President at a time \nwhen America had begun to question its place in the world and the \nvalues upon which this Nation was built. He tore down the wall of doubt \nand reminded us that our many blessings carried with them great \nobligations. Ronald Reagan was a great communicator because he had \nsomething great to communicate: the exceptionalism of the United States \nof America.\n  The birthday of one who has passed from this life is always a \nbittersweet occasion as we remember what we had and reflect on what we \nhave lost. I would like to extend my best wishes to President Reagan's \nbeloved First Lady, Nancy, and to the entire Reagan family.\n  Ronald Reagan was the right man for his time. He now belongs to the \nages. He is missed, but his ideals will always be with us.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we will soon mark the 100th anniversary of \nthe birth of Ronald Reagan, one of our greatest Presidents. In the days \nand months to come, in cities and towns all across this great Nation of \nours, people will pause for a moment to reflect on the past and \nremember him, each in their own way, for the greatness in him that \ninspired a nation. I know he would be humbled by and greatly \nappreciative of our remembrance of his legacy of service and touched by \nthe great admiration and affection with which we will always remember \nhim.\n  I don't think anyone is a better example of the American dream than \nRonald Reagan. He was born in Illinois, the son of a shoe salesman. His \nmother loved to read and she encouraged him to do the same by reading \nto him. In books Reagan was able to tap into the wisdom of our Founding \nFathers and many other great leaders of our past. What he learned from \nhis reading would help to shape his character and ultimately mold his \ndestiny.\n  It wasn't long before Reagan's natural confidence and his \ndetermination to do something with his life began to show itself, first \nduring his school years and later when he pursued a career as an actor. \nHe proved to be a born leader and he took a leadership role at every \nstage of his life. While in college, he served as student body \nPresident. In his acting days he served as the president of the Screen \nActors Guild. In between he worked hard and built a career as a \nsuccessful actor in film and television as he became a familiar face in \nHollywood.\n  If that had been all he had done, he would be remembered for his \ntalents and abilities as an actor. He would have earned his reputation \nfor being unafraid of hard work and his life would have inspired others \nto follow his path just by his success in Hollywood. All of the fame \nand notoriety that came from his acting days would have been enough for \nmost people, but not for Ronald Reagan. He was just getting warmed up. \nThe best was yet to come.\n  With his beloved wife Nancy by his side, Ronald Reagan began to \npursue a bigger dream. He wanted to make an impact on the world that \nwould put him on a bigger stage. He wanted to get more involved in \npolitics and put his principles and values into action in the work that \nhad to be done to solve the problems facing the Nation.\n  His first effort was a run for Governor of California. People thought \nthat was an impossible dream of his and he would never make it. Ronald \nReagan proved them wrong--not for the first or the last time. He took \nhis case to the people, put together a coalition of both Republicans \nand Democrats and when the votes were counted, he had won.\n  I still remember meeting him when I was the president of the Wyoming \nJaycees. We held our national convention in California and Ronald \nReagan spoke to us. I had a chance to meet him and I was quickly \nimpressed by his personality and his style. He clearly had a way not \nonly with words, but to connect to people one on one. Still, I don't \nthink any of us could have guessed what would happen next in his life.\n  Reagan had his sights set on the Presidency of the United States. He \nknew it wasn't going to be easy, but for Ronald Reagan the only failure \nwould be to fail to try. He wasn't successful at first, but he never \ngave up. He kept traveling around the country, speaking to groups, and \nsharing his message of hope and opportunity with the people who came to \nhear him speak. This seemed to be another impossible dream, but once \nagain Reagan made it happen. He won the Republican nomination for \nPresident, facing an incumbent who spoke often about the terrible \nproblems facing the Nation. Ronald Reagan didn't speak with doubt and \nuncertainty about the future; he spoke with strong and passionate \ncertainty that things would get better if we all worked together.\n  Unfortunately, optimism will only get you so far--so when the time \ncame for him to take the oath of office, he knew he had a lot of work \nto do. He often referred to our economic problems as the ``misery \nindex.'' We were in the middle of a time of high unemployment, high \ninterest rates and high inflation. The Nation seemed to have lost its \nself-confidence and no longer believed that it could dare to do great \nthings--and succeed. The experts all seemed to say that there was \nlittle if anything that one person could do to change things and \nreenergize the Nation.\n  Once again, Ronald Reagan proved the experts wrong. It seemed almost \novernight things changed. There was a renewed sense of confidence in \nour shared destiny as a nation, a new feeling of hope and opportunity \nabout the\n\n[[Page S525]]\n\nfuture, and a return to the spirit of America that had been lost. In \njust a short time, with his words and his actions, he inspired a \ngeneration to look to the future with the kind of confidence that comes \nfrom our belief in and commitment to the principles upon which our \nNation was founded.\n  I remember those days very well. I was the mayor of Gillette, WY, and \nwhen the National League of Cities held its national meeting the \nPresident flew to California to speak to our group. I had a chance to \nmeet with him again and enjoyed having an opportunity to speak to him. \nHe was the greatest ambassador for the West and our Western way of life \nthat we have ever had. He understood rural life and because of it he \nunderstood the problems of our rural communities. He also understood \npublic service for what it is--service--and he continued to see himself \nas a public servant throughout his career and his life.\n  I always thought the years he spent living on his ranch in California \nwere responsible for his passion for speaking the truth, regardless of \nwhether or not it was politically expedient to do so. It is a trait \nthat people in Wyoming appreciate and expect from their leaders. It \nquickly led to some of his best moments.\n  I believe we all have strong memories of Ronald Reagan speaking by \nthe Berlin Wall, taking advantage of the occasion to challenge Mikhail \nGorbachev to ``tear down this wall.'' He then went counter to the \nadvice of his staff and referred to the Soviet Union as the ``evil \nempire.'' For Ronald Reagan, life was that simple. If it was the truth, \nit must be said for there are two kinds of people in the world--the \ngood guys and the bad guys. If the good guys worked hard and were \nwilling to sacrifice and do whatever it took to succeed, they won. In \nRonald Reagan's world, we were the good guys and, during his \nPresidency, more often than not, we won.\n  Still, no matter how harsh the rhetoric may have seemed, his \npolitical opponents always knew that it wasn't personal--it was \nprinciple based. That is why, after all that he said, he was still able \nto form a friendship with Mr. Gorbachev. Our two countries were two of \nthe biggest superpowers in the world and he knew he would have to find \na way to keep the lines of communication, trust and understanding open \nbetween them, a necessity that gave way to another of his trademark \nlines, ``Trust but verify.''\n  Over the years he turned many a phrase that reflected the strength of \nhis character, his sense of humor and more. He had a unique way of \nexpressing complex truths in simple sentences that held great meaning \nby virtue of their simplicity.\n  Because of his trademark one liners and other famous remarks, he has \noften been called the Great Communicator, a title that caused Reagan to \nremark ``I never thought it was my style that made a difference--it was \nthe content. I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great \nthings.''\n  Ronald Reagan did communicate great things and he communicated them \nin a number of ways--most importantly by the way he lived his life. \nThere is an old saying that reminds us that we can play it safe and \ntake the well worn path or we can dare to go where few have gone before \nand blaze our own trail in life, leaving a path for others to follow. \nSuch was Ronald Reagan's philosophy and by so doing he helped to give \nus an example of what was possible for us as individuals and for our \nNation.\n  In the end, Ronald Reagan will be remembered for many things. He \nfound a cure for an ailing economy. He helped to bring an end to the \nCold War. He did all of that and so much more but he also did something \nelse that was to prove to be far more important. He helped us to regain \nour spirit as Americans. He helped us to regain that great pride we had \nalways had for our heritage. He helped us to believe in ourselves again \nand in our ability to serve as the leaders of the free world, a title \nwe were always meant to carry. Thanks to Ronald Reagan, it is a title \nwe have carried proudly and with purpose ever since. Through his words \nand his enthusiasm for life and living, the Great Communicator was able \nto infuse our country with optimism, patriotism and an unashamed hope \nfor a better tomorrow. Thanks to him, the United States of America \nbecame a brighter, better place for us all to live as the impact he had \non the world around us continues to be felt to this day.\n  Ronald Reagan's burial site is inscribed with the words he delivered \nat the opening of his Presidential Library. ``I know in my heart that \nman is good, that what is right will always eventually triumph and that \nthere is purpose and worth to each and every life.''\n  As in so many things in life, just like the old show business adage \nreminds us, he left us wanting more. And that is why he will never be \nforgotten by those who knew him and those who remember how he touched a \ngeneration for the better just by the great strength of his character \nand the warm gentleness of his soul.\n  Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I am proud to honor Ronald Reagan on the \n100th anniversary of his birth. President Reagan was a man who inspired \nmillions of Americans to serve their country and fulfill its promise as \nthe shining city on a hill. His genial demeanor, resilience, no-\nnonsense approach to governing and rock solid principles attracted \nflocks of young Americans to the Republican Party, and I am proud to \ninclude myself in that number.\n  I was fortunate to have grown up and come of age politically just as \nPresident Reagan was in office. His words and deeds inspired our entire \ncountry to take pride in our patriotic values and the free market \nprinciples that have made America exceptional. He also comforted us \nduring moments of national tragedy. And his willingness to speak out \nagainst communism--as both a bankrupt economic system and an immoral \nviolation of human dignity--was a ray of sunlight to those living in \nits darkness.\n  I will never forget my parents' reaction the day the Berlin Wall fell \nin 1989. Having lost their country to Fidel Castro's communism, they \nhad spent 30 years divided from their homeland, friends, and \nrelatives--just as the Wall had done to millions in Europe.\n  Especially for my parents' generation of Cuban exiles, whose hopes \nand dreams were shattered by communism, the Wall's fall was a historic \nevent they questioned would ever come. It was a day of celebration and \nrekindled hope that all lands within communism's grip would soon be \nfree as well. Ronald Reagan helped bring about the change that made \ncommunism's fall possible. By joining with other world leaders like \nPope John Paul II, he seized the opportunity to highlight communism's \nfailures. In doing so, he helped make millions of oppressed people more \nself-aware of their intrinsic dignity, more confident that their \npursuit of freedom was justified, and more hopeful that they were not \nalone in their struggles.\n  In commemorating Ronald Reagan's 100th birthday, we also remember the \nwork that remains to be done to tear down other oppressive walls that \nstill stand. America's responsibilities in this effort cannot be \nunderestimated.\n  Economically, we cannot allow Washington's borrow-and-spend binges to \ndiminish our free enterprise system, nor can we allow our debt to make \nour commitment to freedom and human rights subservient to our debt \nholders.\n  Militarily, as Ronald Reagan said, ``Of the four wars in my lifetime, \nnone came about because the U.S. was too strong.'' A free and secure \nworld requires a strong America led by our brave men and women in \nuniform. America's commitment to the defense of our allies should never \nwaver. Diplomatically, we must not confuse a desire for security and \nthe promotion of democratic values as mutually exclusive goals.\n  The United States and the world owe a great debt to Ronald Reagan for \nhis decisive leadership, adherence to conservative principles and \ninspiring example during a tumultuous period. And we owe a special debt \nof gratitude to his wife Nancy for her efforts to keep his memory and \nlegacy alive.\n  Now the question before us is whether we are going to do as Ronald \nReagan did and ensure that future generations can inherit the single \ngreatest society in all of human history. I, for one, am fully \ncommitted to honoring Ronald Reagan's legacy by standing up for the \nprinciples that defined him and have made America exceptional for more \nthan two centuries.\n\n[[Page S526]]\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. President, today, when our country faces enormous \nchallenges--both domestic and international--we have an opportunity to \nrecognize President Ronald Reagan on the 100th anniversary of his \nbirth.\n  Today--when we need big doses of optimism and a renewed faith in \nAmerica--the memory of Ronald Reagan tells us that our challenges can \nbe met and our obstacles can be overcome.\n  I remember the Reagan era well. The late seventies and early eighties \nwere tough times. I had just finished college and returned to North \nDakota, and America was clearly hurting.\n  It was the era of stagflation--stagnant economic growth and \ninflation, all at the same time.\n  It was an era of fuel shortages, long lines at the gas station, and \nsticker shock when you got to the pump.\n  A few years later, America was emerging from that recession and the \ncountry was on the mend. We could see light on the horizon. President \nReagan told us: ``It's morning again in America.'' And it was.\n  It was also the era of the Cold War. For more than a generation, the \nSoviet Union had kept Eastern Europe and its own people under its heel, \nand threatened the West with belligerent rhetoric and an arsenal of \nnuclear weapons.\n  In 1987, at a time when much of the world was resigned to a tense \ndoctrine of coexistence, with a literal and figurative wall between us, \nPresident Ronald Reagan would have none of it. He stood at the Berlin \nWall, and challenged: ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!'' And made \nit happen.\n  In some of our Nation's darkest hours, President Ronald Wilson Reagan \nwas there to remind us that we are a great nation and a great people--a \nnation kind and generous beyond measure, when deserved, but tough and \nenduring when circumstances warranted.\n  He knew that believing in ourselves was vital, and then working \ntogether to get the job done. That is a lesson worth remembering, \ntoday, 100 years after the birth of one of America's greatest \npresidents.\n  We can--and we will--build a brighter future for ourselves and for \nfuture generations. We will continue to truly be that shining city on a \nhill--a beam of light and liberty for the world.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I have had numerous opportunities to \ncomment on the amazing life and Presidency of Ronald Reagan. He had \nbold ideas and the courage to see them through. He was the true \nembodiment of the American success story. I have often referred to the \nfact that he was charismatic, determined and consistent, and he enjoyed \na remarkable batting average of being right. It has always been a point \nof great pride to me that my voting record was supportive of President \nReagan's positions more than any other Member of the Senate.\n  As the Senate commemorates the 100th anniversary of President \nReagan's birth, I want to share with my colleagues and the public a \nspeech I wrote when President Reagan was given the Hudson Institute \nJames Doolittle Award.\n  It was November 22, 1991, and it was a tumultuous time for Washington \nand the world. Yet you could still see the sparkle in the President's \neyes and his warmth and good humor. What we did not know was that \nPresident Reagan's effort to end the Cold War was quickly coming to \nfruition. Within days, on December 1, Ukraine would vote to break away \nfrom the Soviet Union, and on Christmas Day, Mikhail Gorbachev \nannounced the end of the USSR.\n  During his Presidency, when President Reagan decided to renew arms \ncontrol negotiations with the Soviets, he had the wisdom and political \nstrength to ask the Senate to form an official observer group so that \nthere would be understanding and support for any treaty coming out of \nthe negotiations. As cochair of the Arms Control Observer Group, I \nworked closely with Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and began a partnership \nwith him that continued for many years.\n  Subsequently, after the failed coup against Gorbachev in the summer \nof 1991, we heard from Soviet officials we had met that they were \nworried about the control of the Soviet nuclear arsenal as political \nevents unfolded. By that November when President Reagan was being \nhonored, Senator Nunn and I succeeded in passage of the Nunn-Lugar \nCooperative Threat Reduction Act.\n  Thanks to his leadership and vision, President Reagan helped build \nthe foundation for the Nunn-Lugar Program. Now thousands of missiles \nand warheads, any one of which could have destroyed my city of \nIndianapolis, have been eliminated. The success of the Nunn-Lugar \nProgram is a clear derivative of President Reagan's legacy. Thank you, \nPresident Reagan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe speech I wrote in honor of President Reagan when he received the \nHudson Institute James Doolittle Award.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nAddress by Senator Richard G. Lugar in Honor of President Ronald Reagan\n\n                          (November 22, 1991)\n\n       President and Mrs. Reagan, Governor Du Pont, trustees, \n     scholars and friends of the Hudson Institute--We are \n     assembled at the Hudson Institute's James H. Doolittle Award \n     luncheon to Celebrate the Patriotism, personal courage, and \n     strategic wisdom which has made the United States of America \n     historically unique.\n       I am grateful to Governor Du Pont for the extraordinary \n     public service he gave to the Congress of the United States \n     and to the State of Delaware and for the remarkable years of \n     public witness he has given as a champion of market economics \n     and vital federalism. I admire the strength of his ideas, the \n     skill of his advocacy, and i am grateful for the constancy of \n     his loyal friendship.\n       I thank the Hudson Institute for giving me this opportunity \n     to visit with President and Mrs. Reagan. It was my privilege \n     to sit beside Mrs. Reagan during several White House and \n     Republican Party events and to understand the strength of her \n     ideals and her hopes for our country as she worked \n     thoughtfully with the President, day by day, to make those \n     dreams come true.\n       I begin with mention of dreams, hopes, visions because the \n     service of President Reagan to our country can only be \n     approached by understanding how wide he cast the net of \n     potential achievement.\n       President Reagan actually believed and articulated that our \n     country had a special destiny, that no barriers were \n     insurmountable because we are Americans. He actually believed \n     and said that the Soviet Union was an Evil Empire, that its \n     political and economic institutions were disintegrating, and \n     that if its leadership and people knew the alternatives which \n     our country presented, they would choose democracy and market \n     economics.\n       President Reagan was prepared to invest an increasing \n     portion of our national treasure in military defense with the \n     certainty that we would negotiate successfully with our \n     adversaries from a position of strength. He shocked foreign \n     policy and defense specialists by proposing that all \n     intermediate nuclear missiles be destroyed, a negotiating \n     position labelled universally as a bizarre arms-control non-\n     starter.\n       He affirmed the staying power of NATO by deploying Pershing \n     missiles to Germany and cruise missiles to Italy even after \n     the Soviets declared that such deployment would end all arms \n     control negotiations and stimulate Soviet nuclear buildup.\n       Add to this President Reagan's startling proposal that the \n     United States should develop a Strategic Defense Initiative \n     to protect our country against incoming missiles fired upon \n     us. He contended that we should and could try to defend \n     ourselves against the so-called balance of terror.\n       He proposed to President Gorbachev that the United States \n     and the Soviet Union ban all nuclear weapons. In fact, he was \n     confident that if he could take Gorbachev on an extended tour \n     of America that Gorbachev would want to shape the Soviet \n     Union into many of our successful traditions.\n       Meanwhile, President Reagan knew that substantial new \n     growth must occur in our domestic economy to pay for the \n     special leadership role he had envisioned in foreign policy. \n     He was confident that substantial cuts in individual marginal \n     tax rates and a host of investment incentives would establish \n     and sustain the longest peacetime prosperity we have ever \n     enjoyed. Our prosperity underwrote the magnificent gains in \n     free and fair trade which he championed and world wide wealth \n     grew abundantly.\n       When Ronald Reagan stood on a balcony of the Reichstag in \n     Berlin and challenged Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall, \n     he could see white crosses just below where courageous \n     persons seeking freedom had lost their lives in that pursuit. \n     Everything still appeared to be so locked up and grim, and \n     sophisticated observers were barely patronizing in comment on \n     his Berlin Wall challenge.\n       When Germans hacked the Wall down in November of 1989 and \n     Eastern Europeans drove authoritarian communists from \n     positions of power, many scholars and journalists applauded \n     President Gorbachev as Man of the Decade. These awards \n     revealed virtual ignorance of the actual history of Europe in \n     the 1980s and a deliberate attempt to ignore the very public \n     words and leadership of Ronald Reagan for eight years.\n       The Evil Empire crumbled, the Berlin Wall and other walls \n     fell, all of the intermediate nuclear force weapons were \n     destroyed exactly in three years as the INF Treaty provided, \n     and the United States became the\n\n[[Page S527]]\n\n     only superpower with the strongest economy and the ability, \n     uniquely, to extend military authority around the world.\n       All of this occurred because President Reagan persuaded the \n     Congress and his countrymen to build our armed forces, to \n     build our economy through the growth incentives termed \n     ``Reaganomics,'' to maintain the successful strategies of our \n     NATO alliance, to utilize military force to support foreign \n     policy as required, and to commence Strategic Defense \n     Initiative research.\n       We now know that the Soviets were much weaker than experts \n     estimated. We now know that they could not keep up the pace \n     and that desperate attempts to do so led to the collapse of \n     the Soviet Empire and then to the collapse of the Union, \n     itself.\n       President Reagan advocated two more things which were \n     inspiring and critically important in world history.\n       First, he rejected the Brezhnev Doctrine--the idea that \n     territory which socialism has occupied can never be \n     reclaimed. When he advocated this roll back of the Iron \n     Curtain, he created deep anxiety and alarm among most \n     international foreign policy advisers who loved liberty a \n     lot, but loved stability even more.\n       U.S. Stinger missiles shipped to the expert ministrations \n     of the Mujadahin in Afghanistan were a major instrument of \n     the Soviet roll back, and the world watched in awe as the \n     Soviet troops withdrew to a smaller socialist world.\n       Second, President Reagan enunciated a new policy in a \n     statement sent to Congress after the Philippine election and \n     revolution. He stated that henceforth, we would oppose \n     tyranny of the left and tyranny of the right, that we were \n     for democracy developed by the people who sought to know and \n     enjoy democracy and human rights. This statement was severely \n     criticized by experts who suggested that in the ``real \n     world'' a good number of dictators were friendly to the U.S. \n     and certainly useful in waging the Cold War against \n     communism.\n       In articulating his vision on the roll back of the Iron \n     Curtain; in identifying with nations all over the world who \n     applauded our passion for building democratic institutions; \n     in celebrating human rights and free market principles; in \n     all of these areas, Ronald Reagan was far ahead of the \n     prevailing wisdom. Yet he ultimately brought other leaders in \n     America and around the world to his point of view in a \n     relatively short interval.\n       Surely the spirit of the Doolittle Award strongly commends \n     not only being courageous, and being on the right side of \n     history, but performing these deeds in a very public way \n     which instructs and inspires others. Some of us have learned \n     much from President Reagan as we have watched him speak and \n     act. He is charismatic, he is determined and consistent, and \n     he enjoys a remarkable batting average of being right.\n       We now have an important responsibility to make certain \n     that our children comprehend the greatness of his presidency, \n     his optimism about the particular uniqueness of our future \n     opportunities in this country, and the foundations for world \n     peace which his leadership established and which we are \n     charged to build upon.\n       We now also have the opportunity today to correct the \n     historical mistake made a few years ago in designating \n     Mikhail Gorbachev ``Man of the Decade.'' It has to be a high \n     moment in each of our lives to be able to present to \n     President and to Mrs. Reagan even a small fraction of all of \n     the tributes which well up in our minds and hearts today.\n       On behalf of all of your friends assembled to celebrate \n     your life and service, President Reagan, it is my honor to \n     announce that you are the recipient of the James H. Doolittle \n     Award and to express the unbounded gratitude which we have \n     come here to demonstrate today.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues in \nthis august Chamber, especially Senators Feinstein, Hatch, and Webb, \nmembers of the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission, as we pause to pay \ntribute to the indelible legacy of one of America's truly great \nPresidents, Ronald Reagan, who would have turned 100 years old on \nFebruary 6, 2011. It is indeed fitting that as this month of February \nis filled with historic birthdays of transformational Presidents like \nGeorge Washington, who founded our Nation, and Abraham Lincoln, who \npreserved it, that we honor the President who reignited its spirit, \nRonald Reagan.\n  A friend of freedom, a foe of tyranny, and always--always an advocate \nfor America, President Reagan inspired our Nation eloquently and \npowerfully to recapture and reaffirm our founding ideals of individual \nfreedom, common sense, and limited government. He reminded us with \nunshakable optimism that America, as the great experiment in self-\ngovernment, had planted an eternal stake along the timeline of human \nhistory as, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, ``the last best hope of \nEarth.''\n  Many of my colleagues will be sharing their own personal remembrances \nof this threshold figure whom we rank as among the most rarefied of \nAmerican Presidents. What I recall is a President who brought his \npassionate belief in the ideals of America to bear in advancing our \nNation and projecting the hope of freedom as a force for good in the \nworld and a leader who was, contrary perhaps to conventional wisdom, \nnot averse to consensus-building in implementing his vision for this \ncountry.\n  Like those rising to speak in this venerable Chamber today, I \nremember well the arduous challenges facing our Nation in 1980. At the \ntime, I had just completed my freshman term as a Member of the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. Internationally, our country was precariously \nmired in the Cold War, and reeling from the Iran hostage crisis. On the \ndomestic front, our economic vitality had been sapped by double-digit \ninflation, hampered by interest rates that would soar to 21 percent, \nstifled by massive tax burdens including a top tax rate of 70 percent, \nand idled by an energy crisis, exemplified by half mile long lines at \nthe gas pump.\n  Against that backdrop, President Reagan arrived in Washington with an \nunflagging conviction that the greatest untapped potential lies in the \nAmerican people themselves. And by embracing hope, not resignation, he \ncharted a course for America that led to greater prosperity and \nsecurity.\n  As Commander-in-Chief, President Reagan was steadfast in his \nuncompromising foresight and ultimate success in building up our \nmilitary, and displayed unequivocal mettle in confronting the world's \nonly other superpower, laying the foundation for victory in the Cold \nWar. With peace through strength, Ronald Reagan called America to a \npurpose he described in his own hand in 1980. He wrote: ``I believe it \nis our pre-ordained destiny to show all mankind that they too can be \nfree without having to leave their native shore.'' And nothing evoked \nthat immutable faith in humanity and belief in the possibilities for a \nbetter future more than his demand at the Brandenburg Gate forever \netched in our memory: ``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!'' Two years \nlater, that wall did crumble, and not long after, so too did the Soviet \nEmpire.\n  President Reagan battled to reduce the size of the Federal \nbureaucracy--to return tax dollars to the families who had earned them \nand disseminate power out of Washington and back to local governments. \nAnd I well recall meeting with President Reagan numerous times to \ndiscuss issues as far ranging as the MX missile, the budget, women's \nissues, or the impact of proposed trade policies on traditional Maine \nindustries such as potatoes or lumber.\n  And I can attest to the fact that, as a problem solver on every \nfront, President Reagan understood that in order to bring to fruition \nhis core principles and also ensure he could be resolute in \nimplementing his vision for the country, he had to make it happen with \npersuasion and openness. After all, it was President Reagan who \nbelieved ``if I can get 70 or 80 percent of what it is I'm trying to \nget . . . I'll take that and then continue to try to get the rest in \nthe future.''\n  In the end, President Reagan's deeds and words summoned America's \nresolve and essential goodness, and his steady hand guided this great \nland in working to foster liberty and kindle the fires of freedom that \nhave always made America as President Reagan said better than anyone--\n``a shining city on a hill.'' On the occasion of his 100th birthday, we \nexpress our eternal gratitude to President Reagan for his timeless \nleadership of our Nation which he aptly described in his first \ninaugural address as ``the breed called Americans.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/03/senate-section/article/S527-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S527-S531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FINDING COMMONSENSE SOLUTIONS\n\n  Mr. MANCHIN. Madam President, it is my great honor to speak on the \nfloor\n\n[[Page S528]]\n\nfor the first time as a Senator. I am truly humbled by this auspicious \noccasion and the enormous privilege to serve the greatest people in \nAmerica--the people of West Virginia. West Virginia may be a small \nState, but our impact on our Nation's history and our future is far \ngreater than the size of our geography or population.\n  West Virginia was borne out of the turmoil of the Civil War, founded \nby patriots who shared a united pursuit for justice and freedom for \nall. Since this historic beginning, our lands and vast natural \nresources have helped build this Nation. Our people's hard work, \nsacrifices, and patriotism have helped make our Nation stronger and \nsafer. From the mining of the coal that powers our cities to the \nforging of the steel, we have done and will do the heavy lifting that \nhas built America.\n  But this great responsibility to serve as a Senator for West Virginia \nwould never have come about had our State not lost a true giant, our \nbeloved Senator Robert C. Byrd. Senator Byrd was a mentor to me, a \ngreat friend to West Virginia, and a tireless advocate for us all. West \nVirginia would not be the State it is today without the inexhaustible \ncommitment he made every day. Every day without Senator Byrd is a loss \nfor us all, but we can all take comfort that he made not just West \nVirginia a better State, but he made America a greater nation. While no \none will be able to fill his shoes, I hope to honor his memory by \ncontinuing down the path he blazed fighting to better the lives of West \nVirginians and all Americans.\n  I would also like to recognize the unwavering leadership of West \nVirginia's distinguished senior Senator who has left a dynamic mark on \nhistory, my dear friend Senator Jay Rockefeller. He has committed his \nlife to giving outstanding public service to a very grateful State.\n  Throughout my 20 years in public service, I have been fortunate \nbeyond words to have been able to serve the great people of West \nVirginia. Again and again, I have been inspired by West Virginians' \ndevotion to family, their love of country, their belief in hard work \nand sacrifice and, above all, their undeniable spirit to weather any \nstorm by coming together.\n  I have seen our State endure the most devastating challenges--\nhorrific flooding, the tragic mining accidents--and I have seen our \nState in the best of times. But at all times, the spirit of West \nVirginia has never been broken. It is this spirit of working together \nand finding commonsense solutions to any challenge that inspires me. It \nis this spirit that also inspired both sets of my grandparents to \nimmigrate to America--one from Italy and the other from Czechoslovakia. \nMy grandparents came here with the same goals shared by countless \ngenerations of immigrants: to provide a better quality of life for \ntheir families through hard work and sacrifice. They did just that.\n  This is what I learned growing up in West Virginia: When things are \ntough, we do not back down. When we are having trouble paying our \nbills, we do not think of spending more money. When we face difficult \ntimes, we work together to make things better. When faced with a \nproblem, we do not avoid what needs to be done; we try to solve it. \nThis is what West Virginians would call common sense.\n  I was born and raised in Farmington, WV, a small coal mining town. \nNothing will teach you common sense like growing up in a town of less \nthan 500 people. I was educated in our public schools and became the \nfirst member of my family to graduate from college. I met my partner in \nlife, my wife Gayle, in West Virginia. We raised our three children in \nthe State we love.\n  I have long believed in the importance of public service, beginning \nwith my days supporting a volunteer rescue squad in Marin County and \nworking with the United Way more than three decades ago.\n  As for my public life, my first days as a State legislator to my last \ndays as Governor, I realized that none of us in this or any body are \nsimply elected to an office. We are not here for the title. We are here \nto make a difference.\n  I am here to work hard and do this job, and I will work with anyone \nwho offers commonsense solutions on how to best move this country \nforward.\n  In my maiden inaugural address as West Virginia's 34th Governor, I \nsaid that in order for us to be successful, it was going to take the \ncommitment of civic leaders, public employees, businesspeople and \nlaborers, educators, students and parents, lawyers and doctors, \nveterans, young professionals, senior citizens, and Republicans, \nDemocrats, and Independents.\n  At the time, very few thought such a diverse coalition could ever be \nforged, let alone actually accomplish something in the process. But we \nWest Virginians put politics aside. We listened to each other, we \nworked together, and we came together to find common ground and develop \ncommonsense solutions.\n  As a result, we changed the direction of our State for the better. We \ngot our financial house in order. We lowered our taxes for both \nfamilies and businesses. We paid down unfunded liabilities. We created \nthousands of new jobs.\n  There was a surplus every year I was Governor. West Virginia became a \nstronger State and one of the very few fiscally solvent States in this \nNation, all during the worst recession in generations. We solved the \nactual problems that were holding our State back, and those problems \nwere not solved with partisan rhetoric and the mentality ``If you win, \nI lose.'' Not at all. West Virginians came together with a shared \nvision and a common purpose. By working together, we found commonsense \nsolutions. In doing so, we made the future we all share better.\n  This commonsense model is by no means unique to only West Virginia. I \ntruly believe we can develop commonsense solutions to the problems our \nNation faces--commonsense solutions defined not by party or ideology \nbut by doing what is right and what makes sense for our State and our \ncountry. I am committed to doing just that.\n  Of course, cynics will argue that gridlock is inevitable and that \ncommonsense solutions are impossible because the partisan division in \nWashington is too great. I say they are wrong. While the legislative \nreality we face is divided government, it does not mean we must be \ndivided. In fact, since the day I was sworn in as a Senator, I have \nbeen fortunate to sit and talk with many of my Democratic and \nRepublican colleagues. Every time, what I heard was a profound love for \nthis great Nation and an unbreakable commitment to leave this country \nbetter and stronger for future generations.\n  While disagreements in how we solve our Nation's great challenges \nwill occur, they need not divide us. I see these disagreements as an \nopportunity for us to seek the common ground that will unite us and \nmove our Nation forward. I am committed to working with both sides to \ndo what is right to address the serious economic and policy challenges \nwe face as a nation and which are of deep concern to the hard-working \npeople of West Virginia.\n  I heard these concerns loudly and clearly during our most recent work \nperiod. During those 2 weeks in January, I traveled more than 2,100 \nmiles on my ``Call for Common Sense'' tour. I held more than 28 events \nand met with the unemployed, seniors, veterans, small business owners, \nyoung professionals, labor leaders, educators, leaders from our coal \nand energy industry, as well as leaders in manufacturing. I held \ntownhall meetings in Wheeling and Elkins, where West Virginians with \ndiverse concerns came together to share their opinions.\n  Again and again, I heard their serious concerns about the economy and \njobs, the need to protect coal and our energy industry, as well as \ntheir fears from rising debt and deficits. I heard about what \ngovernment was doing or not doing to ensure that we keep our promises \nto our seniors and our veterans.\n\n  What I also heard was a lot of commonsense ideas about what our \ncountry needs to focus on and what we must do to provide a more secure \nfuture for our children and grandchildren.\n  Addressing these top concerns--job creation, deficit reduction, \nenergy independence, and keeping our promises to our veterans and our \nseniors--matters not only to West Virginians and me, but they matter to \nevery one of you and all of America.\n  With respect to job creation, our Nation continues to struggle with \nhigh unemployment and a great recession that feels too much like a \nGreat Depression for the millions of Americans looking for work.\n\n[[Page S529]]\n\n  For too long, we have seen America's manufacturing sector decimated \nby the cruel irony of rules and regulations that make it easier to \ncreate jobs abroad than in the United States. West Virginians are not \nasking for a handout. We are asking for a work permit.\n  We have seen small business owners--the bedrock of our economy and \nour job growth--increasingly strangled by paperwork and regulatory \nobstacles that make doing business more difficult.\n  I believe that to create a thriving economy and jobs, we must lessen \nthe burdens of unnecessary rules and regulations. Bureaucrats should \nnot be able to regulate what has not been legislated. We need to make \ngovernment work smarter and its agencies operate more efficiently and \neffectively. We are not asking government to be our provider; we are \nasking government to be our partner.\n  I truly hope that we in this session of Congress will work together \nto reform our Federal bureaucracy so we can make sure our government \nworks for us instead of the other way around.\n  As a small businessperson, I know firsthand the last thing any small \nbusiness owner needs is more regulation or paperwork. It is why I was \nproud to be one of the lead Democrats to work across the aisle to \ncosponsor legislation with my friend, Senator Mike Johanns, to repeal \nthe 1099 provision from our health care reform. I was even more proud \nto add my voice last night to the many Senators from both parties who \nshowed we can and will work together on commonsense reform of health \ncare legislation. It is why I will continue to work with any of my \ncolleagues to ensure we do everything we can to help small businesses, \nnot just by improving health care reform but also by strengthening the \naccess to the capital and investment that small businesses so \ndesperately need to create jobs.\n  Improving the opportunity for small businesses and boosting job \ncreation will also depend on making difficult choices to rein in \nwasteful spending and rising debt. As we learned last week, the fiscal \n2012 deficit is projected to be $1.5 trillion. The Congressional Budget \nOffice projects that under current law, our national debt will reach \n$25 trillion by 2021.\n  What I heard from my fellow West Virginians is that we must get our \nfinancial house in order. My proud grandfather always told me crippling \ndebt will lead us to make cowardly decisions.\n  America is not a country of cowards. During a recent townhall meeting \nI held in Wheeling, a young college student, worried about getting \nmarried and having a family in the near future, told me she was worried \nbecause of the debt and fiscal burdens her child would inherit. For me, \nthis young woman's words are a tragic reminder of the consequences that \nwill come from inaction. In America, no one should have to have second \nthoughts about starting a family because of his or her worries about \nour Nation's out-of-control spending and rising debt.\n  As I have said before, we as a nation cannot spend ourselves to \nprosperity. We must confront our fiscal situation and be willing to \nmake the right investments and the difficult choices. Doing so for West \nVirginians is just common sense. West Virginians do not go out and \nspend more money when they face tough financial problems. They cut back \nand live within their means. I believe we all in America must do the \nsame, especially in Washington. To that end, I believe we must declare \na bipartisan war against wasteful spending and begin to take \nresponsible steps to scour our Nation's budget for all waste and \nredundant programs.\n  In the coming weeks, I look forward to working with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to develop a commonsense strategy on how to \nbest cut spending and address our rising debt and deficits. While these \nsteps will require difficult decisions, I believe if we put \npartisanship aside and work together, we can have a bipartisan, \ncommonsense plan that improves our fiscal future and sets our Nation on \na new course for fiscal responsibility.\n  But strengthening our economy will also depend on our Nation \nachieving not just independence from debt but real energy independence. \nAs a Senator from a true energy State, the second leading producer of \ncoal with abundant resources, a net exporter of electricity, I am very \nproud of the critical role West Virginians play in providing energy to \nour Nation. I imagine the lights in this very Chamber would be a little \ndimmer were it not for West Virginia and West Virginia coal.\n  Moving forward, achieving true energy independence demands that we \nnot only start realizing the importance coal has in achieving this \ngoal, it means we must stop demonizing one resource and start realizing \nwe must develop a comprehensive plan that utilizes all of our domestic \nresources--coal, natural gas, the development of nuclear, wind, and \nsolar--so we can, once and for all, end our dependence on foreign oil \nwithin this generation.\n  If we are going to truly be secure, we must declare our country to be \nenergy independent, and every State in this great Nation must do its \npart. West Virginia is using every ounce of its natural resources--our \ncoal, our abundant supply of natural gas, biomass, wind, hydroelectric, \nsolar--all of which should be used in the most environmentally \nresponsible way.\n  As a country, we must stop buying oil from the countries that promote \nviolence against their own people and the United States. That is just \ncommon sense.\n  I am also strongly committed to working with my fellow Senators to \ndevelop a realistic and responsible clean energy policy for the future \nthat balances the needs of our country and our environment. I believe \nwe can achieve this commonsense balance while protecting the vital role \nthat coal and natural gas and our other resources play in our Nation's \neconomy.\n  Defending the critical role coal and West Virginia play in our \nNation's energy production is one reason I submitted today my first \npiece of legislation--the EPA Fair Play Act of 2011--which will check \nthe power of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  I believe it is fundamentally wrong for any bureaucratic agency, \nincluding the EPA, to regulate what has not been legislated, to have \nabsolute power to change the rules at the end of the game and to revoke \na permit, as the EPA did in southern West Virginia's Spruce Mine, after \nit was lawfully granted and employees were hired. Giving any agency \nsuch absolute power will have a chilling effect on investment and job \ncreation far beyond West Virginia, and I am proud there is already \nbipartisan support for this legislation.\n  Achieving a brighter future for our Nation will also depend on us \nkeeping our promises to our seniors and veterans. West Virginia's \nseniors and veterans helped build and defend this Nation and we have an \nobligation to them we must never break.\n  As I traveled the State last month, I heard from seniors at \nbreakfasts, in nursing homes, in courthouses, and at townhalls about \ntheir Social Security being at risk. I made it clear to them that I \nwill never support going back on our promises. I also heard there are \nconcerns about living for 2 years without a COLA increase, and I am \ncommitted to finding a commonsense solution--a recalculation of the \nCOLA formula to make sure it reflects the reality of the cost of living \ntoday.\n  To our seniors, Social Security and Medicare are not just government \nprograms, they are promises made by a thankful nation to ensure a \nquality of life well earned from years of hard work and sacrifice.\n  For our veterans, their sacrifices and patriotism know no bounds. \nThey have answered the call of our State and this Nation again and \nagain. They have served with unparalleled honor and distinction. As \nGovernor, I was so proud and honored to have been commander-in-chief of \nthe West Virginia National Guard, the greatest guard in the Nation.\n  West Virginia is one of the most patriotic States in the country and \nwe are proud of the number of veterans and active-duty members who have \nserved our military and served honorably and proudly. During this \nsession of Congress, I am strongly committed to working with my \ncolleagues on legislation that will ensure our veterans and their \nfamilies have the best care and benefits they deserve. That is why I am \nso proud to be a cosponsor with the leader of this bill--Senator Jay \nRockefeller's legislation--giving the National Guard their rightful \nplace on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Our National\n\n[[Page S530]]\n\nGuard and Reserve forces have bravely assumed a major role in our \ncombat missions, and they deserve a seat at the table along with our \nActive-Duty Forces. West Virginia National Guard and Reserve forces are \nthe best in the Nation, and as Governor I was proud to be their \ncommander-in-chief. Not only are they an operational force to be \nreckoned with on the front lines defending our Nation abroad, they are \nalso first on the scene during disasters here at home.\n  Looking ahead, addressing the issues of job creation, rising debt and \ndeficits, energy independence, keeping our promises to our seniors and \nour veterans will demand not just commonsense policies but a renewed \nbipartisan spirit. No matter how large a divide may seem at times, we \nmust work together to find common ground to achieve commonsense \nsolutions. I truly believe Republicans and Democrats and Independents \ncan and will work together to chart a new course for this Nation.\n  It is why I am so proud and honored to have been selected to serve on \nsuch esteemed committees as the Armed Services Committee, the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee, and the Special Committee on Aging. I \nlook forward to working with Senators Levin and McCain, Bingaman and \nMurkowski, Kohl, Corker, and all my committee colleagues to address the \nwide array of issues and challenges that will come before these \nimportant bodies.\n  Whether it is my work on these committees or elsewhere, I am \ncommitted to working hard and being the best Senator I can be for the \nState I love. Like all 99 of my colleagues, who are here for the right \nreasons, I will represent my State to the best of my abilities and work \nto make America stronger and my State proud. I pledge to you that I \nwill not only work with each and every one of my fellow Senators to \nfind commonsense solutions, I will do what I can to usher in a new \nbipartisan spirit in the Senate and in this Congress. In that spirit, I \nwill strive to always find that commonsense bridge that unites our \nparties and reminds us and the world that we, no matter what State we \nmay represent, share one common and unbreakable bond--we are all \nAmericans. We all share a love for this Nation, for our families and \nfor our children, and it is this bond which will unite us in these \ndifficult times and which gives me the hope and optimism that once \nagain we will rise above any challenge we face.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, you have just heard a classic Joe \nManchin speech. It truly is. It is full of optimism, strength, common \npurpose, no problem cannot be solved, and the desire for bipartisan \ncooperation. If anybody can bring our two sides together, surely he can \ndo that. He is aggressive, he is thoughtful, but above all he is \noptimistic. He has a positive approach, a constructive approach. He is \nunafraid of any problem and thrilled about doing whatever kinds of \npublic service he does.\n  We actually have fairly common careers. We both served in the State \nlegislature. He served in both branches. I served in one branch. We \nwere both Secretaries of State and we both ran for Governor. Now we are \nboth in the Senate. So I have known the Manchin family for years.\n  I have known Joe Manchin for years. I have always been proud of his \nwork. He is fun. He loves sports. That is very important in life--very \nimportant in life. He loves sports. He is a devoted Mountaineer. \nSometimes I think he calls the plays for our team. This is going to be \na better Senate because of Joe Manchin, because of his personality.\n  I have watched him in the couple of months he has been here--couple \nof weeks, a month, two--and he has been all over the floor. It is fun \nto watch him. Somebody sits down that side, this side, and all of a \nsudden Senator Joe Manchin is seated right beside him, grabbing an arm, \nmaking a point, establishing a friendship, bonding. That is the way he \nis with our people.\n\n  He comes from the very heart of West Virginia--coal mining country--\nand that is the way he acts. That is the way his father acted. It is \nthe way his family has always acted. They are part and parcel of the \nblood, the beginning and the struggle of West Virginia.\n  One of the reasons I am in public service is because West Virginia is \nalways fighting uphill. People don't pay attention to us the way we \nthink they should. They do not pay attention to what our economy has to \noffer the way they should. That is what motivates Joe Manchin. If you \nare a West Virginian, you simply have to fight harder. If you are a \nWest Virginia public servant, at whatever level, you have to fight \nharder and you have to have an optimistic view. You have to believe \nthings can work. You have to be determined things can work, and you \nhave to see the course all the way to end. That is exactly who Joe \nManchin is.\n  I am incredibly proud to serve with him. I read his speech before. He \nsaid some very nice things about me--all accurate. But because we have \nbeen colleagues for so long, I can tell you--and those who don't know \nhim as well as you will--that he is a real asset to this body. We are a \nbody which now is in the process of struggling to find out who we are. \nIt is not always a pretty sight, but everybody here takes public life \nseriously. Senator Manchin has the problem--some would say the \nopportunity, but not many--to have to be reelected again in 2 years. So \nlife already is more complicated for him, because that is the way the \nelection system has worked out. But he is a bright light, and a young, \naggressive bright light with an absolutely marvelous wife who is now \npart of us.\n  I think he has a unique perspective--it is a classic West Virginia \nperspective--and I look forward to his making an enormous difference in \nthis body, to our State, and to our country. So I welcome him, and I \ncongratulate him on his opening statement.\n  I made an opening statement some years ago. It was actually one of \nthe most boring speeches I ever listened to. But those were the days \nwhen you weren't allowed to make a speech until you had been here for 6 \nmonths, and then everybody turned out. All the old guard--you know, \nsuch as the senior Senator from New York over there. The guys with gray \nbeards, the wise old men, would turn out, and they all planted \nthemselves around here and listened to this incredibly boring speech of \nmine, which was all about a steel company because that is what I \nhappened to be working on at the time.\n  Russell Long stood up afterwards and said: that is the most brilliant \nspeech I ever heard. But those were the days of a certain type of \nprotocol. Times are much faster now. We have to react much faster. We \ndon't have time for that. So Senator Manchin has made his speech, but \nhe goes from his speech to his work, and there he will simply not stop \nuntil we get a better State and a better country.\n  I congratulate him and I welcome him officially and forever to the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I will say that I join the Senator \nfrom New York in welcoming another West Virginia Governor to the \nSenate. Governor Manchin succeeds a man who is irreplaceable in the \nSenate's history--Senator Byrd--but he brings to our Senate the skills \nof a Governor. Governor Rockefeller and I are very partial to those \nskills. We think the Senate needs more Governors. Governors are \naccustomed to looking for consensus, to making things work, to making \nthings happen. We have a different sort of job here in the legislature, \nbut those qualities are important, and especially important now when we \nhave such large challenges to face, such as the fact that we are \nspending $3.7 trillion and collecting $2.1 trillion. All of us are \nshocked by that, and we have to deal with it one way or the other.\n  I welcome him and I welcome his wife, a distinguished educator, to \nthe Senate family. I know she is here today, so we welcome her and look \nforward to learning from her as well.\n  I join Governor Rockefeller in saying it was a great speech. Your \nmaiden\n\n[[Page S531]]\n\nspeech is always your best speech. I remember walking with the \nUniversity of Tennessee basketball coach in Knoxville in the dogwood \nparade--or in some parade before the season started. He was very \npopular before the season began. And Senators who make maiden speeches \nalways have their best speeches then, as basketball coaches always are \nmost popular at the beginning of the year.\n  But I look forward to working with Senator Manchin. He will make a \ntremendous contribution to the Senate. I am glad I was here to hear his \noutstanding address, and I thank the Senator from New York for his \ncourtesy in letting me make my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I too want to join in the accolades for \nour Senator from West Virginia, Senator Manchin. He is one fine guy. I \ngot to know him when he was Governor and then campaigning, and he is \ndoing a wonderful job here already.\n  To have passion about where you come from is noble. I think the great \npoets from Greek times on have written that, and nobody has more \npassion about where he comes from and his roots than Senator Manchin--\nJoe Manchin. You can see it and feel it in everything he does, as we \ncould in this speech today. So I too join in thanking him for coming \nhere. America needs his perspective and his wisdom, and I know he will \nmake a great Senator. We are already great friends, and so I thank him.\n  I also compliment my colleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia \nas well, Senator Rockefeller, for his kind remarks. He is a great \nleader. Joe and I have talked about how you cannot go wrong watching \nand imitating and emulating Senator Rockefeller. With the two of them, \nI believe West Virginia might have the tallest delegation in the \nSenate, not just tall in inches but in stature, ability to get things \ndone, and passion for the State they represent. It is my honor to be \nhere as well and to congratulate Joe on a very fine and introductory \nspeech.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. Madam President, I also rise today to congratulate the \nSenator from West Virginia on his speech and welcome him to the Senate \nand express pleasure in working together. I want to echo the comments \nof Senator Lamar Alexander, the good Senator from Tennessee, as well. \nBeing a former Governor, I actually got to know Joe Manchin in his days \nas Governor. We worked together in his days as Governor and certainly I \nlook forward to working with him as Senator.\n  Our States share many interests. One of those interests is coal. I \nwant to express my intent today to join as a cosponsor on legislation \nregarding EPA regulation that Senator Manchin is putting forward. That \nis a good example where we can work together to create jobs and \nopportunities.

S. 223 is the pending measure.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 21\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendments and call up amendment No. 21.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 21.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To reduce the total amount authorized to be appropriated for \n the Federal Aviation Administration for fiscal year 2011 to the total \namount authorized to be appropriated for the Administration for fiscal \n                               year 2008)\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 108. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR FEDERAL \n                   AVIATION ADMINISTRATION AT FISCAL YEAR 2008 \n                   LEVELS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of, or amendment made \n     by, this title, the total amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by this title to the Federal Aviation \n     Administration for fiscal year 2011 is $14,719,000,000.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Madam President, the amendment I have presented to the \nfloor for the FAA bill is an amendment that I think is a first step \ntoward looking at budgetary restraint. The President, in his State of \nthe Union Address, talked about freezing spending at 2010 levels. If we \nwere to do that at the inflated levels of 2010, we would add $3.8 \ntrillion to the debt over the next 5 years. It does nothing to the \nlooming debt crisis to leave things at 2010 levels because these were \nlevels where we had already increased spending by over 20 percent.\n  What I am asking is a very modest proposal; that is, that all \nspending go back to the 2008 levels. This is not a significant cut. We \nhave increased things dramatically in recent years. FAA has been \nincreased in funding by 50 percent over the last 8 years. We can fund \nthe upgrading of NextGen and various things by looking for cost savings \nwithin the bill. These are things we must do.\n  The American people are demanding cost savings. The American people \ndo not understand why we must pay inflated rates for our wages for the \nworkers on Federal projects. They do not understand why Davis-Bacon \nwages, which were often 30 percent higher than the wages paid on other \nprojects, private projects, must be paid. People are familiar with this \neven in their home States when you talk about the building of schools, \nhow schools cost 20 and 30 percent more because of having to have \ninflated wages and extra regulations, extra paperwork that the Davis-\nBacon laws require.\n  What we are looking for is cost savings everywhere--in this bill, in \nevery bill that comes forward. As long as I am able to and as long as I \nam allowed, we will ask for spending reductions.\n  Many people in this city are for a balanced budget. They say they are \nfor a balanced budget amendment. But how can they be for a balanced \nbudget amendment if they are not willing to cut spending? This is a \nvery small, almost token cut in spending, but we have to do it \neverywhere.\n  When people ask how will you balance the budget, you have to say I \nwill cut spending. This is a very small first step to take the spending \nfor this particular department to 2008 levels. I think it is a step \nlong overdue. It is a chance for Members who say they are for a \nbalanced budget to put their vote where their mouth is.\n  Let's vote to cut spending. Let's vote to cut spending on this bill \nnow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 27\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \namendment No. 27, offered by the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, be \nadded to the list of pending amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Rockefeller], for Mr. \n     Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 27.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S532]]\n\n(Purpose: To increase the number of test sites in the National Airspace \n System used for unmanned aerial vehicles and to require one of those \n      test sites to include a significant portion of public lands)\n\n       On page 96, lines 4 and 5, strike ``at 4 test sites in the \n     National Airspace System by 2012'' and insert ``by 2012 at 10 \n     test sites in the National Airspace System, one of which \n     shall include a significant portion of public lands (as \n     defined in section 203 of the Public Lands Corps Act of 1993 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1722))''.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an alarming trend that \nseems to be developing on this, the first substantive legislation we \nare considering in this new Congress. At least three amendments have \nbeen filed--one of which has already been offered, others expected to \nbe offered shortly--that make unnecessary and misplaced attacks on \nbasic rights and protections for American workers.\n  I find it deeply disturbing that in this difficult economy, some of \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to be chomping at the \nbit to bring American workers down a notch or two more. I don't think \nthe safety of our skies has to come at the expense of fair wages, safe \nworking conditions, and other basic workplace rights. I hope all \nRepublicans in this Chamber don't share that radical viewpoint.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 14\n\n  The first amendment I will focus on today would deny transportation \nsecurity officers basic collective bargaining rights. That amendment \nwas offered by my friend, the distinguished Senator from Mississippi. \nWell, that is fundamentally unfair and a poor way to treat hard-working \npeople who are on the frontlines of our effort to keep America safe.\n  Currently, most Federal employees--including other employees at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, such as Border Patrol, Immigration and \nCustoms officials, and the Coast Guard--all have a voice in the \ndecisions that affect their safety, their families, and their future.\n  Other Federal security employees also have these protections--the \nright to collective bargaining--including Border Patrol agents, Capitol \nPolice officers, Customs and Border inspection officers, and Federal \nProtective Service officers.\n  That is right. All these wonderful policemen we see out here day \nafter day, who are doing a hard job protecting us, protecting all the \npeople who work in the Capitol and all these buildings around here, all \nour Capitol Police officers--guess what--have the fundamental right of \nbeing organized and collectively bargaining for their hours, wages, and \nconditions of employment. Do we feel any less safe because of that? Of \ncourse not.\n  Despite working side by side with these colleagues, transportation \nsecurity officers, TSOs, are denied the rights these other employees \nenjoy. They do not have a voice at work. They do not have statutory \nwhistleblower protections or the right to appeal if they are subject to \ndiscrimination or unfair treatment by their supervisors.\n  The absence of collective bargaining rights has made TSA less \neffective. Our transportation security officers, TSOs, have twice the \naverage rate of injury for Federal employees. A recent Best Places to \nWork survey ranked TSA 220 out of 224 Federal employers, and turnover \nrates are among the highest for any Federal agency. Let me repeat that. \nTurnover rates at TSA are among the highest for any Federal agency.\n  I submit that low morale and high turnover at a frontline security \nagency are a recipe for disaster, and Senator Wicker's amendment will \nonly exacerbate the problem and make it worse.\n  I have heard some deeply disturbing rhetoric from my Republican \ncolleagues about the effects of granting TSOs collective bargaining \nrights. They say collective bargaining rights keep security workers \nfrom performing their jobs effectively. Well, these insinuations are an \ninsult to every man and woman in uniform who works under a collective \nbargaining agreement across this country. To suggest that unionized \nworkers will not do what is best for our country in the event of an \nemergency is scandalous.\n  How many remember that image of 9/11--9/11--when we saw the towers \ncome crumbling down, and we saw men and women running to escape the \ndisaster, running away from it? Who was running into it? Our \nfirefighters, our emergency medical teams, our police officers--all of \nthem unionized, members of organized labor, operating under a \ncollective bargaining agreement.\n  Does anyone question their loyalty, their devotion to duty--many of \nwhom lost their lives or are severely impaired for life because they \ndid their duty--simply because they were union members? We are saying \nsomehow they are less, they are less than others simply because they \nbelong to a union?\n  Also, on 9/11, Department of Defense employees, operating under a \ncollective bargaining agreement, were required to report wherever they \nwere told, regardless of their usual work assignments. No Federal union \ntried to hold up this process in any way to bargain or seek \narbitration, and not one single grievance was filed to challenge the \nredeployments after the fact--not one.\n  Increasing employees' voices at work has the potential to improve the \nfunctioning of our security systems. Think about this: When you travel \nabroad, you go through screening devices. Go to London, go to Paris, go \nto Luxembourg, go to Rome, go to Tokyo, go to Brisbane, go to Sydney, \ngo anywhere around the world where they have airport screeners and--\nguess what--they all work under collective bargaining agreements. The \nunions that represent these screeners have worked hand in hand with \ntheir governments to improve security procedures and to make our skies \nsafer.\n  Senator Wicker referenced a 2003 memo from the Under Secretary of \nTransportation for Security for the rationale for his bill. Well, \ncurrently TSA is reviewing that 2003 decision and is expected to make a \ndetermination soon about the relationship between safety and collective \nbargaining. I think we should defer to that agency's expertise on this \nissue rather than hastily approving an amendment that would limit the \nadministration's ability to adapt.\n  Collective bargaining, I believe, is the best way to bring dignity, \nconsistency, and fairness to a workplace. It will make our TSO \nworkforce more safe and stable, enhancing the security of our skies. \nRestoring these essential rights is long overdue. I urge my colleagues \nto oppose the Wicker amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Paul be \nrecognized to call up amendment No. 19 which deals with the Davis-Bacon \nissue; that there be 30 minutes of debate equally divided between \nSenators Paul and Rockefeller or their designees; that upon the use or \nyielding back of time, there be 10 minutes of debate equally divided on \nthe Whitehouse amendment No. 8 dealing with laser pointers; that this \ntime be equally divided between Senators Whitehouse and Hutchison or \ntheir designees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the Whitehouse amendment, to be followed \nby a vote in relation to the Paul amendment; further, that there be no \namendments or points of order in order to the amendments prior to the \nvotes; and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. That being the case, we will have votes probably around \n5:30, give or take a few minutes. Everyone should be alerted that there \nis likely to be some time yielded back. If that is the case, we will \nbegin voting sooner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n[[Page S533]]\n\n                            Amendment No. 19\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to temporarily set \naside the pending amendment so I may call up my amendment, amendment \nNo. 19, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Paul] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 19.\n\n  Mr. PAUL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit the application of the Davis-Bacon Act in the case \n                   of projects funded under this Act)\n\n       On page _, between lines _ and _, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. NONAPPLICATION OF DAVIS-BACON.\n\n       None of the funds made available under this Act (or an \n     amendment made by this Act) may be used to administer or \n     enforce the wage-rate requirements of subchapter IV of \n     chapter 31 of part A of subtitle II of title 40, United \n     States Code (commonly referred to as the ``Davis-Bacon Act'') \n     with respect to any project or program funded under this Act \n     (or amendment).\n\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered to the FAA bill \nis an amendment to exempt the FAA from the Davis-Bacon restrictions. \nMost of us know, when we talk about schools being built in our district \nor in our neighborhood, the cost of schools and anything built under \nDavis-Bacon determines prevailing wages. This means if you are a \ncarpenter making usually $14 an hour in Bowling Green, KY, the \ngovernment comes in and says, Well, you need to pay $35 an hour. It \ninflates the cost of building projects and it does us no good as a \nsociety. What happens is we build less schools, less airports, and we \nare unable to have enough money in our country to provide for the \nthings we want. We can build 20 to 30 percent more airports if we don't \nforce union wages that are above the market wages on our government \nprojects.\n  I think it is inexcusable, at a time when we run a deficit of between \n$1.5 trillion and $2 trillion in a year, that we want to inflate the \ncost of government projects. The marketplace should determine market \nwages, and we should have a marketplace that allows us to build more \nairports and more schools.\n  I think it is not a good idea to have the government get involved by \nforcing wages above the market wage. If you pass this and you allow an \nexemption from Davis-Bacon, you will save about $500 million just in \nthis department. If you would allow this across government, you would \nsave $11 billion.\n  My point in bringing this up is that this won't balance the budget, \nbut you have to start somewhere. Everybody says we have to do \nsomething, but nobody is willing to do anything that will reduce \ngovernment expenditures. I think this is one small step forward, and if \nyou can't vote for this one small step forward, you are not serious \nabout balancing the budget. That is why the American people are unhappy \nwith us in Congress, because we won't do anything, we won't step \nforward, we will not be bold, and we will not start cutting spending.\n  I recommend to the Senate that we pass this amendment as one small \nstep forward but an important step toward trying to get our fiscal \nhouse in order.\n  I yield to Senator Hutchison.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, how much time does Senator Paul \ncontrol?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 12\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to withhold until the other \nside has had a chance to speak. Then I will take part of Senator Paul's \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, does the Senator from Iowa wish to \nspeak?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I will. Mr. President, I assume the chairman of the \ncommittee yields me whatever time I want to consume, and I am reserving \nsome time also for the chairman.\n  Here we go again. It is not the first time we have had an attack on \nDavis-Bacon. I am sure it will not be the last. Again, we have to get \nthe facts out and not be led astray by misconceptions and by lack of \nreally good data.\n  The fact is that Davis-Bacon doesn't just create good jobs, it saves \ngovernment money in Federal construction costs. Again, my friend from \nKentucky has said this is going to cost more money. Well, I would like \nto see the studies because we have had a lot of studies on this over \nthe years, and they show that prevailing wage laws lead to reductions \nin the costs and responsible contractors that pay workers at least a \nprevailing wage, higher productivity, and fewer safety problems.\n  We need Davis-Bacon so that our infrastructure projects are built \nsafely for the hundreds of millions of Americans who rely on them, \nbecause contractors that pay prevailing wages hire higher skilled and \nbetter trained workers, and they produce safer buildings, airports, \nbridges, roads, and tunnels. Senator Paul's amendment would undermine \npublic safety by making it much easier for less responsible contractors \nto build important public infrastructure projects with shoddy \nconstruction.\n  Congress has rejected attacks on Davis-Bacon before, going clear back \nto 1931. It should do so again. In the most recent vote in the Senate, \nin 2007, a bipartisan vote of Democrats and Republicans voted against \nan amendment to strip Davis-Bacon protection from funds to repair \nbridges. There has always been bipartisan support in this body for \nDavis-Bacon. In fact, we ought to read history. Senator Davis and \nRepresentative Bacon were both Republicans. It was originally a \nRepublican bill. I hope my colleagues will recognize the value of \ncontinuing to support fair wages in these difficult economic times.\n  This is the wrong time to start pulling the rug out from underneath \nour construction workers. Our fair wages that we have under Davis-Bacon \nare a key component of middle-class security for working families. Now \nis the wrong time to be attacking these essential protections.\n  Prevailing-wage laws, such as Davis-Bacon, require that workers be \npaid the prevailing local wages and benefits. These laws ensure that \nfederally supported construction projects don't undermine local labor \nstandards. By removing these protections, Senator Paul's amendment \nwould drive down wages, creating a dangerous race to the bottom. Again, \nthat is the wrong approach to take in this troubled economy, the wrong \napproach to take for worker safety, the wrong approach to take for \nmaking sure what we build with taxpayer money is built well, with well-\ntrained, well-motivated, and well-paid workers.\n  We want a real recovery. These working families--construction workers \nwho haul steel, pour concrete, build the bridges and the walls and do \nall these things--build the infrastructure of our country. We want to \nmake sure they have good, family-supporting jobs, with fair wages and \ndecent benefits. That is what Davis-Bacon is about.\n  I urge a defeat of the Paul amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment also. There \nare reasons for Davis-Bacon. One of them, for example, is it protects \ncommunities and employers by keeping the wage standards of low-wage \nareas from being imported into high-wage areas, and also the reverse. \nWhat do I mean by that? Obviously, West Virginia has a very different \nwage level than New York or Maryland or many parts of Virginia. They \ncould come in and bid on a contract and either bid very low and do a \nbad job or bid very high and get it, for whatever reason. This prevents \nartificially inflating wages.\n  The inference was that it costs more to have Davis-Bacon. Some people \ndon't like Davis-Bacon, and I understand that. But the law specifically \nrequires that all workers must be paid no less than the prevailing \nwages and benefits that are paid in similar projects in that area. So \nit attaches the Davis-Bacon concept onto the regional local wage area. \nVirginia and Maryland are not far from West Virginia, so people want \ncontracts, and they are likely to bid.\n  Since it was enacted, Davis-Bacon has protected taxpayers and workers \nfrom low-ball contractors who try to compete. You know that song. We \nall see it so much. They come in and bid a\n\n[[Page S534]]\n\nlow price, and they get it, and there are all kinds of extra things \nadded on--cost-plus. It doesn't happen under this; it isn't allowed. So \nthe law effectively makes sure the taxpayers get their money's worth. \nAs the Senator from Iowa indicated, numerous studies indicate that \nprojects built under Davis-Bacon are more likely to be completed on \ntime, within budget, and with fewer repair costs.\n  So this is a very significant amendment. But it is not about bilking \nthe taxpayers. It is protecting the taxpayers. Davis-Bacon puts the \ncontract wages in line with what is prevailing locally. That is the \nlaw. It makes sense to me. I strongly oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the Paul \namendment.\n  The Davis-Bacon Act was passed in 1931. We had a very different labor \nand diversity of wages. There were not minimum wages to the extent we \nhave today. Today, every State has a different cost of living, \ndifferent standards of what kinds of construction requirements there \nare, and thousands of buildings in this country are built in the \nprivate sector very safely, very efficiently. But when Davis-Bacon \nkicks in, for a government program, it skews the entire wage scale of \nthat community, causing an inflation to other projects.\n  The studies I have seen prove that Davis-Bacon increases costs \nthroughout a community because it sets an artificial standard, not \ntaking into account the cost of living in that area. No one can argue \nthat the cost of living in New York is very different from the cost of \nliving in Texas or West Virginia or Tennessee. We should not be trying \nto change the norm in an area by artificially inflating the costs, and \nthat is exactly what Davis-Bacon does.\n  If we are going to hear the voice of the people, who said last \nNovember: We are tired of business as usual in Washington and in \nCongress, we will pass the Paul amendment because this is the first \nstep toward efficiency--to say that the projects going forward in this \nbill will not be subject to Davis-Bacon; they will be subject to \nbidding on contracts. And bidders do not necessarily win because they \nhave the lowest bid. The person who is doing the contracting has the \nleeway to take into account quality and the reputation of the builder. \nSo it is not as if the lowest bidder gets every bid. It is a process \nthat is orderly. But Davis-Bacon does inflate the cost.\n  I think the Paul amendment is an excellent one. I think it will show \nthat the people in this Senate got the message in November--that we \ndon't have to sit with a 1931 law that is no longer necessary because \nthe protections are in place, and we need to build our taxpayer-funded \nfacilities in the most efficient way that saves taxpayer dollars.\n  I support the Paul amendment and hope it will pass.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nKentucky. He is on the mark. Our priorities are two: One, to make it \neasier and cheaper to create private sector jobs; two, to reduce the \nFederal debt.\n  The Paul amendment makes it easier and cheaper to create private \nsector jobs. Why? Because it permits more contractors to hire more \npeople to do more work at the lowest possible cost to the taxpayer.\n  Also, according to the General Accounting Office, it will help lower \nthe Federal debt. In fact, the GAO has recommended changes to the \nDavis-Bacon Act as a means for trimming the Federal deficit. Leaving \nthe law the way it is, applying the Davis-Bacon law to construction \nprojects all over the country, will mean fewer jobs, less construction, \nhigher taxes, and a higher Federal debt.\n  Passing the Rand Paul amendment will mean that we will make it easier \nand cheaper to create private sector jobs. Day after day in this \nSenate, we should be acting on legislation that remembers that in \nTennessee, for example, we have had 24 straight months of unemployment \nabove 9 percent.\n  I am glad to be a cosponsor of the Paul amendment because, in my \nState and across the country, it will make it easier and cheaper to \ncreate private sector jobs instead of adding to the debt, creating \nfewer jobs, less construction, slower airport contracts, and higher \ntaxes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I may, I ask the Senator from \nKentucky if he is ready to yield back time and I ask the majority if \nthey are ready to yield back time on the Paul amendment. If so, we can \nmove on to the Whitehouse amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Texas, I would like to have an \nadditional 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will reserve an additional 2 minutes for Senator \nPaul, and we can close this out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I heard my friend from Tennessee--and he \nis my friend--talk about how this will be cheaper, it would be cheaper \nto build things. The new Senator from Kentucky referred to that too.\n  Sometimes cheapest is not always the least expensive. Sometimes \ncheapest can turn out to be the most expensive, depending upon the \nquality of the work, how long these projects are, and whether they are \ndone on time.\n  I have a friend in Iowa who happens to be one of the largest \ncontractors in the Midwest, if not in the entire country. He has big \nearth-moving equipment. He is a huge contractor. He probably does work \nin Tennessee, Kentucky, Texas, and everyplace else.\n  He told me once: I will only hire union labor. I asked him why. He \nsaid: Because they have a great apprenticeship and training program. \nPlus, he said: I know I get well-trained workers on my construction \njobs.\n  He said: I don't mind Davis-Bacon because I get apprenticeship, I get \ntraining, plus I get workers I don't have to look over their shoulders \nall the time. I get quality work done.\n  He said: I didn't get big by undercutting everybody. I got big \nbecause I did good work, and I got good quality.\n  He is able to go head to head with nonunion contractors, and he has \nbecome the largest contractor because of the quality of his work.\n  That is why I say to my friend, sometimes the cheapest is not always \nthe best in terms of the interest of the taxpayers and of this country.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, this amendment is not about quality. It is \nnot about unions. It is about a Federal Government that is spending too \nmuch money, and it is about an enormous debt we have. It is about \nstarting somewhere.\n  People agree that you save money if you do not have to pay the \nprevailing wage. Everybody knows it. The gallery knows it. The public \nknows it. In Kentucky, schools cost 30 percent more if you have \nprevailing wage. You build less schools. Your money does not go as far. \nIt is not a good efficient use of your money.\n  With regard to quality, to imply that you cannot have quality unless \nit is union labor, unless it is prevailing wage, completely ignores \nwhat goes on in our economy; that is to say, the 90 percent of things \nthat are made in our country that are nonunion and nonprevailing wage \ndo not have quality. The argument is specious. It has no substance.\n  What this is about is making a first step toward controlling our \ndeficit. We need to cut costs in government. If we cannot do these \nlittle things--this would save $500 million on this bill. It is a small \namount in Washington. It is a large amount to us in Kentucky, to \nindividuals. It is a small amount, but it is a first step toward saying \nwe are going to be responsible as a Congress and say: Enough is enough; \nwe cannot live with $2 trillion deficits each year. It is out of \ncontrol. We are headed toward financial ruin, and this is one first \nstep forward.\n  I hope the rest of the Senate will support this amendment to exempt \nfrom the FAA bill the considerations of Davis-Bacon.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back on the pending \namendment?\n\n[[Page S535]]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. We yield back all time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nPaul amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment. I ask \nfor the yeas and nays on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be set aside.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 8\n\n  There is now 10 minutes evenly divided on the Whitehouse amendment. \nWho yields time?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to speak to this amendment \nwhich makes it a Federal criminal offense to target an aircraft with a \nlaser.\n  The prevalence of this activity has increased enormously. According \nto the FAA, there were 2,836 instances of lasers aimed at airplanes in \n2010, which is a ninefold increase over the past 5 years.\n  The consequences of one of these attacks in the cockpit of an \naircraft are significant. I am reading from a news report:\n\n       Glendale, CA, police Sgt. Steve Robertson remembers the \n     first time he encountered a laser strike. He says his \n     helicopter was hit by a powerful beam of green light one \n     night while he was on patrol. ``It immediately [lit] up the \n     whole cockpit and it hit both of my eyes and burned both of \n     my corneas,'' said the veteran pilot. ``Instantly, I was \n     blinded. It felt like I was hit in the face with a baseball \n     bat--just an intense, burning pain.''\n       Robertson was momentarily incapacitated and would have \n     crashed if his co-pilot hadn't been able to land the chopper.\n\n  Thankfully, he recovered from his injuries.\n  I express my appreciation to both Senators Boxer and Feinstein who \nare cosponsors of this amendment. Clearly, it is a major issue in \nCalifornia. I thank Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois who is the lead \nRepublican cosponsor.\n  O'Hare Airport is one of the busiest airports in the country. It had \n98 of these events take place in 2010.\n  Senator Durbin also of Illinois is a cosponsor as well. I express my \nappreciation to him.\n  The House has passed a similar measure. There is every reason to \nbelieve that if we take this step we will be able to help defend our \nairspace from these attacks. Obviously, they are most dangerous near \nairports when planes are taking off or landing or in low level flight, \nas police sergeant Steve Robertson was.\n  It has the support of the National Association of Police Agencies and \nthe Pilots Association.\n  I hope very much that my colleagues will vote in favor of it and take \nthis simple step to protect our aircraft travel from a new and emerging \nrisk.\n  Does the chairman wish to speak? I yield back our time but for the 2 \nminutes to the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this is an enormously important \namendment. To be quite truthful, I think Senator Whitehouse would have \nbeen satisfied with just having it accepted by both sides, which it \nwould have been. I said: Please bring it to a vote.\n  This is a national security threat. The technology is going to get \nmuch better. He spoke about the pilot who was temporarily blinded, \nwhose corneas were affected. As the technology increases, it is going \nto blind pilots permanently. Maybe if they are accurate, they can get \nboth the pilot and the copilot.\n  All of this will take place around airports where there is obviously \nroom to sight in on these people taking off and landing, particularly \nlanding, I would think. It is absolutely a threat, and the numbers in \nthe last 2 years absolutely prove it.\n  I wish to emphasize, yes; this is on a Federal aviation bill, but it \ncould be on an Armed Services Committee bill. It could be on an \nIntelligence Committee bill. It could be on a Homeland Security \nCommittee bill. It is a very powerful vote because there will be a \nfuture for terrorists in this business, so the criminal penalties have \nto be established. The Whitehouse amendment, which I strongly support, \ndoes that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I support the Whitehouse amendment. It \nwill add to the security of our aircraft flying. I urge my colleagues \nto support it as well.\n  If time has been yielded back, I call for a vote.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  If all time is yielded back, the question is on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 8. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                                 Egypt\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will not send the resolution to the desk. \nIt is currently being hotlined in both offices. It may actually be \ndealt with in a short period in wrap-up. Senator McCain and I wish to \nspeak briefly to this resolution.\n  This is a resolution which expresses the deep concern of the Senate \nover the events taking place in Egypt at this time. We acknowledge the \nlong relationship and importance of the relationship with Egypt. Most \nimportant, we call attention to the need at this moment for the \nGovernment of Egypt and for all the parties involved to take every step \npossible to avoid violence, to respect the rights of people to \nassemble, to express their rights, to fight for and demonstrate for a \ntransition in their lives and in their country.\n  This is now a many-days-long demonstration, the longest in the \nhistory of Egypt. Hundreds have been killed, many thousands wounded. It \nis our hope--and we express this--that over the next days, responsible \nleadership will stand on all sides and work toward a transition process \nthat respects people's rights and that builds a future that meets the \naspirations expressed so passionately in the streets of cities all \nacross Egypt. We hope this process will respect the right of \njournalists to report on the events in Egypt to the people of Egypt as \nwell as the people of the world who are watching. We ask the leadership \nthere to find a path by which they can transition to some kind of \ninterim government over these next days that will build toward \nelections that can be free and fair and set an example for how any \ncountry in this kind of crisis can deal with it and, most importantly, \nmeet the aspirations of their people.\n  I am privileged to join with Senator McCain, Senator Graham, and \nothers in an effort to try to send this message from the Senate about \nour deep concern over the violence and our hopes and prayers that in \nthe next hours and days responsible leadership will step up and do what \nis right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Kerry, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, myself, and \nothers, we will send this resolution to the desk. I will send it after \nI finish my remarks. We will not be seeking a vote at this time because \nwe are hotlining the resolution.\n  This is a seminal moment in the history of the Middle East and the \nworld. We are seeing an uprising and a movement that spread across the \nentire Middle East. Egypt is the heart and soul of the Arab world. What \nwe have been watching unfold in the last week has grieved and concerned \nall of us. There is every possibility that this crisis lurches into a \ngenuine massacre. We cannot afford that. We must do everything in our \npower to see that it stops. Our resolution urges the Egyptian military \nto demonstrate maximum professionalism and restraint and emphasizes the \nimportance of working to peacefully restore common order, while \nallowing for free and nonviolent freedom of expression. We do not want \nthe Egyptian military to encourage thugs. We do not want the Egyptian \nmilitary to be a party to increased violence.\n  We are concerned about an interim government. That interim government \nmust be representative of all democratic forces within Egypt. In the \nresolution, we call on President Mubarak to immediately begin an \norderly and peaceful transition to a democratic political system, \nincluding the transfer of power to an inclusive interim caretaker \ngovernment in coordination with leaders from Egypt's opposition, civil \nsociety, and the military.\n  Again, I emphasize, I know my colleagues know, the Egyptian military \nis the most respected institution in Egypt. They risk turning the \npeople of Egypt against them unless they act as a genuine peacemaker in \nEgypt.\n  I have been involved in Middle Eastern affairs for many years. I have \ntraveled many times to the region. What is happening is a seminal \nevent. How it turns out will affect the future of the 21st century. If \nEgypt turns to radical Islamic extremism and other countries as well, \nit poses not only a threat to America's national security but to the \nwell-being of tens or hundreds of millions of people who have the God-\ngiven right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as we \nguarantee to all people.\n  I thank Senator Kerry again. We are sending a message from the Senate \nthat I am sure the overwhelming majority of my colleagues will agree \nwith: Stop the bloodletting. Let's start a peaceful transition to a \nfree and open society and a government that can regain and hold the \ntrust of the people of Egypt. This is a seminal moment and one that I \nbelieve the future of peace in the world will be relied upon.\n  I thank my colleagues. We look forward to further discussion. We \nwanted to bring this up now. It is very important, since tomorrow could \nbe a very critical day in the history of the Egyptian people's struggle \nfor independence and freedom.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I congratulate and compliment my \ncolleagues from Massachusetts and Arizona. This resolution represents \nthe best of the Senate. We have two people who are very well versed in \nthe ways of the world and understand America and what we stand for. \nThey have crafted a document I would like to cosponsor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be added as a cosponsor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Tomorrow is a big day for the future of Egypt. Senator \nMcCain said it well: To the Army, I doubt if they are watching C-SPAN, \nbut they have a chance to bring order out of chaos and to continue to \nhave respect throughout the world and within the borders of Egypt. Do \nnot let this opportunity pass. An interim government should be formed \nquickly, as this resolution urges. When it comes to the Egyptian \npeople, I have faith that the young women who are risking life and limb \nin the square tonight and tomorrow are not doing so to be required to \nwear a burqa in the future. I have faith that the young men who are \nrisking life and limb tonight and tomorrow would not want such a fate \nfor their daughters and their wives. I have great respect for Islam. \nRadical Islam, similar to any other form of radical religion, is a \nthreat to all we hold dear. The Egyptian people have a chance to chart \na new way for the future of the Arab world and the world at large. This \nresolution is a statement of principle by the Senate that we stand with \nyou and all those who believe in tolerance and the dignity of mankind.\n  This statement is bipartisan. It is well thought out. I think it \nreflects where the American people want to be in relation to Egypt.\n  To those in Congress who want to act quickly about defunding our \nrelationship with Egypt, please consider the consequences of such \naction. Give the Egyptian people a chance to work this out. Give the \nArmy a chance to bring order out of chaos. It is in our national \nsecurity interest that we have a stable Egypt. The army is the most \nrespected institution.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it time to urge democracy and freedom and not the \ntime to threaten? There is plenty of time to threaten the Government \nand people of Egypt with reprisal. The time now is to urge democracy \nand freedom.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Well said. It is now time for the United States to say \nwhat we are for and urge the Egyptian people to realize their hopes and \ndreams and that we want to be their partner. Now is not the time to \nsever the partnership. Now is the time to stand by a future partnership \nthat would be beneficial to both countries. This resolution is a \nstatement of principle that I hope the Egyptian people will see as an \nacknowledgment by the Senate that we are with them when it comes to \ntheir best hopes and dreams.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I also ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor of the resolution.\n\n[[Page S538]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I also commend these two great leaders, Senator Kerry \nand Senator McCain, for coming together on this resolution. A lot of \npeople try to bring us apart in this institution. But they were counted \nhere today with one voice. I was in Vietnam with Senator McCain. I \ncouldn't get over all the people who came up to him and still talked \nabout the work he and Senator Kerry had done together, with POWs and \nother issues, how they had gone to Vietnam together. Well, once again, \nthey have come together at a time of great crisis to have the Senate \ntell the people of Egypt that we are there with them and we are behind \nthem.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Hawaii is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 14\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly oppose Senator \nWicker's amendment to prevent Transportation Security Administration \nemployees from being able to collectively bargain.\n  There is no need for the Senate to use valuable time considering this \nissue right now. Congress gave the Administrator of TSA the authority \nto determine if and how collective bargaining should take place in the \nAir Transportation Security Act, which established TSA in the wake of \nthe attacks of September 11.\n  Administrator Pistole, who has a strong national security background, \nis evaluating this issue in detail and I believe we should let him \ncomplete his review.\n  Although I believe Administrator Pistole should be given time to make \nthe decision on granting collective bargaining rights to TSA employees, \nI want to address the arguments some are making in opposing TSA \nworkers' rights.\n  I believe giving TSA employees a greater voice in the workplace would \nbe good for security. TSA suffers from low morale, high attrition, and \nhigh injury rates.\n  National security is jeopardized when agencies charged with \nprotecting our safety continually lose trained and talented employees \ndue to workplace injuries and a lack of employee protections.\n  Moreover, the vast majority of Federal employees have collective \nbargaining rights. This includes other employees of the Department of \nHomeland Security performing similar security functions, such as Border \nPatrol agents, Federal Protective Service officers, and Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement officers.\n  In addition, there currently are some private airport screeners with \nfull collective bargaining rights. Airport security is handled by \ncontract screeners in a handful of airports, including some large ones. \nThese contract employees have full collective bargaining rights. \nIronically, some have recently been arguing for contracting security at \nmore airports, saying the security is better there. To be clear, I \nstrongly support federalized airport security, but if there are any \nbenefits where security is contracted, perhaps it is because the \nscreeners are unionized, not because they are privatized.\n  Proponents of collective bargaining restrictions say they are \nnecessary so that TSA has the flexibility to respond to emergencies. \nThat is simply not true. Under Federal law, agencies are provided \nauthority to take any actions they deem necessary to carry out their \nmissions during an emergency. Granting collective bargaining rights \nwould not in any way hinder TSA's flexibility to transfer employees in \nthe event of a national emergency.\n  Moreover, under civil service laws, TSA employees, as other Federal \nemployees, would be prohibited from striking if they are granted \ncollective bargaining rights.\n  We all remember the heroic first responders who rushed into the World \nTrade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001. I vividly recall \nthe Capitol Police officers working frantically to protect our safety \nwhen it appeared the fourth plane could strike the Capitol. These were \nunionized workers. Like the heroes of 9/11, the brave men and women of \nTSA have dedicated themselves to protect our security. There is \nabsolutely no basis for the Republicans to argue that TSA employees \nwould invoke union contract restrictions rather than rise to the \noccasion in an emergency.\n  I urge all Senators to protect TSA employees' opportunity to have a \nvoice in their workforce by opposing the Wicker amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I was unable to vote today because of a \nfamily emergency. I want to be clear that if I were present in the \nChamber, I would have voted in favor of Senator Sheldon Whitehouse's \namendment No. 8 to provide penalties for pointing laser pointers at \nairplanes. Instances of this dangerous practice doubled last year, and \nI believe we need to take the strong actions necessary to protect our \nflight crews and the flying public from dangers such as this.\n  I also would have voted in support of the motion to table Senator \nRand Paul's amendment No. 19 to prohibit any funds made available by \nthe FAA Reauthorization Act to be used to administer or enforce wage-\nrate requirements with respect to any project or program funded under \nthe bill. I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to protect American workers, especially in these tough \neconomic times.\n\n[[Page S539]]\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President. I am in strong support of Senator \nLevin's effort to repeal the enhanced tax form 1099 reporting \nrequirements enacted in the Patient Protection and Affordable Health \nCare Act. Since passage of the bill, I have heard from hundreds of \nRhode Island small business owners about the paperwork and record-\nkeeping costs of complying with the new 1099 standards. The provision, \nwhich was intended to cut down on fraud and generate revenue, has \nsimply proven too burdensome on small businesses. I support the repeal \nof the new 1099 provision and am pleased to have voted in favor of the \nLevin amendment which would do so.\n  While I support the Levin approach to repealing the 1099 provision, I \ncannot lend my support to Senator Stabenow's amendment which would pay \nfor the repeal by rescinding $44 billion in appropriated funds. The \nrescission could endanger priorities for Rhode Island like funds \nappropriated for water infrastructure, housing assistance, and to help \nRhode Island recover from the historic floods of March 2010. Senator \nReed and I fought hard to bring Federal help to Rhode Islanders \nstruggling to rebuild after the worst flood in 200 years, and I simply \nam not willing jeopardize that relief.\n  Once again, I fully support the repeal of the enhanced 1099 reporting \nrequirements, and I hope we can pass a measure to do that without \nendangering funding for critical programs like flood recovery.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I support Senator McConnell's effort to \nfully repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Act. I opposed the \nfinal passage of this new law because it was the product of a seriously \nflawed process that was rushed on a host of artificial timelines \nresulting in fundamentally defective policy that did not resolve the \nissue of affordability of health care in Maine and across the country. \nIn addition, the preponderance of the beneficial reforms and subsidies \ndo not kick in until 2014, so between now and then most Mainers will \ncontinue to experience what they know all too well--a continuation of \npremiums that have skyrocketed by 426 percent over the past decade and \ndiminishing competition and plan choices in our markets.\n  Regrettably, what the Democratic majority rushed through the Senate \nfloor last Congress was a 2,740-page bill, which we were forced to \ncomplete by Christmas day after a mere 21 days on the floor. As the \nresult of this massive bill, we have a bloated and overextended new law \nthat dramatically augments the reach of the Federal Government in \nhealth care. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the new health \nreform law mandates 41 separate rulemakings, at least 100 additional \nregulatory guidance documents, and 129 reports. In addition, the new \nlaw is paid for with a job-killing $210 billion increase in Medicare \ntaxes on businesses and an estimated $500 billion overall increase in \ntaxes at this time of economic peril.\n  I happen to believe the details matter of what we do here in \nCongress. And I also believe the American people would agree. It is not \nirrational for them to expect that we actually know what is in this \nbill, how it will work, and whether we can reasonably expect it to be \neffective and bring down costs for the American people. And there is \nmounting evidence that it will not, as a recent study projects an 8.8-\npercent premium increase for employer-sponsored coverage in 2011--up \nfrom 6.9 percent in 2010 and 6 percent in 2009--and out-of-pocket \npremium costs for employees will rise 12.4 percent next year.\n  During consideration of the health reform bill, I had serious \nconcerns about affordability--and whether an affordable coverage option \nwould be available to all Americans in the private insurance market. \nThat is why I requested an analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office, CBO, back in December 2009, with a State-specific \nanalysis of premium affordability, but regrettably a complete analysis \nwas never provided.\n  So I support efforts to fully repeal of the health care reform law. \nAnd because the majority has endorsed once again their misguided health \nlaw by defeating today's full repeal vote, I will also support targeted \nefforts to repeal other provisions--starting with the onerous 1099 \nmandate that we have just repealed that would have required millions of \nbusinesses to send billions of new information reporting forms to the \nIRS and other businesses. I want to commend Senator Johanns for his \nrecognition of this onerous burden and his tireless efforts to repeal \nit. Since last summer he has done a yeoman's job of leading on this \nissue.\n  If this amendment was not adopted here in the Senate, every business \nin America, starting in 2012, must report to the IRS on business \npurchases that exceed a threshold of only $600 per vendor or supplier--\nfor purchases of supplies and equipment and also services ranging from \ncell phone coverage to window washing to utilities.\n  This new mandate was imposed in the health reform law, yet it had \nabsolutely nothing to do with health insurance reform. What it does is \nmake the Federal Government a more intrusive and burdensome presence in \nevery aspect of American business--which is the very last thing \nAmerican business needs during these tumultuous economic times. What \nsmall firms are clamoring for is certainty and relief from these \nextreme regulatory nuisances. They need the Federal Government to help \nfoster an entrepreneurial environment under which they can do what they \ndo best--create new jobs--and not saddle them with an incessant and \nunnecessary paperwork burden such as this new 1099 filing requirement.\n  Missing from the amendment we just passed is the fact that rental \nreal estate would still be subject to this 1099 reporting requirement. \nRental real estate was added to this paperwork morass as part of the \nSmall Business Jobs Act last year at a time when the 1099 reporting \nquagmire was already known. Yet, remarkably, the majority forged ahead \nregardless and inexplicably expanded rather fixing this problem. For \nthose parts of the country that have tourism as an economic foundation, \nrental real estate is a major factor, and for Maine, for which the \nState motto is ``Vacationland'' this is a major problem--and it is \nsomething we need to repeal this year.\n  We also need to strike the employer mandate from the bill, which is \nsomething of critical importance to me as ranking member of the Senate \nSmall Business Committee. Under the new law, starting in 2014, firms \nwith more than 50 workers would have to pay $2,000 per employee with \njust the first 30 employees exempted. And if that is not enough, part-\ntime workers will be counted in determining if the mandate would apply. \nThat means countless more middle-sized firms such as restaurants and \nretailers would be subject to the mandate, which will raise $52 billion \nin revenue.\n  Mr. President, exactly how is this going to help our Nation's \ngreatest job generators--our small businesses--to lead us out of this \nrecession, especially since we are also now going to hit them with \nincreased Medicare taxes? And that is another tax increase we must \nrepeal. That is right--starting in 2013, the new law includes $87 \nbillion in Medicare taxes that disproportionally harm small businesses \nbecause they apply to the income those businesses would normally \nreinvest. Plain and simple, this 0.9 percentage point increase in \nMedicare HI payroll taxes, coupled with a 3.8-percent Medicare tax that \nis unprecedented because it will imposing a payroll tax on investment \nincome, will result in a grand total of $210 billion in new Medicare \ntaxes--a job killer as it essentially takes away capital from the very \nsmall business owners who are the most likely to employ between 20 and \n250 employees.\n  Furthermore, I am deeply troubled by the manner in which the Medicare \ntax increases in this bill are to be utilized. According to CBO--and \nthese are their exact words--``To describe the full amount of HI trust \nfund savings as both improving the government's ability to pay future \nMedicare benefits and financing new spending outside of Medicare would \nessentially double count a large share of those savings and thus \noverstate the improvement in the government's fiscal position.''\n  Speaking of double counting, we need to repeal the so-called CLASS \nAct. Now, while proponents point to estimates that this provision would \nraise $72 billion over the first 10 years, that savings only occurs as \na result of a fiscal shell game of using funds promised to \nbeneficiaries later to lower the deficit today. As CBO says, ``The \nprogram\n\n[[Page S540]]\n\nwould pay out far less in benefits than it would receive in premiums \nover the 10-year budget window,'' raising $70 billion in premiums that \nwill fund benefits outside the window. As a result, CBO further \nconcluded that ``in the decade following 2029, the CLASS program would \nbegin to increase the deficit.'' Again, this is exactly the wrong \ndirection for America.\n  We also need to repeal the administration's ``grandfathering'' \nregulations. Not even a year after the administration promised that if \nyou like the coverage you have, you can keep it, we find out that \nburied in 121 pages of regulations, which resulted from just 2 pages of \nlegislative text, I might add that, no, that is not exactly true--far \nfrom it. In fact, the administration itself projects that up to 69 \npercent of all businesses and 80 percent of small businesses will not \nbe able to retain the coverage they currently provide and will be \nforced to offer more costly coverage as opposed to hiring new workers \nand growing their businesses. So we must repeal these regulations this \nyear.\n  Finally, I also strongly oppose the individual mandate in the new \nlaw, which would require, starting in 2014, Americans to have maintain \ninsurance coverage or be subject to a financial penalty that would \nultimately be the greater of $695 per uninsured individual or 2.5 \npercent of income. How can the Federal Government require its citizens \nto purchase health coverage without first guaranteeing that an \naffordable coverage option will be available to all Americans in the \nprivate insurance market?\n  Numerous court challenges are underway questioning the \nconstitutionality of the individual mandate. Last November, I joined \nwith Republican Leader McConnell with 30 other GOP Senators to file a \nfriend-of-the-court brief in the lawsuit in a Florida Federal court \nbrought by the National Federation of Independent Business and now 26 \nStates, including Maine, and I am pleased that just this week, the \nFlorida judge agreed with us and struck down not just the individual \nmandate but the entire bill.\n  In its ruling, the court held that the ``individual mandate is \noutside Congress' Commerce Clause power'' and that it is not \nconstitutional. The court concluded that the new law has ``450 separate \npieces, but one essential piece (the individual mandate) is defective \nand must be removed. It cannot function as originally designed.'' In \nthe courts view, and I agree, ``that the individual mandate and the \nremaining provisions are inextricably bound together in purpose and \nmust stand or fall as a single unit.''\n  So moving forward, with serious questions about the constitutionality \nand workability of this new law, a top priority this Congress must be \nto repeal the health reform bill and replace it with workable \nalternatives that would result in more competitive health insurance \nmarkets. That is why, first and foremost, we must expedite allowing \nindividuals and small businesses to purchase health insurance across \nState lines, which, as I have long said, would interject unfettered \ncompetition and new coverage options into stagnant insurance markets \nlike those in Maine, where we have just two carriers offering coverage \nin the individual insurance market. That is why in the Senate, I long \nchampioned association health plan, AHP, legislation--and developed \nregional compact proposals--that would have allowed small business and \nthe self-employed to band together, across State lines, to secure \nquality coverage made affordable through administrative cost savings \nand greater bargaining power.\n  We must also develop a plan for affordability by maintaining certain \nwidely agreed upon elements of reform, such as outlawing unconscionable \ninsurance industry practices, banning preexisting condition \nlimitations, and allowing parents to keep children on plans until age \n26.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/03/senate-section/article/S540-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S540]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, I extend my condolences to the family of my \ngood friend Mr. Eddie Escobedo, who passed away in Las Vegas, NV, on \nOctober 15, 2010. He was 77 years old.\n  Eddie left behind his loving wife of 50 years, Dona Maria Escobedo, \nhis children, Eddie, Jr., Hilda, Nicolas, Victor, and nine \ngrandchildren. His passing leaves an empty place in the lives of those \nwho knew and loved him, but it also leaves an enormous void in the Las \nVegas community.\n  Eddie was best known as the publisher of the Spanish-language El \nMundo newspaper and a strong advocate for the Hispanic community. He \narrived in southern Nevada when approximately 60,000 people lived in \nthe Las Vegas Valley. His assertive leadership drew attention to the \nissues that pertain specifically to the Latino community, paving the \nway for hundreds of thousands of them who now reside in Nevada.\n  Eddie was born in Juarez, Mexico, in 1932, and as a teenager \nimmigrated to the United States. He recognized early on that in America \nhe would have the opportunity to accomplish his dreams. He enlisted in \nthe Air Force and earned his citizenship after serving with \ndistinction.\n  Several years ago I received a call from my friend Eddie to invite me \nto Christmas in the Barrio, where he would help give toys to needy \nchildren. Seeing those little faces glow because they would have a \nlittle bit of Christmas even though their families were struggling is a \nmemory that I keep very fondly. Eddie's actions that day crystallized \nwho he was in this community, and it reinforced my commitment to public \nservice.\n  Eddie spread democracy through his incisive columns published in his \nnewspaper, which often became the voice of the Latino community in Las \nVegas. His columns also inspired his 175,000 weekly readers to become \nactive in the community and to exercise their right to vote.\n  Eddie Escobedo's dedication to Nevada changed the community that he \nloved and fought for. He will be missed. His legacy and big heart will \nlive on through his publication--El Mundo Newspaper--as it continues to \nplay a vital role in the lives of Hispanics throughout Nevada by \nconveying the challenges and experiences Latino families face on a \ndaily basis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/03/senate-section/article/S540-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S540-S541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SUPER BOWL XLV\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, when we tune in this Sunday night to watch \nSuper Bowl XLV, we will cheer players from all across our Nation. But \nas a Michiganian, I will take special pride in watching the several \nplayers from Michigan colleges. I will cheer Flozell Adams of Michigan \nState University; Charlie Batch and T.J. Lang of Eastern Michigan \nUniversity; Larry Foote, LaMarr Woodley and Charles Woodson of the \nUniversity of Michigan; Greg Jennings of Western Michigan University; \nand Nick McDonald of Grand Valley State University.\n  But what is perhaps most extraordinary is the fact that four of the \nplayers on the field this Sunday will come from a single Michigan \ninstitution, Central Michigan University. As reported by the Morning \nSun of Mount Pleasant, CMU's hometown paper, only three other schools--\nLouisiana State, Ohio State and Tennessee--will have as many players on \nthe field, and none will have more.\n  The four CMU players--Steelers receiver Antonio Brown and Packers \ncornerback Josh Gordy, linebacker Frank Zombo and defensive tackle \nCullen Jenkins--each enjoyed stellar careers for the Chippewas. Brown, \nGordy and Zombo all played on multiple Mid-American Conference \nchampionship teams. The presence of these four players shows that it's \nnot the size or the fame of the football program, but the effort and \ndetermination of its people, that bring success.\n  That is true not just in athletics, but academics as well. CMU is \nranked among the Nation's top 20 research institutions with 16 or fewer \ndoctoral programs.

Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in \nhonoring the 10th anniversary of Missouri River Relief and their \ndedication to preserving Missouri rivers.\n  As a lifelong Missourian, I have visited and enjoyed the natural \nbeauty and recreational opportunities along the Missouri River. These \nriverbanks and waterways are treasured attractions throughout Missouri. \nThe Missouri River enjoys over 1 million visitors from across the \nNation each year who have the opportunity to experience the splendor \nand excitement these natural resources provide for our state. That is \nwhy I am so thrilled to acknowledge the work of the Missouri River \nRelief program.\n  Founded in 2001, Missouri River Relief began with just a few Missouri \nRiver enthusiasts dedicated to cleaning up our State waters. Ten years \nlater, 12,000 Missourians have joined their communities in fighting for \nthis cause, removing over 1 million pounds of trash and debris, making \nour waters safer for all to enjoy. In 2010 alone, over 1,100 student \nand teacher volunteers helped clean over 70 miles of river.\n  Missouri River Relief has contributed to promoting river education \nthroughout the State. By sponsoring recreational activities and \nfestivals that incorporate the arts alongside river education, this \norganization has made it their mission to teach Missouri families about \nour local rivers and how the rivers contribute to our environment.\n  This project has received an outpouring of State and corporate \nsponsorships that have made this growing cause a reality. Neighboring \nStates have also included their support, cleaning up almost 400 miles \nof the Missouri River. The trash gathered from these clean ups have \nincluded recyclable and environmental friendly particles that have been \nturned into useful resources.\n  Working to preserve one of our country's most affluent and beautiful \nrivers, this organization deserves our gratitude and commemoration. \nMissouri River Relief is committed to water safety and education and \nits service to the community stands as an inspiration to all \nMissourians and a strong signal of our State's continued growth and \nsuccess.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in recognizing the 10th \nanniversary of the Missouri River Relief.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/03/senate-section/article/S541-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NORTHEAST ORGANIC FARMING ASSOCIATION OF VERMONT\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, today I honor the Northeast \nOrganic Farming Association of Vermont. NOFA Vermont is a nonprofit \nassociation of farmers, gardeners, and consumers working to promote an \neconomically viable and ecologically sound Vermont food system for the \nbenefit of current and future generations. This year it celebrates its \n40th anniversary of helping farms thrive, making locally grown and \norganic foods available to all, and increasing consumer access at \nfarmers markets across our Green Mountain State.\n  NOFA Vermont was founded in Putney in 1971, making it one of the \noldest organic farming associations in the United States. Today, they \nare proud to have more than 1,200 members throughout the State and to \ncertify over 525 farms and processors to the USDA national organic \nprogram standards. They are passionate about increasing the acreage of \ncertified organic land in Vermont, while also increasing access to \nlocal organic food by all Vermonters. The entirety of their programs \nstrives to meet these goals, whether it involves working with schools \nto bring local foods into the cafeteria, or providing business planning \nservices to farmers to ensure their businesses stay viable.\n  With a vision that consists of small farms and agriculturally based \nbusinesses that are improving the ecology of Vermont foodscapes, where \norganic farms and gardens supply food to all members of their \ncommunities and where everyone knows their farmers, I see NOFA-VT as an \nexemplary national leader for the USDA campaign ``Know your Farmer, \nKnow your Food.''\n  Executive director, Enid Wonnacott, has led this exceptional \norganization for the past 30 years. She and her dedicated team offer \ntechnical assistance and revolving loan funds; and supply information \non energy management, apprenticeships, and educational and electronic \nresources. They have built direct markets between farmers and consumers \nthrough the VT Farmers Market Association and have sponsored \noutstanding conferences yearly. This year they expect more than 1,500 \nfarmers to attend their winter conference, which is extremely well-run, \nworthwhile, and fun. They provide knowledgeable speakers, workshops \nbrimming with information and healthy attitudes for the 21st century of \nfarming.\n  Finally, I have been very impressed with their commitment to \nVermont's future and our children as NOFA-VT has been a significant \npartner in the advancement of the Vermont Food and Farm Education \nprogram, FEED. This critical program provides schools, farmers, food \nservice directors, and community partners with technical assistance, \ntraining, and professional development to advance student achievement, \nimprove childhood nutrition, and create community-based farm to school \nprograms. It is through programs such as these that children are able \nto connect with the farm in their community, understand where their \nfood comes from, and have the opportunity to eat local healthy food in \ntheir school meal programs.\n  I offer my sincerest congratulations to NOFA-VT on the occasion of \ntheir 40th anniversary of service to our great State of Vermont and \nwish them many more years of continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/03/senate-section/article/S541-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S541-S542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING NORTH EAST WIPERS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, America is home to millions of \ninnovative and forward-thinking small businesses, which is critical to \nour future. And, as President Obama said in this State of the Union \nAddress, ``We need to out-innovate the . . . rest of the world'' to \nmaintain our position of global economic power. As such, I rise today \nto recognize a small company from my home State of Maine that \nrepresents a shining example of America's ingenuity and innovative \nspirit.\n  North East Wipers got its start a little over a year ago after a \nconversation between two long-time friends. Gerard Dubois, the owner of \nPioneer Transport in Waterville, told his friend Ray Lawrence, a \nmachinist with 25 years experience, about an idea to create mini wiper \nblades that can be affixed to rearview mirrors on big rig trucks, so \nthat the driver would not have to stop every few minutes during \ninclement weather to clear off snow or remove dirt and salt. Not only \nwas this a commonsense idea, it was a matter of safety for truckers who \nare often forced to drive in unforgiving weather conditions to deliver \ntimely goods on which the American people rely.\n  As a result of the conversation, Ray and Gerard gathered $10,000 in \nstartup costs and set to work on creating a number of prototypes. They \neventually coalesced around a simple yet durable model that attaches to \nmirror mounts without using electrical or motorized parts that cannot \nclog or freeze. Once affixed to the mirror, all the driver has to do is \npush a button for the wipers to work. Even more appealing is that the \nsystem costs $500, roughly the amount it costs to fill a tractor \ntrailer with diesel fuel.\n  While originally designed for logging trucks facing difficult \nconditions on roads across Maine and other snow-plagued States, Gerard \nDubois and Ray\n\n[[Page S542]]\n\nLawrence are seeking to make their invention available to other major \ncommercial vehicles on the road. Recognizing the merits of North East \nWipers' product, the Maine Technology Institute recently announced it \nwill be providing the company with a seed grant to support further \ndevelopment and commercialization of the wiper blades. Such capital is \ncritical for the success of a project like this, and it recognizes the \nvalue and practicality of this unique invention. Gerard and Ray's \nultimate goal is to work with a truck manufacturer on making the wipers \nstandard equipment for its big rigs.\n  Maine is home to scores of groundbreaking entrepreneurs and creative \nthinkers, and clearly Gerard Dubois and Ray Lawrence fit that bill. I \nam extremely proud of the ingenuity they have demonstrated and the \ndedication they have shown in making their product a reality. I thank \nthem for their inventiveness, and wish them much success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/03/senate-section/article/S542-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/03/senate-section/article/S542-2", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/03/senate-section/article/S542-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEASURES DISCHARGED\n\n  The following bill was discharged from the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, and referred as indicated:\n\n       S. 126.

A bill to repeal the excise tax on medical device \nmanufacturers; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to repeal the tax imposed on medical device manufacturers.\n  As my colleagues know, this 2.3 percent sales tax imposed on medical \ndevice manufacturers--a tax that will ultimately be passed on to \nconsumers--is part-and-parcel of the Federal health care reform bill \nthat passed last Congress.\n  Like others in this chamber, I am extremely concerned that this tax \ncould threaten jobs in my State, reduce domestic investment in research \nand development and ultimately diminish access to life-saving medical \ndevices for patients.\n  Medical technology companies employ more than 375,000 workers in the \nUnited States. In Massachusetts alone, we have more than 225 medical \ndevice firms, which employ more than 20,000 workers, and contribute \nnearly $1 billion in payroll. Medical devices are one of our State's \ntop exports, contributing $6 billion to our State's economy.\n  These are powerfully good numbers. These are the numbers that make my \nState tick, help drive our economy, and keep people working. I want to \nmake certain that what happens in Washington does not reverse these \nnumbers, does not undermine my State's ability to compete, and does not \nhamper our chances to grow and hire workers.\n  Massachusetts' position as an industry leader, a hub of innovation \nand entrepreneurship must be preserved. That has been and will continue \nto be my focus in the U.S. Senate.\n  So how do I intend to accomplish this?\n  For starters it means working to eliminate the medical device tax, \nwhich I believe will diminish our ability to compete, will increase \ncosts for consumers, and could result in our medical device and \ntechnology jobs being sent overseas, where the costs of labor and \nproduction are cheaper.\n  The effort that I am spearheading--and that I ask my colleagues to \njoin--eliminates the medical device tax in a way that does not add to \nthe deficit. I propose eliminating this harmful tax--a tax that will \nstifle innovation, be passed on to consumers, and increase the cost of \ncare--and propose that we offset the cost by using unobligated \ndiscretionary dollars. This is the same source of funding, the same \noffset, that 81 of my colleagues supported yesterday.\n  As my colleagues know, I worked on an amendment that would repeal the \nmedical device tax last Congress. I will continue this work because the \nharmful effects of this tax are the last thing Massachusetts needs--\nmore industry jobs lost, our workers at a competitive disadvantage.\n  But the medical device tax doesn't just lead to job uncertainty, it \nleads to investment uncertainty as well, which results in private \ncapital staying on the sidelines rather than being invested in \nMassachusetts based companies and their workers.\n  The medical device tax, coupled with other provisions in the Federal \nhealth reform bill, increases the level of uncertainty at a time when \nbusinesses, consumers and investors are craving the exact opposite.\n  For example, some medical devices are approved as combination \nproducts, both as medical devices and drugs and/or biologics. The \nSecretary has yet to determine how these medical devices will be \ncaptured under the law, how they will be taxed.\n  I pledge to work with my Senate colleagues--and during the Medical \nDevice User Fee Modernization Act reauthorization slated for next \nyear--to ensure that the medical device companies whose products are \napproved as combination products by the FDA are not double-taxed by way \nof the medical device tax and the pharmaceutical tax.\n  With the rolling implementation of the Federal health care reform \nbill, this Congress will provide many opportunities for me to protect \nthe interests of and work on behalf of Massachusetts families, \nMassachusetts taxpayers,\n\n[[Page S546]]\n\nMassachusetts workers, and Massachusetts businesses.\n  I hope my colleagues will join my efforts to find opportunities to \ncorrect what is wrong with the Federal health reform law--to protect \ninnovation, the jobs, and the development and growth that can occur in \na sector that is vitally important to our Nation's health.\n  I know that a robust medical device sector translates into a \nhealthier America--physically, economically, and socially. The same is \ntrue for Massachusetts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley):\n  S. 270. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain Federal land to Deschutes County, Oregon; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce two bills \nthat will provide two important communities in rural Oregon with the \nmeans to promote their cultural history and their economic development \nopportunities. These are bills that I introduced in the last Congress \nand were reported out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nbut were unfortunately not passed in the Senate. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senator Merkley in this effort.\n  These bills both are intended to help leaders in rural communities in \nmy State continue to grow their economies and make the most of the \nabundant resources surrounding their communities. As in many rural \ncommunities in my State and in many places in the Western United \nStates, not much happens without the Federal Government's involvement. \nIn fact, the Federal Government owns much of the land surrounding these \nsmall communities. While many of these lands are treasures, this high \npercentage of Federal land ownership sometimes limits the ability of \nlocal governments and civic leaders to solve problems and serve the \npublic. I firmly believe the Federal Government can and should be an \nactive partner in strengthening communities and improving a region's \nquality of life.\n  That is why I am re-introducing these two pieces of legislation \ntoday. These bills--both passed out of the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee in the last Congress with minor modifications--\ndemonstrate the possibilities that can come when the Federal Government \npartners with proactive, innovative communities to tackle challenging \neconomic conditions and the pattern of Federal land ownership.\n  My first bill, the La Pine Land Conveyance Act, would convey two \nparcels of property to Deschutes County, Oregon and a third parcel to \nthe City of La Pine. The bill directs the transfer of Bureau of Land \nManagement, BLM, lands to Deschutes County and the City of La Pine to \nenable the small town of La Pine to develop rodeo and equestrian \nfacilities, expand a sewage treatment site, and develop the library or \nother public facilities.\n  La Pine has a set of unique challenges but the town's incorporation \nhas brought a feeling in the community that good things can happen if \nthey work together to make their town as good as it can possibly be.\n  My bill proposes the transfer of 150 acres of BLM land contiguous to \nthe La Pine city limit to enable construction of public equestrian and \nrodeo facilities that have become increasingly important in La Pine. In \naddition, the land will provide a location for development of ball \nfields, parks, and recreation facilities, which can be developed as the \ntown grows and budgets allow.\n  My bill also directs the transfer of approximately 750 acres of BLM \nlands to Deschutes County for the purpose of expanding the town's \nwastewater treatment operation. For several years this has been the \nCity's top priority for a land transfer under the Recreation and Public \nPurposes Act. Although the BLM began an administrative transfer it was \nnot completed, limiting this small community's ability to be \ncompetitive for state and federal economic stimulus funds. This project \nis too important to let languish.\n  Perhaps the most important issue affecting water quality in Deschutes \nCounty involves the threat to groundwater and the Deschutes River from \nhousehold septic systems in southern Deschutes County, the region \naround La Pine. This project directly reduces nitrate loading into \nsouth county groundwater in two ways. First, by enabling expansion of \nthe District service boundary to residential areas where septic systems \nare generating elevated groundwater nitrate levels; and second, by \nclosing the current location for spreading treated effluent, over a \nrelatively high groundwater area, to this new location which is judged \nnot to threaten groundwater. That is why I am introducing legislation \ntoday to make sure this transfer moves forward.\n  The third parcel that would be transferred under this legislation \nwould convey approximately 10 acres to the City of La Pine. This is a \nparcel right in the heart of downtown La Pine. The City is exploring \nits use for expansion of library space or using it as an open space.\n  My second bill, S. 271, the Wallowa Forest Service Compound \nConveyance Act would convey an old Forest Service Ranger Station \ncompound to the City of Wallowa, OR. In Wallowa County, this Forest \nService compound was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the \n1930's. For many years it was the center of town and this site \ncontinues to represent the natural and cultural history of one of \nEastern Oregon's most beautiful communities. The City of Wallowa, along \nwith County Commissioners, the local arts organizations, and a broad \ngroup of community leaders intend to restore this important example of \nPacific Northwest rustic architecture and tribute to bygone times, \nmaking a valuable community interpretive center at this site. The \nconveyance of this property will allow the community to move forward \nwith this project. The community worked hard to list the Ranger Station \non the National Register of Historic Places, and ownership by the City \nwill allow this coalition to restore the buildings and again develop a \nvibrant community center. Oregon Public Broadcasting aired a segment \ndepicting an early 20th century railroad logging community--a \nsignificant part of the rich and diverse history and traditions that \nwill be preserved and celebrated as this Forest Service Compound is \ndeveloped as an interpretive center.\n  I want to express my thanks to all the citizens and community leaders \nwho have worked to build their communities and develop these projects. \nThey represent the pioneering spirit and vision that defines my State.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HAGAN (for herself, Mr. Franken, Mr. Brown of Ohio, and \n        Mr. Johnson of South Dakota):\n  S. 274. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexpand access to medication therapy management services under the \nMedicare prescription drug program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today, I am proud to reintroduce the \nMedication Therapy Management, MTM, Empowerment Act of 2011, with my \ncolleagues from Minnesota, Senator Franken, from Ohio, Senator Brown, \nand from South Dakota, Senator Johnson.\n  A recent analysis conducted by the New England Healthcare Institute \nestimates that the overall cost of medication nonadherence is as much \nas $290 billion per year. According to a recent article published in \nthe New England Journal of Medicine, over $100 billion is spent \nannually on avoidable hospitalizations because patients do not take \ntheir medications correctly.\n  Not only does nonadherence cost our system billions of dollars, \nnonadherence to medication regimens also affects the quality of life \nfor seniors and may lead to early death. The elderly typically take \nmany more prescription medicines than the general population and \ntherefore are at greater risk for problems associated with improper use \nof medications. For example, the same New England Journal of Medicine \narticle I just referenced found that better adherence to \nantihypertensive treatment alone could prevent 89,000 premature deaths \nin the U.S. annually.\n  With as much as one half of all patients in the U.S. not following \ntheir doctors' orders regarding their medications, medication therapy \nmanagement could help reduce some of the wasted health care costs in \nour system.\n  North Carolina has implemented some very successful MTM programs.\n  The Asheville Project, which focuses on diabetes, asthma, and \ncardiovascular disease, has seen improved\n\n[[Page S547]]\n\nhealth outcomes and significant savings among city employees since it \nbegan in 1997. For example, in the Asheville Project's diabetes MTM \nProject, they have seen a decrease in medical costs of between $1,622 \nto $3,356 per patient per year; a decrease in insurance claims of \n$2,704 per patient in year one and a $6,502 decrease in year five; a 50 \npercent decrease in use of sick days; and increased productivity gains \nestimated at $18,000 annually.\n  In 2007, the North Carolina Health and Wellness Trust Fund Commission \nlaunched an innovative statewide program, Checkmeds NC, to provide MTM \nservices to North Carolina seniors. During the program's first year, \nmore than 15,000 North Carolina seniors and 285 pharmacists \nparticipated. A total of 31,000 seniors have participated since 2007. \nThe seniors bring all of their prescriptions, over-the-counter \nmedicines, vitamins and supplements to the pharmacy to be thoroughly \nreviewed in a one-on-one session. The pharmacist follows up and \neducates the patient about his or her medication regimen. The program \nhas saved an estimated $34 million to date, and countless health \nproblems have been avoided.\n  During consideration of health care reform, I was pleased to have \nsuccessfully secured language in the bill that built off these North \nCarolina models and implemented MTM nationally for seniors suffering \nfrom two or more chronic conditions.\n  The bill I am reintroducing today takes MTM one step further. \nSpecifically, this bill would expand MTM eligibility to seniors with \nany chronic condition that accounts for high spending in our health \ncare system, such as heart failure and diabetes. Currently, only 12.9 \npercent of Part D beneficiaries are eligible under the MTM criteria for \nmultiple chronic conditions. However, of those, more than 85 percent \nhave chosen to participate in the benefit. Clearly this program is very \npopular and widely utilized by those who are already eligible. By \nexpanding eligibility to more seniors, MTM will certainly result in \nMedicare savings.\n  The bill also ensures access to MTM for seniors at a pharmacy or with \na qualified health care provider of their choice.\n  To ensure pharmacists and health care providers are able to provide \nMTM to seniors, this bill requires that they are appropriately \nreimbursed for their time and service. This provision will permit \npharmacies and other health care providers to spend considerable time \nand resources evaluating a person's drug routine and educating them on \nproper usage--all critical components of a successful MTM program.\n  Finally, this bill would establish standards for data collection to \nevaluate and improve the Part D MTM benefit.\n  The value of MTM is widely known and discussed. I am proud that North \nCarolina is a leader in this arena. Expansion of MTM to more seniors \nwill no doubt improve their overall health, while at the same time \nreducing waste in our health care system.\n  I urge my collegues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself and Mr. Bennet):\n  S. 278. A bill to provide for the exchange of certain land located in \nthe Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forests in the State of Colorado, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, fighting fires is very serious \nbusiness in my home State of Colorado. Just a few months ago, we \nexperienced the most expensive fire in our history--the Fourmile Fire, \nnear Boulder. This fire destroyed more than 150 homes and burned over \n6,000 acres.\n  We could not have stopped this fire without the dedicated efforts of \nhundreds of public servants, including volunteer firefighters from \nlocal fire districts. These individuals saved lives and property, often \nrisking their own lives. That is, in part, why I believe we should do \neverything we can to help these fire districts and the volunteers who \nserve them.\n  One fire district involved in the Fourmile Fire--the Sugar Loaf Fire \nDistrict--lost 17 homes in the fire. The Sugar Loaf Fire District is \ncritical to protecting thousands of Coloradans, but instead of being \nable to focus on fighting fires this District has been wrapped up \ntrying to resolve a land issue with the Forest Service for many years \nnow. It is a very simple land exchange to make sure that the Fire \nDistrict owns the land under two of its three fire stations.\n  The Fire District has occupied and operated the fire stations on \nthese properties for nearly 40 years. If they can secure ownership, the \nlands will continue to be used as sites for fire stations and training. \nThe Fire District is willing to trade the property it owns, an \nundeveloped inholding in Forest Service land, for the property under \nthe stations. This is a simple and fair exchange that will serve the \npublic good and help protect the local area from growing wildfire \nthreats.\n  The Fire District has made a strong, persistent, and good faith \neffort to acquire the land under the stations through administrative \nmeans by working with the Forest Service. Furthermore, the Fire \nDistrict has demonstrated its sincere commitment to this project by \nexpending its monetary resources and the time of its staff to satisfy \nthe requirements set forth by the Forest Service.\n  However, those efforts have not succeeded and it has become evident \nthat legislation is required to resolve the situation.\n  To help facilitate this land exchange, I am introducing the Sugar \nLoaf Fire Station Land Exchange Act of 2011 today. This language is the \nsame as what passed the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee \nin the last Congress.\n  Under the bill, the land exchange will proceed if the Fire District \noffers to convey acceptable title to a specified parcel of land \namounting to about 5.17 acres. This land resides between the \ncommunities of Boulder and Nederland in an unincorporated part of \nBoulder County within the boundaries of the Arapaho-Roosevelt National \nForest. In return, the land--about 5.08 acres--where the two fire \nstations are located will be transferred to the Fire District.\n  The lands transferred to the Federal Government will become part of \nthe Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest and managed accordingly.\n  This is a relatively minor bill but one that is important to the \nSugar Loaf Fire District and the people it serves. As public lands \nbills pile up in Congress because of ideological obstruction, this fire \ndistrict is being forced into wasting time and money trying to resolve \nan otherwise commonsense and technical public lands fix. I think this \nbill deserves enactment without unnecessary delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 278\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the Camp \nHale Study Act of 2011, which would direct the Secretary of the \nInterior to study the feasibility and suitability of establishing Camp \nHale, near Leadville, CO, as a national historic district. Camp Hale is \nan important part of our Nation's proud national defense legacy, and it \ndeserves to be recognized and protected.\n  This bill concerns an important military legacy from the World War II \nand Cold War eras. Camp Hale, located in the mountains of central \nColorado, was a training facility for combat in high alpine and \nmountainous conditions. Principally, it was a training venue for the \nArmy's 10th Mountain Division and other elements of the U.S. Armed \nForces. The geography of the area was ideal for winter and high-\naltitude training, with steep mountains surrounding a level valley \nsuitable for housing and other facilities. The facility itself was \nlocated in Eagle County along the Eagle River, and its training \nboundary included lands in Eagle, Summit, Lake, and Pitkin Counties.\n  In addition to the 10th Mountain Division, the 38th Regimental Combat \nTeam, 99th Infantry Battalion, and soldiers from Fort Carson were \ntrained at Camp Hale from 1942 to 1965. Throughout this time, the Army \ntested a variety of weapons and equipment at Camp Hale.\n  Between 1956 and 1965, the camp was also used by the Central \nIntelligence Agency as a secret center for training Tibetan refugees in \nguerilla warfare to resist the Chinese occupation of their mountainous \ncountry. Just last year, at my urging, the Forest Service put in place \na plaque honoring these Tibetan Freedom Fighters. I joined many of \nthose brave Tibetans, their CIA trainers, and their families in a \nmoving ceremony to honor those who trained at Camp Hale.\n  In July 1965, Camp Hale was deactivated, and in 1966, control of the \nlands was returned to the Forest Service. Today the site is part of the \nWhite River and San Isabel National Forests. The U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers is working to clean up potentially hazardous munitions left \nover from weapons testing at the site, particularly in the East Fork.\n  Camp Hale was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in \n1992, but this bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to \ncomplete a special resource study of Camp Hale to determine the \nsuitability and feasibility of designating Camp Hale as a separate unit \nof the National Park System. That would include an analysis of the \nsignificance of Camp Hale in relation to the defense of our Nation \nduring World War II and the Cold War, including the use of Camp Hale \nfor training of the 10th Mountain Division and for training by the \nCentral Intelligence Agency of Tibetan refugees seeking to resist the \nChinese occupation of Tibet.\n  I have worked with Representative Lamborn on this bill since he first \nintroduced it in the House in the 110th Congress, when I proudly \ncosponsored it. I introduced this bill in the Senate in the last \nCongress and shepherded it through the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. However, because of opposition from a few Senators \nto all public lands bills, we could not pass this bipartisan bill on \nthe Senate floor.\n  Camp Hale should be recognized for the role it played in our \ncountry's national security. The people who trained there are proud of \ntheir accomplishments, and I am proud to join Representative Lamborn in \nsupporting this legislation. I am confident that we will have more \nsuccess in passing this legislation in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 279\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Camp Hale Study Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SPECIAL RESOURCE STUDY OF THE SUITABILITY AND \n                   FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING CAMP HALE AS A UNIT \n                   OF THE NATIONAL PARK SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior, acting \n     through the Director of the National Park Service, \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall complete \n     a special resource study of Camp Hale to determine--\n       (1) the suitability and feasibility of designating Camp \n     Hale as a separate unit of the National Park System; and\n       (2) the methods and means for the protection and \n     interpretation of Camp Hale by the National Park Service, \n     other Federal, State, or local government entities or private \n     or nonprofit organizations.\n       (b) Study Requirements.--The Secretary shall conduct the \n     study in accordance with section 8(c) of Public Law 91-383 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1a-5(c)).\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date on which \n     funds are made available to carry out this Act, the Secretary \n     shall submit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the \n     House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources of the Senate a report containing--\n       (1) the results of the study; and\n       (2) any recommendations of the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for flexibility and improvements in \nelementary and secondary education, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the No Child \nLeft Behind Flexibility and Improvements Act. I am pleased to be joined \nin this effort by my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe. Our \nlegislation would give greater local control and flexibility to Maine \nand other states in their efforts to implement the No Child Left Behind \nAct, NCLB. It provides common sense reforms in the statute while \nretaining elements to help ensure transparency and accountability.\n  Since the enactment of NCLB 9 years ago, I have had the opportunity \nto meet with numerous Maine educators to discuss their concerns with \nthe law. In response to their concerns, Senator Snowe and I \ncommissioned the Maine NCLB Task Force to examine the implementation \nissues facing Maine under both NCLB and the Maine Learning Results. Our \ntask force included members from every county in our State, and had \nsuperintendents, teachers, principals, school board members, parents, \nbusiness leaders, former State legislators, special education \nspecialists, assessment experts, officials from the Maine Department of \nEducation, and was chaired by a former Maine commissioner of education \nand a dean from the University of Maine's College of Education and \nHuman Development. In other words, it was a broad-based commission that \nbrought a great deal of expertise, experience, and perspective to the \ntask force's work.\n  After a year of study, the task force presented us with its final \nreport outlining recommendations for possible statutory and regulatory \nchanges to the act. The task force recommendations highlighted the need \nfor greater flexibility for the Maine Department of Education and local \nschools in order to address various implementation concerns facing \nMaine. The legislation we are introducing today would make significant \nstatutory changes designed to provide greater local control to Maine \nand greater flexibility to all States in their implementation efforts, \nnot just Maine.\n  First, our legislation would provide greater flexibility to states in \nthe ways that they measure student progress in meeting state education \nstandards. Current NCLB law has proven to be too restrictive. Our \nlegislation would permit states to use additional models to more \naccurately track the progress of all students over time. Specifically, \nit would allow States to use a cohort growth model, which tracks the \nprogress of the same group of students over time. It would also permit \nthe use of an ``indexing'' model, where progress is measured based on \nthe number of students whose scores improve from, for example, a \n``below-basic'' to a ``basic'' level, and not simply on the number of \nstudents who cross the ``proficient'' line. Even if a school is unable \nto meet the trajectory targets set by the NCLB time-line, a school \nwould not be identified as failing to make AYP provided it demonstrates \nimproved student achievement according to these additional models. We \nwould also require the Secretary to provide examples of these models to \ngive practical assistance to States in the design of these systems. \nWhile the trajectory goals set in the statute are certainly valuable, \nour legislation seeks to clarify that States should be granted greater \nflexibility in the design of different accountability systems provided \nthat they are consistent with the principle of improved student \nperformance.\n  Second, our legislation would provide schools with better notice \nregarding possible performance issues, allowing schools a chance to \nidentify and work with a particular group of students before being \nidentified. It would expand the existing ``safe-harbor'' provisions to \nallow more schools to qualify for this important protection. The \nchanges made in our bill are in keeping with what assessment experts \nand teachers know--that significant gains in academic achievement tend \nto occur gradually and over time. In addition, the legislation \naddresses my concern about the statute's current requirement that all \nschools reach 100 percent proficiency by 2013-2014 by requiring the \nSecretary of Education to review progress by the States toward meeting \nthis goal every three years, and allowing him to modify the time-line \nas necessary.\n\n  Furthermore, the Task Force report raised important concerns that in \nsome schools, special education students fear that they are being \nblamed for their school not making adequate yearly progress. Our \nlegislation would allow the members of a special education student's \nIndividual Education Plan, IEP, team to determine the best assessment \nfor that individual student, and would permit the student's performance \non that assessment to count for all NCLB purposes. This legislative \nchange is also based on principles of fairness and common sense. Many \ntimes, it simply does not make sense to require a special needs student \nto take a grade-level assessment that educators and parents know he or \nshe is not ready to take. Many special education students are referred \nfor special education services precisely because they cannot meet \ngrade-level expectations. Allowing the IEP team to determine the best \ntest for each special needs student will bring an important improvement \nto the act while still ensuring accountability.\n  Finally, our legislation would provide new flexibility for teachers \nof multiple subjects at the secondary school level to help them meet \nthe ``highly qualified teacher'' requirements. Unfortunately, the \ncurrent regulations place undue burdens on teachers at small and rural \nschools who often teach multiple subjects due to staffing needs, and on \nspecial education teachers who work with students on a variety of \nsubjects throughout the day. Under the bill, provided these teachers \nare highly qualified for one subject they teach, they will be provided \nadditional time and less burdensome avenues to satisfy the remaining \nrequirements.\n  While it has been some time since Maine's Task Force issued its \nreport, its findings and recommendations remain valid. Our legislation \nis still necessary to provide greater flexibility and common sense \nmodifications to address those key NCLB challenges identified in Maine. \nOur goals remain the same as those in NCLB: a good education for each \nand every child; well- qualified, committed teachers in every \nclassroom; and increased transparency and accountability for every \nschool. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle on these issues during the upcoming NCLB reauthorization \nprocess.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 289. A bill to extend expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT \nImprovement and Reauthorization Act of 2005, the Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, and the FISA Amendments Act of \n2008 until December 31, 2013, and for other purposes; read the first \ntime.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, on January 25, I introduced S. 149, \nthe FISA Sunsets Extension Act of 2011 to extend the three expiring \nprovisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--the authority \nto conduct, subject to court order, so-called ``roving wiretaps,'' \n``lone wolf'' surveillance, and collection of business records. S. 149 \nwas referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Today, I am reintroducing that legislation with a new, identical \nbill. This new bill, just as S. 149 would do, will extend these three \nauthorities, otherwise set to expire on February 28, to December 31, \n2013. The bill will also change the expiration date of the intelligence \ncollection authorities provided in the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 so \nthey, too, last until the end of 2013.\n  The sole purpose of reintroducing the measure is to begin the process \nunder Senate rule XIV to place the reintroduced extension bill on the \nSenate calendar. The three provisions of FISA\n\n[[Page S550]]\n\nwill sunset in a little more than 3 weeks. One of those weeks is a \ncongressional recess. By placing the extension bill on the Senate \ncalendar, we will, at least, be one procedural step closer to acting.\n  On January 28, Attorney General Eric Holder and Director of National \nIntelligence James Clapper wrote to urge Congress to grant a \nreauthorization of sufficient duration to provide intelligence and law \nenforcement agencies with reasonable certainty and predictability \nconcerning the tools available to them.\n  The FISA sunsets have most recently been the subject of two short-\nterm extensions: a 2-month extension from December 31, 2009 to February \n28, 2010, and then a 1-year extension from that date to February 28, \n2011.\n  In their January 28 letter, the DNI and the Attorney General \nexpressed their concern about the devolution of FISA sunsets ``into a \nseries of short-term extensions that increase the uncertainties borne \nby our intelligence and law enforcement agencies in carrying out their \nmissions.''\n  The letter states that ``S. 149, the FISA Sunsets Extension Act of \n2011, would avoid these difficulties by reauthorizing the three \nexpiring provisions until December 2013, together with the provisions \nof Title VII of FISA that are currently scheduled to sunset next year. \nWe look forward to working with you to ensure the prompt enactment of \nthis or similar legislation.''\n  Yesterday, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees also received \na classified report from the Attorney General and the DNI on the \nimportant intelligence collection made possible by authority that is \nsubject to the approaching sunset. The Department of Justice and the \nOffice of the DNI have asked for our assistance in making this \nclassified report available, in a secure setting, directly and \npersonally to any Member of the Senate. We did so for a similar report \na year ago when Congress considered the last sunset extension.\n  Each Senator is invited to read this classified report in the \nIntelligence Committee's offices in 211 Hart Senate Office Building. \nThe Attorney General and DNI have offered to make Justice Department \nand intelligence community personnel available to meet with any Member \nwho has questions. Our Intelligence Committee staff is also prepared to \nmeet with Members. Vice Chairman Chambliss and I are sending a Dear \nColleague letter to each Senator conveying this invitation.\n  In concluding, I call upon my colleagues in the Senate and House to \nheed the Attorney General's and DNI's concern about the uncertainty \ncreated by short-term extensions. The 3-year extension that my \nlegislation proposes will give our law enforcement and intelligence \nofficials the tools and certainty they need in protecting the Nation. \nIt will align the several sunsets so that Congress can review FISA more \ncomprehensively in 2013. In setting that date Congress will wisely be \nseparating that review of FISA from the debates of a presidential \nelection.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leaders Reid, Pelosi, and \n     McConnell:\n       In the current threat environment, it is imperative that \n     our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have the tools \n     they need to protect our national security. The Foreign \n     Intelligence Surveillance Act (``FISA'') is a critical tool \n     that has been used in numerous highly sensitive intelligence \n     collection operations. Three vital provisions of FISA are \n     scheduled to expire on February 28, 2011: section 206 of the \n     USA PATRIOT Act, which provides authority for roving \n     surveillance of targets who take steps that may thwart FISA \n     surveillance; section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which \n     provides expanded authority to compel production of business \n     records and other tangible things with the approval of the \n     FISA court; and section 6001 of the Intelligence Reform and \n     Terrorism Prevention Act, which provides the authority under \n     FISA to target non-United States persons who engage in \n     international terrorism or activities in preparation \n     therefor, but are not necessarily associated with an \n     identified terrorist group (the so-called ``lone wolf'' \n     amendment).\n       It is essential that these intelligence tools be \n     reauthorized before they expire, and we are committed to \n     working with Congress to ensure the speedy enactment of \n     legislation to achieve this result.\n       We also urge Congress to grant a reauthorization of \n     sufficient duration to provide those charged with protecting \n     our nation with reasonable certainty and predictability. When \n     Congress enacted the PATRIOT Act, it included a three-year \n     sunset on these authorities. While we welcome Congressional \n     oversight into the use of these tools, Congress did not \n     contemplate that this sunset would devolve into a series of \n     short-term extensions that increase the uncertainties borne \n     by our intelligence and law enforcement agencies in carrying \n     out their missions.\n       S. 149, the FISA Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, would avoid \n     these difficulties by reauthorizing the three expiring \n     provisions until December 2013, together with the provisions \n     of Title VII of FISA that are currently scheduled to sunset \n     next year. We look forward to working with you to ensure the \n     prompt enactment of this or similar legislation.\n       The Administration also remains open to proposals that \n     enhance protections for civil liberties and privacy while \n     maintaining the effectiveness of these and other intelligence \n     collection tools.\n       Finally, we are prepared to provide additional information \n     to Members concerning these critical authorities in a \n     classified setting, as we did in connection with the previous \n     reauthorization of the expiring provisions.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised us that \n     there is no objection to this letter from the perspective of \n     the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James R. Clapper,\n                                Director of National Intelligence.\n                                              Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Chambliss):\n  S. 291.

Res. 44\n\n       Whereas the United States and Egypt have long shared a \n     strong bilateral relationship;\n       Whereas Egypt plays an important role in global and \n     regional politics as well as in the broader Middle East and \n     North Africa;\n       Whereas Egypt has been, and continues to be, an \n     intellectual and cultural center of the Arab world;\n       Whereas on January 25, 2011, demonstrations began across \n     Egypt with thousands of protesters peacefully calling for a \n     new government, free and fair elections, significant \n     constitutional and political reforms, greater economic \n     opportunity, and an end to government corruption;\n       Whereas on January 28, 2011, the Government of Egypt shut \n     down Internet and mobile phone networks almost entirely and \n     blocked social networking websites;\n       Whereas on January 29, 2011, President Hosni Mubarak \n     appointed Omar Suleiman, former head of the Egyptian General \n     Intelligence Directorate, as Vice President and Ahmed Shafik, \n     former Minister for Civil Aviation, as Prime Minister;\n       Whereas the demonstrations have continued, making this the \n     longest protest in modern Egyptian history, and on February \n     1, 2011, millions of protesters took to the streets across \n     the country;\n       Whereas hundreds of Egyptians have been killed and injured \n     since the protests began;\n       Whereas on February 1, 2011, President Hosni Mubarak \n     announced that he would not run for reelection later this \n     year, but widespread protests against his government \n     continue;\n       Whereas on February 1, 2011, President Barack Obama called \n     for an orderly transition, stating that it ``must be \n     meaningful, it must be peaceful, and it must begin now.'' He \n     also affirmed that: ``The process must include a broad \n     spectrum of Egyptian voices and opposition parties. It should \n     lead to elections that are free and fair. And it should \n     result in a government that's not only grounded in democratic \n     principles, but is also responsive to the aspirations of the \n     Egyptian people.'';\n       Whereas despite President Hosni Mubarak's pledge in 2005 \n     that Egypt's controversial emergency law would be used only \n     to fight terrorism and that he planned to abolish the state \n     of emergency and adopt new antiterrorism legislation as an \n     alternative, in May 2010, the Government of Egypt again \n     extended the emergency law, which has been in place \n     continuously since 1981, for another 2 years, giving police \n     broad powers of arrest and allowing indefinite detention \n     without charge;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2009 Human Rights Report \n     notes with respect to Egypt, ``[t]he government's respect for \n     human rights remained poor, and serious abuses continued in \n     many areas. The government limited citizens' right to change \n     their government and continued a state of emergency that has \n     been in place almost continuously since 1967.'';\n       Whereas past elections in Egypt, including the most recent \n     November 2010 parliamentary elections, have seen serious \n     irregularities at polling and counting stations, security \n     force intimidation and coercion of voters, and obstruction of \n     peaceful political rallies and demonstrations; and\n       Whereas any election must be honest and open to all \n     legitimate candidates and conducted without interference from \n     the military or security apparatus and under the oversight of \n     international monitors: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the central and historic importance of the \n     United States-Egyptian strategic partnership in advancing the \n     common interests of both countries, including peace and \n     security in the broader Middle East and North Africa;\n       (2) reaffirms the United States' commitment to the \n     universal rights of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, \n     and freedom of access to information, including the Internet, \n     and expresses strong support for the people of Egypt in their \n     peaceful calls for a representative and responsive democratic \n     government that respects these rights;\n       (3) condemns any efforts to provoke or instigate violence, \n     and calls upon all parties to refrain from all violent and \n     criminal acts;\n       (4) supports freedom of the press and strongly condemns the \n     intimidation, targeting, or detention of journalists.\n       (5) urges the Egyptian military to demonstrate maximum \n     professionalism and restraint, and emphasizes the importance \n     of working to peacefully restore calm and order while \n     allowing for free and non-violent freedom of expression;\n       (6) calls on President Mubarak to immediately begin an \n     orderly and peaceful transition to a democratic political \n     system, including the transfer of power to an inclusive \n     interim caretaker government, in coordination with leaders \n     from Egypt's opposition, civil society, and military, to \n     enact the necessary reforms to hold free, fair, and \n     internationally credible elections this year;\n       (7) affirms that a real transition to a legitimate \n     representative democracy in Egypt requires concrete steps to \n     be taken as soon as possible, including lifting the state of \n     emergency, allowing Egyptians to organize independent \n     political parties without interference, enhancing the \n     transparency of governmental institutions, restoring judicial \n     supervision of elections, allowing credible international \n     monitors to observe the preparation and conduct of elections, \n     and amending the laws and Constitution of Egypt as necessary \n     to implement these and other critical reforms;\n       (8) pledges full support for Egypt's transition to a \n     representative democracy that is responsive to the needs of \n     the Egyptian people, and calls on all nations to support the \n     people of Egypt as they work to conduct a successful \n     transition to democracy;\n       (9) expresses deep concern over any organization that \n     espouses an extremist ideology, including the Muslim \n     Brotherhood, and calls upon all political movements and \n     parties in Egypt, including an interim government, to affirm \n     their commitment to non-violence and the rule of law, the \n     equal rights of all individuals, accountable institutions of \n     justice, religious tolerance, peaceful relations with Egypt's \n     neighbors, and the fundamental principles and practices of \n     democracy, including the regular conduct of free and fair \n     elections;\n       (10) underscores the vital importance of any Egyptian \n     Government continuing to fulfill its international \n     obligations, including its commitments under the Egypt-Israel \n     Peace Treaty signed on March 26, 1979 and the freedom of \n     navigation through the Suez Canal;

A qualified \n     airline employee making such a transfer may exclude from \n     gross income the amount transferred, in the taxable year in \n     which the airline payment amount was paid to the qualified \n     airline employee by the commercial passenger airline carrier.\n       (2) Transfer of amounts attributable to airline payment \n     amount following rollover to roth ira.--A qualified airline \n     employee who has contributed an airline payment amount to a \n     Roth IRA that is treated as a qualified rollover contribution \n     pursuant to section 125 of the Worker, Retiree, and Employer \n     Recovery Act of 2008, may transfer to a traditional IRA, in a \n     trustee-to-trustee transfer, all or any part of the \n     contribution (together with any net income allocable to such \n     contribution), and the transfer to the traditional IRA will \n     be deemed to have been made at the time of the rollover to \n     the Roth IRA, if such transfer is made within 180 days of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act.

No amount so transferred to a traditional \n     IRA may be treated as a qualified rollover contribution with \n     respect to a Roth IRA within the 5-taxable year period \n     beginning with the taxable year in which such transfer was \n     made.\n       (3) Extension of time to file claim for refund.--A \n     qualified airline employee who excludes an amount from gross \n     income in a prior taxable year under paragraph (1) or (2) may \n     reflect such exclusion in a claim for refund filed within the \n     period of limitation under section 6511(a) (or, if later, \n     April 15, 2012).\n       (b) Treatment of Airline Payment Amounts and Transfers for \n     Employment Taxes.--For purposes of chapter 21 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 and section 209 of the Social Security \n     Act, an airline payment amount shall not fail to be treated \n     as a payment of wages by the commercial passenger airline \n     carrier to the qualified airline employee in the taxable year \n     of payment because such amount is excluded from the qualified \n     airline employee's gross income under subsection (a).\n       (c) Definitions and Special Rules.--For purposes of this \n     section--\n       (1) Airline payment amount.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``airline payment amount'' means \n     any payment of any money or other property which is payable \n     by a commercial passenger airline carrier to a qualified \n     airline employee--\n       (i) under the approval of an order of a Federal bankruptcy \n     court in a case filed after September 11, 2001, and before \n     January 1, 2007, and\n       (ii) in respect of the qualified airline employee's \n     interest in a bankruptcy claim against the carrier, any note \n     of the carrier (or amount paid in lieu of a note being \n     issued), or any other fixed obligation of the carrier to pay \n     a lump sum amount.\n     The amount of such payment shall be determined without regard \n     to any requirement to deduct and withhold tax from such \n     payment under sections 3102(a) and 3402(a).\n       (B) Exception.--An airline payment amount shall not include \n     any amount payable on the basis of the carrier's future \n     earnings or profits.\n       (2) Qualified airline employee.--The term ``qualified \n     airline employee'' means an employee or former employee of a \n     commercial passenger airline carrier who was a participant in \n     a defined benefit plan maintained by the carrier which--\n       (A) is a plan described in section 401(a) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 which includes a trust exempt from tax \n     under section 501(a) of such Code, and\n       (B) was terminated or became subject to the restrictions \n     contained in paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 402(b) of the \n     Pension Protection Act of 2006.\n\n[[Page S556]]\n\n       (3) Traditional ira.--The term ``traditional IRA'' means an \n     individual retirement plan (as defined in section 7701(a)(37) \n     of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) which is not a Roth \n     IRA.\n       (4) Roth ira.--The term ``Roth IRA'' has the meaning given \n     such term by section 408A(b) of such Code.\n       (d) Surviving Spouse.--If a qualified airline employee died \n     after receiving an airline payment amount, or if an airline \n     payment amount was paid to the surviving spouse of a \n     qualified airline employee in respect of the qualified \n     airline employee, the surviving spouse of the qualified \n     airline employee may take all actions permitted under section \n     125 of the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, \n     or under this section, to the same extent that the qualified \n     airline employee could have done had the qualified airline \n     employee survived.\n       (e) Effective Date.--This section shall apply to transfers \n     made after the date of the enactment of this Act with respect \n     to airline payment amounts paid before, on, or after such \n     date.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/03/senate-section/article/S556-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      Committee on Armed Services\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, over the last 20 years, the apportionment of \ncommittee funding has gone a straight two-thirds for majority and one-\nthird for minority during the 1990s, regardless of the size of the \nmajority and minority, to biannual negotiations during the past decade. \nIt is my intention that the approach adopted for this Congress will be \nused in the future. This new funding allocation for Senate committees \nis based on the party division of the Senate, with 10 percent of the \ntotal majority and minority salary baseline going to the majority for \nadministrative expenses. However, regardless of the party division of \nthe Senate, it is also intended that the minority share will never be \nless than 40 percent, and the majority share will never exceed 60 \npercent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my intention also that this new \napproach will serve us for the Congress and future Congresses. In \naddition, we are making a transition to restore Special Reserves to its \nhistoric purpose. We know that we will face tight budgets for the \nforeseeable future and cannot expect increases in funding. We have to \nmove toward funding authorizations that are in line with our actual \nresources and I look forward to working with my friend, the majority \nleader, to accomplish this.\n  Mr. REID. I thank my friend, the Republican leader, and ask unanimous \nconsent that a joint leadership letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Joint Leadership Letter\n\n       We mutually commit to the following for the 112th Congress:\n       The budgets of the Committees of the Senate, including \n     Joint and Special Committees, and all other subgroups, shall \n     be apportioned to reflect the ratio of the Senate as of this \n     date, including an additional ten percent (10%) to be \n     allocated to the Chairmen for administrative expenses, to be \n     determined by the Rules Committee. However, the amount of \n     funding authorized for each individual Committee in the 112th \n     Congress is being reduced by the amount that was allocated to \n     that Committee from Special Reserves in the last Congress.\n       Special Reserves is being restored to its historic purpose. \n     Requests for funding will only be considered when submitted \n     by a Committee Chairman and Ranking Member for unanticipated, \n     non-recurring needs. Such requests shall be granted only upon \n     the approval of the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Rules \n     Committee.\n       Funds for Committee expenses shall be available to each \n     Chairman consistent with Senate rules and practices of the \n     111th Congress.\n       The Chairman and Ranking Member of any Committee may, by \n     mutual agreement, modify the apportionment of Committee \n     funding and office space.\n       The division of Committee office space shall be \n     commensurate with this funding agreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/03/senate-section/article/S556-3", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S556-S557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONSTITUTING MAJORITY PARTY'S MEMBERSHIP ON CERTAIN COMMITTEES FOR THE \n                      ONE HUNDRED TWELFTH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 44\n\n       Whereas the United States and Egypt have long shared a \n     strong bilateral relationship;\n       Whereas Egypt plays an important role in global and \n     regional politics as well as in the broader Middle East and \n     North Africa;\n       Whereas Egypt has been, and continues to be, an \n     intellectual and cultural center of the Arab world;\n       Whereas on January 25, 2011, demonstrations began across \n     Egypt with thousands of protesters peacefully calling for a \n     new government, free and fair elections, significant \n     constitutional and political reforms, greater economic \n     opportunity, and an end to government corruption;\n       Whereas on January 28, 2011, the Government of Egypt shut \n     down Internet and mobile phone networks almost entirely and \n     blocked social networking websites;\n       Whereas on January 29, 2011, President Hosni Mubarak \n     appointed Omar Suleiman, former head of the Egyptian General \n     Intelligence Directorate, as Vice President and Ahmed Shafik, \n     former Minister for Civil Aviation, as Prime Minister;\n       Whereas the demonstrations have continued, making this the \n     longest protest in modern Egyptian history, and on February \n     1, 2011, millions of protesters took to the streets across \n     the country;\n       Whereas hundreds of Egyptians have been killed and injured \n     since the protests began;\n       Whereas on February 1, 2011, President Hosni Mubarak \n     announced that he would not run for reelection later this \n     year, but widespread protests against his government \n     continue;\n       Whereas on February 1, 2011, President Barack Obama called \n     for an orderly transition, stating that it ``must be \n     meaningful, it must be peaceful, and it must begin now.'' He \n     also affirmed that: ``The process must include a broad \n     spectrum of Egyptian voices and opposition parties. It should \n     lead to elections that are free and fair. And it should \n     result in a government that's not only grounded in democratic \n     principles, but is also responsive to the aspirations of the \n     Egyptian people.'';\n       Whereas despite President Hosni Mubarak's pledge in 2005 \n     that Egypt's controversial emergency law would be used only \n     to fight terrorism and that he planned to abolish the state \n     of emergency and adopt new antiterrorism legislation as an \n     alternative, in May 2010, the Government of Egypt again \n     extended the emergency law, which has been in place \n     continuously since 1981, for another 2 years, giving police \n     broad powers of arrest and allowing indefinite detention \n     without charge;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2009 Human Rights Report \n     notes with respect to Egypt, ``[t]he government's respect for \n     human rights remained poor, and serious abuses continued in \n     many areas. The government limited citizens' right to change \n     their government and continued a state of emergency that has \n     been in place almost continuously since 1967.'';\n       Whereas past elections in Egypt, including the most recent \n     November 2010 parliamentary elections, have seen serious \n     irregularities at polling and counting stations, security \n     force intimidation and coercion of voters, and obstruction of \n     peaceful political rallies and demonstrations; and\n       Whereas any election must be honest and open to all \n     legitimate candidates and conducted without interference from \n     the military or security apparatus and under the oversight of \n     international monitors: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) acknowledges the central and historic importance of the \n     United States-Egyptian strategic partnership in advancing the \n     common interests of both countries, including peace and \n     security in the broader Middle East and North Africa;\n       (2) reaffirms the United States' commitment to the \n     universal rights of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, \n     and freedom of access to information, including the Internet, \n     and expresses strong support for the people of Egypt in their \n     peaceful calls for a representative and responsive democratic \n     government that respects these rights;\n       (3) condemns any efforts to provoke or instigate violence, \n     and calls upon all parties to refrain from all violent and \n     criminal acts;\n       (4) supports freedom of the press and strongly condems the \n     intimidation, targeting, or detention of journalists.\n       (5) urges the Egyptian military to demonstrate maximum \n     professionalism and restraint, and emphasizes the importance \n     of working to peacefully restore calm and order while \n     allowing for free and non-violent freedom of expression;\n       (6) calls on President Mubarak to immediately begin an \n     orderly and peaceful transition to a democratic political \n     system, including the transfer of power to an inclusive \n     interim caretaker government, in coordination with leaders \n     from Egypt's opposition, civil society, and military, to \n     enact the necessary reforms to hold free, fair, and \n     internationally credible elections this year;\n       (7) affirms that a real transition to a legitimate \n     representative democracy in Egypt requires concrete steps to \n     be taken as soon as possible, including lifting the state of \n     emergency, allowing Egyptians to organize independent \n     political parties without interference, enhancing the \n     transparency of governmental institutions, restoring judicial \n     supervision of elections, allowing credible international \n     monitors to observe the preparation and conduct of elections, \n     and amending the laws and Constitution of Egypt as necessary \n     to implement these and other critical reforms;\n       (8) pledges full support for Egypt's transition to a \n     representative democracy that is responsive to the needs of \n     the Egyptian people, and calls on all nations to support the \n     people of Egypt as they work to conduct a successful \n     transition to democracy;\n       (9) expresses deep concern over any organization that \n     espouses an extremist ideology, including the Muslim \n     Brotherhood, and calls upon all political movements and \n     parties in Egypt, including an interim goverment, to affirm \n     their commitment to non-violence and the rule of law, the \n     equal rights of all individuals, accountable institutions of \n     justice, religious, tolerance, peaceful relations with \n     Egypt's neighbors, and the fundamental principles and \n     practices of democracy, including the regular conduct of free \n     and fair elections;\n       (10) underscores the vital importance of any Egyptian \n     Government continuing to fulfill its international \n     obligations, including its commitments under the Egypt-Israel \n     Peace Treaty signed on March 26, 1979 and the freedom of \n     navigation through the Suez Canal; and\n       (11) ensures that United States assistance to the Egyptian \n     Government, military, and people will advance the goal of \n     ensuring respect for the universal rights of the Egyptian \n     people and will further the national security interests of \n     the United States in the region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/02/03/senate-section/article/S558-1", "month": "02", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S558-S559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONGRATULATING THE EASTERN WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL TEAM\n\n  Mr. REID.
