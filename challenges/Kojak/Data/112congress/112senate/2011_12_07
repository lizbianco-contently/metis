Madam President, 70 years ago today the attack on Pearl \nHarbor changed our country forever. It also hardened our resolve to \nbecome a better, stronger nation, and that we have become.\n  An example is the USS Nevada, a great battleship that epitomizes the \nresiliency of our country. While in the port of Oahu on December 7, \n1941, the battleship Nevada was hit by many bombs and a torpedo. Sixty \nAmerican sailors died. Less than a year later, that great battleship \nreturned to service and served valiantly for our country during World \nWar II.\n  Today we honor the living Pearl Harbor veterans for their courage and \nsacrifice. Here in the Senate we refer to our Medal of Honor winner Dan \nInouye, and Senator Akaka, and Frank Lautenberg. All three served in \nWorld War II.\n  We also remember the nearly 2,400 Americans who lost their lives that \nday and the hundreds of thousands more who made the ultimate sacrifice \nduring World War II. These servicemembers are heroes. They set a fine \nexample for the men and women who protect our freedoms today, and none \nof us will ever forget their courage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8381-8", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8381-S8382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PAYROLL TAX CUT\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Republicans like to claim they are the \nparty of the tax cuts, but as Democrats propose more tax relief--we \npropose it every day for working families--Republicans every day are \nshowing their true colors. They only support tax cuts that benefit the \nrich.\n  Speaker Boehner and Senator McConnell say they agree with Democrats, \nthat we should prevent a $1,000 tax hike on middle-class families. A \nperson running for President, Mitt Romney, agrees that we should extend \nthe payroll tax cut. The former Speaker who is running for President, \nNewt Gingrich, says we should extend the payroll tax cut. But it has \nbecome clear that the caucus, led by the Speaker and by the Republican \nleader--that those they lead don't seem to be following them. Tea party \nRepublicans oppose our plan to cut taxes for nearly every American \nfamily. But Republican leaders recognize that taking $1,000 out of \nmiddle-class pockets during these hard times is political suicide.\n  There are papers all over the country, but take this one as an \nexample. ``GOP Is Split On Payroll Tax Cut. Objections To Surtax On \nRich.'' Remember, the surtax is on the second million\n\n[[Page S8382]]\n\ndollars that people make. On the first million dollars, not a penny. On \nthe second million dollars, the bill that we are going to vote on--\nprobably Friday here, maybe Thursday--has a surtax for people's second \nmillion dollars of income of less than 2 percent.\n  The headlines go on to say ``Opposition Could Give Obama a 2012 \nIssue.'' Obama doesn't need a 2012 issue. Middle-class Americans do not \nneed a tax increase. That is what this is all about.\n  It is very clear that there is a bitter division in the House with \nHouse Republicans. As you know, they were supposed to send us a bill \ntoday--or was it yesterday? They finally acknowledged late yesterday \nthey could not send us anything. They cannot get an agreement even \namong the Republicans. They don't reach out to the Democrats at all. \nThey want to do it with a majority of the majority, and they cannot get \nanything done.\n  So it seems to me, faced with this rebellion in the two caucuses, \nRepublican leaders have two options: They can work with us to forge a \ncompromise that will pass or they can move even further to the right to \nappease the tea party, because that is what this is all about. As we \nhave seen before, when faced with a choice between the middle class and \nthe tea party, Republicans will choose the tea party every time. We \nhave seen before, when faced with a choice between the middle class and \nthe richest of the rich, the Republicans choose the richest of the \nrich.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8382-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, tomorrow the Senate will vote on whether \nto move forward with confirmation of Richard Cordray, the nominee to \nhead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is part of the \nDodd-Frank bill.\n  The one thing that came out of that legislation--and certainly we \nunderstood with the financial meltdown that took place on Wall Street--\nis the banks need more control, not less. We also learned during that \nlong debate that the American consumer had no protection whatsoever. \nThe legislation we passed created the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau.\n  My Republican colleagues have signaled they are going to block \nCordray's nomination but not because he is unqualified. You would think \nthat if someone wanted to vote against him, it would be because he is \ntoo liberal, he is too conservative, he is too rich, he is too poor, he \ndoesn't have the proper education, whatever you could come up with to \nfind justification for voting against this man. That is not what they \nhave done. For the first time I can ever remember--and my staff did \nresearch on this last night--for the first time in Senate history the \nRepublicans are poised to block a qualified nominee solely because they \ndon't like the Federal agency he will lead.\n  The Senate Republicans have no problem with Mr. Cordray. He has \nbipartisan support and a long history of fighting unfair practices by \nfinancial predators. Instead, Republicans are trying to cripple the new \nconsumer agency altogether by depriving it of a director. Their \nattempts to hamstring the consumer watchdog will leave Americans \nvulnerable to scams and rip-offs that are going on as we speak and have \ngone on in the past. It is shameful that Republicans would leave \nconsumers in the dark about the risk they face when making financial \ndecisions, and they are doing it only to try to change a law that is \nthe law of this land.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8382-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AFFORDABLE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Finally, my first elected job, many years ago, was to an \norganization called the Southern Nevada Memorial Hospital. It was the \nlargest hospital in the State. It was the largest hospital district. \nPeople ran at-large from Clark County, the Las Vegas area, and I was \nelected to that. It was my first elected job. When I took that job, \nthere was no Medicare. In that hospital, when someone came who was old \nand did not have money, someone had to sign for them--a husband, a \nwife, father, mother, brother, sister, neighbor; someone signed. If \nthat person did not pay after agreeing to pay, we had a large \ncollection agency and we would go after those people. It was very \ndifficult sometimes to collect that money, difficult in the sense it \nwas hard to do, but, more importantly, it was difficult to do because \nyou hated to go after people to pay these large hospital and doctor \nbills.\n  Medicare came into being before I left my job. It changed. Prior to \nMedicare, 40 percent of the seniors who came into that hospital had no \ninsurance, and that is where they had to look to their friends and \nneighbors and relatives to take care of that bill. Today, after \nMedicare is the law of the land, virtually every senior citizen has the \nability to go into a hospital anyplace in America.\n  For all of these many years, going on five decades, Medicare has been \nimproving and extending the lives of seniors. The Affordable Care Act, \nlegislation that my Republican colleagues tend to denigrate, \nObamacare--let's talk a little bit about Obamacare today, the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  One thing that bill did is it extended the life of Medicare for 12 \nyears. Medicare would stay strong for future generations and for \nretirees. That is one reason we passed that legislation.\n  Health care reform today is helping seniors by beginning to close the \ndoughnut hole, the infamous doughnut hole for prescription drugs for \nseniors. This year; that is, 2011, because of the legislation we \npassed, Obamacare, more than 2.5 million Medicare recipients, including \nthousands of Nevadans, saved about $600 each on prescription drugs. \nThat amounts to about $1.6 billion, thanks to this legislation. For \nsome seniors on fixed incomes, those savings prevented difficult \nchoices between literally food and medicine.\n  We also had a provision in that legislation that people could get \nwellness checks, screenings, and a checkup. More than 24 million \nseniors this year got free physicals because of health care reform. \nThat is progress of which America can be proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8382-3", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, as the majority leader has noted, \ntoday is the 70th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. I \nhave certainly had the opportunity, and many Members of the Senate may \nhave as well, of visiting World War II era veterans when they come to \nWashington on what are called the honor flights, where veterans groups \nraise the funds to get these World War II vets up here to see the World \nWar II Memorial. It is a great inspiration to see these members of the \n``greatest generation'' who, indeed, saved America during World War II.\n  I remember in particular talking to an elderly gentleman--obviously \nthey are all elderly at this point--who was at Pearl Harbor that day, \nand his describing the horror of the experience. So whether these World \nWar II veterans served in Pearl Harbor or in Europe or in the Pacific \ntheatre, we certainly remember their extraordinary contribution to \nsaving this country, and today in particular.\n  For our parents' generation, they always remembered exactly where \nthey were when they heard about the attack. For most of us, we remember \nexactly where we were when we heard about the Kennedy assassination, \nthat moment that is seared in your memory of some extraordinary event; \nand, of course, for younger people, the 9/11 attack. Everybody \nremembers exactly where they were, and millions of Americans saw the \nsecond plane go into the second building in real time. But today we \nremember the attack, and we express our admiration and respect for the \n``greatest generation.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8382-5", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8382-S8383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, today the President welcomes Canadian \nPrime Minister Stephen Harper to the White House, and I would like to \ntake the opportunity to say that I hope the Prime Minister is able to \nconvince President Obama to reverse his recent decision to delay the \nKeystone XL Pipeline.\n\n[[Page S8383]]\n\n  The President has said repeatedly that jobs are his top priority. He \nsays he wakes up every morning thinking about how he can create jobs. \nYet here is the single greatest shovel-ready project in America ready \nto go, and for some reason he is suddenly not interested.\n  I have a question: How is it that when it comes to taxpayer-\nsubsidized jobs that may or may not materialize, the President tells us \nwe can't wait, we have to do it tomorrow, but when it comes to private \nsector jobs that are ready to go immediately, he is in no rush? It \ndoesn't make any sense, particularly when we look at some of the \nPresident's past statements.\n  Here are a couple of examples. President Obama said earlier this \nyear:\n\n       For those--just to give a background to folks, there are \n     these tar sands in Canada that can produce oil. There is talk \n     about building a pipeline into the United States to import \n     that oil.\n\n  This is the President. He said:\n\n       I will make this general point, which is that, first of \n     all, importing oil from countries that are stable and \n     friendly is a good thing.\n\n  That is the President, and I agree with him.\n  The President also said earlier this year--a statement of the \nobvious:\n\n       We're still going to have to import some oil.\n\n  Boy, are we.\n\n       And when it comes to the oil we import from other nations, \n     obviously we've got to look at neighbors like Canada and \n     Mexico that are stable and steady and reliable sources.\n\n  That was the President earlier this year.\n  So the President has correctly said, in my view, that he favors \nimporting oil from allies and neighbors. Here is a project that would \nenable us to do that and do a lot more of it and create thousands of \njobs in the process. What is the problem?\n  Last Friday, Americans woke up to the news that for the 34th month in \na row, the unemployment rate in this country has stood above 8 \npercent--a period of joblessness not seen since the Great Depression. \nThe least they can expect from Washington is that we will not stand in \nthe way of people who want to hire. Yet that is exactly what they are \ngetting from this President when it comes to this pipeline. This \nproject has been under review for years--3 years--including two \nexhaustive environmental evaluations. By all accounts, the State \nDepartment was ready to give it the green light by the end of this \nyear--this month.\n  What happened? Well, it appears Presidential politics got in the way. \nThe President started getting heat from the environmental activists he \nis counting on to stuff envelopes next year, so he conveniently put off \nthe decision until right after next year's election.\n  So if this episode tells us anything, it is that the President is \nclearly more concerned about getting himself reelected next year than \ngetting somebody in Montana or Kansas or South Dakota or Missouri a job \ntoday. He is so determined to keep his liberal base happy, he is even \nwilling to go against the labor unions that, by the way, are \nenthusiastically in favor of beginning this project right now.\n  What have they had to say about it? Well, the Teamsters put it this \nway:\n\n       The Keystone Pipeline project will offer working men and \n     women a real chance to earn a good wage and support their \n     families in this difficult economic climate.\n\n  That is Jimmy Hoffa.\n  The AFL-CIO:\n\n       For America's skilled craft construction professionals, any \n     discussion of the Keystone XL project begins and ends with \n     one word: JOBS.\n\n  The AFL-CIO further said:\n\n       As many as 500,000 indirect jobs via a strong economic \n     multiplier effect . . . without one single dollar of \n     government assistance.\n\n  Isn't this what we are looking for? It doesn't cost the government \nanything. It creates jobs immediately. This is what we are looking for.\n  The Brotherhood of Electrical Workers:\n\n       At a time when jobs are the top global priority, the \n     Keystone project will put thousands back to work and have \n     ripple benefits throughout the North American economy.\n\n  Laborers' International Union of North America had this to say: This \nis ``not just a pipeline, but is a lifeline''--not just a pipeline, but \na lifeline--``for thousands of desperate working men and women.''\n  So what do we have here? We have a privately funded project that \nlabor leaders are saying their members want up and running. But the \nPresident says this one can wait. Despite what he has said about \nimporting oil from allies, despite what the labor unions say, the \nPresident wants to delay these jobs until after his election.\n  It is not just the unions and the Republicans who are asking for this \nproject to move forward. Let's take a look at what some of the \nDemocrats in Congress have said about it. There was a letter from 22 \nHouse Democrats to President Obama on October 19 of this year, and I \nwill just read a few excerpts: ``America truly cannot afford to say \nno.''\n  Further in the letter:\n\n       Mr. President, America needs the Keystone XL Pipeline.\n\n  Further in the letter:\n\n       The Department of State's Final Environmental Impact \n     Statement reaffirmed the findings of the two previous \n     environmental impact statements, namely, that the Keystone XL \n     Pipeline will have no significant impact on the environment.\n\n  Further in this letter from the 22 Democrats to the President they \nsaid:\n\n       This represents a true shovel-ready project that would \n     directly create 20,000 high quality domestic manufacturing \n     and construction jobs for Americans who are desperately \n     seeking employment.\n\n  That is 22,000 directly working for the pipeline. I have already \ndescribed the spin-off benefits--the other jobs that would be created \nas a result of it.\n  Senator Baucus--right here in the Senate--Senator Baucus said:\n\n       We need to put Montanans back to work and cannot afford \n     further delays to the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\n  Senator Tester said:\n\n       It should not have to wait 14 months for an up-or-down \n     decision.\n\n  The Montana Senators have it right. Americans can't wait for the next \nelection. They want their jobs now--right now.\n  So it is my hope that Prime Minister Harper is able to convince the \nPresident to change his mind.\n  Congressional Republicans and Democrats stand ready to move forward \non this project. We are prepared to do all within our means to get the \nKeystone XL Pipeline approved. There is literally no time for delay.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I rise this morning to discuss the North \nAmerican Energy Security Act in a colloquy with my colleagues. Joining \nme will be our leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison of Texas, Senator Johnny Isakson from the great State \nof Georgia, Senator Mike Johanns from Nebraska, and Senator Jim Inhofe \nof Oklahoma. We are here to discuss a very solutions-oriented piece of \nlegislation. It is about creating jobs. It is about creating energy \nsecurity for our Nation. It is about good environmental stewardship. It \nis about all of these things and more.\n  We want to take this opportunity to discuss the legislation and \nencourage--to urge--our fellow colleagues to join with us to create \njobs and opportunity for the American people. In a nutshell, this \nlegislation clears the way for the Keystone XL Pipeline, which is a \n1,700-mile pipeline that will run from Alberta, Canada, all the way \ndown to the gulf coast region of the country, down to the refineries in \nthe United States.\n  This blue line shows the route of the Keystone XL Pipeline. This red \nline shows an existing pipeline, the Keystone Pipeline, which was built \nvery recently by TransCanada. It provides almost 600,000 barrels a day \nof crude to the United States. The Keystone XL Pipeline would provide \nmore than 700,000 barrels a day of crude oil to our refineries. In \naddition, it will also haul domestic crude from States such as North \nDakota and Montana.\n  It will put 100,000 barrels a day of our own light, sweet, domestic \ncrude into the pipeline to bring it down for our needs in the country. \nIt will also bring oil from places such as Cushing, OK, where we \ncurrently have backlogs to the refineries, as well. So it is also about \nmoving oil within our country as well as bringing Canadian crude to the \nUnited States and to our refineries.\n  I mentioned it is a job creation bill. As our leader said just a \nminute ago, just the construction alone will put 20,000 workers on the \njob--20,000 workers on the job--just constructing the pipeline. The \nPerryman Group out of Waco, TX, has indicated more than 250,000 jobs. \nIt is a huge job creator.\n  I yield to our leader, Senator McConnell.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator will yield on that point, it is my \nunderstanding, and is it not correct, that these are not jobs sometime \nin the future but these are, in fact, jobs that just as soon as the \nPresident would sign off on this, this project is ready to go. We don't \nhave to borrow any--the government doesn't have to borrow any money and \nthey don't have to try to stimulate anything. This is a project, as I \nunderstand it, I would ask my friend from North Dakota, that is \nliterally shovel ready and will not cost the government a penny?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. This is a project that is absolutely ready to go and will \nnot cost the Federal Government one penny. It puts 20,000 workers on \nthe job right away.\n  The hurdle was the route through Nebraska, but we have now worked \nwith the State of Nebraska. They have had a special session. They have \nset up a process to clear that part of the route. Our legislation says \nwithin 60 days after passage of this bill the route is deemed approved. \nThat is after 3 years of process through the EPA.\n  So we are ready to go. We have addressed the issues. We can put these \npeople on the job now if we can get the Presidential approval.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In fact, I would say to my friend, the Senator from \nNebraska is on the Senate floor with us right now. He could further \nunderscore that the people of Nebraska, having now satisfied the \nconcern they had earlier about location, seem to be ready to go.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to respond \nto the leader's comment and his question. The leader is absolutely \nright. The people of Nebraska, through their elected officials, have \nworked with the company building this pipeline in that they have \nresolved their differences.\n\n  The reason I support this legislation and have decided to be a \ncosponsor of the legislation is that this legislation respects the \nNebraska process. It says there will be a process in Nebraska where we \nwill site the pipeline in the best place. This legislation says that is \nfine. But what this legislation also acknowledges is, on the entire \nrest of the pipeline outside of the State of Nebraska, this is ready to \nbe built today.\n  The President of the United States has had 3 years of background \nstudy and extensive environmental study, as the leader has pointed out, \nand nothing is going to change outside of the State of Nebraska. So \nwork can begin today. There is just one person holding up that work. \nThat is the President of the United States. With the stroke of a pen, \nhe can turn this project loose. It will respect what is going on in \nNebraska. Workers can be hired, the pipeline can be built, and those \njobs can be literally provided today.\n  So I support this legislation. I am proud to be here this morning to \nsay that and to thank the Senator from North Dakota, the minority \nleader, and all others who have worked with us to solve this problem. \nThe problem is solved. We are ready to create the jobs. It is my hope \nthe President will announce that he is ready to proceed to create these \njobs for American workers.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Could I ask one further question of either or both of \nthe Senators--and Senator Isakson as well.\n  I understand there is a suggestion that there may be political \nconcerns on the President's part, and we all know that most \nenvironmental groups are very much on the Democratic side. But is it \nnot the case that there are a number of unions in the country--most of \nwhich, certainly, do not support Republicans anywhere I know--that also \nfeel passionately about this issue and would like to get to work? Is \nthat not the case?\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I ask Senator Johanns, would he like to respond?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I have worked on this issue for a number of months--\nactually, a couple of years. Here is the situation: Unions are ready to \ngo to work. I talk to the locals in Nebraska on a regular basis, and \nthey talk about unemployment numbers that are staggering, in the \ndouble-digits, which, in our State, is remarkable because we have an \nunemployment rate of 4.2 percent.\n  The unions are ready to go to work, bringing their skills and their \ntalents to bear. The leader's observation is absolutely right.\n  For the environmentalists, on the other hand, it is not the pipeline, \nit is not the location, it is that they do not want the tar sands \ndevelopment to occur. So the President is on the horns of a dilemma. \nPart of his base, the unions, are saying: Create the jobs. There is \nalready a pipeline. Let's go out there and do this in the most \nenvironmentally sensitive way we possibly can.\n\n[[Page S8385]]\n\n  On the other hand, the environmentalists are saying: No, Mr. \nPresident. They have circled the White House. They have done all of \nthese things. Well, the President solved this dilemma he finds himself \nin, in my judgment, by announcing he would just delay this until after \nthe election.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Could I ask the Senator from Nebraska a further \nquestion?\n  It strikes me--correct me if I am wrong--that America not going \nforward does not prevent this from happening, just in another country. \nAnd a good option for the Canadians might well be to just ship this \nproduct to China. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Well, in response to the leader's question, the Canadian \nGovernment has already indicated that if the United States is not a \nreliable purchaser and transporter of this commodity, they will have to \nlook to other parts of the world, for example, China, to sell this \nproduct.\n  This will not stop the development in that area. In fact, it will \npush the development to a part of the world where the refinery process \nmight take place with fewer environmental standards and, therefore, \ncause more environmental problems than if we build this pipeline and \nsolve it. That is why from the very beginning I have said: Look, I am \nnot opposed to the tar sands development. I am not even opposed to the \npipeline in our State, now that we have solved the problem.\n  As I said, there is one person who can create these jobs today. That \nis the President of the United States. With the Prime Minister with the \nPresident, it would be a perfect opportunity to say: We do not have to \nwait until after the election. Let's create these jobs today. Let's put \nAmericans to work.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Just one final observation, and then I am going to \nleave the colloquy to all the rest of my colleagues. But it strikes \nme--and I wonder if my colleagues agree--this is about as close to a \nno-brainer as we will ever run into in America. There is no government \nmoney.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I would ask Senator Isakson to join us at this point. He \nis here specifically to talk a little bit about the issue with oil \nsands development and China. So Senator Isakson, and then certainly \nSenator Hutchison as well.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank Senator Hoeven for the recognition, and I thank \nthe leader for his remarks.\n  I just want to confirm what the leader just said by quoting from two \nrecent articles. The first is from an article about Minister Oliver, \nwho is Canada's Minister of Natural Resources, on his trip to Shanghai. \nHere is his quote:\n\n       My mission to China is clear. I have come to raise \n     awareness of the strength of Canada's natural resource \n     sectors--as both an outstanding source of quality products \n     and an attractive destination for investment.\n\n  Let me read one other quote that occurred shortly after that speech \nwas made by the Canadian Minister of Natural Resources:\n\n       A unit of China Petrochemical Corp., [known as] Sinopec, \n     agreed to buy Daylight Energy Ltd., a Canadian oil and \n     natural-gas producer, for 2.2 billion Canadian dollars . . \n     .--China's second [purchase and second] foray into Canada's \n     oil patch in [the last year].\n\n  So to confirm what the leader has said, and to confirm what Senator \nHoeven has acknowledged, this is not something we might fear happening \nlater on. This is something happening now. If we default on the \nKeystone XL Pipeline now, we are giving a wide open year for the \nChinese to come back to Canada, make those investments, tie down that \noil, and encourage that pipeline to go--not to Houston, TX--but to \nVancouver, Canada, and then on ships to China.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of both of these articles \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [Natural Resources Canada, Nov. 9, 2011]\n\n           Minister Oliver Promotes Canadian Energy in China\n\n       ``My mission to China is clear. I have come to raise \n     awareness of the strength of Canada's natural resource \n     sectors--as both an outstanding source of quality products \n     and an attractive destination for investment,'' said the \n     Honourable Joe Oliver, Canada's Minister of Natural \n     Resources, while speaking today at the Canadian Chamber of \n     Commerce in Shanghai.\n       The Minister has been in Beijing and Shanghai this week \n     meeting with senior government officials and leaders of \n     Chinese companies.\n       Minister Oliver met with Vice Premier Li Keqiang and \n     discussed the role of investment and trade in energy and \n     mineral resources in contributing to Canada's long-term \n     strategic partnership with China. He also signed an agreement \n     with the President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, \n     Professor Bai Chunli, to expand cooperation on science and \n     technology in earth sciences and natural resources.\n       Over the last few days, Minister Oliver has held meetings \n     with major Chinese energy companies including Sinopec, China \n     National Offshore Oil Corporation and Petrochina to discuss \n     Canada's enormous energy resources and attractive investment \n     climate.\n       ``As reaffirmed today in the International Energy Agency's \n     2011 World Outlook, global energy demand is expected to \n     increase by one third from 2010 to 2035,'' said Minister \n     Oliver. ``Given that Canada is also projected to be an ever-\n     increasing contributor to global energy supply, our Chinese \n     investors recognize the importance of getting into the \n     Canadian energy market right now.''\n       The Minister discussed the Government of Canada's key \n     strategic policy of diversifying Canadian energy markets and \n     participated in a joint Canada-B.C. event with Canadian and \n     Chinese industry officials to promote exports to China.\n       Minister Oliver met with Vice Chair Zhang Xiaoqiang of the \n     National Development and Reform Commission on strengthening \n     Canada's long-term strategic partnership with China through \n     two-way trade and investment in energy and natural resources.\n       While in Shanghai, the Minister also toured the Jinqiao \n     Wood Townhouse Demonstration Project, where he underlined the \n     many benefits of Canadian wood-frame construction expertise \n     for China.\n       This demonstration project is one of several in China \n     funded by the Government of Canada to showcase the low-\n     carbon, environmentally friendly and energy-efficient \n     properties of wood-frame construction, and to assist China in \n     meeting its national goals of reducing carbon emissions in \n     new housing projects.\n       Minister Oliver continued to highlight the phenomenal \n     growth in exports of wood products when he met with Vice \n     Minister Qiu Baoxing, Ministry of Housing and Urban Rural \n     Development, as well as with British Columbia Premier Christy \n     Clark and Pat Bell, BC Minister of Jobs, Tourism and \n     Innovation, to discuss trilateral cooperation on wood-frame \n     housing in China.\n       Minister Oliver will now continue on to Tokyo and Sendai, \n     Japan.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 10, 2011]\n\n          Sinopec Deepens China's Push Into Canadian Oil Patch\n\n                           (By Edward Welsch)\n\n       A unit of China Petrochemical Corp., or Sinopec, agreed to \n     buy Daylight Energy Ltd., a Canadian oil and natural-gas \n     producer, for 2.2 billion) Canadian dollars (US$2.12 \n     billion)--China's second big foray into Canada's oil patch in \n     recent months.\n       In July, Cnooc Ltd. agreed to pay just over $2 billion for \n     bankrupt OPTI Canada Inc., in a rare move by a Chinese \n     company to swoop in and swallow an entire company instead of \n     tiptoeing in with a minority stake.\n       In the North American energy sector, in particular, Chinese \n     companies have been wary of political fallout if they are \n     seen as acting too aggressively in a sector that many \n     consider to be strategic.\n       But the two recent moves suggest sensitivities in Beijing \n     may be easing somewhat--at least regarding business in \n     Canada. The federal government in Ottawa and its \n     semiautonomous provincial counterparts have long welcomed \n     foreign investment in the Canadian oil patch, which includes \n     vast conventional oil and natural-gas reserves, but also the \n     much more capital-intensive, oil-sands developments of \n     northern Alberta.\n       Canadian companies, with relatively small domestic capital \n     markets to fall back on, have relied on foreign investment--\n     including from China--though more often that has come in the \n     form of minority stakes in companies, or joint ventures in \n     certain capital-intensive projects.\n       Last year, for instance, Sinopec bought ConocoPhillips' 9 \n     percent stake in its large Syncrude oil-sands project in \n     northeastern Alberta for $4.65 billion.\n       Recently, some Canadian politicians and businessmen have \n     expressed new wariness over big foreign deals.\n       Ottawa rejected Australia-based BHP Billiton Ltd.'s $39 \n     billion attempt to buy Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. last \n     year. The Canadian government said the deal wouldn't bring \n     enough economic benefit. However, a campaign against the \n     takeover launched by the local government of Saskatchewan \n     generated significant support from regional politicians and \n     the public.\n       The Sinopec-Daylight deal will face the same sort of \n     government review that other significant foreign deals \n     undergo, including a federal sign-off. But it isn't expected \n     to garner the same sort of scrutiny as the BHP-Potash bid.\n       Potash holds a significant chunk of the world's reserves of \n     potash, a critical raw material in fertilizer. Critics used \n     that market dominance to argue that Potash was a strategic \n     asset that should remain in Canadian hands.\n\n[[Page S8386]]\n\n       Daylight, meanwhile, is a relatively small energy \n     competitor--one of scores of Canadian companies that hold \n     just a thin slice of the country's overall petroleum \n     reserves.\n       Daylight produces light oil and natural gas from properties \n     in northeast British Columbia and northwestern Alberta. The \n     company produced just 37,000 barrels of oil equivalents in \n     the second quarter. But Daylight has accumulated a \n     significant undeveloped land position in the emerging \n     liquids-rich Duvernay shale-gas play in Alberta.\n       Sinopec is laying down a sizable premium for the deal. In a \n     statement Sunday, Daylight, based in Calgary, said that \n     Sinopec had agreed to buy the company for C$10.08 a share, \n     representing a premium of 43.6 percent over the 60-day \n     weighted average price of the stock ending Oct 7.\n       ``We believe this transaction with [Sinopec] recognizes the \n     highly attractive asset portfolio and exceptional team that \n     we have assembled,'' said Anthony Lambert, the president and \n     chief executive of Daylight, in the statement\n       Barclays Capital advised Sinopec on the transaction. \n     Canaccord Genuity Corp. advised Daylight. Q02\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank Senator Isakson and ask the Senator if he has any \nmore he wants to add. I know the Senator has to leave and is on a tight \ntimetable.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Just to thank the Senator for his leadership; the \nSenator's leadership on this issue has been outstanding.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank Senator Isakson and thank him for being here.\n  I will turn to Senator Hutchison from Texas.\n  We have actually 40 Senators already on this legislation--40 \nSenators. It is bipartisan. This is something we absolutely need to \nmove on. I spoke with the Canadian Ambassador today, Ambassador Doer. \nHe talked about how they are already looking at Western routes to send \nthis oil to China.\n  So this oil is going to be produced. It is going to be produced. The \nquestion is, Does it come to the United States and help us reduce our \ndependence on Middle Eastern oil? Does it come here and create \nthousands of jobs or do we send it to China where there will actually \nbe more emissions because it will be refined in refineries that produce \nhigher emissions?\n  We will also have the emissions of shipping product all around the \nworld, not only shipping this oil to China but then we are going to \ncontinue to have to ship oil from places such as the Middle East and \nVenezuela. So we actually increase CO2 emissions without \nthis project.\n  Now, in Texas, of course, we have refineries, and Senator Hutchison \nis here to talk about just how important it is we bring this product \ndown to our refineries in the gulf coast region.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from North Dakota because Senator \nHoeven has been a leader on this issue, knowing how important this find \nis, and how much more capacity we will have for affordable energy in \nour country if we can extend the pipeline.\n  This is a pipeline that is not just starting from Canada into the \nUnited States. The Keystone Pipeline was started in 2008. The initial \nline moves 590,000 barrels of oil per day from northern Alberta to \npoints in Cushing, OK, and Patoka, IL. The XL extension--which is what \nwe are talking about that is being held up by the State Department--is \ncurrently under review. It would expand the system by 700,000 barrels \nper day--so more than double what we are getting already--and bring the \nline further south to Texas.\n  Well, now, why is that important? It is because 25 percent of the \nrefinery capacity in America is in Texas. It is in the gulf coast of \nTexas. That is where the refiners are. We are talking about producing \nnow more affordable energy for all the consumers in our country by \nbringing it straight down and having it refined and sent back out to \nall points in America. Otherwise, what my colleagues have just been \ntalking about--Senator Isakson and Senator Hoeven--is that we will see \nCanada export this to other countries, whether it be China or other \ncountries, and eventually it is going to be coming back into the United \nStates much more expensively to be refined in Texas and sent out.\n  So specifically for Texas, it would put our State's 26 refineries \ninto probably 24 hours' of business, which means lots of jobs in Texas. \nThat 25 percent of U.S. production is approximately 5 percent of \nworldwide capacity. So we are talking about lowering the price of \nenergy throughout our country and the world.\n  It would produce an estimated $2.3 billion in new spending and \ngenerate more than $48 million in new tax revenue for my state alone. \nIt would result in 700,000 barrels of oil a day, as I have said. We \nknow the Canadian find--the sands that have been found there--is the \nthird largest capacity, next to Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, in \nrecoverable oil in the world. So we have the third largest reserve in \nCanada and we know we have the ability to bring that oil down, have it \nrefined, and go out to the United States because dependence on the \nMiddle East and North Africa has certainly led to price spikes. \nVenezuela is certainly not a reliable partner right now and supply \ninterruptions threaten our economy and our national security.\n  So the Keystone XL Pipeline would certainly be a boom to Texas and \nTexas jobs. But more than that, it is going to benefit every consumer \nof energy in America. It will more than double what we can buy from \nCanada, and think of the reliability of our Canadian relationship. The \nreliability of our trade and our relationship with our neighbor to the \nnorth, Canada, is among the most solid we have in all of the globe.\n  It is essential we build this pipeline. As the leader said earlier, \nthis is a no-brainer--as close as you can get to a no-brainer for \nbuilding our economy, creating jobs, and creating more tax revenue that \nwill bring down the deficit we have heard so much talk about on the \nother side--but this would do it the old-fashioned way: by giving \npeople the ability to provide for their families and contribute to the \neconomy of our country.\n  That is the way we want to see increased revenue in this country: \nwith more jobs and paying taxes, not collecting benefits because they \ncannot find work. It is right here, and it does not cost the government \na dime because it is private investment that will bring this oil to the \nrefineries and put it back out to the United States.\n  I urge the President of the United States to go to the State \nDepartment and say: Let this go. In lieu of urging the President, we \nhave a bill that was started by Senator Hoeven, with 40 sponsors, that \nwill tell the President: Now is the time--it is long past due time--for \nus to create the jobs in this country that are not going to be taxpayer \nfunded, that are going to be privately funded. They are going to create \ncleaner, better, cheaper, more efficient energy; and they are going to \ncreate jobs which people want in this holiday season and on into the \nfuture years.\n  So I thank my colleague from North Dakota for giving us this chance \nto tell the American people we have an answer to jobs and to bringing \ndown the deficit and increasing revenue the way people want to: by \nproviding for their families and paying taxes with the money they are \nearning. It is a win for everyone. I thank the Senator from North \nDakota for leading this effort.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the Senator from Texas. Senator Hutchison is, as \nusual, not only eloquent but has hit the nail on the head. Looking \nacross our country from North Dakota to Texas to Oklahoma, across our \ncountry we need these jobs. This is the way to get them, and we can get \nthem now. We need our President to act.\n  This legislation is a solutions-oriented bill.\n  It is about job creation. It is about energy independence. It is \nabout good environmental stewardship. We need to do it. I would like to \nnow turn to my esteemed colleague from the State of Oklahoma, Senator \nInhofe, who is the ranking member on Environment and Public Works. He \nhas a tremendous background in energy, as does Senator Hutchison. I \nwould turn to Senator Inhofe for his comments.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I do appreciate that. Sometimes we stand on the floor and \nwe talk about jobs. But here is the evidence, Oklahoma has a big dog in \nthis fight. Not only do we have Cushing--when the Senator from North \nDakota talked about Cushing, that is Cushing, OK, right there on his \nmap. That is kind of a choke point in this pipeline. They all kind of \nconverge. There is no way of getting down to Texas without getting \nthrough what we have in Oklahoma.\n  But more so, if you do not think this is a jobs bill, you have a very \nfamous Oklahoman working in your State. I would say Harold Hamm is \nprobably\n\n[[Page S8387]]\n\nthe No. 1 producer out there today. I have talked to him. Do you know \nwhat his biggest problem is in North Dakota? His biggest problem is he \ncannot find anyone to work. They are full employed up there. What \nbetter evidence is there that this solves the problem--that this is a \njobs bill--than the jobs in North Dakota?\n  I think there is something sadly lacking in this debate, though; that \nis, that this is just an extension of what this administration has been \ntrying to do. They have been trying to kill fossil fuels from the very \nbeginning. Let me quote Alan Kruger, who is chair of the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers. He says: ``The administration believes \nthat it is no longer sufficient to address our nation's energy needs by \nfinding more fossil fuels.'' He wants to kill fossil fuels.\n  Steven Chu, the Energy Secretary said: ``Somehow we are going to have \nto figure out how to increase the price of oil to be equal to that in \nCentral Europe.'' That is $8 a gallon. He is trying to wean us off \nfossil fuels. We cannot run this machine called America without it.\n  I only wanted to mention that, and I appreciate the Senator from \nNorth Dakota talking about the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nIt has been an effort of this administration through the backdoor, \nthrough regulation, to do away with fossil fuels. The boiler MACT--\nMACT, by the way, means Maximum Achievable Controlled Technology.\n  By increasing the emission requirements on boilers and on utilities, \nwe are talking about around $83 billion a year of cost. Compare that to \nthe cap and trade. Cap and trade right now is--and we have gone through \nthis on the floor with all these bills trying to have cap and trade and \nthe greenhouse gases and all that. The cost of that is between $300 and \n$400 billion a year. That is more than all the other regulations \ncombined.\n  It is all aimed at one thing. What is that one thing? To stop fossil \nfuels. Of course, when we talk about my State of Oklahoma being kind of \nthe choke point, as the Senator has pointed out in his chart over \nthere, I say to my good friend from North Dakota, we have done an \nanalysis of jobs just in my State of Oklahoma. By the construction of \nthe Keystone XL, that would be 14,000 new jobs just in Oklahoma--just \nin my State--and an increase of personal income by $847 million.\n  So this is a huge thing that we have in my State of Oklahoma. Cushing \njust happens to be the crossroads. That is where they all come \ntogether. They are clogged up now. As the Senator pointed out, they \ncannot do anything. Their hands are tied because they are in total \ncapacity right now.\n  It should be a no-brainer. But the problem is there is one man, as \nthe Senator from Nebraska said, one man can make this a reality, the \nPresident of the United States. He has made it very clear he does not \nwant to do anything to help fossil fuels in America. It is a political \nproblem we have.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. If I may, I would like to ask the esteemed Senator from \nOklahoma to talk for a minute on the subject of how we create that \nenvironment that gets job creation going. I think this project is a \nperfect example of what we are talking about. We have to create an \nenvironment--a legal, tax and regulatory environment--that empowers \nprivate investment, not government spending but private investment, to \nget job creation going.\n  Here we have a regulatory issue, where we just--TransCanada has \nworked for 3 years to meet the environmental process. Most recently, \nthe problem was in Nebraska, the Sand Hills area of Nebraska, the \nOgallala aquifer. But now we have come up with a solution to make sure \nwe deal with that issue. So we have cleared that process.\n  That means this project is ready to go as we have just described. \nLeader McConnell just a minute ago talked about how the labor unions \nstrongly support this project. I can go through that whole list as \nwell. In addition, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says: Let's go. We \nsupport this project. So we have 40 Senators, bipartisan, labor unions, \nChamber of Commerce.\n  Here is an another interesting statistic. This example is such a good \nexample of what we are talking about. I ask the Senator from Oklahoma \nto maybe expand on the point. But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce last \nyear released a study identifying 351 stalled energy projects \nnationwide costing the American economy $1.1 trillion in lost income \nimpact, and nearly 2 million jobs annually.\n  My point is this: We have to find a way to empower private investment \nto get job creation going. The esteemed Senator from Oklahoma is \nranking member on Environment and Public Works. He sees this every day. \nBut without more government spending, the secret to unlocking jobs in \nthis country is to empower the investment. I would ask if the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma can address that for just a minute because I think this \nproject is such a perfect example of what we are talking about.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is, and this is something that is understood. The term \na ``no-brainer'' has been used several times because we do not have to \nthink this through. One of the problems I have had--back when \nRepublicans were a majority, I chaired the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. That has jurisdiction over the Environmental Protection \nAgency, which has been making every effort to overregulate, to the \nextent--we know everybody knows of the spending crisis we have, the \ndeficit and the debt and all that. They do not understand the \noverregulation actually costs us more than all these fiscal issues \ncombined.\n  I mentioned just a few of those. I can recall, before the Senator \nfrom North Dakota was in this body, back during the Kyoto treaty--in \nthe Kyoto treaty, they were trying to get this through to have a type \nof cap and trade, something that they said somehow greenhouse gases \nwere going to cause catastrophic global warming and all that. That went \ndown the tubes. Then they started introducing legislation to do the \nsame thing. Then we had--and I appreciate the honesty of Lisa Jackson, \nwho is the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, when \nshe came out and said: No, if we were to have this strictly in the \nUnited States, it is not going to reduce the emissions.\n  This is kind of a long way around. The point I am trying to make is, \nit is very difficult for people to understand. Just the cap and trade \nthis administration is trying to do through regulations, because they \ncould not do it through legislation, is going to end up having the same \neffect: kill fossil fuels. That is what they are trying to do.\n  But the point the Senator from North Dakota is making is that is kind \nof complicated. That is hard to understand. This is not. This is \nalready out there. As I mentioned, just in my State of Oklahoma alone, \n14,000 new jobs. Who would be against it? The only ones against it are \npeople who do not want to keep this machine running in America because \nthey know they cannot do it without fossil fuels.\n  Maybe someday that will be different. It is not different today. The \nway to get it down, to bring it down, is through this pipeline. I am \nvery selfish. It is not just the country; I have 20 kids and grandkids \nright there in Oklahoma who are depending on us doing what we \nare supposed to be doing.\n\n  Mr. HOEVEN. I thank the esteemed Senator from Oklahoma. He is so \nright. That is what it is all about. It is about putting people back to \nwork. It is about American ingenuity, private investment. It is about \ngetting this economy going.\n  We have to find ways to save dollars, to reduce the spending that has \ngotten out of control. But a big part of getting out of the deficit and \nthe debt is getting people back to work and getting this economy \nrolling. We are talking about a project that will create 20,000 \nconstruction jobs right upfront, 250,000 permanent jobs, $600 million \nin State and local tax revenues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HOEVEN. This is a project that reduces our dependence on oil from \nthe Middle East. This is a project that provides better environmental \nstewardship, as we have described. This is a project where we need to \nmove forward. This body needs to be about solutions. This is a \nsolution. We need to act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n[[Page S8388]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8388-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8388-S8389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RICHARD CORDRAY NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President I come to the floor to speak in support \nof President Obama's nomination of Richard Cordray, from Ohio, to be \nthe Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He is a \nformer attorney general, former solicitor general, and former State \ntreasurer of Ohio.\n  He is unquestionably well qualified to take on the position for which \nhe has been nominated. Unfortunately, we are stuck in a Republican \nfilibuster of Mr. Cordray's nomination. Sometimes there is a hidden \nulterior motive around here. In this case, there is a stated ulterior \nmotive: to weaken the new agency's power to protect consumers.\n  Republican obstruction of Mr. Cordray's nomination has nothing to do \nwith Mr. Cordray himself. Former Republican Senator and current Ohio \nattorney general Mike DeWine has called Mr. Cordray very well qualified \nfor this job. Just last month, eight Republican attorneys general \ncolleagues of his joined 29 Democratic attorneys general in writing to \nLeaders Reid and McConnell with their support for Mr. Cordray's \nnomination.\n  Mr. Cordray has been endorsed by groups as varied as the AFL-CIO, the \nCredit Union National Association, the National Fraternal Order of \nPolice, and the AARP. But notwithstanding widespread bipartisan support \non Main Street, Senate Republicans are seeking to prevent Mr. Cordray \nfrom taking office as a service to Wall Street.\n  As one Republican member of the Senate Banking Committee said: ``My \ncolleagues and I stand by our pledge that no nominee to head the CFPB \nwill be confirmed by the U.S. Senate regardless of party affiliation \nwithout basic changes to the Bureau's structure.''\n  What are these basic changes? The basic changes the Republicans have \ndemanded include: making the agency subject to the budgetary influences \nof Congress, which given the way Congress is behaving is a way of \nallowing the influences of Wall Street to come through and control it, \nand also replacing the Director's position with a board that would \nensure that Wall Street is represented.\n  These are not constructive changes. These are an attempt to weaken a \nregulator designed to protect consumers. I hope my Republican \ncolleagues will reevaluate their filibuster of Mr. Cordray's \nnomination. But in the event they do not, let's take a moment to review \nthe consequences for the American people.\n  As many of our constituents know, in Rhode Island and in Minnesota, \nwe established the CFPB in the Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act as a new agency to protect American consumers from \nmisleading and potentially ruinous financial products. After the \nsubprime mortgage catastrophe, the logic behind that is pretty clear. \nWe designed this new agency to be for mortgages, credit cards, student \nloans, debt collection, credit reporting--what the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission is for toaster ovens, toys, baby strollers, \nbatteries, and swimming pools.\n  Harvard law professor Elizabeth Warren first proposed such an agency, \nand I was very proud to cosponsor Senator Durbin's original Financial \nProduct Safety Act of 2009, which was the first bill to bring Professor \nWarren's idea to the Senate.\n  We designed the CFPB to investigate consumer financial products and \ngave it the power to make rules ensuring that financial products are \ntransparent and fair, including, for the first time, providing Federal \noversight of previously unregulated loans and financial services from \nnonbank financial institutions. Those institutions are often the ones \nthat get regular Americans in deep and unexpected trouble because of \ntricks and traps in those contracts.\n  When you look at the length and the amount of fine print in consumer \ncontracts and when you look at the extent to which different traps and \ntricks get hidden in all that fine print in order to catch consumers in \nthings they weren't aware of and would not accept if they had been \naware of them, the reason for this oversight is obvious to most \nAmericans. Indeed, it is my contention that Americans in today's \nsociety are the most bedeviled group of humans in history by fine \nprint. Everywhere you go, you find fine print filled with tricks and \ntraps that fool you, that kick up your interest rate or give away \nrights that you have. So what we want is a little bit of a fair shot \nand a straight deal for the American consumer.\n  Under the temporary direction of the Treasure Secretary, the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau is actually already up and running. It is \nnow regulating the largest banks in the country--those with over $10 \nbillion in assets--as well as credit unions. Unfortunately, its \nauthority to protect consumers from these other financial products will \nbe unclear until there is a Director, which may be another motive for \nblocking a Director.\n  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is already out there looking \nout for American consumers to make sure big banks and credit unions are \nplaying by fair rules, but it has not yet been able to regulate the \nnonbank companies, such as mortgage services, the private student loan \nlenders, debt collectors, payday lenders, and credit reporting \nagencies. While the Senate Republicans filibuster this nominee--a very \nqualified nominee, an indisputably qualified nominee--some of the worst \nfinancial actors in the country remain unaccountable for their \ndeceptive and harmful practices. Predatory lenders near military bases \ncontinue to charge our servicemembers effective interest rates of up to \n800 percent. Private student lenders continue to withhold clear \ninformation about repayment terms from young students taking out these \nloans. Debt collectors continue to bully and harass those who are on \nthe edge of bankruptcy. So-called payday lenders continue to dupe \nsenior citizens into taking out loans bearing triple-digit interest \nrates.\n  This is the status quo Senate Republicans are preserving by blocking \nMr. Cordray's nomination. Consumer protection against these kinds of \npractices should not be a partisan issue. I really hope our colleagues \nacross the aisle at least allow us to have an up-or-down vote on this \nnomination. The majority rules, so let's vote and let's go.\n  Every day that Republicans continue their obstruction, Americans from \nall walks of life--from students, to senior citizens, to our men and \nwomen in uniform--will continue to be subjected to unchecked and \nunregulated deceptive financial products. They will continue to be prey \nfor predatory loan instruments.\n  Abusive lending practices that strip wealth from communities and \npurchasing power from consumers continue to hold back our struggling \neconomy. Let's confirm Mr. Cordray so that he can begin the hard work \nof leveling the playing field for the American consumer and help \nordinary Americans get a straight deal in our increasingly complex \neconomy. I hope we will be able to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I am honored to join and associate \nmyself with the remarks made by my colleague from Rhode Island, who has \nexpressed forcefully and eloquently the reasons that I believe Richard \nCordray should be confirmed in his nomination as Director of the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  This country faces a continuing financial crisis. We see it on the \njob lines, in the streets, and in our communities. That crisis can be \ntraced to the same abuses that this new agency was created by the \nCongress to fight.\n  The laws are good laws. They are designed to protect consumers from \nthose abuses and problems that led to this financial crisis. But the \nlaws are dead letter, or meaningless, unless they are enforced \nvigorously and rigorously, unless consumers are protected not just in \nword but in deed. That is the reason we should confirm Richard Cordray \nas the Director of the CFPB.\n  The people in this agency are doing good work. They have the \nauthority now to supervise some of the biggest banks, credit unions, \nand other financial institutions, but they need a Director to oversee \nthe work of nonbank financial institutions, such as independent payday \nlenders, nonbank mortgage lenders, nonbank mortgage servicers, debt \ncollectors, credit reporting agencies, and private student lenders.\n  Lest anyone think these are abstract or potential problems, they have \nonly to look to their neighbors and friends\n\n[[Page S8389]]\n\nwho are struggling to stay in their homes, seeking to pay their debts, \nand facing every day the continuing abuses in these areas. The bad \nactors may be among a minority of actors in this area, but they cannot \nbe counted unless Richard Cordray is confirmed. I know from my \nexperience that consumer protection laws are meaningless to ordinary \nAmericans, as they are to citizens of Connecticut, unless there is \nvigorous enforcement of these laws.\n  Richard Cordray will bring to this job a unique set of \nqualifications. He has been involved at the local and State levels in \nworking closely with community banks and credit unions, as well as \nother financial institutions, as a State and county treasurer. He \nunderstands the important role they play in small towns and \ncommunities. He knows how to work with institutions and the \nbusinesspeople who run them. He is realistic and sensible. He has \ncommon sense. He has had a positive experience--hands on--working at \nthe local and State level.\n  I have worked with him personally as an attorney general, worked \ncollaboratively with him--indeed, helping to start the investigation of \nthe mortgage service abuses that have led to a nationwide inquiry and, \nhopefully, will lead to a nationwide solution. I know him to be a \npractical and sensible person who knows how to listen. Richard Cordray \nknows how to listen to people who are affected by the rulings he may \nmake, the policies he may implement, and the people whom he may hire. \nIndeed, his nomination was praised by a former U.S. Senator and current \nattorney general, Mike DeWine, a Republican who defeated him in 2010.\n  Republicans in this body have made this issue a partisan one. It \nshould not be. There is nothing partisan about debt collectors or \nmortgage services or others who may abuse the trust of consumers. There \nis nothing partisan about people who become victims of the abusive \npractices that continue, which we need the CFPB to counter. There is \nnothing partisan--or should be nothing partisan about this individual, \nRich Cordray, who has dedicated his life to protecting ordinary men and \nwomen against the financial abuses the CFPB is designed to fight.\n  Blocking his nomination is, very simply, a way to stop the CFPB from \nending abuse. It may be articulated in a variety of ways, using words \nsuch as ``accountability,'' ``rulemaking,'' ``structure,'' or \n``authority'' as terms that are at issue. But the fact is that his \nnomination cries out for confirmation simply to implement the important \nlaws that this body has passed, laws that remain dead letter as long as \nthey are not enforced.\n  The men and women who are working in this agency now, under the \nleadership of Raj Date, are doing the best they can. They are making a \ndifference. They are protecting, for example, our veterans. Holly \nPetraeus, who is head of the division in the agency designed to protect \nour veterans, is doing great work in that area. She deserves our \nsupport; she needs and merits our support. She and others in that \nagency need and deserve the support of this Congress and this body in \nconfirming Rich Cordray.\n  I have worked with Rich Cordray. I know him as a man, as a public \nofficial, as a nominee. We will be losing a uniquely qualified person \nfor this job if we fail to do the right thing and protect consumers \nfrom the continuing abuses of this industry.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8389-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8389-S8390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PAYROLL TAX CUT\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the issue of the \npayroll tax and the tax cuts we are trying to enact, very similar to \nwhat we did last year when Democrats and Republicans came together at \nthe end of the year, right before the holiday season, and said, we have \nto take action now to make sure we are doing everything possible to \njump-start the economy.\n  One of the elements of that agreement last year--and, again, it was \nbipartisan--was a cut in the payroll tax. Just so people understand my \npoint about this tax--and I will deal only with the employee side--we \nknow that employees in the United States, when they make their payroll \ntax payment, it is 6.2 percent of their earnings. Last year we cut that \nfrom 6.2 to 4.2. It was the right thing to do and it had a positive \nimpact. What I am trying to do now--and, again, I think this is \nbipartisan--is to not just do that again, but we want to cut it even \nmore so that we can reduce it in half, so instead of paying 6.2, an \nindividual would pay 3.1.\n  This is a very basic idea, and what we are trying to do are two basic \nthings. No. 1 is to give folks out there more take-home pay--kind of \ndollars in the pocket. Last year, it was roughly $1,000 per worker. The \nimpact on a family--the positive impact of that--is very significant. \nThis year, we hope it will be greater. We hope we can enact something \nwhere the take-home pay savings are increased, depending on how one \nargues it, almost $1,500. Instead of being $900 or $1,000, for some \nfolks it can be $1,500 or $1,400 or somewhere in that range.\n  The second point on this is peace of mind. We ought to take action \nhere in a bipartisan way--and every once in a while we get this right--\nthat will say to people, we are trying to do our best to understand \nwhat you are up against. We are trying to take actions here that will \nlead to economic growth and job creation.\n  One of the actions we can take is making sure we reduce the payroll \ntax so folks out there have more money in their pocket--more take-home \npay--as they head not just into the holiday season but as they head \ninto the new year in 2012. So it is about take-home pay and peace of \nmind.\n  We have made some progress in the last couple of months, when we \nconsider where we have been and in trying to dig our way out of this \ngreat recession. Unfortunately, the progress we have made is far too \nmodest, and the economic recovery right now is still very vulnerable, \nvery fragile--pick your word, there are lots of ways to describe it. We \nneed this tax cut to boost consumer spending.\n  A lot of the business folks I talk to in Pennsylvania, when I ask \nthem if they want to hire, or if they want to increase their payroll, \nsay, I want to, but I can't. I say, why can't you? They say, there is \nnot enough demand out there. So one of the best ways--maybe the best \nway--to create demand in our economy is to have folks have more take-\nhome pay.\n  As you can see from this chart on my left, when we look at the \nquarters, starting right here, we see minus 6.7 percent. That is the \nfirst quarter of 2009. Eventually, we have gotten to the point where we \nhave started to have some growth. We have had nine straight quarters of \nGDP growth. But that is not enough--not nearly enough. It is movement \nin the right direction, but it has been barely positive, as you can \nsee, even if you look at just the last year. This .04 is the first \nquarter of 2011. So even though we had almost 4 percent of good growth \nback in a couple of quarters in 2009 and into 2010, in the last three-\nquarters of 2011, we had .4 percent growth, 1.3 percent growth, and 2.0 \npercent growth.\n  What we have to do now is make sure the fourth quarter is stronger, \nas best we can, and we need to make sure, by the actions we take here, \nthat 2012 is much better. We need to ensure we have stronger growth, \nand putting $1,500 of additional earnings into the pockets of 160 \nmillion workers, as I said before, will help substantially. I think \nthat number should be repeated. When we talk about cutting the payroll \ntax in half and putting more take-home pay in people's pockets, we are \ntalking about affecting 160 million workers in the United States.\n  Economists across the board have told us why this is so important. \nThey have reported the payroll tax cut will create jobs and increase \nGDP--increase those numbers I referred to on the chart--and that \nfailing to extend the tax cut will slow growth and lead to fewer jobs. \nMark Zandi, of Moody's Analytics--one of the economists both parties \nhave quoted over many years--estimates that not extending the current \npayroll tax cut--meaning allowing the payroll tax to go back up to the \n6.2\n\n[[Page S8390]]\n\npercent, not cutting it in half--would reduce gross domestic product \ngrowth by .5 percent in 2012.\n  So instead of having positive growth, he is saying that if we don't \nenact and extend the payroll tax cut from last year, at a minimum we \nwould be losing a half point of growth. That would be devastating to \nthis economy.\n  Goldman Sachs has said similar things. They put the negative impact \non GDP growth at as much as two-thirds of 1 percent in 2012. Most \neconomists are in that range in terms of the adverse impact. RBC \nCapital Markets concludes that the hit to GDP next year of failing to \nact would be a full 1 percent.\n  So you have economists saying half a percent adverse consequence, \ntwo-thirds maybe, but at least among others saying a full percentage \npoint. That would be devastating when we need to see growth at above 2 \nand hopefully even above 3. But that has been very hard to reach in the \nlast couple of months.\n  I put this chart up on my left to highlight what Mark Zandi said. \nHere is his warning when discussing what could happen on the current \npayroll tax cut in effect right now, the 4.2 level that we are at right \nnow from the cut from last year:\n\n       We'd be in recession right now without it.\n\n  That is what he said about what we did last year in a bipartisan way. \nI would hope we could end this year on a high note, on a bipartisan \nnote, and make sure we cut the payroll tax again and put more take-home \npay in people's pockets.\n  Then here is Mark Zandi talking about if we don't extend, what could \nhappen into the near future:\n\n       We'll likely go into recession.\n\n  So says Mark Zandi. We can't afford to do that. The payroll tax cut \nhas helped sustain the economic recovery this year, and it will \nstrengthen the economy in 2012 if we reduce it again.\n  My bill not only extends it but increases it so that the per worker \ntake-home pay increase, instead of being around $1,000, would be \napproximately $1,500.\n  We also know that cutting the tax leads to job growth. We know this \nfrom our experience, and we know this from recent history. At the end \nof 2010, Congress enacted the current payroll tax, cutting it from 6.2 \nto 4.2, and it took effect at the beginning of the year.\n  As we look at private sector job growth in 2011, we can see some of \nthe impact of the cut. As we can see on the chart, if you look at the \nfirst couple of bars--even if you can't read the smaller print here--\nthis depicts starting in January of 2011 what was the monthly change in \nprivate payrolls, meaning private sector job growth. January was only \n94,000, not that great of a month in January 2011. But look at \nFebruary: 261,000 private sector jobs added. Look at March: 219,000 \nprivate sector jobs added. And then April: 241,000. So you had an \naverage of about 240,000 private sector jobs growing in those 3 months. \nWhen we got to May and June, of course, a lot of things happened which \ntook that number way down. It slowed for a lot of reasons. One of them \nwas the spike in oil prices, another was the effect on gas prices, and, \nfinally, the earthquake in Japan had a terrible effect on our economy.\n  I am wrapping up here, but I want to make one more point about this. \nThe American people are looking at us right now, watching what we do, \nand they are saying basically two things to us--at least the people in \nPennsylvania, to me. They ask me one basic question: What are you doing \nto grow the economy and create jobs? What are you doing as an \nindividual Member of the Senate? One of the ways I can respond \naffirmatively and positively is to say we have come together to reduce \nthe payroll tax even more than we did last year to help you in your \nbottom line, so you have more take-home pay for you and your family.\n  The second thing they ask is, what are you doing to try to bring \npeople together, to try to reach a bipartisan consensus? We have all \ngot to try do that in our own way. This is about take-home pay and \npeace of mind. We need this tax cut in place to boost consumer \nspending, to create jobs, and accelerate economic growth.\n  I want to conclude with one thought about Social Security, because I \nknow it has been raised by a number of folks the last couple of days.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \naddressed to Secretary of the Treasury Geithner and Director, Office of \nManagement and Budget, Jacob Lew, dated December 6, 2011. It is signed \nby Steven C. Gross, Chief Actuary of the Social Security \nAdministration.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Social Security Administration,\n\n\n                                  Office of the Chief Actuary,\n\n                                  Baltimore, MD, December 6, 2011.\n     Hon. Timothy F. Geithner,\n     Secretary of the Treasury, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jacob J. Lew,\n     Director, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Geithner and Mr. Lew: We have reviewed the \n     language in the ``Middle Class Tax Cut Act of 2011'' (S. \n     1944), introduced yesterday by Senator Casey. We estimate \n     that the enactment of this bill would have a negligible \n     effect on the financial status of the Old Age and Survivors \n     Insurance and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program in both \n     the near term and the long term. We estimate that the \n     projected level of the OASI and DI Trust Funds would be \n     unaffected by enactment of this provision.\n       Section 2 of the bill would make the following changes for \n     payroll tax rates and OASDI financing: (1) for wages and \n     salaries paid in calendar year 2012 and self-employment \n     earnings in calendar year 2012, reduce the OASDI payroll tax \n     rate by 3.1 percentage points, (2) transfer revenue from the \n     General Fund of the Treasury to the OASI and DI Trust Funds \n     so that total revenue for trust funds would be unaffected by \n     this provision, and (3) credit earnings to the records of \n     workers for the purpose of determining future benefits \n     payable from the trust funds so that such benefits would be \n     unaffected by this provision. For wage and salary earnings, \n     the 3.1-percent rate reduction would apply to the employee \n     share of the payroll tax rate. For self-employment earnings, \n     the personal income tax deduction for the OASDI payroll tax \n     would be 66.67 percent of the portion of such taxes \n     attributable to self-employment earnings for 2012. Other \n     sections of the bill would have no direct effects on the \n     OASDI program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Stephen C. Goss,\n                                                    Chief Actuary.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. The point of this letter is very simple. I won't read the \nwhole letter, but here is the pertinent part of this letter from the \nSocial Security Administration.\n\n       We estimate that the projected level of the OASDI and DI \n     Trust Funds would be unaffected by enactment of this \n     provision.\n\n  What he is talking about there is Social Security would be \nunaffected. The trustee said last year the same thing. I won't add all \nthis to the Record, but read the one sentence. This is page 33 of a \nreport from last year:\n\n       Therefore, this payroll tax cut is estimated to have no \n     financial impact on these same trust accounts.\n\n  So it is abundantly clear that there is no impact on Social Security \nand, secondly, it is abundantly clear that passing a payroll tax cut \nagain will boost job growth, strengthen the economy, grow the economy, \nand give American families some measure of peace of mind as we head \ninto the holidays and head into the year 2012.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8390-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8390-S8392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ATF'S LANNY BREUER\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms is a division of the \nJustice Department. I have been investigating Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms' Operation Fast and Furious for almost 11 months now. It is \npast time for accountability at the senior levels of the Justice \nDepartment. That accountability needs to start with the head of the \ncriminal division, Lanny Breuer. I believe it is time for him to go, \nand I wish to explain why I have come to that conclusion.\n  The Justice Department denied, in a letter to me on February 4, 2011, \nthat ATF had ever walked guns. Mr. Breuer had been consulted in the \ndrafting of that erroneous letter of February 4, this year.\n  On May 2, 2011, rather than acknowledging the increasingly obvious \nfacts and apologizing for its February letter, the Justice Department \nreiterated its denial on May 2, this year, the same denial of February \n4th.\n  Thus, when the Justice Department revealed on October 31 of this year \nthat\n\n[[Page S8391]]\n\nBreuer had known as far back as April 2010 about gunwalking at ATF, I \nwas astounded. That was a shocking revelation.\n  The controversy about gunwalking in Fast and Furious has been \nescalating steadily for 10 months now. The Justice Department had \npublicly denied to Congress that ATF would ever walk guns. Yet, the \nhead of the criminal division, Mr. Breuer, knew otherwise and said \nnothing. He knew the same field division was responsible for walking \nguns in a 2006-2007 case, and that case was called Wide Receiver.\n  But the real shock was how Mr. Breuer had responded within his own \ndepartment when that earlier gunwalking was first brought to his \nattention in April 2010. He didn't tell the Attorney General. He didn't \ntell the Attorney General's Chief of Staff. He didn't tell the Deputy \nAttorney General. He didn't tell the inspector general. Instead, he \nsimply told his deputies to meet with ATF leadership and inform them of \nthe gunwalking:\n\n       . . . so they know the bad stuff that could come out.\n\n  Later, his deputy outlined a strategy to:\n\n       . . . announce the case without highlighting the negative \n     part of the story and risking embarrassing ATF.\n\n  Think about that. In that case, saving face was more important than \nthe bad policy.\n  For 18 months, the embarrassing truth about ATF gunwalking in Wide \nReceiver and Breuer's knowledge of it was successfully hidden. It only \ncame out because of the congressional investigation into gunwalking in \nFast and Furious.\n  The public outrage over Fast and Furious comes from the average \nAmerican who cannot understand why their very own government would \nintentionally allow criminals to illegally buy weapons for trafficking \ninto Mexico.\n  Next week, it will be 1 year since Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry \nwas murdered by bandits armed with guns as a direct result of this \npolicy of letting guns walk. The Terry family, and all Americans who \nsympathize with their loss, are rightfully outraged and astonished at \ntheir very own government doing such a thing. Yet, when Mr. Breuer \nlearned of a case where ATF walked guns in a very similar way, all he \ndid was give ATF a heads up. There seems to be a vast gulf between what \noutrages the American people and what outrages Lanny Breuer.\n  Mr. Breuer showed a complete lack of judgment by failing to object to \nthe gunwalking that he knew about in April 2010, 9 months before I was \never aware of Fast and Furious. If Mr. Breuer had reacted to gunwalking \nin Wide Receiver the way most Americans reacted to gunwalking in Fast \nand Furious, he would have taken steps to stop it and hold accountable \neveryone involved. Consequently, Fast and Furious might have been \nstopped in its tracks and Brian Terry might be alive.\n  When Mr. Breuer came before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \nCrime and Terrorism the day after those revelations, I gave him a \nchance to explain himself. I listened to what he had to say. He told us \nthat he:\n\n       . . . thought that . . . dealing with the leadership of ATF \n     was sufficient and reasonable.\n\n  Clearly, it was not sufficient. Mr. Breuer even admitted as much, \nsaying:\n\n       I regret that I did not alert others within the leadership \n     of the Department of Justice to the tactics used in Operation \n     Wide Receiver when they first came to my attention.\n\n  He regrets not bringing gunwalking in Wide Receiver to the attention \nof the Attorney General. But what about bringing it to the attention of \nCongress? He didn't even step forward to express his regret until e-\nmails that detailed his knowledge were about to be produced under \ncongressional subpoena.\n  It is astounding then that it took the public controversy over Fast \nand Furious to help the chief of the criminal division realize that \nwalking guns is unacceptable. Yet he had had 9 months after the \nFebruary 4 letter to step forward, correct the record, and come clean \nwith the American public. He had 18 months, after learning of \ngunwalking in Wide Receiver, to put a stop to it and hold people \naccountable. He failed to do so.\n\n  During his testimony, I asked him pointblank if he reviewed that \nletter of February 4 before it was sent to me. His misleading answers \nto these questions formed the basis for my second reason for calling on \nMr. Breuer to resign. He responded that he could not say for sure but \nsuggested that he did not review the letter. He said, ``[A]t that time, \nI was in Mexico dealing with the very real issues that we are all so \ncommitted to.''\n  Last Friday, the Justice Department withdrew their February 4 letter \nto me because of its inaccuracies--and the word ``inaccuracy'' is their \nword. The Department also turned over documents under subpoena about \nwho participated in the drafting and the reviewing of the letter. One \ncan imagine my surprise when I discovered from documents provided \nFriday night that Mr. Breuer was far more informed during the drafting \nof that letter than he admitted before the Judiciary Committee. In \nfact, Mr. Breuer got frequent updates on the status of the letter while \nhe was in Mexico.\n  He was sent versions of the letter four times. Two versions were e-\nmailed to Mr. Breuer on February 4, after he returned from Mexico, \nincluding the version of the letter that was ultimately sent to me that \nday. At that time, he forwarded the letter to his personal e-mail \naccount. Mr. Breuer's Deputy also sent him two drafts of the letter \nwhile he was in Mexico, and he also forwarded one of those to his \npersonal e-mail account. We do not know whether he did that in order to \naccess it on a larger screen than the Government-issued BlackBerry or \nwhether he engaged in any further discussion about the letter in his \nnongovernment e-mail account. However, we do know, in response to the \ndraft received in Mexico, he wrote to one of the main drafters of the \nletter: ``As usual, great work.''\n  The Justice Department excluded Breuer's compliment about the context \nof the draft from the set of e-mails it released to the press on \nFriday, before they released those documents to this Senator.\n  That evening, Mr. Breuer submitted answers to written questions. He \nwrote:\n\n       I have no recollection of having [seen the letter] and, \n     given that I was on official travel that week and given the \n     scope of my duties as Assistant Attorney General, I think it \n     is exceedingly unlikely that I did so.\n\n  So as late as last Friday night, Mr. Breuer was still trying to \nminimize his role in reviewing the letter, despite all the evidence to \nthe contrary. Why would Mr. Breuer say ``great work'' to a staffer \nabout a letter he claimed he had not read?\n  It is not credible that someone such as Mr. Breuer would forget about \nhis involvement in a matter such as this. Mr. Breuer's failure to be \ncandid and forthcoming before this body irreparably harms his \ncredibility. His complete lack of judgment and failure to deal with \ngunwalking when he first learned of it in April 2010 was bad enough, \nbut this is the final straw. Mr. Breuer has lost my confidence in his \nability to effectively serve the Justice Department. If he cannot be \nstraight with the Congress, he doesn't need to be running the Criminal \nDivision. It is time to stop spinning and start taking responsibility.\n  I have long said the highest ranking individual who knew about \ngunwalking and Operation Fast and Furious needs to be held accountable. \nThat standard applies no less to officials who knew about gunwalking in \nOperation Wide Receiver. Gunwalking is unacceptable no matter when it \noccurred. Documents made clear that Assistant Attorney General Breuer \nwas the highest ranking official in the Justice Department who knew \nabout gunwalking in Operation Wide Receiver. He did nothing to correct \nthe problem, alert others to the issue, take responsibility or even \nadmit what he knew until he was forced to do so by the evidence. \nTherefore, I believe the Attorney General needs to ask for Mr. Breuer's \nresignation or remove him from office if he refuses. If Mr. Breuer \nwants to do the honorable thing, he would resign.\n  I am not somebody who flippantly calls for resignations. I have done \noversight for many years, and in all that time I don't ever remember \ncoming across a government official who so blatantly placed sparing the \nagency embarrassment over protecting the lives of citizens. He has \nfailed to do his job of ensuring that the government operates properly, \nincluding holding people accountable.\n\n[[Page S8392]]\n\n  Because of that, Mr. Breuer needs to go immediately. Anything less \nwill show the American people the Justice Department is not serious \nabout being honest with Congress in our attempt to get to the bottom of \nthis.\n  In regard to my attempt to get to the bottom, just last night the \nJustice Department sent a letter refusing to provide several Justice \nDepartment staff for transcribed interviews. The letter explicitly goes \nback on the assurances I received when I consented to proceed with the \nconfirmation of three senior Justice Department officials, which I had \nheld up to get an agreement to get the information Congress is entitled \nto.\n  One of my conditions for agreeing to proceed with those nominations \nwas that officials who agreed to voluntary interviews in this \ninvestigation would have either a personal lawyer present or a \nDepartment lawyer present but not both. I personally met with the \nAttorney General, and he had the conditions listed on a piece of paper \nin front of him. It looked as if he had read it and was familiar with \nit. Yet he never objected to that condition.\n  Dozens of witness interviews have been conducted under that \nunderstanding with no problem. The only difference is that instead of \nATF witnesses, we are now seeking to interview Justice Department \nwitnesses. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. There is \nno reason to change the rules in the middle of the game. I was relying \non the Attorney General and other officials at the Department to honor \ntheir agreement. Apparently, that is not going to happen.\n  Fortunately, Chairman Issa has the ability to require the witnesses \nto appear via subpoena if they refuse to appear voluntarily under \nconditions that the Department previously agreed to with me. I am \nconfident he will do that if it becomes necessary, and I will take \nwhatever steps I have to take in the Senate to encourage the Department \nto reconsider and stick to its original agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8392-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8392-S8393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE CORDRAY NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am delighted to stand before you on this \nDelaware Day, 2011. This is the anniversary of the day when, on \nDecember 7, 1787, Delaware became the first State to ratify the \nConstitution. For 1 week, Delaware was the entire United States of \nAmerica. We opened up things in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, eventually \nNew Mexico. For the most part, it has turned out well, especially the \nNew Mexico part. We are happy to be here to celebrate this day with all \nour colleagues.\n  Later today, Senator Coons and I will return to regale our colleagues \nwith more about what we started all those years ago and how it has \nturned out.\n  I wish to fast forward, if I could, though, to 2008. As the Presiding \nOfficer will recall, during the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis \non Wall Street, one question which Congress repeatedly asked itself \nwas: What can we do to prevent future harm from reaching Main Street? \nWhat can we do to prevent future harm from reaching Main Street?\n  This theme continued as we considered and ultimately passed in 2010 \ncomprehensive financial regulatory reform regulation, which fortunately \nthe majority of us, including myself, supported, the legislation now \nknown as the Dodd-Frank law.\n  While none of us were able to agree on each of the elements of the \nDodd-Frank law, and while some of my colleagues did not support it in \nthe end, most us could agree we needed to do more to help protect \nAmerican families and businesses from bad actors.\n  As a result, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created. \nFor the first time in history, one agency would be charged with \noverseeing consumer protection for Main Street Americans within the \nfinancial industry.\n  In July of this year, 5 months ago, Richard Cordray was nominated to \nbe Director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Richard \nCordray served for many years as the president pro tem of the Delaware \nState Senate before retiring roughly 10 years ago--a man now probably \nin his mid-70s. I was shocked to hear he had been nominated to head \nthis new agency. It turns out it is another Richard Cordray. This \nRichard Cordray had been the attorney general of Ohio for a number of \nyears. He was well regarded. He helped protect consumers, investors, \nretirees, and business owners to ensure that Americans on Main Street \ngot a fair deal. At the time of his nomination, he was leading the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau's enforcement efforts. Mr. \nCordray, former AG, is someone who has been intimately involved in \ngetting the new bureau stood up and running and who brings key \nexpertise to the table.\n  When we first passed the law, I suggested to the President, to \nSecretary Geithner, and others--I said I think there are three models \nthey could choose from to pick someone to nominate to head this new \nbureau. No. 1, they could pick an academician; No. 2, they could pick \nsomebody who has been a regulator or, in this case, attorney, an \nAttorney General; and the third, I said they might want to try to find \nsomebody in the private sector who has run a significant financial \nservice company but had a great, impeccable record, that of a ``white \nhat'' for consumer protection, for looking out for consumers, somebody \nwho believes one can do well and do good at the same time. I thought \nthose were the models. The administration looked at people in all three \ncategories, including the latter one and ultimately decided, within the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, they had Mr. Cordray. He had a \ngood track record, and he was the person the President wanted to \nnominate. I think he has made a very good choice.\n  I talked to a number of my colleagues who sat in on hearings where he \ntestified on his nomination and for the most part got good reviews from \nRepublicans and Democrats here.\n  As my colleagues and I debate this nomination and ask ourselves is he \nqualified to do the job, I think the answer is yes. My colleagues on \nthe Senate Banking Committee agreed, and 37 attorneys general from \nacross the country, both Republican and Democratic, agreed.\n  However, today's debate has not been about whether Mr. Cordray is \nqualified to do this job; instead, the debate has focused on the \nstructure of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In May of \nthis year, 44 of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle sent a \nletter to the President saying they would block any nominee until \nstructural changes are made in the new agency. This is before the \nPresident ever nominated Mr. Cordray. My colleagues want to see changes \nmade such as replacing the Director with a board structure and \nsubjecting the Bureau to the appropriations process. My colleagues, 44 \ncolleagues in any event, pointed out that these structural changes \nwould model the Bureau after already-existing agencies, while some of \nmy other colleagues have also made the point that there are already \nexisting agencies not subject to the appropriations process, such as \nthe FDIC and the Federal Reserve.\n  What we have is a disagreement, one where colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle have what I believe are legitimate points. The Consumer \nBureau was created in Dodd-Frank through a series of compromises. \nRarely is any compromise perfect. The Presiding Officer and I have been \ninvolved in enough compromises over the years to know if, in the end, \nneither side is fully satisfied with the compromise, maybe we struck a \npretty good balance, and I think that is the case here.\n  But the point of the Bureau is to put the consumer first, and I will \nbe the first to admit that there is no such thing as a perfect law. I \nassume my colleagues who are here and back in their offices and at \ncommittee hearings would agree with that. If there are aspects to Dodd-\nFrank that can be tweaked and approved, we ought to do that. But at the \nend of the day, we must put financial protection of consumers above our \ndisagreements and our personal preferences.\n  The longer we continue to constrain the Bureau by denying it a leader \nand only discussing the structural changes that some Members would like \nto see made, the greater the disservice to consumers across \nAmerica. The Bureau's authority was created so that it would not just \nbe limited to banks since those institutions are already regulated, as\n\n[[Page S8393]]\n\nare credit unions and bank-holding companies. The Bureau's authority is \nsupposed to extend to nonbanks as well, nonbanks which provide a form \nof financial service, such as payday lenders and debt collectors.\n\n  Prior to Dodd-Frank, nonbank entities were subject to little, if any, \nFederal supervision. Yet their reach and use across our country is \nwidespread. As a result, many unscrupulous actors were able to exploit \nloopholes and harm American consumers. That is not to say all payday \nlenders or all debt collectors are unscrupulous actors. They are not. \nThey are not all out there to exploit the loopholes. But too many of \nthem do, and they do so without the kind of supervision they should \nreceive.\n  However, without a Director in place, the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau does not have the authority to supervise these very \nentities. This drastically undermines the very spirit in which the \nBureau was created. It is not just the consumers who are harmed but our \nsmall community institutions as well. These community institutions want \nto see a level playing field where they can compete and where everyone \nplays by the rules. Consumers and businesses need certainty, and they \nneed predictability. I hear that almost every day, especially from \nbusinesses. Without certainty, without predictability in a whole wide \nrange of areas, we will continue to see our economic recovery hindered.\n  I think I have shared with the Presiding Officer a story that is \ngermane today to this discussion, and it goes back to 7 or 8 years ago \nwhen I was working on clean air legislation to try to reduce the \nemission of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, mercury, carbon dioxide, \nissues that we debate from time to time in the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works where we serve.\n  I remember one day we had seven or eight utility CEOs in from across \nthe country to discuss the merits of different legislative proposals. \nFinally, one crusty old CEO of a utility down south said to me: Look, \nhere is what you should do. You should figure out what the rules are \ngoing to be, use some common sense, give us a reasonable amount of time \nto comply with them, and get out of the way. That is what he said. I \nthought those were words of great wisdom, and not just for clean air \nlegislation but also today.\n  We cannot afford to drag this disagreement out in perpetuity. We must \nempower this Bureau to look out for Main Street as was envisioned with \nthe creation of the Bureau. We may have to look at the idea of a \ncommission-based structure, and I would love to sit down with my \ncolleagues from the other side of the aisle and discuss that option if \nthe former General Cordray's nomination continues to be blocked later \nthis week.\n  Right now we have the ability to move forward and to stand by our \nwords and by the spirit of the law. We need to look out for every \nAmerican with a mortgage, credit card, and those looking to send their \nkids to college. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting Mr. \nCordray's nomination. It is the right thing to do, and it is our \nopportunity to show the American consumers that we are putting them \nfirst, ahead of partisan politics, by governing as we were meant to do \nin the first place.\n  I see Senator Webb of Virginia has joined us on the Senate floor. I \nwill close, before turning it over to him, on a little brighter note. \nIt is a gloomy day in our Nation's Capital. It has been raining, \nsometimes pretty hard. When I was walking up here from the train \nstation it was.\n  I want to go back and talk about the issue of uncertainty and lack of \npredictability. I think the greatest impediment to getting our modest \neconomic recovery going and turning it into a robust economic recovery \nis to address so much of the uncertainty and lack of predictability. It \nrevolves around a bunch of issues. Can we demonstrate to those who \nquestion our ability to find the middle to reach across the aisle? Can \nwe demonstrate the ability to govern? Are we able to demonstrate \nthrough an approach much like the Bowles-Simpson Deficit Commission \nplan the ability to get us back on the right track in terms of reducing \nour debt?\n  What is going to happen with the health care law? Is it going to be \ndeemed constitutional or unconstitutional? What about the Tax Code? \nWhat is going to happen in a year from now, and what will happen to all \nof these tax provisions that expire at the end of this month? There is \na lack of certainty and a lack of predictability, and we need to deal \nwith that.\n  I want to mention two or three promising signs before I close. We \nhave new job numbers for the month of November. The unemployment rate \ndropped down to 8.6 percent. Before we stand and celebrate that, there \nare still a lot of people we know who don't have a job and are looking \nfor a job. A lot of people stopped looking for a job, and that is one \nof the reasons that number has dropped.\n  Here is the good news: There were about 120,000 private sector jobs \ncreated last month. About 100,000 jobs were created the month before \nand roughly 200,000 jobs the month before that. So that is roughly \n140,000 jobs per month. We are actually starting to see growth \noccurring not just over a couple of months, but now for well over a \nyear there has been private sector job creation. It is not the numbers \nthat we like, but it is in the right direction.\n  The other thing we are seeing is a regrowth and rebirth of \nrevitalization occurring in the manufacturing sector of our economy. \nSome of you may know that we have something called a manufacturing \nindex. If it sits at 50, it means the manufacturing sector is not \ngrowing, and it is not shrinking. I think it has been over 50 for about \n25 consecutive months.\n  We are seeing a resurgence of manufacturing in this country, which \nencourages me to believe that what the President is trying to do, to \ndouble exports over a 5-year period of time, is not just a pipe dream. \nIt is something that might just happen. It is aided by the three free-\ntrade agreements that we passed in the last month or two.\n  On those happier notes, I want to say thank you, Mr. President, for \nallowing me to talk about some leadership that is needed and the \nwillingness to compromise if we cannot get Mr. Cordray confirmed this \nweek.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8393-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8393-S8394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PEARL HARBOR DAY\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, 70 years ago today at 0745 in the morning in \nHawaii--where it is now about 0840 in the morning--our country was \nattacked at Pearl Harbor bringing us into World War II. It was a war \nthat had been ongoing in Europe for more than 3 years, and in Asia, in \ndifferent forms, for a much longer period, probably 7 to 8 years.\n  This began a national effort that was historically unprecedented in \nits unity and in its vigor in which the United States astounded the \nworld in terms of its capacity to respond to this attack on many \ndifferent fronts. Our economic production was staggering by 1943. Our \nproduction schedule included 125,000 aircraft, 75,000 tanks, 35,000 \nantiaircraft guns, and 10 million tons of merchant shipping.\n  During the course of that war, the productive capacity of this \ncountry gave our allied forces more than half of all of its armaments, \nincluding 86 percent of the armaments that were used in response to the \nJapanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\n  I rise today to express my thanks and my appreciation to the men and \nwomen of that generation who stepped forward and responded to the call \nof service in this period. During World War II more than 16 million \nAmericans stepped forward to serve our country. In that period more \nthan 400,000 of them died, including 291,557 who were killed in action. \nAnother 670,846 were wounded in action. Out of those 16.1 million, \ntoday about 1.7 million World War II veterans remain alive. They are \ncarrying the torch and the memory of this larger group who stepped \nforward and served and became known as the ``greatest generation.''\n  It is my profound pleasure and, quite frankly, my duty to remember \nall of them today. Among those 16 million who served, nearly 8 million \nwere able to take advantage of the World War II GI bill. It was my \nhonor to have introduced a similar GI bill on my first day in the \nSenate in 2007. Within 16 months, our body and the other body\n\n[[Page S8394]]\n\nhad come together to agree on an educational package that would allow \nthose who served since 9/11 to have the same chance at a first-class \nfuture as those who served during World War II. It is a program that \nwill pay their tuition, buy their books, and give them a monthly \nstipend.\n  On this day of remembrance, for those who served during World War II, \nwe should also remember that for every dollar that was spent on the \nWorld War II GI bill, our Treasury received $7 in tax reimbursements \nbecause of the ability of the ``greatest generation'' to have \nsuccessful careers and to contribute to our economy.\n  So today I would just like to say, as one of many of us here who are \nthe next generation from the ``greatest generation,'' how thankful I am \nfor the service they gave and for the example they set when they \nreturned from war. For many of us--me--they were our parents, they were \nour mentors, they were our role models, they were our leaders as we \nourselves matured into leaders. They taught us how to love our country. \nThey taught us how to value the notion of service. Their legacy is in \nevery area of our society today.\n  We honor them and we should resolve, all of us, to continue in the \ntraditions that were imbued in us by their sacrifices and the example \nthey set when they returned from a most difficult war.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8394-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MUST-PASS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time because we are in the \nlast, we hope, few days before we adjourn for the holidays. There are \ncertain pieces of legislation we must get done before we leave town. We \ncall these the must-pass bills that we have to make sure are enacted \nbefore Congress adjourns for the year.\n  One, of course, is what President Obama has been talking about. We \nneed to deal with the payroll tax issue. We don't want to see middle-\nincome families finding that on January 1 their paychecks--the actual \namount of money they take home--are reduced. During this economic time, \nwe want to make sure the money remains constant, and we don't want to \nsee additional burdens placed on middle-income families.\n  We all know we have to deal with the Medicare extenders, including \nthe physicians problem. We have a flawed system for reimbursing \nphysicians that causes a substantial reduction in rates physicians \nreceive--a 27-percent reduction. That would affect not only the \nfairness of our reimbursement system to our doctors, but it would also \naffect the access Medicare patients have to physicians. So we need to \nabsolutely take care of that issue.\n  We have the Omnibus appropriations bill. I certainly hope that is \ngoing to be an appropriations bill so we can give some predictability \nthrough the remainder of this fiscal year. We have to get that done \nbefore we adjourn for the holidays.\n  We also need to pass the tax extenders. I know the Presiding Officer \nhas been very actively involved in the energy extenders, knowing full \nwell the importance not only to New Mexico but to our entire country. \nThose extenders need to be passed because, if not, we lose jobs. This \ninvolves the ability to move forward with sustainable energy projects \nthat will mean jobs in our communities and energy self-sufficiency for \nAmerica.\n  But I wish to take this time to talk about another must-pass bill \nbefore we adjourn for the year; that is, the extension of the \nunemployment insurance. It is absolutely essential that we get that \ndone before Congress adjourns for the year.\n  I think we have to make it clear that this extension will mean \nproviding the same number of weeks of unemployment insurance for those \nwho are currently in the system--those who have lost their jobs--that \nwe have had for the last couple of years for those who have been caught \nup in this economic downturn. We are not extending beyond what the \nunemployed have already received. So we are basically extending the \ncurrent policy because we are still in a very difficult economic \ncircumstance.\n  For every job that is open, there are four people who apply for it. \nSo it is very difficult for someone who is unemployed to be able to \nfind employment. As I know and as the Presiding Officer knows, if a \nperson is unemployed and looking for work, it is much more difficult.\n  For all of those reasons, the right thing to do is to acknowledge \nthat the number of weeks of benefits should not be reduced at this \nperiod, that those who are currently in the system who have lost their \njobs should be able to get the same number of benefits that earlier \nunemployed people were able to get during this economic period. That is \nwhat this legislation would do.\n  Unemployment insurance is an insurance program. During good times, we \npay more into the system. During economic downturns, we take the money \nout of the system. It is countercyclical so that we help our economy as \nwell as help our families.\n  This is the right thing to do. This is the only lifeline for many \nfamilies. This represents their ability to be able to put food on the \ntable for their families or to keep their home from going into \nforeclosure or to pay their rent or to take care of their family needs. \nThis is the right thing to do from the point of view of families who \nhave been caught up in this economic period.\n  It also, by the way, would affect millions of our families. Over the \nnext year, if we were not to extend the unemployment insurance \nbenefits, it is estimated that 6 million families would be denied their \nfull benefits that they are receiving currently--6 million families--\nand each one is a family in our community who would be adversely \naffected.\n  It also helps our economy. Mark Zandi, who was the economic adviser \nfor then-Presidential candidate Senator McCain, said that for every \ndollar we put out into the economy for unemployment benefits, we get \nback $1.61 in our economy. The multiplier effect of unemployment \ncompensation is positive to our economy. So, once again, when we are \ntrying to stimulate job growth, this helps us. How does it help us? The \npeople who receive unemployment benefits visit our local shops, our \nsmall businesses in our communities, keeping our economy moving, \nkeeping our path forward to job growth.\n  For all of those reasons--for the fact that it is the right thing to \ndo for families and for what the intent of unemployment insurance is \nall about--it is the right thing for us to do because it helps our \neconomy. This must be on our list of must-pass legislation. We have to \nget this done before we adjourn for the year.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8394-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8394-S8395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PEARL HARBOR DAY\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today is December 7, 2011. Seventy years \nago, something happened in Pearl Harbor. I shall never forget that day \nbecause it was a Sunday, and, as were many Americans, I was preparing \nto go to church. I was putting on my necktie and having a good time \nlistening to delightful Hawaiian music. Suddenly, at about this time--\n1:55 p.m. here--the disc jockey in charge of that program began \nscreaming, yelling into the mike. He was saying: ``The Japanese are \nbombing Pearl Harbor!'' He kept on repeating that. For a moment, I \nthought it was a repeat or replay of Orson Welles, which my colleagues \nwill recall was the program that was a mighty hit in the United States.\n  The disc jockey kept on doing this for about 5 minutes--no music, \njust screaming--so I decided to take my father out on the street and \nlook toward Pearl Harbor. We could see these black puffs, and then we \nknew what was happening. Suddenly, while watching these black puffs of \nexplosions, we could hear a rumble just overhead, and there were three \naircraft. They were pearl gray in color, and they had red dots on the \nwings. I knew what was happening, and I thought the world had just come \nto an end. Just about 2,400 American sailors and soldiers and \nnoncombatants died that morning.\n\n[[Page S8395]]\n\n  I was a young man of 17 at that time, but I was also a volunteer \nmedical aid man. We had a little aid station--a temporary one--set up \nby the elementary school called Lunalilo. So I rushed there to respond \nto the call of duty, and I stayed there for about a week taking care of \nthe wounded and the dead, because we also maintained a morgue on the \nschool premises.\n  I became familiar with the cost of war--not the full cost, but I knew \nwhat was happening. The war was much more than just blood and guts. We \nhave an extraordinary Constitution. We have an extraordinary set of \nlaws. But throughout the history of mankind--not just the history of \nthe United States but the history of mankind--war has always provided \nsome justification for leaders to set aside these laws. For example, on \njust about Christmas Eve of 1941, about 3 weeks after December 7, the \nU.S. Government made a decision, and that decision was to provide a new \ndesignation for all Japanese residing in the United States. Citizens \nand noncitizens, such as my father, were given the new designation, \nwhich was 4-C.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, 1-A means you are physically fit, \nmentally alert, and you can put on a uniform; 4-F means something is \nwrong with you; and 4-C is the designation for an ``enemy alien.'' Just \nimagine that--an enemy alien. This was used as one of the \njustifications to round up over 120,000 Japanese, most of them \nAmericans of Japanese ancestry, and place them into these internment \ncamps. There were 10 of them throughout the United States in very \ndesolate areas--Arkansas, Arizona, Utah, out in the deserts. Their \ncrime was they were ``enemy aliens.'' None of them had committed any \ncrime. Investigation after investigation disclosed that. No sabotage, \nno espionage, no assault--nothing. They were rounded up and placed into \nthese camps, which were described by our government as concentration \ncamps. Yes, it was unconstitutional, but our leaders felt the war was a \njustification to set aside the Constitution and set aside the laws.\n\n  Well, many of us--especially the young ones--were very eager to \ndemonstrate to our neighbors and to our government that we were loyal, \nthat we wanted to do our part in this war, and, if necessary, put our \nlives on the line. We petitioned the government. Finally, after about a \nyear of petitioning, President Roosevelt issued a statement saying: \nAmericanism is not a matter of blood or color. Americanism is a matter \nof heart and soul. He said: OK, form a volunteer group. And that was \ndone. We trained in Mississippi and we did our best.\n  The 100th Battalion, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team were assigned \nto do our battles in Europe. We fought in Italy and France. We started \noff the war with about 6,000 men. At the end, over 12,000 had gone \nthrough the ranks. So you can imagine the casualty rates. We had about \n10,000 Purple Hearts for all the wounds they received. We were told \nthat these two units became the most decorated in the history of the \nUnited States.\n  Yes, the bombing of Pearl Harbor 70 years ago began a period of my \nlife when I became an adult and, I hope, a good American. It is \nsomething I will never forget. It changed my life forever.\n  Something of interest at this moment: 20 years ago, when we decided \nto make it a national event--the 50th anniversary of the bombing of \nPearl Harbor--on that morning, the President was there. The Secretary \nof Defense, the Secretary of War, the Secretaries of the Interior \nDepartment, State Department--all of the important people of the United \nStates were in attendance.\n  In preparation of this, we took a poll, about 6 months before \nDecember 7, and the poll was among high school seniors, well-educated \nyoung boys and girls. The question was a very simple one: What is the \nsignificance of December 7, 1941?\n  Mr. President, I am sad to report to you that less than half could \nrespond. Most of them thought it was a birthday of some President or \nsome historic date of some nature, but they could not recall what it \nwas.\n  On this 70th anniversary, I wonder, if that poll were taken again, \nWhat would be the outcome?\n  Well, I hope we will remember December 7. I hope we will remember 9/\n11. That was just a few years ago. But people are beginning to forget \n9/11, as well as forgetting December 7.\n  If December 7 is going to teach us anything, it should be that we \nmust remain vigilant at all times--not just to avoid war but vigilant \namong ourselves so we would not use this as a justification to set \naside our most honored document, the Constitution. I hope it will never \nhappen again.\n  Mr. President, I thank you very much for this opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am very moved by the words of the \nSenator from Hawaii--not only his words but the example he has set for \nall Americans of heroism and sacrifice and service to his country, and \na most valued Member of the U.S. Senate but, more importantly, a \ngenuine American hero.\n  I thank the Senator from Hawaii for his continued service and his \ncontinued inspiration to all Americans, especially those who are \nserving in the military today.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, would my friend yield for a brief statement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, like my friend from Arizona, compliment \nmy friend from Hawaii. But I think it speaks volumes to hear Senator \nJohn McCain talk about a hero. It is a hero talking about a hero. Far \ntoo rarely do we recognize these people whom we have the opportunity to \nserve with here in the U.S. Senate.\n  When I came here with Senator McCain--we came at the same time--we \nhad a lot of people who were war veterans. It is not the case anymore. \nBut I so appreciate John McCain--a certified, unqualified hero--\nstanding and talking about Dan Inouye being a hero. This says, I \nrepeat, volumes coming from someone who is a hero himself.\n  I have such admiration for both of these men. For someone who has \nnever served in the military, to have the pleasure of being able to \nserve and work together with these two men will be something I will \nremember the rest of my life.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am deeply touched by the kind and \nundeserved words of my old friend of many years, the distinguished \nmajority leader. We have had our spirited combat and our agreements, \nbut we share a commitment--the two of us--for the betterment of this \nNation.\n  I also remind my friend from Nevada what he already knows, but I \nremind him, it does not take a great deal of talent to get shot down. I \nwas able to intercept a surface-to-air missile with my own airplane, \nwhich will not go down in the Aviation Hall of Fame, not to mention the \nseveral aircraft I destroyed at taxpayers' expense in previous times.\n  So I thank my dear friend from Nevada, as well, for his kind words.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the humility of my friend. I \nhave heard him say words to this effect before. The fact is, what he \ndid after the plane went down is what we all will remember. As long as \nour country is the country it is, we will always remember what happened \nafter that plane went down, what John McCain did, setting an example \nfor the world and certainly his country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask to speak in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8395-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8395-S8398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RUSSIA\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about Russia, and to \nreview--particularly, in light of the recent election in Russia and the \nrelationship we have--the state of what this administration has \ntrumpeted as a so-called reset of U.S.-Russia relations, especially in \nlight of the flawed Duma election that occurred this weekend, and in \nlight of my strong belief that the growing demand for dignity and \nuncorrupt\n\n[[Page S8396]]\n\ngovernance that has defined the Arab world this year may impact Russia \nas well.\n  Let me once again make clear that I am not opposed to U.S. engagement \nwith Russia. I am not opposed to working consistently in good faith \nwith Russia to find more ways to improve our relationship. To the \ncontrary, we must continue to actively seek ways to cooperate with \nRussia in mutually beneficial ways. It is in our national interest to \ndo so. And whatever can be said about the administration's policy \ntoward Russia, no one can accuse them of a lack of sincerity and \ndiligence in trying to increase cooperation with Russia.\n  I would simply ask, What has been accomplished? What has been the \nresult of the administration's good-faith desire for a so-called reset \nof relations with Russia? The answer, I am afraid, is precious little. \nYes, there have been some areas of progress, but even those minor steps \nmay now be getting rolled back.\n  There has been a lot of news recently pertaining to our relationship \nwith Russia and Russia's future development, which my colleagues may \nhave missed. It is very important to spend some time today and review \nthese new developments.\n  Let's start with the issue of missile defense.\n  My colleagues will remember the debate we had here last year over the \nratification of the New START treaty. In that debate, we spent a lot of \ntime discussing the Russian threat to withdraw from the treaty if the \nUnited States took any further steps to build up its missile defense \ncapabilities. Specifically, the Russian Government stated that the New \nSTART treaty ``may be effective and viable only in conditions where \nthere is no qualitative or quantitative build-up in the missile defense \nsystem capabilities of the United States of America.'' The Russian \nGovernment stated that in the ratification of the treaty. They went on \nto say that if those conditions were not met, Russia would exercise its \nright to withdraw from the treaty.\n  Many of us felt strongly at the time, and feel strongly now, that it \nwas a mistake to ratify a treaty on which the two signatories had two \ncompletely antithetical positions about the implications of that \ntreaty, particularly as it pertains to one of our most vital national \nsecurity programs--our missile defenses. Some of us thought and argued \nat the time that the United States should not voluntarily sign up to a \ntreaty that would likely be used by the Russian Government as a source \nof political pressure and blackmail to get us to make concessions on \nour missile defenses.\n  Well, here we are, 1 year later, and let's review some of what the \nRussian Government has been saying and doing in this regard.\n  On November 23, we read an article from Bloomberg entitled ``Russia \nPrepares to `Destroy' U.S. Shield.'' This is what it said:\n\n       Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ordered the military to \n     prepare the capability to ``destroy'' the command structure \n     of the planned U.S. missile-defense system in Europe.\n       Russia may also station strike missiles on its southern and \n     western flanks, including Iskander rockets in the Kaliningrad \n     exclave between Poland and Lithuania, both members of the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Union, \n     Medvedev said on state television today.\n       ``I have ordered the armed forces to develop measures to \n     ensure, if necessary, that we can destroy the command and \n     control systems'' of the U.S. shield, Medvedev said. ``These \n     measures are appropriate, effective and low-cost.''\n\n  On the same day, we read the following in an article in the New York \nTimes entitled ``Russia Elevates Warning About U.S. Missile-Defense \nPlan in Europe.'' I quote from the article:\n\n       Russia will deploy its own missiles and could withdraw from \n     the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty if the United \n     States moves forward with its plans for a missile-defense \n     system in Europe, President Dmitri A. Medvedev warned on \n     Wednesday.\n       ``I have set the task to the armed forces to develop \n     measures for disabling missile-defense data and control \n     systems,'' Mr. Medvedev said. . . .\n       But it was Mr. Medvedev's comments about the New Start \n     treaty, put into effect this year, that suggested a darkening \n     tone in what has been a steady drumbeat of warnings out of \n     Moscow in recent days over the plans for a missile-defense \n     system based in Europe.\n       ``In the case of unfavorable development of the situation, \n     Russia reserves the right to discontinue further steps in the \n     field of disarmament and arms control,'' Mr. Medvedev said in \n     a televised address from his residence outside Moscow. \n     ``Given the intrinsic link between the strategic offensive \n     and defensive arms, conditions for our withdrawal from the \n     New START treaty could also arise,'' he said.\n\n  If all this were not troubling enough, we then read on November 28 an \narticle from a Russian state news agency entitled ``Russia's NATO Envoy \nto Visit China, Iran, Over Missile Defense.'' Here is what was \nreported:\n\n       Russian envoy to NATO Dmitry Rogozin will visit China and \n     Iran in mid-January to discuss a U.S.-backed global missile \n     defense network.\n       ``We are planning to visit both Beijing and Tehran soon \n     under the Russian president's directive, to discuss the \n     planned deployment of a global missile defense network,'' \n     Rogozin said during a roundtable meeting at the lower house \n     of the Russian parliament.\n  On November 28, the Russian Government went even further, not just \nusing the New START treaty to try to blackmail us into weakening our \nmissile defenses but threatening to cut off NATO's supply routes into \nAfghanistan as well, which was another area of limited progress that \nthe administration hailed as part of its so-called reset policy. This \nis how the Wall Street Journal described it last Monday in an article \nentitled ``Russia Considers Blocking NATO Supply Routes.''\n\n       Russia said it may not let NATO use its territory to supply \n     troops in Afghanistan if the alliance doesn't seriously \n     consider its objections to a U.S.-led missile shield for \n     Europe, Russia's ambassador to NATO said Monday.\n       If NATO does not give a serious response, ``we have to \n     address matters in relations in other areas,'' Russian news \n     services reported Dmitri Rogozin, ambassador to NATO, as \n     saying. He added that Russia's cooperation on Afghanistan may \n     be an area for review, the news services reported.\n\n  So let me summarize: After being assured that the New START treaty \nwould contribute to the improvement of U.S.-Russia relations, and that \nthe Russian Government would not use the treaty against us as \nblackmail, we are now in a situation where the President of Russia is \nthreatening to deploy ballistic missiles to destroy U.S. missile \ndefense systems in Europe; where he is openly threatening to withdraw \nhis government from the New START treaty if the United States does not \nmake unacceptable concessions on its missile defense programs; and \nwhere the Russian Ambassador to NATO is threatening to cut off NATO's \nsupply routes to Afghanistan and planning to visit China and Iran with \nthe purpose of deepening Russia's cooperation with those governments \nagainst U.S. missile defenses.\n  I think it is safe to say that the effect to date of the New START \ntreaty on the U.S.-Russia relationship is rather less positive than \noriginally advertised. The problems in our relationship with Russia go \nwell beyond missile defense, as important as that is. In recent months, \nas the Assad regime in Syria has slaughtered roughly 4,000 of its own \ncitizens who are seeking a democratic future, what has been the Russian \nGovernment's response? With the help of China, Russia has been \nabsolutely shameless in blocking any serious action in the United \nNations Security Council, including by vetoing a toothless security \nresolution that would not have even imposed sanctions but merely hinted \nat the possibility of sanctions. At the same time, while the Assad \nregime's bloody rampage has continued against the Syrian people, the \nRussian Government has continued to serve as its primary supplier of \nweaponry. In fact, last week in a story entitled ``Russia Delivers \nMissiles to Syria,'' AFP reported that despite the brutal violence of \nthe Assad regime, and over Israel's strenuous objections, Russia \ndelivered 72 supersonic cruise missiles to the Syrian Government worth \nat least $300 million.\n  Then there is Russia's continued interference in the sovereign \nterritory and internal affairs of the Republic of Georgia, a country \nthat the Russian military invaded in 2008 and continues to occupy to \nthis day. Two weeks ago there was a Presidential election in the \nbreakaway state of South Ossetia, which is part of Georgia's sovereign \nterritory. But when Moscow's preferred candidate was overwhelmingly \ndefeated in those elections, the supreme court of this Russian proxy \nstate declared the results illegal and nullified\n\n[[Page S8397]]\n\nthe vote. Russian parliamentarians applauded.\n  Finally, there is the unfortunate issue of Russia's backsliding on \nhuman rights and democracy. A few months ago, President Medvedev \nannounced, as we all know, that he would step aside in Russia's \nelection next year so that Vladimir Putin could once again run for the \nPresidency. Some see this as a sign that Putin will come back. I object \nto that characterization, because I do not believe Putin ever left. He \nhas been running things in Russia with no less informal power than he \nhad as President.\n  Not surprisingly, over the past 3 years, the state of human rights \nand freedom in that country has gotten no better. In fact, things have \ngotten worse. Perhaps the clearest evidence of this fact is the tragic \nand heartbreaking case of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian tax attorney \nworking for an international company, Hermitage Capital, that had \ninvested in Russia. Magnitsky did not spend his life as a human rights \nactivist or an outspoken critic of the Russian Government. He was an \nordinary man. But he became an extraordinary champion of justice and \nthe rule of law in a Russia where those principles have lost nearly all \nmeaning.\n  What Magnitsky uncovered was that a collection of Russian Government \nofficials and criminals associated with them colluded to defraud the \nRussian state of $230 million. The Russian Government, in turn, blamed \nthe crime on Hermitage Capital and threw Magnitsky in prison in 2008. \nMagnitsky was detained for 11 months without trial.\n  Russian officials, especially from the interior ministry, pressured \nMagnitsky to deny what he had uncovered, to lie and recant. But he \nrefused. He was sickened by what his government had done and he refused \nto surrender. As a result, he was transferred to increasingly more \nsevere and more horrific prison conditions. He was forced to eat \nunclean food and drink unclear water. He was denied basic medical care \neven as his health continued to deteriorate. In fact, he was placed in \neven worse conditions until, on November 16, 2009, having served 358 \ndays in prison, Sergei Magnitsky died. He was 37 years old.\n  The Magnitsky case shined a light on the tragic realities of human \nrights abuses in Russia today, and the overwhelming cruelty and \ninjustice that Magnitsky endured has made it impossible for the \ngovernment and the people of Russia to ignore. Even the Public \nOversight Commission of the City of Moscow for the Control of the \nObservance of Human Rights in Places of Forced Detention, a Russian \norganization empowered by Russian law to independently monitor the \ncountry's prison conditions, concluded the following in a report this \nyear:\n\n       A man who is kept in custody and is being detained is not \n     capable of using all of the necessary means to protect either \n     his life or his health. This is a responsibility of a state \n     which holds him captive. Therefore, the case of Sergei \n     Magnitsky can be described as a breach of the right to life. \n     The members of the civic supervisory commission have reached \n     the conclusion that Magnitsky had been experiencing both \n     psychological and physical pressure in custody, and the \n     conditions in some of the wards . . . can be justifiably \n     called torturous. The people responsible for this must be \n     punished.\n\n  The case of Sergei Magnitsky is but an extreme example of a problem \nthat is all too common in Russia today, the flagrant violations of \nhuman rights and the rule of law committed by the Russian Government \nand its allies outside of government. We have seen the problem in the \nshow trial of Mikhail Khordokovsky, which I would remind my colleagues \nwas unfolding at the exact same time that this body was debating the \nratification of the New START treaty last December.\n  After the Russian Government stole Khordokovsky's oil company, it \nthen turned around and charged him for the crime. Even more absurdly, \nas he was nearing the end of his 8-year prison sentence, the Russian \nstate then charged him again for virtually the same crime. Before the \njudge had even handed down his verdict, Prime Minister Putin said, \nKhordokovsky ``should sit in jail.'' And lo and behold, that is exactly \nwhat the judge ultimately ruled, sentencing Khodorkovsky to 5 \nadditional years in prison on top of the 8 years he had already served.\n  Earlier this year, not surprisingly, Khodorkovsky lost his appeal of \nthis ruling. In a report released this year, Freedom House concluded \nthat the cases of Magnitsky and Khodorkovsky:\n\n       Put an international spotlight on the Russian state's \n     contempt for the rule of law. . . . By silencing influential \n     and accomplished figures such as Khodorkovsky and Magnitsky, \n     the Russian authorities have made it abundantly clear that \n     anyone in Russia can be silenced.\n\n  The violations of human rights in Russia also extend to the deep and \nworsening problem of corruption, which perhaps as much as any other \nissue mobilizes the frustration and anger of the Russian public. In its \nannual index of perceptions of corruption, the independent organization \nTransparency International ranked Russia 154th out of 178 countries. \nThat means that Russia is perceived as more corrupt than Pakistan, \nYemen, and Zimbabwe. The World Bank considers 122 countries to be \nbetter places to do business than Russia. I would point out that one of \nthose countries is the Republic of Georgia, which is ranked 12th by the \nWorld Bank.\n  When we consider the pattern of corruption and abuse the Russian \nGovernment has perpetrated over many years, it is not surprising to see \nthe outpouring of anger and dissatisfaction that Russian voters \nexpressed in this weekend's parliamentary elections. Unfortunately, the \nconduct of that election and especially its aftermath has only \nvalidated the growing frustration that Russians feel for their rulers. \nBefore the ballots were even cast, a noted Russian election monitoring \norganization called Golos was subjected to intimidation, harassment, \npolitical pressure, and fines. The subsequent election has been \ncriticized by impartial international observers, including the \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which documented \nin its preliminary assessment numerous irregularities and other efforts \nby the government to sway a vote in its favor.\n  Instances of ballot stuffing have been documented. For example, in \nChechnya, it was reported that 99 percent of the population \nparticipated in the election and 99.5 percent of them voted for Putin's \nparty. That seems a little suspicious, especially considering that the \nPutin government has waged years of bloody warfare in Chechnya.\n  Despite the fact that the recent Duma election fell short of \ninternational standards and violated Russia's law, substantially fewer \nRussian voters chose to cast their vote for Putin's party, including in \nits stronghold and home base of St. Petersburg. This frustration has \nsubsequently poured into the streets where Russian citizens have \npeacefully sought to demonstrate against the recent election fraud. The \nRussian Government has responded, in turn, by arresting hundreds of \nopposition leaders, democracy and human rights activists, journalists, \nand other members of civil society, including Boris Nemtsov, Alexey \nNavalny, and Ilya Yashin. Those men and women are exercising universal \nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms which should not be a crime in \nany country.\n  I call on the Government of Russia to release every Russian citizen \nwho is unjustly detained for political purposes and to clarify the \nwhereabouts and conditions of those individuals.\n  Mr. President, throughout this year, I have said that the demand for \ndignity, justice, and democracy that is shaking the Arab world to its \nfoundations will not be confined to that one region alone. It will \nspread. It will inspire others. It will demonstrate to others that the \nfrustrations, indignities, and lack of hope they may feel today need \nnot be the realities they endure tomorrow. They can change those \nrealities. They can change their destiny. They can change their \ncountries. And it appears that message may be resonating with the \npeople in Russia. We should hope that it does resonate and resonate in \na peaceful manner, because we agree with a growing number of Russians \nwho clearly believe they deserve better. They deserve a government that \nrespects and responds to their aspirations for a better life. They \ndeserve the power to freely elect their own leaders.\n  The political development of Russia is more than an issue of moral \nprinciple for the United States. It is closely\n\n[[Page S8398]]\n\ntied to our national interests. We have seen in the past that when \nautocratic governments feel they are losing legitimacy among their \npeople at home, they try to demonize others, both in their country and \nbeyond it, and redirect their public's anger against imaginary enemies. \nWe have seen how the Putin government has done this in the past. We \nhave seen its attempts to paint the United States and our NATO and \nother allies as enemies of Russia and to lash out against us in the \nhope of mobilizing public support at home. This is why the growing \npattern of confrontation from the Russian Government that we have seen \nin recent months--over missile defense, resupply efforts into \nAfghanistan, and other issues--should be so concerning to us and why \nwe must understand that the actions of the Russian Government cannot be \nseparated from its character. In fact, as Russia's Government grows \nless tolerant of its own people's rights at home, we should not be \nsurprised if it treats us the same way.\n\n  As I have said before, I believe we need greater realism about \nRussia, but that is not the same as pessimism or cynicism or \ndemonization. I am ultimately an optimist, and I often find sources for \nhope in the most hopeless of places.\n  One year ago, after languishing in prison for 7 years and facing the \nnear certainty of enduring many more, Mikhail Khodorkovsky spoke before \nhis sentencing about the hopes of the Russian people as they watched \nhis trial. He said:\n\n       They are watching with the hope that Russia will after all \n     become a country of freedom and of the law. Where supporting \n     opposition parties will cease being a cause for reprisals. \n     Where the special services will protect the people and the \n     law, and not the bureaucracy from the people and the law. \n     Where human rights will no longer depend on the mood of the \n     tsar, good or evil. Where, on the contrary, the power will \n     truly be dependent on the citizens and the court, only on law \n     and God. For me, as for anybody, it is hard to live in jail, \n     and I do not want to die there. But if I have to, I will not \n     hesitate. The things I believe in are worth dying for.\n\n  That there are still men and women of such spirit in Russia is cause \nfor hope. And eventually--maybe not this year or next year or the year \nafter that but eventually--the Russian people will have a government \nthat is worthy of their aspirations, for equal justice can be delayed \nand human dignity can be denied but not forever.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I thank my most distinguished friend from \nArizona for his generous, warm, and friendly remarks. They mean a lot \nto me. I will never forget them. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in observation of the surprise \nattack that the Empire of Japan launched on the U.S. military bases in \nHawaii 70 years ago. The attack was concentrated on the Pearl Harbor \nNaval Base, where over 2,400 courageous sailors, soldiers, and marines \nlost their lives. Each year, close to 1\\1/2\\ million people from across \nthe country and around the world visit the memorials at Pearl Harbor to \nremember the events of December 7, 1941, and how the world was changed \nforever on that day.\n  As the Sun rose over Pearl Harbor today, solemn prayers were offered \nand large crowds gathered to honor the sacrifice made by so many of our \nbrave young men and women.\n  The National Park Service and the Navy Region Hawaii are hosting the \n70th Anniversary Pearl Harbor Day Commemoration at the Pearl Harbor \nVisitor Center to recognize those who bravely survived the attacks and \nto remember the thousands more who gave their lives in service to their \ncountry that day.\n  Representative Charles William ``Bill'' Young from Florida will be \nrepresenting Congress at the commemoration ceremony accompanied by \nWilliam Muehleib, the president of the Pearl Harbor Survivors \nAssociation, and approximately 100 survivors of the attacks, including \n8 who were aboard the USS Arizona, which lies enshrined at the bottom \nof Pearl Harbor today. The USS Oklahoma, BB 37, Memorial Executive \nCommittee will dedicate a rose granite memorial marker at the National \nMemorial Cemetery of the Pacific at Punchbowl to honor the memory of \nthe approximately 355 USS Oklahoma sailors who perished but were never \nindividually identified. The remains of two servicemembers will be \ninterred at the USS Utah and the USS Arizona so they may again join \ntheir shipmates in accordance with their wishes. And the Hawaii Air \nNational Guard will fly F-22 Raptors over the memorial sites at Pearl \nHarbor and Hickam Air Force Base in honor of the fallen.\n  I want to recognize and thank the National Park Service and Navy \nRegion Hawaii for their diligent work and dedication to ensuring that \nthe legacy of the thousands of servicemembers who perished that day \nlives on through the memorials that stand solemnly at Pearl Harbor. \nThey have done an outstanding job conveying the unwavering spirit of \nthose who, in the face of perilous odds, stood their ground and fought \nback against the Japanese attack to save the lives of their brothers in \narms. The efforts of these organizations have helped to make sure that \nour country will never forget the tragic loss that all Americans felt \nas news of the attack spread across the Nation.\n  We must continue to remember the acts of heroism, bravery, and \nsacrifice that followed the attack. Our country fought in the name of \njustice to preserve our Nation's sacred freedoms. And we must also \nrecognize and thank the courageous men and women of our Armed Forces \ntoday who are still fighting in the name of those same freedoms. I urge \nthe citizens of this Nation to recall that it was the collaboration of \na country and the sacrifices made by ordinary men and women who rallied \nin defense of freedom, liberty, and the great promise of our democracy \nthat preserved our Nation's freedom and liberty. It is in that spirit \nof coming together to save our country that has always produced the \nstrongest results and made our country great.\n  Mr. President, I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in prayer and \nremembrance for the men and women who died in Pearl Harbor and those \nwho are still fighting overseas today. May God bless all of those who \nhave served to protect our shores, and God bless America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in the school year 2009-2010, the U.S. \nDepartment of Education provided $132 billion in grants and loans to \nstudents. That was up from $49 billion in 2001--a dramatic increase in \nFederal aid to education. A large part of the increase can be traced to \none particular type of school: enrollment at for-profit colleges. That \nhas grown faster than any other sector.\n\n  Currently, about 10 percent of the students pursuing education after \nhigh school attend for-profit schools--for-profit colleges and \ndifferent training schools that offer certification in certain skills \nand certain professions, 10 percent. But that 10-percent portion of \nstudents in America account for 25 percent of all the Federal aid to \neducation. In other words, dramatically more money is going to those \nstudents than those attending other schools after high school.\n  When it comes to the student loan defaults, where college students \nborrow money to go to school and then fail to pay it back, for-profit \nschool students account for 44 percent of the student loan defaults in \nAmerica. Again, 10 percent of the students, 25 percent of the Federal \naid to education, and 44 percent of student loan defaults are \nattributable to for-profit schools.\n  The industry is dominated by 10 publicly traded for-profit companies. \nOf those 10 companies, they enroll almost half the students in for-\nprofit schools.\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\nSo it is dominated by the big players. The largest, of course, the \nApollo Group, University of Phoenix, at one point had over 450,000 \nstudents enrolled nationwide, more than the combined enrollment of all \nthe Big Ten colleges and universities--a big player when it comes to \nhigher education and a big player when it comes to Federal aid to \neducation. The Apollo Group, University of Phoenix, receives more money \nthan any other college in America, far and away. None are even close. \nThe next two schools, when it comes to Federal aid to education, are \nalso for-profit colleges.\n  While Federal spending on student aid has seen a huge increase, there \nhas been very little accountability when it comes to these for-profit \nschools. Worse yet, almost no information has been available about \nwhether the students are actually learning and finding work in their \nrespective fields after graduation.\n  In June of last year, Senator Tom Harkin--who has joined me in this \neffort to look closely at for-profit schools across America--added his \nname to a letter we sent to the Government Accountability Office to \nstudy the outcomes for students attending for-profit colleges. The \nreport has been formally released. For-profit colleges serve--and one \ncould argue they target--primarily low-income, nontraditional, and \nminority students.\n  For-profit colleges often claim the reason more of their students \ncan't find jobs and the reason more of their students default on \nstudent loans is because they are trying to provide education to \nstudents whom others will not accept. That is their explanation for \nhigher debt levels and higher default rates and poorer student \noutcomes. Senator Harkin and I wanted to ask the Government \nAccountability Office straight out to take a look at the different \nstudents in terms of their income and background and compare outcomes--\nfor-profit schools versus public universities and private schools. Our \nquestion was: What does the research show about graduation rates, \nemployment outcomes, student loan debt, and default rates for students \nat for-profit schools compared to those at nonprofit and public \nschools, taking into consideration different student backgrounds.\n  When looking at student debt, one study by the GAO found that 99 \npercent--99 percent--of for-profit college students took out loans, \nalmost all of them. What is the comparison? Seventy-two percent of \nthose attending public colleges took out loans, with 83 percent of \nthose attending private, nonprofit colleges.\n  When it comes to student loans, the for-profit colleges lead all \ntypes of schools and universities in the number of students who are \ntaking out loans. The GAO found that for-profit college students have \nhigher rates of unemployment when it is all over. When it comes to \nloans and debts, students at for-profit colleges fare much more poorly \nthan their peers attending nonprofit or public institutions. Students \nat for-profit colleges took out more student loans and they generally \nhad higher loan debt.\n  Let me tell you about one of those students who contacted our office. \nHis name is Jacob Helms. He attended a for-profit, online school to \nearn a bachelor of computer science degree in videogame design. When he \nenrolled, he was a little bit apprehensive because of the cost. You \nsee, this for-profit, online school told him he had to take about nine \nclasses a year and each class would cost him $1,500. Jacob was \nconcerned about the cost, but the school told him: Don't worry about \nit. The loans you have to take out will cover your entire education.\n  With that assurance, Jake enrolled 4 years ago. After about 4 years \nof attending courses year-round, Jake reached the maximum direct loan \namount for independent undergraduate students. He had borrowed $57,500. \nThe problem was, he wasn't finished. He hadn't completed his required \ncourses. He had just run out of the ability to borrow any more money \nfrom the government. Jake is $57,500 in debt. He has no degree and no \njob prospects. He says all he wants to do is move forward and start a \ncareer--his original goal. Jake says the school will provide him with \nno assistance or alternative other than to drop out with a debt, no \ndiploma, and no job.\n  In fact, Jake didn't even know he had reached the maximum level on \nhis Federal direct loan limit. He was withdrawn from online classes \nwith no explanation and finally determined that since he could no \nlonger borrow money from the Federal Government--he was at the top, \nwith $57,500--they didn't want him. When he inquired, the school told \nhim he had run out of money. With an annual income of less than $25,000 \nand no other way to pay the tuition, Jake dropped out. He says the \nschool's attitude was very clear: We got our money; we are done with \nyou.\n  Jake is not alone. Student debt has outpaced credit card debt. \nImagine that. In October of last year--13 months ago--for the first \ntime in history, the total amount of student loan debt is greater than \ncredit card debt in America. In 2009, the average debt nationally for \nstudents at for-profit colleges was well above those who attended other \ninstitutions. Students at for-profit colleges graduated with an average \ndebt of $33,000. At public universities, the average was $20,000. At \nprivate nonprofits, the average was $27,600.\n  There are very few penalties for schools where students incur huge \namounts of debt and can't repay their loans. More than three in four--\nthat is 76 percent--of young adults say college has become harder to \nafford in the past 5 years. Nearly as many--73 percent--say graduates \nhave more student debt than they can manage.\n\n  It was interesting to see with this Occupy movement--which had many \ndifferent causes, in many different cities--that the one recurring \ntheme, particularly from the younger people who were there, was we have \nto do something about student loan debt. Students across America, those \nwho have attended colleges and universities, understand that debt and \nthe burden it places on their lives. These students have to put off \nbuying homes, starting families, and other major life decisions because \nof their debt.\n  Sadly, many students are not informed about the loans they are taking \nout. They do not know the difference between a direct loan and a \nprivate loan, but they should. The one critical difference is this. It \nwasn't that long ago in America where people could borrow money from \nthe Federal Government to go to college and beyond and then declare \nbankruptcy, so we changed the law. We said: That is not fair. They \ncan't borrow this money from the Federal government and then refuse to \npay it. So student loans from the government were no longer \ndischargeable in bankruptcy.\n  I thought there was some sense and justice to that decision. We had \ncases that were reported of students literally finishing medical school \nand declaring bankruptcy before they went into practice so they didn't \nhave to pay their student loans. That was unacceptable and unfair and \nit can no longer be done. Just a few years ago, we changed the law \nagain and said private college student loans--those are loans from the \nuniversity and not from the government--were also not dischargeable in \nbankruptcy. What does that mean? It means, if a student has incurred a \ndebt or if one has signed on to their son or daughter's college debt, \nthey are on the hook. They will have to pay that off or else.\n  We asked some of the Federal agencies: Are you concerned about \nstudent loan default? They gave a very cold answer. They said: No. We \nwill get our money because we will be watching for the rest of that \nperson's life. Every time they think they are going to receive a \nFederal income tax refund, we will take the check. If necessary, we \nwill take their Social Security checks too. That shows this student \nloan debt can haunt them for a lifetime.\n  We recently had an e-mail from a young man. It was heartbreaking. He \ntold a story of going to one of the for-profit colleges in the Chicago \narea and he ended up coming out of college with $90,000 in debt, a \nworthless diploma and no job. His parents signed a note. Because of the \npenalties and interest which accumulated after he had finished his \neducation, his debt was now up to $124,000. Both his parents had \ndecided they could no longer afford to retire, as they had planned. \nThey had to keep working to pay off their son's student loan for an \neducation that turned out to be worthless.\n  I wish that was the only example I knew of, but we have been \nreceiving\n\n[[Page S8400]]\n\nmore and more examples just like it. There is no way in this \ncircumstance for this student to consolidate loans, lower interest \nrates or pay off the balance.\n  Sadly, many students are not informed about the loans they take out. \nThey do not know the difference between direct loans and private loans. \nThey do not know this aspect of nondischargeability in bankruptcy. \nPrivate loans are even more burdensome. You see, when a person takes \nout a government student loan, after a period of time--because of some \nof the decisions made by President Obama and by this Congress--they can \nbe at least limited in their exposure of how much they have to pay each \nyear, 10 percent of their income, with certain qualifications--10 \npercent, no more. After 10 years, should they take a job as a teacher \nor nurse, some of their government student loan debt can be forgiven.\n\n  This is not true on the private side. The money loaned to a student \nby the school, for example, or by some other institution other than the \ngovernment is not subject to these benefits or limits. Students wrack \nup unmanageable amounts of debt, then can't repay their loans or \ndischarge their private student loans in bankruptcy.\n  In September, the Department of Education released the fiscal year \n2009 national student loan default rates. It is a measurement of how \nmany students default on their student loans, and it gives us a view of \nthe overall burden of college on students. The rates of students \nattending for-profit colleges continue to soar well above the rates for \nstudents at private and public colleges--4.6 percent of students who \nattend private schools defaulting on their loans. But students who \nattend for-profit schools default at a rate almost 3\\1/2\\ times as \nhigh, at 15 percent. That is dramatically higher if they attend for-\nprofit schools. Because their debt is higher, their likelihood of a job \nis much less.\n  This says more about the institutions than it says about the \nstudents. Yet there are no repercussions for schools with high default \nrates, unless--under new regulations from this administration--they \nhave 25 percent default rates for 3 consecutive years. This is \nunacceptable.\n  The recent GAO study recognizes we have few measures to determine the \nquality of education students receive. One measure we do have is that \nstudents at for-profits continue to go deeper and deeper into debt even \nthough most of them don't graduate. Of students who began their \neducation at for-profit schools in the 2003-2004 school year, only 15 \npercent had obtained a bachelor's degree by 2009. Again, for-profit \nschools, over a period of 6 years, graduate 15 percent.\n  What about other schools? Sixty-four percent of students at public \ncolleges graduated in that 6-year period of time, and 71 percent at \nprivate colleges obtained a bachelor's degree. That is a huge \ndifference. A 15-percent graduation rate at for-profit schools means \nstudents, many of them, are deeply in debt by a margin of almost 6 to 1 \nare not graduating. They don't end up with a diploma. They have the \ndebt, they have no diploma, and some of them end up with a worthless \ndiploma.\n  The recent Department of Education regulations are starting to work. \nThey are cracking down on aggressive recruiting practices. Students are \nthinking harder about where they enroll in schools. In some cases, \nstudents are avoiding for-profit colleges. Every high school student in \nAmerica should read the summary of the Government Accountability Office \nreport on for-profit schools before they even consider enrolling in one \nof those schools.\n  Some of the schools are starting to ask questions on their own about \nthe way they do business, and they have come to me--many of these \nschools--pleading with me, saying: You are just talking about the bad \nguys. We are the good guys.\n  Well, prove it. Prove it. Make certain that students are getting an \neducation that is worthwhile. Don't sink them with debt. Stand by them \nwhen it comes to finding a job or at least be mindful of what that debt \nmeans to their lives.\n  More needs to be done to educate families, high school teachers, and \nhigh school counselors about the choices students face. I hope these \ncompanies will continue to examine their practices, and I hope the \nDepartment of Education is going to continue monitoring the schools and \nthe way they operate.\n  Let me tell you about one such operation, the Career Education \nCorporation. I know about this school because its former CEO came and \nmet with me in my office in Chicago and then appeared at a hearing, \npleading with me to give special consideration to his for-profit \nschools, which were different and better and shouldn't be lumped into \nthe category of these schools that are exploiting young people coming \nout of high school. I listened to him and basically said: Well, I will \npay attention to the way this turns out.\n  This gentleman, whose name is Gary McCullough, resigned as the CEO of \nCareer Education Corporation on November 1 after it was reported that \nhis school had misrepresented its placement rates for its graduates.\n  Career Education Corporation is an Illinois-based company with over \n100,000 students nationwide. If you have not heard of Career Education \nCorporation, you may have heard of some of the names of its schools. I \nsaw one of them on a bus in Chicago advertising for more students, and \nit is a familiar name to people who have followed the culinary side of \nbusiness for a long time: Le Cordon Bleu. They bought that name, and \nthey named one of their schools Le Cordon Bleu. We will teach you how \nto be a superchef, an Iron Chef, whatever chef you want to be. But it \nturns out that they were not only failing to educate and train the \nstudents, but the students couldn't get jobs, and the students were \ndeep in debt.\n  When Mr. McCullough ended up resigning as CEO of Career Education \nCorporation, they found out that only 13 of their 49 health, education, \nand art design schools--13 of 49--met the 65-percent minimum placement \nrate for the reporting period. They had falsified their numbers, and \nnow they are under investigation. They should be. We need to get to the \nbottom of it. If they are lying to the students, something has to \nhappen.\n  First, they shouldn't be qualified for Federal student loans or Pell \ngrants. If they are not graduating students into jobs, then they ought \nto be held to higher standards. And the students shouldn't be misled \ninto believing that if they can get a Federal loan at a school, it has \nto be a good school.\n  Secondly, there has to be some standard for accreditation. There \nobviously is little or no accreditation accountability at this point. \nYou can't expect a high school student or his parents to be able to \nlook at a school from the outside or look at the Web site and decide \nwhether it is any good. There have to be some standards for performance \nand excellence when it comes to these for-profit schools--for every \nschool, for that matter.\n  Finally, if this school loses its accreditation, particularly in the \nprograms where it has failed to graduate students, I think this school \nand this corporation should be held accountable for the student loans \nthat have been incurred by these students. They didn't know they were \nsigning up to go to an unaccredited school. Their debt is very real; \ntheir diploma is a phony. So it is time for these schools to be held \naccountable.\n  I am sure there are many for-profit schools that offer a good \neducation, but there are certainly many that are exploiting students \ntoday. They are so good at marketing, you can't avoid them, whether it \nis on the Internet or television. They are everywhere, everywhere you \nturn, particularly in low-income communities. They are offering \n``college'' to many students who can't get into a regular college or \nuniversity. These students feel they are finally going to get their \nchance. Little do they know that all these for-profit schools are \nlooking for is the money they can bring to them. When it is all over, \nthey are deep in debt with no job and no place to turn.\n  What is our responsibility? Remember, we put $132 billion a year into \nFederal aid to higher education. It is time for us to make sure the \nschools that receive them for the students are real schools, are \ngraduating students and preparing them for a good life and a good job.\n\n[[Page S8401]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8401-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF RICHARD CORDRAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, experts blame credit default swaps and \ncollateralized debt obligations for the financial crisis. The fact is, \nthese complicated financial products were based on mortgages sold to \nfamilies who couldn't afford them, credit cards with hidden fees, and \nloans targeted to low-income individuals with up to 400 percent \ninterest rates. The financial regulators ignored their responsibility \nto protect consumers from these predatory practices. Because there was \nnot one regulator solely responsible for consumer protection, the \nfinancial regulators pointed their fingers at the other guy when the \nsystem collapsed. Consumers lost $17 trillion in household wealth and \nretirement savings almost overnight.\n  That is why a bipartisan group of 60 Senators voted last year to \nconsolidate consumer protection authority into one agency: the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. The CFPB was given new responsibilities to \noversee nonbank actors who deal in payday loans, prepaid cards, student \nloans, and credit reporting.\n  Mr. President, 200 million Americans rely on credit reporting \nagencies when they make a big purchase and sometimes when they apply \nfor a job. An estimated 20 million people use payday lenders to make \nends meet. I wish they didn't, but they do. Many of them face up to 400 \npercent interest rates to obtain these short-term loans. Four million \nAmericans have prepaid debit cards. As more companies use these types \nof products instead of checks or direct deposit, it is expected that \nover $670 billion will be loaded into prepaid cards in the next few \nyears. More than $10 billion in private student loans is given to \nstudents, who then face up to 15 percent interest rates. I talked about \na few of them in an earlier statement.\n  Tens of millions of Americans relying on nonbanks for their financial \nneeds will go without protection unless the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau has the resources it needs to help American consumers \nand a Director.\n  Earlier this year, President Obama nominated Richard Cordray to be \nDirector of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. He was recruited \nto lead the Enforcement Division and now is being asked to move up and \ntake over the directorship. Before joining, he served as Ohio's \nattorney general, recovering billions of dollars in pension funds on \nbehalf of retirees and taking on the predatory lenders. Mr. Cordray saw \nfirsthand how the failure to enforce Federal consumer protection laws \nrelated to mortgages affected Ohio residents. He has a strong \ngrounding, working with both consumer advocates and the financial \nsector. He is an excellent choice, and I strongly support his \nnomination.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Cordray is asking to head up a consumer protection \nagency which, to paraphrase a former colleague on the floor, the banks \nhate like the devil hates holy water. The idea that we would give \nauthority to an agency to watch these financial institutions--payday \nloan operations and the rest--to make certain they don't exploit \nAmerican consumers drives these banking interests wild. They have done \neverything they can to stop him from becoming Director and to cut the \nmoney available for his Bureau. They don't believe there should be \nconsumer protection. Let the buyer beware. They don't care, at the end \nof the day, if innocent people suffer across America. But they should.\n\n  My colleagues claim there won't be any real checks on his power if \nMr. Cordray is given this position, but he is subject to an annual \naudit by the GAO; he has to report to Congress biannually; is subject \nto private sector independent audit; monitored by the inspector general \nof the Federal Reserve; the Comptroller General is required to annually \naudit the financial transactions of the Bureau; and is subject to the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Congress \nReview Act, and the Administrative Procedures Act, to name a few. The \nFinancial Stability Oversight Council that includes members from across \nthe financial sector can review and overturn CFPB regulations. No other \nagency is subject to having regulations under its own jurisdiction \noverturned. But that isn't enough for the special interests that hate \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. These are the same players \nwho helped create the financial crisis that devastated our economy.\n  Despite all these measures to ensure congressional oversight, those \nwho couldn't kill the CFPB outright are determined to destroy its \nability to act. And now, as we finally start to recover from this \neconomic crisis, the same special interests are protesting efforts to \nrequire the disclosure of credit card fees, for example. The same banks \nthat made billions from selling homes to families who couldn't afford \nthem are refusing to modify mortgages so families can stay in their \nhomes. They don't want to change the structure of the CFPB; they want \nto destroy its ability to protect America's consumers and families. \nThey want to go back to the days of ``heads I win, tails you lose,'' \nback to the days when we didn't have to worry about a regulator \nenforcing consumer protection laws.\n  The CFPB structure is similar to other financial regulators. The \nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency has been led by one \nindividual with congressional oversight for over 100 years, for \nexample. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac, is also led by a single Director with congressional \noversight. Yet both financial regulators have avoided the political \noutcry we are hearing about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  Really, what we are seeing, I am afraid, is a partisan effort to \nblock a well-qualified nominee. Many intelligent, decent, and hard-\nworking Americans volunteer to contribute as appointed public servants. \nThey are well qualified, but all too often these days, they can't get \nthrough the Senate. This has serious consequences on all Federal \nagencies and our judiciary.\n  Yesterday, we saw an incredibly astonishing Republican filibuster of \nthe nomination of Caitlin Halligan to serve in the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals. The fact is, those voting against her nomination couldn't come \nup with a good reason. She had been found by the ABA to be unanimously \n``well qualified,'' she had an amazing resume, and she was rejected on \na filibuster initiated by the Republican side. That is unfortunate.\n  I would just say to my Senate Republican colleagues that I think \nRichard Cordray has the background and experience to lead this agency. \nHe should be given a chance. I know the banks aren't happy that anybody \nis watching them. These financial institutions--payday lenders and the \nrest--would rather do their business without anybody looking over their \nshoulders.\n  Holly Petraeus is the wife of General Petraeus. She has been working \nwith the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stop the exploitation \nof men and women in military service. She came by my office to talk \nabout what this agency is doing to protect these families. Sadly, some \nof these families are exploited so badly that they are forced out of \nthe military and have to be discharged. We don't want that to happen. \nWe don't want it to happen to American families who unsuspectingly find \nthemselves lured into financial arrangements that are totally unfair.\n  Richard Cordray is competent, qualified, and an honorable public \nservant. He deserves an up-or-down vote. We are going to have that vote \nprobably tomorrow, and I hope he will be confirmed and given an \nopportunity to lead this important agency.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when I \ncomplete my remarks, the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Barrasso, be allowed \nto follow me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8401-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8401-S8403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the President of the United States has said \nrepeatedly that he makes jobs his top priority, he wakes up every \nmorning thinking about what he can do to create jobs and how he can \ncreate jobs. Yet we have the greatest shovel-ready project in the \ncountry right in front of us, and when it comes to that particular \nproject, for some reason the President is suddenly not interested. I \nthink we have to ask the question of why that is. I think there are \nprobably\n\n[[Page S8402]]\n\na number of reasons, most of which have to do with politics and not the \neconomy and not jobs because clearly this is a subject on which there \nis no debate when it comes to the job-creation potential there, the \nimpact it would have on the economies of multiple States in our country \nand what it would do for the issue of energy security.\n  The project to which I am referring is the Keystone XL Pipeline. The \nKeystone XL Pipeline is a project that has been under review now for \nthe better part of 3 years. In fact, there have been two environmental \nstudies. If you look at all of the due diligence that has been done, it \nhas clearly been reviewed, it has been analyzed, it has been studied, \nand it has been scrutinized. It has gotten to the point now where it is \ntime to move forward, time to make a decision on this.\n  Ironically and I think sort of surprisingly to a lot of people, \nrecently the administration said they are not going to decide this now, \nfor 18 months. They are going to put it off for 18 months--\ninterestingly enough, from a timing standpoint, until after the next \nelection. I think it is unfortunate that is the case because, again, if \nyour No. 1 priority is job creation, you have one here ready to go \ntoday that could be under construction, and it would immediately create \n20,000 jobs in this country, and it would create $7 billion of \ninvestment and a lot of revenue for State and local governments, many \nof which desperately need it.\n  In my own State of South Dakota, the Keystone XL Pipeline would \ntraverse my State of South Dakota as the oil that comes from the oil \nsands area up in Canada makes its way down to the refineries and other \nparts of the country, comes through South Dakota, and just in our State \nalone that would be about $\\1/2\\ billion of economic activity, meaning \nhundreds of jobs and revenue for a lot of State and local governments.\n  This project in my State, like so many States where it comes through, \nwhere it impacts--there have been a number of opportunities for people \nto be heard, to get their input made on this. It has been going on now \nfor 3 years. You finally get to a point where you have to say it is \ntime to make a decision one way or the other. Clearly, my view on this \nis that this is a project that should move forward. But one way or the \nother, the President of the United States and his administration ought \nto be acting with some finality on this subject now, not waiting 18 \nmonths, not waiting until after the next election because it is \npolitically expedient to do that, but making a decision now. Why is \nthat? Because, if it does not get done here, that oil from the oil \nsands area in Canada will go somewhere else and some other country \naround the world will benefit from that. It will not be the United \nStates, it will not be refineries here in this country, it will not be \nthe citizens of America--who have a good relationship with our neighbor \nto the north. Canada is our biggest single trading partner. We do about \n$640 billion of bilateral trade every single year with Canada. It makes \na lot of sense, if you are thinking about energy security, if you are \nworried about the dangerous dependence that we have on other countries \naround the world for our energy needs, that if we are going to get \nenergy we get it from a country with which we have a good relationship, \na country that is friendly and a country with which we do a tremendous \namount of trade.\n\n  If we cannot move forward, it is going somewhere, probably to Asia, \nprobably to China. China will get the benefit. The citizens of China \nwill get the benefit of this project rather than having the American \npeople benefit from all this project would entail if we could get it \napproved here.\n  But we ought to at least make a decision. We have all these \ndiscussions in this country, all the rhetoric coming from the other \nside about how it is so important that we create jobs in this country. \nYet the administration seems willing to disregard that and say we are \ngoing to make what is clearly a political decision and put this off for \n18 months until after the next election.\n  I think it is interesting to note what some are saying about this, \nand frankly even what the President himself has said as recently as \nlast April about the importance of getting energy from countries that \nare stable and friendly. This is something the President said:\n\n       Importing oil from countries that are stable and friendly \n     is a good thing.\n\n  That is something the President of the United States said as recently \nas last April. There is a letter that went from 22 congressional \nDemocrats to the President, telling him that America needs the Keystone \nXL Pipeline. Twenty-two Democratic Members of the House of \nRepresentatives weighed in on this issue. We have had Democratic \nSenators here as well who weighed in with the administration and \nweighed in publicly and said this is an important project that needs to \nbe completed.\n  You even have the labor unions. Traditionally you would think of them \nas part of the President's political base. What are they saying about \nthis? The AFL-CIO said:\n\n       For America's skilled craft construction professionals, any \n     discussion of the Keystone XL Pipeline project begins and \n     ends with one word: JOBS.\n\n  That is what the AFL-CIO is saying.\n  Laborers' International Union of North America says it is:\n\n       . . . not just a pipeline, but it is a lifeline for \n     thousands of desperate working men and women.\n\n  You have bipartisan support here in Congress. You have the working \npeople, the organizations of this country that represent working \npeople, weighing in saying this is a project that needs to be approved, \nthat would create jobs, that would address some of the economic angst \nwe are feeling in this country, and here we are faced with this \nunnecessary delay.\n  We have legislation that has 40 cosponsors in the Senate. It was \nintroduced last week. Many of our colleagues have taken the lead: \nSenator Hoeven of North Dakota, Senator Johanns from Nebraska, Senator \nMurkowski, Senator Barrasso, who is here on the floor, and others who \nbelieve so strongly in the issue of economic growth, job creation, \nenergy security, national security, that we have introduced a bill that \nwould allow this project either, No. 1, to move forward or to have to \nprovide a rationale why it would not move forward. It is pretty simple, \nstraightforward legislation. It would allow 60 days from enactment of \nthe legislation for a decision to be made about the permit, one way or \nthe other. Either it gets permitted or, on the contrary, the President \ngives an explanation as to why it should not be permitted. But at least \nwe get a decision made so there is some economic certainty for the \npeople behind this project, the people who are making this investment, \nabout whether it is going to go forward.\n  One thing we hear over and over from small businesses across this \ncountry--and large businesses, job creators--is we need economic \ncertainty. We cannot continue to operate in this complete cloud of \neconomic uncertainty if we are going to put investment out there and \ncreate the jobs that go with that investment.\n  Mr. President, 700,000 barrels a day is the equivalent of what we get \ndaily from Venezuela. If we could get 700,000 barrels of oil today from \nCanada, a friendly neighbor to the north, or 700,000 barrels from \nVenezuela or any other countries from which we import oil, it seems so \nlogical and such a no-brainer for us to be able to trade and interact \nand to have this economic relationship with Canada on this particular \nproject. It does come across that way, as I said, in many parts of the \nDakotas and Montana. It would encourage greater oil production here in \nthis country as well, because you have the Bakkan Reserve in North \nDakota and Montana which we would be able to access for this pipeline \nto be able to get some of their energy to refiners around this country. \nIt is an ``all of the above'' domestic energy strategy: More domestic \noil, more alternative fuels, more innovation. It is all these things we \nneed when we talk about energy security. But clearly in this case, for \nsome unexplained reason, the administration has concluded that this \nproject should not go forward.\n  There was a concern raised earlier on about the State of Nebraska and \nthe route the pipeline was taking. That issue has been addressed. The \nleaders in Nebraska--Senator Johanns and the Governor of Nebraska--have \ncome together behind an alternative route which I believe was agreeable \nto the company, TransCanada, so you can no\n\n[[Page S8403]]\n\nlonger hide behind that and use that as a shield. The legislation we \nare introducing would make, of course, this subject to States rights \nand having States such as Nebraska intervene and work with the company \nto find this alternative route. It also would ensure and require strong \nenvironmental protections in the legislation. So that issue is \nsomething the legislation has addressed.\n  More than anything else, what it does is it at least forces some \naction. It at least says we are going to be serious about job creation \nin this country or we are not. We are going to support a shovel-ready \nproject that could create 20,000 jobs and start immediately or we are \nnot. All this rhetoric and all the hot air that comes from people here \nin Washington, DC, about wanting to create jobs, this is putting it to \nthe test. This is where you have to put up or shut up when it comes to \nwhether you are serious about creating jobs in this country.\n\n  I hope my colleagues here in the Senate on both sides of the aisle--\nbecause I believe this is a bipartisan issue--will work with us to \nadvance this legislation. There is some thinking that perhaps the House \nof Representatives, the other body, may include it in some legislation \nthey send us that could be coming this way in the not too distant \nfuture.\n  If that is the case, I hope we will pick that up and act on it \nbecause if we are serious and mean what we say about job creation in \nthis country, there is no better way than to put some certainty behind \nthis project. Again, it would be one thing if this had not been studied \nand overstudied and evaluated and analyzed and scrutinized--but it has, \nover and over again, now for the better part of 3 years. Mr. President, \n700,000 barrels of oil today from Canada and the Bakkan region in North \nDakota and U.S. refineries or 700,000 barrels of oil to some other \nplace around the world that will benefit from it and, just as important \nif not more important, 700,000 barrels of oil the United States will \nhave to import from some other country around the world that perhaps is \nnot nearly as friendly as our neighbors to the north.\n  This is not complicated. This is a pretty straightforward issue and \none where I don't think there is anything but support from the States \nthat are impacted by this, anything but support from the leadership, \npolitical leadership at the State level and local levels. I am not \nsuggesting there is--there is no project that has unanimous support. \nThere are people who oppose this as there are people who oppose almost \nanything that happens in this country. But the huge majority of people \nI think in the States that are impacted see this for what it is--a \npositive, forward-looking project that would address so many of the \nimportant priorities for this country right now: economic growth, job \ncreation, energy security, national security, addressing some of the \nneeds the State and local governments have for additional revenue. All \nthese issues are addressed with regard to this project.\n  It is mystifying as to why the President of the United States and his \nadministration would put this decision off until 18 months from now \nafter the next election, other than purely and simply political reasons \nand motivations. That is wrong for the American people. It is wrong for \nthis project. It is wrong for jobs. It is wrong for the economy. I hope \nthis body, the Senate, will take steps to rectify that by putting a \ndate certain out there by which this project is at least acted on, at \nleast decided, at least permitted or not permitted--hopefully \npermitted--so these jobs can be created and we can get this economic \nactivity underway in these many States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley).

Mr. President, I come to the floor today as I have so \nmany times since the President's health care bill was signed into law, \nwith a doctor's second opinion. I do that because I practiced medicine \nin Wyoming, taking care of families from around the State for about a \nquarter of a century.\n  When I talk to patients at home and I talk to people on the street, \nwhen I talk to folks all around my State and around the country, what I \nhear they want from a health care law was an opportunity to have the \ncare they need from the doctor they want at a cost they can afford. But \nwhat we have gotten in this country through this administration and \nthis health care law is a law that is bad for patients, in my opinion; \nbad for providers, the nurses and doctors who take care of those \npatients; and terrible for American taxpayers. So I come to the floor \nagain with a second opinion today because I am thinking about job \ncreation.\n  We just heard about the Keystone XL Pipeline and the opportunity \nthere with a shovel-ready project to get people back to work. I am \nreminded what former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi claimed after \nthe health care law was passed. She said it would ``create 4 million \njobs.'' She went on to say ``400,000 jobs almost immediately.''\n  As we all know, that prediction never came true. In fact, the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the health care law will \nactually encourage some people to work fewer hours or to withdraw from \nthe labor market altogether.\n  This past week when the employment statistics came out we saw that \nover 300,000 Americans have withdrawn from the labor market altogether.\n  It is interesting that about the same time the health care law was \nsigned, March 2010, Senator Chuck Schumer, the New York Senator, \nclaimed on ``Meet the Press'':\n\n       . . . as people learn about the bill, and now that the bill \n     is enacted, it's going to become more and more popular.\n\n  In fact, this health care law is less popular now, today, December \n2011, than it was at the time it was signed into law.\n  We look at all of these predictions that never came true. It has been \n20 months. The health care law's popularity remains low. The law is in \nfront of the Supreme Court to deal with the constitutionality of this \ngovernment going into the homes of American people, telling them they \nmust buy a product. It is clear that Washington Democrats and the \nPresident have miscalculated. They made promise after promise to the \nAmerican people. They asked families, they asked businesses all across \nthe Nation, to trust them. The President promised that if you like what \nyou have, you can keep it. The American people know that promise has \nbeen broken. The President said that premiums, health care premiums or \ninsurance costs for families would drop by $2,500 per family per year. \nWe know that the costs have gone up higher than if the law had never \nbeen passed in the first place.\n  Week after week we hear of more unintended consequences within the \nlaw, glitches that are found which show additional problems with the \nlaw and additional promises of the President being broken.\n  The American people know that they do not like this health care law. \nWhen you ask them do you think this health care law was passed for you \nor for someone else, most Americans will tell you that they think it \nwas passed for someone else.\n  Today I want to talk about two specific examples of problems with \nthis health care law and the possible unintended consequences and some \nof the repercussions of the things that have happened with this health \ncare law.\n  One has to do with the labor statistics that came out on December 2 \nof this year. They released updated payroll employment and unemployment \nnumbers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics data actually shows that health \ncare employment was up in November. It was up for all the wrong \nreasons. The problem is, the health care law's excessive mandates and \nburdensome regulations are prompting the health care industry to create \nadditional administrative jobs, not caregiver jobs.\n  The health care law was supposed to actually work to get more doctors \nand more nurses and more x-ray techs and physical therapists to take \ncare of patients, but that is not what happened. Now we see it is \nadministrative jobs that are up, not caregiver jobs. As a matter of \nfact, USA Today printed a half-page article, and the title was ``Health \nCare Jobs Grow . . . in Administration.''\n  The article actually talked about a New Hampshire hospital, and that \nhospital--according to the article--was forced to eliminate 5 percent \nof its\n\n[[Page S8404]]\n\nworkforce. So we have a hospital eliminating 5 percent of the workforce \nafter the State cut Medicaid funding last year. So here is a hospital \nwhere 5 percent of the workforce is cut. Many of those workers were \nnurses and other caregivers. When I hear caregivers, I think of \nphysical therapists, radiation technologists, nurse's aides.\n  Yet in spite of the fact that they had to eliminate 5 percent of its \nworkforce, they are actually still hiring. How can that be? Let's \nlisten to what the hospital's vice president, Mark Whitney said. He \nsaid:\n\n       We need to deal with new technology, new services, new \n     regulations, electronic health records, government reporting \n     requirements on quality . . . a lot of this is related to the \n     new Federal health law.\n\n  So they are eliminating nursing positions, eliminating positions of \ncaregivers and hiring more people to push paper.\n  The President and the Democrats in Congress promised their health \ncare law would expand health insurance coverage. Look at what is \nhappening now. More and more people are pushing paper.\n  It is interesting that what the President and Democrats did not tell \nthe American people is that the health care law's oppressive mandates, \nburdensome regulations would actually cause health care employers to \nlay off or stop hiring the very health care professionals needed to \ntreat patients.\n  Instead, the health care employers must be hiring more clerks, more \nadministrators, more paper pushers, all in an effort to figure out and \nthen comply with the health care law's rules and mandates. I do not \nbelieve that is the change most Americans wanted when they started to \nthink about health care reform.\n  The second example I would like to give is from a column in the \nWashington Post, December 2 of this year--just a week or so ago--\nwritten by George Will. The article is titled ``Choking on Obamacare.'' \nThe article talks about the health care law's crushing insurance \nmandates and how those influence both small and large businesses in \nterms of their willingness to actually hire new workers.\n  When we have this kind of record unemployment, such as we are dealing \nwith in this country, we want to have businesses hire more people, get \npeople back to work. That is what makes America grow. That is what \nhelps our economy, putting people back to work.\n  In the article, they use the example of Carl's Jr. and Hardee's \nrestaurants. There are about 3,200 of those restaurants around the \nworld. The parent company said they have created about 70,000 jobs, and \nthey want to hire more workers. But the CEO of the company, Andy \nPuzder, said they cannot hire more workers because they don't know how \nmuch they will need to spend on health care. They are planning to spend \nabout $18 million on health care, and they say that is just a guess.\n  If someone is running a business, they want to be able to figure out \nwhat their future costs are going to be, what the expenses are going to \nbe, and they would rather have a little more predictability than just \nguessing. Thanks to the health care law's complex formulas and many \nregulations which have not yet been released and many of the \nuncertainties that continue to exist, this is a company that is going \nto have to guess about how much they will need to spend on health care.\n  What business can afford to guess what one of their largest costs is \ngoing to be? They are guessing they are going to have to spend about \ntwice the amount of money on health care as they did building new \nrestaurants last year. So they talk about building new restaurants--and \nthose are construction jobs and jobs for the people who work in the \nrestaurants providing services--and they are going to end up spending \ntwice as much on health care as building new restaurants. It doesn't \ntake a lot to realize that hindering a company's ability to build new \nrestaurants means fewer available jobs for construction workers and for \nservice suppliers in a struggling economy.\n  The CEO of the company is right when he says that ``employers \neverywhere will be looking to reduce labor content in their business \nmodels as Obamacare makes employees unambiguously more expensive.''\n  If we want to spur the economy and economic growth and job creation, \nWashington must take its shackles off our job creators. This is just \none more reason why the President's health care law must be repealed \nand replaced.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

Mr. President, I rise today to strongly support Richard \nCordray, the President's nominee to be Director of the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau.\n  Three years ago our economy was tumbling into the deepest recession \nsince the Great Depression. In the fall of 2008, the stock market was \nplummeting, unemployment was skyrocketing, and there were daily reports \nof yet another financial institution crumbling. Our economy was in a \nchaotic tailspin. That was only 3 years ago.\n  Today we are in a slow and tenuous recovery. Unemployment is still \nway too high. Millions of Americans are out of work and have been for \nsome time. Long-term unemployment is staggeringly high. Retirement \naccounts are still reeling. Yet in the Halls of Congress we are \ndominated by discussions of our Nation's debt and deficit. In fact, we \nare doing little else. These discussions are necessary. We need to \ntackle our deficits and our long-term debt. But as we do, we shouldn't \nlose sight of how we got here.\n  The lessons we learned in the aftermath of the 2008 crash shouldn't \nbe so quickly forgotten. The crash of 2008 was driven in no small part \nby unfair practices in the mortgage industry which led to many \nconsumers being trapped in loans they didn't understand and couldn't \nafford. It should come as no surprise that this was as a result of \nincreasing deregulation of the banking industry.\n  So in response, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act. Dodd-Frank, which was passed into law last \nyear, sought to rein in abusive practices, protect American consumers, \nand prevent future meltdowns. One of the bill's centerpieces was the \nestablishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The CFPB is \nthe first Federal financial regulator devoted solely to looking out for \nthe best interests of American consumers and to do so before a crash \nand before any taxpayer-funded bailouts are necessary.\n  The CFPB's mission is a commonsense one. The CFPB is tasked with \nensuring that consumer financial markets are fair and competitive; that \nconsumers have clear information about financial products; that \nfinancial practices are not unfair, deceptive, or abusive; and that \nconsumer financial regulations are improved and streamlined. The CFPB \nseeks to empower American consumers to make the best financial \ndecisions for their families, and that can only help out our Nation as \na whole.\n  Several months ago, on the 1-year anniversary of the enactment of \nDodd-Frank, there was good news and bad news. The good news was that \nthe CFPB officially opened its doors. It has already hired staff and \nbegun some of its work. In fact, a while back I met with Mrs. Holly \nPetraeus, who is heading up the Office for Service Member Affairs at \nCFPB. She wanted to discuss a few problems that disproportionately harm \nmembers of our armed services.\n  We talked about ways to educate servicemembers about the potential \ndownfalls of certain types of loans. This is exactly the type of work I \nam so happy that the CFPB has begun. That would be the good news.\n  The bad news is the CFPB still does not have a Director. Under Dodd-\nFrank, the CFPB cannot fully do its job until a Director is in place. \nIt can do some things, but it will be limited until the Senate confirms \na nominee. President Obama has nominated Richard Cordray. Rich is an \nimpressive figure, and he has my full support.\n  Rich Cordray has been on the front lines protecting homeowners from\n\n[[Page S8405]]\n\nrisky and sometimes illegal practices of mortgage servicers. In 2009 he \nwas the first State attorney general to take on a mortgage servicer for \nviolating consumer laws.\n  Last year, he continued his strong record of standing up for \nhomeowners when he represented the people of Ohio against GMAC Mortgage \nfor signing thousands and thousands of affidavits allowing foreclosures \nto proceed despite the fact that nobody at the company had any \nknowledge of these cases. So I want Rich Cordray at CFPB to put his \nprevious expertise to work.\n  During his tenure as attorney general, he also took on the credit \nrating agencies on behalf of Ohio's pensioners. Because of the rating \nagencies' reckless behavior, hard-working Ohioans lost over $450 \nmillion from their pensions. Rich Cordray is exactly the kind of strong \nconsumer advocate that CFPB needs.\n  Further compounding the bad news is that most of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have vowed to oppose any nominee until the CFPB \nis substantially altered--literally any nominee. They claim that \nchanges to the CFPB need to be made before they will even look at a \nnominee. The proposed changes supposedly rectify the unprecedented \nauthority--unprecedented authority--granted to the CFPB and impose real \nchecks on that authority. In fact, the CFPB is subject to unprecedented \nlimitations. It is the only banking regulator with rules that are \nsubject to veto power by a group of other regulators, the only banking \nregulator subject to Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act \npanels, and the only banking regulator with a budgetary cap.\n\n  We already have had this debate. During the consideration of Dodd-\nFrank last year, there were attempts to weaken the CFPB, and those \nattempts were defeated. Now the people who lost that debate are taking \na second crack at consumers and trying to bring down this Bureau. Only \nthis time, instead of debating on the Senate floor, they are hijacking \nthe advice-and-consent function of the Senate. Is that a precedent that \nwe want to set? I do not believe that is what the Founders of this \ngreat Nation conceived when they gave this function to the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues instead to consider this nominee on his merits. \nRich Cordray has demonstrated he is looking out for middle-class \nfamilies. He is looking out for homeowners who have been scammed by \nmortgage servicers. He is looking out for pensioners who have lost \ntheir pensions at the hands of Wall Street recklessness. He has been \nendorsed by former Republican Senator and current Ohio attorney general \nMike DeWine. He is exactly--exactly--the type of person we need at the \nhelm of this critical Bureau, and this Bureau cannot do its job until \nhe is confirmed.\n  I hope my colleagues will reconsider their position and instead do \nwhat is right for American consumers. I hope my colleagues will join me \nin supporting Rich Cordray to be the first Director of the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Manchin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER.

Madam President, today is Delaware Day. Something very \nimportant for our State and our Nation occurred on December 7, 1787. \nSenator Coons is here. I ask him to take a moment and share with our \ncolleagues what that was all about. What happened then at that Golden \nFleece Tavern?\n  Mr. COONS. I thank the Senator for entering into this colloquy about \nDelaware Day. As some folks may know, if you look at the Delaware flag, \nas the Senator mentioned, there is the date, December 7, 1787. That is \nthe day 30 Delawareans, elected delegates, gathered at the Golden \nFleece Tavern in Dover and voted unanimously to make Delaware the first \nState to ratify the U.S. Constitution. That is why our State moniker \nis--\n  Mr. CARPER. The First State.\n  Mr. COONS. Yes, the First State.\n  Mr. CARPER. The small wonder. Thirty of those guys who were there \nthat day--I would like to say they were drinking hot chocolate. I am \nnot sure what they were drinking at the Golden Fleece Tavern, but the \noutcome was a good one. For one whole week after that, Delaware was the \nentire United States of America. Who was next, Pennsylvania? Maybe \nPennsylvania, maybe New Jersey. Then the rest followed and I think, for \nthe most part, it turned out pretty well.\n  Mr. COONS. One of the things I have always been struck by is that it \nwas 11 years before that that Delaware actually, on Separation Day, on \nJune 15 of 1776, acted both to declare its independence from \nPennsylvania and its independence from the King of England, and by \ndoing so acted in an incredibly risky way because, of course, had the \nContinental Congress on July 4 not chosen to ratify the Declaration of \nIndependence, Delaware would have stood alone, and arguably hung alone, \nfor having taken the risk of stepping out first.\n  Delaware has a tradition of being first--first in declaring its \nindependence and acting to secure its independence, and in ratifying \nthe Constitution, which set the whole structure that ended the debate \nover the Articles of Confederation and moved toward the Federal system, \none where we look to each other as States and look to this government \nfor the provision of and the securing of our liberty through the \nbalance of justice and liberty that we rely on so much. What else are \nwe doing to celebrate this great day?\n  Mr. CARPER. The Constitution that was ratified that day--the thing \nabout it is that it is the most enduring Constitution of any nation on \nEarth, the most copied or emulated Constitution of any nation on Earth \nas well, and a living document that provides for us to change and \nupdate as time goes by. It is remarkable, the role we played in getting \nthe ball rolling in this great country of ours.\n  I want to go back to July 1776, if I can. Not far away from the \nGolden Fleece Tavern, there was a guy named Caesar Rodney, who rode his \nhorse. Does the Senator want to share that story?\n  Mr. COONS. That made it possible for our delegation to be represented \nin Philadelphia and for us to commit to the Declaration by breaking a \ntie between the other representatives of Delaware in the Continental \nCongress.\n  Mr. CARPER. If you look at the back of the Delaware coin, you might \nsay why is Paul Revere on the back of that coin? Well, that is not Paul \nRevere, that is Caesar Rodney riding the horse from Dover to \nPhiladelphia. For people who are familiar with Dover Air Force Base, \nwhere big planes come in--the C-5s and C-17s that fly all over the \nworld--as you come in on the approach, the runway heading north-\nnortheast to land, you are very close to flying over an old plantation \nhouse where a guy named John Dickinson used to live. There is a John \nDickinson high school in Delaware, which was named after him. He was \nalso a guy who was involved in the Constitutional Congress and also \ninvolved in the Declaration of Independence, and the penman of the \nRevolution. So if you think about it, there at the Golden Fleece \nTavern, the Constitution was ratified. Caesar Rodney, from Dover, \ndeparting from not far from there, casts the tie-breaking vote for the \nDeclaration of Independence, and the penman of the Revolution, growing \nup in what is now the Dickinson plantation. There is a lot of history \nthere, especially for a State that doesn't have a national park.\n  Mr. COONS. Although we have a senior Senator who is tireless in his \neffective advocacy of our State.\n  Mr. CARPER. Maybe we can do something about that with the Senator's \nhelp and that of Congressman Carney, and our colleagues in the Senate \nand the House--and maybe including the Presiding Officer from North \nCarolina. In closing, believe it or not, the economic value of national \nparks is actually charged for every one of our States.\n  The most visited sites in the United States among tourists from \nforeign countries are our national parks. The economic value to the \nState of North Carolina--I was told last year--from\n\n[[Page S8406]]\n\ntheir national parks was $700 million. Not bad.\n  Mr. COONS. If I might, later today we are having our first Delaware \nDay reception in one of the Senate buildings. It is a way for us to \npromote and celebrate what is great about Delaware.\n  One of the things I treasure most about Delaware is our unique \npolitical culture--a culture that focuses on consensus, on reasoned \ncompromise, on bringing folks together across from what is, in some \nother places, a sharp partisan divide to find reasonable, principled \npaths forward to tackling the challenges that face our State. It is \nthat consensus, commonsense approach I know my senior Senator brought \nto his two terms as Governor and has brought to the Senate. Our \nCongressman, who was on national television this morning with a \nRepublican cosponsor of an initiative, has also made that a hallmark of \nhis tenure. I know our Governor has as well.\n  I wanted to suggest that one of the things that makes Delaware \nunique, special, valued, and first isn't just our agricultural \nproducts, it isn't just our great and enjoyable food products, and it \nisn't just our unique history in the beginning of our country but it is \nalso how we continue to find ways to build bridges across the divide \nthat so many Americans watch us in the Congress wrestling with at this \nmoment and that I think, in our home State, we have managed to find a \ngood path forward.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, we call this the Delaware way. As my \ncolleague from Delaware knows, whenever I run into people who have been \nmarried a long time--50, 60, 70 years--I ask them what is the secret to \nbeing married so many years. They give some funny answers, but they \nalso give some very pointed answers. One of the best answers I have \nheard--and I hear it over and over--as the reason why they have been \nmarried such a long time is because of the two Cs. I say: What are the \ntwo Cs? They say, ``Communicate and compromise.''\n  I would suggest that is what we do pretty well in our State. It is \nnot only good advice for creating an enduring marriage, but it would \nalso be good advice for us in this body, in this town, to do a better \njob--both parties--at communicating and compromising. We show, I think \nevery day, in our State, if we do those things, take that seriously, \nthe result is pretty good. We could get a better result here if we keep \nthat in mind.\n  With that, I think we have said our piece. It is Delaware Day, one \nmore time, and may the spirit of Delaware and the Delaware way permeate \nthis place as well.\n  I have enjoyed being with my friend and colleague in this colloquy.\n  Mr. COONS. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8406-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8406-S8407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF RICHARD CORDRAY\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have come to the floor on numerous \noccasions this year to discuss the distressed state of America's middle \nclass. In fact, in our committee, we have had a series of hearings \nlooking at the state of the middle class and what is happening to the \nmiddle class in America. In recent decades, our Nation's once secure \nmiddle class has struggled in the face of stagnant wages, declining job \nsecurity, rising indebtedness, and disappearing pensions, not to \nmention sharply higher costs for health care, education, food, and \nenergy.\n  It wasn't always this way. In the three decades after World War II, \nAmerica's middle class grew rapidly. Incomes rose steadily as the \nmiddle class secured its fair share of the expanding national wealth. \nThe Federal Government invested generously in infrastructure building, \ninnovation, and education, vastly expanding opportunity for people to \nmove into the middle class. America became a more equal, fair, and just \nsociety, built on a solid bedrock of a strong middle class.\n  I am an example of that. My father had an eighth grade education. He \nwas a coal miner. My mother was an immigrant with very little formal \neducation. Yet their three children were able to go to good schools, \nget good jobs, and get an education. All three of their children \ngraduated from Iowa State University, a great land grant college, \nbecause it didn't cost very much and we could afford to go there and we \nwere able to enter the middle class from those humble beginnings.\n  But beginning in the 1970s, much of that progress started to come to \na halt. Our manufacturing base declined, and the U.S. economy became \nincreasingly dominated by financial markets and Wall Street--a trend \nthat was accelerated by ill-advised deregulation. Soaring profits and \nsky-high salaries attracted more of our Nation's best and brightest to \npursue careers in finance at the expense of engineering, teaching, and \npublic service.\n\n  Wall Street bankers were emboldened by deregulation. They were \nincentivized by huge salaries and bonuses to take ever greater risks, \nand they devised ever more exotic and risky investment schemes. As we \nall know, in 2008, this frenzy of greed and recklessness culminated in \nthe catastrophic meltdown of our Nation's financial system. This \neconomic crisis was a hammer blow to our already struggling middle \nclass. The value of Americans' homes and retirement accounts plummeted, \nmillions lost their jobs or were forced into foreclosure, and hopes for \nthe future dimmed.\n  In the wake of this financial crash, with its pervasive damage to the \nmiddle class, the American people demanded action to rein in the worst \nabuses of Wall Street and to prevent a replay of 2008. This led to the \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act--let me \nrepeat that, the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act--the \nmost sweeping reform of our financial system since the Great \nDepression. For hundreds of millions of American consumers in their \neveryday lives, no aspect of this law is more important and \ntransformative than the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau. Again, read the words of the legislation. It is the Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act. Therefore, a big part of the bill \nwas to build in consumer protections, and one of those was to create \nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  I have come to the floor in strong support of the nomination of \nRichard Cordray to be Director of this Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau. The idea behind this bureau is very simple. We need a cop on \nthe beat looking out for the best interests of consumers who use \nfinancial products, just as we have regulators looking out for the \nfinancial health of banks.\n  A strong Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will ensure consumers \nare not lured into debt through hidden fees, for example. It will \nsimplify disclosures and reduce paperwork so consumers aren't faced \nwith mountains of paperwork they can't understand. It will oversee \nproviders of consumer credit, such as payday lenders, which for years \nhave acted like banks without facing any kind of banking regulation. \nAdditionally, as student debt surpasses credit card debt as the largest \nsource of consumer debt--which has already happened, by the way, that \nstudent debt right now is larger than credit card debt--this Consumer \nProtection Bureau can play a critical role in helping families better \nunderstand the increasing challenges of facing a college education and \nfinancing it as well as bringing some sanity to the private student \nloan marketplace.\n  Finally, a key function of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nwill also provide help to our veterans through the Office of Service \nMember Affairs. Sadly, too often our servicemembers fall victim to \nabusive financial traps upon their return home. The Bureau has made an \noutstanding choice for leadership of this office with the selection of \nMrs. Hollister Petraeus. But cynically, my Republican colleagues have \nchosen to protect the unscrupulous lenders that prey on military \nfamilies. They would rather neuter the entire agency, have no Director, \nthan to fully empower Mrs. Petraeus to protect military personnel and \ntheir families from all forms of predatory lending activities.\n\n[[Page S8407]]\n\n  These steps are essential elements of helping to tilt the scales of \nour economy back into balance so that once again we put the interests \nof the 99 percent of Americans who use financial products ahead of the \n1 percent who profit from them.\n  I was deeply disappointed when our Republican colleagues voted \nagainst the Wall Street reform bill that should have been \noverwhelmingly a bipartisan bill. But now the bill is law, and guess \nwhat. My Republican friends are doing everything in their power to \nprevent it from doing its important job.\n  Earlier this year, 44 Republican Senators served notice that they \nwould not confirm anyone--let me repeat, they would not confirm \nanyone--to the position of Director unless structural changes are made \nto the Bureau that would effectively take away its ability to stand up \nfor consumers. The changes they have demanded are unfair and \nunreasonable. No other independent financial regulator has its rules \nsubject to veto by other regulatory agencies. To suggest that the only \nregulator with a primary mission to protect everyday hard-working \nAmericans should face unprecedented levels of oversight simply does not \nmake sense. Once again, the Republicans have brazenly put the interests \nof Wall Street, payday lenders, and unscrupulous mortgage lenders ahead \nof the interests of Main Street consumers.\n  To restore the American economy to its place, we need a financial \nsystem that works for them. This means a financial system where \nconsumers choose services based on a full and transparent understanding \nof the costs of those services. But absent a Director, the Consumer \nFinance Protection Bureau won't be able to supervise payday lenders, \ndebt collectors, or private student lenders. They won't be able to make \nit easier for the good actors in the financial system--our community \nbanks, for example, or our credit unions--to compete against those who \nare making a large profit by unfairly taking advantage of unsuspecting \nconsumers.\n  Richard Cordray is a superb choice to serve as the first Director of \nthis Bureau. As attorney general of Ohio, he was a strong and fair \nadvocate for consumers. His work has earned him the endorsement of \nbankers, CEOs, and civil rights leaders across the State of Ohio. He is \na public servant of the highest caliber who deserves to be given the \nopportunity to lead this critically important Bureau.\n  As a matter of fundamental fairness to hard-working Americans on Main \nStreet, we need an effective, evenhanded Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau. Mr. Cordray deserves the opportunity to lead this new Bureau.\n  I call upon my Republican colleagues, at long last, to put the \ninterests of consumers ahead of the interests of those whose reckless \npursuit of profits and bonuses have caused so much harm to our society \nand economy. I call upon my Republican colleagues to ignore the legions \nof Wall Street lobbyists who are urging them to disable and, if \npossible, kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  Richard Cordray is a dedicated and impartial public servant who will \nput the best interests of American consumers first. We should give him \nthat opportunity. I hope my colleagues will join me in strongly \nsupporting his nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8407-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8407-S8408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, we are now as a country squarely in the \nmiddle of the Obama economy. It is a period of slow growth, \npersistently high unemployment, with many potential workers having \nabandoned the playing field and simply given up looking for work.\n  There is a growing awareness among our countrymen that the policies \nof President Obama--the policies enacted during the first 2 years of \nhis administration under Democratic supermajorities--have made matters \nworse.\n  We have legitimate disagreements in this Capitol concerning the \nsolutions to the problems we are experiencing with the Obama economy. \nMy colleagues and I on this side of the aisle would enact aggressive \nregulatory reform, an expansive energy policy, and we would vastly \nlimit the size and scope of the Federal Government. That is our plan, \nand it is a plan about which we could have genuine disagreements.\n  What I want to talk to my colleagues about today, though, is what I \nwould suggest is a manufactured dispute over this issue of the \nextension of the payroll tax. That is an issue on which really there is \na wide consensus on the Democratic side of the aisle, over here on the \nRepublican side, and down the hall in the other body.\n  The President said only a few months ago that it is not wise to raise \ntaxes on anyone during a recession. And we certainly are in a \nrecession. In recent weeks, the President has suggested that perhaps he \nhas abandoned this position and changed his mind and that we should \nperhaps raise taxes on some people even though we are still in a \nrecession. But Republicans have consistently agreed with what the \nPresident said earlier: We are in a recession, and this is no time to \nraise taxes on anyone. This means we shouldn't raise taxes on the \nworking poor. It means we shouldn't raise taxes on employees working on \nthe assembly line or working in the retail sector. It means we should \nnot raise taxes on job creators. We should not raise taxes on investors \non whom we depend to provide the capital to create jobs. We shouldn't \nraise taxes on anybody because we are in a time of recession.\n  Let's put this into a historical context. Last December, at a time \nwhen Democrats still had supermajorities over here in the Senate, when \nSpeaker Pelosi was still in charge in the House of Representatives with \nher majority there, this Congress on a bipartisan basis enacted \nlegislation to keep in place the Bush-era tax cuts, to leave those \nrates in place for all Americans at whatever income level, and we also \non a bipartisan basis enacted a cut in the payroll tax. This is the \nSocial Security tax that all workers pay regardless of income, the so-\ncalled FICA taxes that you see on your pay stubs. Last December, that \ntax cut dropped the payroll tax for employees from 6.2 percent to 4.2 \npercent. I supported that. Republicans and Democrats supported that. It \nis up for renewal, and there is a huge majority of Members of the House \nand Senate who want to renew that. The distinguished majority leader, \nSenator Reid, however, has suggested that not only do we keep the lower \nrate of 4.2 percent rather than 6.2 but we actually lower that FICA tax \nto 3.1 percent.\n  We can have an extension of the current FICA tax rate. Democrats know \nit, the White House knows it, and the Republican conference knows it. \nBut one problem must be addressed, and I think both parties want to \naddress this: We need to offset the cost to the Social Security trust \nfund of these lower payroll tax rates. Why do we need to do this? \nBecause when the law says we are really supposed to be taking in 6.2 \npercent and putting that in the trust fund to make the Social Security \nProgram as solvent as possible and we lower that to 4.2 percent or to \nless, as the majority leader wants to do, it amounts to a drain on the \nSocial Security system. I think the last thing we want to do with a \nweak system, which we know can't come out in the end, is to put further \npressure on the Social Security trust fund. So both parties have \nproposed to offset, or pay for, a continuation of the payroll tax cuts.\n  Last week, the White House unveiled a digital clock at the top of its \nWeb site that counts down to the date when the payroll tax cuts will \nexpire at the end of the year. This somehow suggests that someone in \nthis town wants the payroll tax to go back up to 6.2 percent. This is \npure political gamesmanship. We can have a bipartisan solution to keep \nthe payroll tax at 4.2 percent, but we must pay for it.\n  The distinguished majority leader, Senator Reid, had a proposal last \nweek not only to lower the payroll tax to 3.1 percent but to pay for it \nby raising taxes on someone else. This violates what the President said \nseveral months ago: We don't need to raise taxes on anyone.\n  We can pay for a continuation of this, as Republicans have proposed \nto do, by offsetting it with smart spending cuts, a freeze in Federal \npay, a reduction in the Federal workforce, and means testing of some \nbenefits at the upper income levels. We proposed this\n\n[[Page S8408]]\n\nlast week, but it was shot down by the majority in this body with, to \nme, a contrived plan to actually lower the payroll tax and shift those \ntaxes to someone else.\n\n  We are told that this week, just like last week, we are going to have \nsome more political theater. The majority leader will propose once \nagain a tax increase on others so that we can keep this payroll tax \ncut, and we will propose a side-by-side which is essentially the pay-\nfor plan to keep the tax rate as it is. Both of these will fail because \nthe majority leader intends for them to fail, and essentially we will \nhave wasted 2 weeks at the end of this session of Congress by creating \na manufactured disagreement for the sake of scoring political points.\n  Maybe after we get this week over with and we have had yet another \nweek of gamesmanship, the Senate can get down to the business of \npassing a simple extension of the payroll rates in their current form \nand to offset that action with savings. There is an absolute majority \nin the Senate and in the House to do just that. In doing so, we can end \n3 weeks of political theater with the Democrats trying to score points \nfor 2012.\n  I wish we could fast-forward to next week and get this important \npiece of legislation done and enact a continuation of the payroll taxes \nthat a vast majority of Republicans and Democrats support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse).

Mr. President, last week I came to the floor and urged \nall of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together in a \ncommonsense, bipartisan way and extend for a significant period of time \nthe very important National Flood Insurance Program. That program, \nwhich is essential to the country, involves a lot of properties \nessential to real estate closings, to allow that important part of our \neconomy to happen as we struggle to get out of this recession. That \nprogram would otherwise expire 1 week from this Friday.\n  I also wrote Senator Reid that same day, as I came to the floor, \nurging him to support this legislation, extending this vital program, \nto be passed quickly, hopefully unanimously, through the Senate.\n  The good news is that I have reached out to many folks--Democrats and \nRepublicans--since then, and we have continued to build consensus to do \nthat, to make sure there is no threat of the National Flood Insurance \nProgram lapsing yet again, as it did, unfortunately, four times in \n2010--no good reason--for a total of 53 days. Every time that happens \nor is even threatened to happen, within a few days there is great chaos \nand uncertainty in the real estate market. Good closings are put off. \nOur economy slows down for no good reason, as we need every closing in \nsight to do exactly the opposite and to improve the economy. Again, the \ngood news is that we have built consensus, and I think we have reached \nconsensus to avoid that sort of lapse. So I return to the floor today \nto get that formally done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. 1958, my bill, to extend the National Flood \nInsurance Program well into next year, to May 31, which I introduced \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1958) to extend the National Flood Insurance \n     Program until May 31, 2012.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I know of no further debate on this \nmeasure. I will have a few closing comments after we formally pass it, \nbut I urge its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The bill (S. 1958) was passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1958\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Program Extension.--Section 1319 of the National Flood \n     Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4026) is amended by striking \n     ``September 30, 2011'' and inserting ``May 31, 2012''.\n       (b) Financing.--Section 1309(a) of the National Flood \n     Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4016(a)) is amended by \n     striking ``September 30, 2011'' and inserting ``May 31, \n     2012''.\n       (c) Repeal.--The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2012 \n     (Public Law 112-36; 125 Stat. 386) is amended by striking \n     section 130.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, in closing, I thank everyone, on both \nsides of the aisle, who worked in a very commonsense way to get this \ndone. Again, sort of the worst case scenario is what we all experienced \nin 2010. Four different times in 2010 the program actually lapsed, a \ntotal of 53 days. More times than that it came within a few days of \nlapsing and created great uncertainty in the real estate market.\n  We do not need any of that. We have been trying to struggle out of a \nrecession and a very bad economy which has been led by a real estate \ndownturn. We need every good closing we can get. Giving the market this \ncertainty over a week before it would otherwise expire is very good as \nwe try to create that certainty and build a better economic climate.\n  I am happy we came together in a commonsense bipartisan way to extend \nthe National Flood Insurance Program, as is, to May 31. Let me also say \nin closing I strongly support a full 6-year reauthorization of the \nprogram. I have worked on that bill with many others in the relevant \nSenate committee, the Senate Banking Committee. We have reported a good \nbill out of committee. I want to get that to the Senate floor and merge \nit and compromise it in some reasonable way with the House \nreauthorization.\n  We need a full-blown 6-year reauthorization of the program with \nsignificant reforms. That was obviously not going to happen between now \nand a week from Friday. It is obviously not going to happen a month or \ntwo into the new year. So we needed to create the certainty this \nextension will create as we continue to work on that full \nreauthorization.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to urge \nmy colleagues to support legislation to extend and expand the payroll \ntax cut on which middle-class families across America depend. Last week \nDemocrats brought a bill to the floor that would have not only \naccomplished this goal for our workers, it would have also cut the \npayroll tax for half of our Nation's employers and eliminated it \nentirely for businesses who were making new hires.\n  To pay for this proposal, Democrats proposed a small surtax on \nmillionaires and billionaires; that is, people who are earning more \nthan $1 million a year. In order to extend and expand the critical tax \nbreak for middle-class families and small businesses owners, we thought \nit right to call on the wealthiest among us--those who can afford it--\nto pay just a little bit more at a time when a vast majority of \nAmericans are struggling.\n  Our bill set up a choice, and we thought it was an easy one: Do you \nvote to extend critical tax cuts for middle-class families or do you \nvote to protect the wealthiest Americans from paying one penny more \ntoward their fair share?\n\n[[Page S8409]]\n\n  Unfortunately, almost every Senate Republican chose to side with the \nrichest Americans and filibuster our middle-class tax cut bill. In a \nsurprising development, their leadership's own bill to simply extend \nthe middle-class tax cuts while protecting the wealthiest Americans was \nopposed by the majority of Republicans.\n  Republicans spent months on the Joint Select Committee on Deficit \nReduction saying that the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans should \nbe made permanent, that the wealthiest Americans and biggest \ncorporations should get even deeper tax cuts, the tax cuts for the rich \nshould not be paid for and should be simply added to the deficit, and \nthat a pledge made to a Republican lobbyist named Grover Norquist gave \nthem no choice but to support tax cut extensions.\n  So I have to say I am truly disappointed to see, once again, that \nthis apparent concern for tax cuts only seems to extend to millionaires \nand billionaires. Now that a break for the middle class is on the verge \nof ending in a few short weeks--potentially causing deep harm to our \nweak economy--those Republicans who fought tooth and nail for tax cuts \nfor the rich are nowhere to be found. In fact, many of them are \nactively opposing it.\n  Republicans seem to be operating under the backwards economic \nprinciple that only tax cuts for the richest Americans and biggest \ncorporations are worth fighting for. In fact, they have a name for that \ngroup of people. They call them the job creators. They believe the only \nones who create jobs in America are the rich, and they claim the tax \ncuts and loopholes they fight for that benefit the wealthy will somehow \ntrickle down to the rest of us.\n  Well, that is wrong. We know the Republican economic policy has \nfailed us. It was this kind of thinking that turned a surplus into a \ndeficit, that brought our economy to its knees, that failed our middle \nclass and allowed the wealthiest Americans to amass record fortunes, \npaying the lowest tax rates in decades. It is the wrong way to go. \nAmericans know it and our country has the scars to prove it.\n  A constituent of mine named Nick Hanauer recently published an op-ed \nin Bloomberg Businessweek that speaks to this point exceptionally well. \nNick is a businessman. He is a venture capitalist in Seattle. He helped \nto launch more than 20 companies, including amazon.com, and he has a \ndeep understanding of 21st-century jobs and the innovation economy.\n  Nick wrote that it is not tax cuts for the rich that create jobs--and \nI want to quote him. He says:\n\n       Only consumers can set in motion a virtuous cycle that \n     allows companies to survive and thrive and business owners to \n     hire. An ordinary middle-class consumer is far more of a job \n     creator than I ever have been or ever will be.\n\n  He advocates ending the tax breaks for the rich and using some of \nthat savings to give average working families a break and put more \nmoney in their pockets. Nick's logic is clear, and it makes economic \nsense. It is in line with what the American public believes, and it is \nexactly why this middle-class tax cut needs to pass.\n  So while I strongly supported our last bill that would have extended \nand expanded this tax cut on both workers and employers, it was clear \nthat Republicans were not going to drop their filibuster. So we are \nback now with a compromise.\n  Republicans claim to be concerned that our bill was too big, so we \nscaled it back. They didn't like the surcharge on the wealthiest \nAmericans, so we cut it down significantly and we made it temporary. To \nmake it even more acceptable, we included spending cuts that both sides \nsaid were acceptable as well as their proposal to make millionaires \nineligible to receive unemployment insurance and food stamps.\n  The compromise that is before us is fully paid for. It extends and \nexpands payroll tax relief for millions of middle-class families in our \ncountry. It will create jobs and provide a critical boost for this \neconomy at a time when we desperately need it.\n  So I continue hoping that our Republican colleagues will be as \nfocused on tax cuts for the middle class as they are for the wealthiest \nAmericans and largest corporations. I hope they stand with us to pass \nthis critical legislation in time for the holidays because that is what \nAmerican families want.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow we will be voting on whether to \nclose debate on the nomination of Richard Cordray as Director of the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. This vote can be framed in terms \nof his qualifications, but that would be a mistake because folks on \nboth sides of the aisle have noted he is exceptionally qualified for \nthis position. He is a graduate of Michigan State University, of Oxford \nUniversity, and the University of Chicago Law School, where he was \neditor in chief of the University of Chicago Law Review.\n  In addition, he has held a number of public positions with honor and \ndistinction as State representative, as Ohio's treasurer, as Ohio \nattorney general. Indeed, as Ohio's attorney general, he was an \naggressive advocate for consumers. He recovered more than $2 billion \nfor Ohio's retirees, investors and business owners and took major steps \nto help protect its consumers from fraudulent foreclosures and \nfinancial predators. What a terrific resume. He is an individual who \nhas stood up for retirees, business owners, and investors. He has said \nfraud will not be tolerated. We will seek it out and we will penalize \nit and we will end it. In other words, it is exactly the resume of \nsomeone we would want to head a consumer financial protection \ndepartment or division or bureau.\n  Why are we voting tomorrow to end debate? Why don't we just have a \nunanimous consent agreement that we go to a final vote? The answer is, \nmy colleagues across the aisle are objecting. They are objecting to a \nvote on his nomination not because he isn't qualified but because they \nwant to prevent this agency from doing its job: protecting America's \nfamilies against predators. I cannot think of many issues that are so \nimportant to the success of our families as making sure they are not \nsubject to financial predators. Yet my colleagues across the aisle are \nopposing this nomination in order to protect the predators preying on \nAmerica's families. That is just plain wrong. I hope they will change \ntheir position before tomorrow.\n  Let's turn the clock back to 2003. In 2003, a new type of mortgage \nwas invented in the United States. This was a mortgage that had a 2-\nyear teaser rate--a very favorable, low rate--so as to serve as the \nbait for mortgage originators to say to their clients: This is the best \nmortgage for you because it has the lowest rate. But what the \noriginators didn't tell their clients was that after 2 years, that rate \nexploded to a very high interest rate--a predatory rate--and they \ncouldn't get out of the mortgage because the mortgage had a little \nsentence in it that said they have to pay a huge penalty if they try to \nrefinance this mortgage. That penalty was 5 or 10 percent of the value \nof the loan. Show me a working family in America who buys a house, puts \ndown their downpayment, makes their repairs, gets moved in, and still \nhas 10 percent of the value of the house sitting in the bank, able to \npay a penalty so they can get to a fair interest rate after the \ninterest rate explodes.\n  So this new mortgage turned the humble, amortizing, family mortgage \nthat had been the pathway for the middle class, for millions of \nAmerican families, into a predatory trap that destroyed families and \nthat created a lot of wealth for the 1 percent who run the system in \nour society. Have no doubt, that 1 percent got in, in every possible \nway. They said: Let's package these predatory mortgages and sell them \nand then let's take pieces of those packages and combine them with \npieces of other security packages and resell them and then let's \ndevelop a brandnew insurance industry that insures securities. This \ninsurance is what is often called credit default swaps or derivatives, \nwhich are fancy names for insurance on\n\n[[Page S8410]]\n\nthese packages and mortgages. So then they said let's thereby make them \nvery attractive to pension funds and investors across the world. This \nwas so successful that those who were buying the mortgages were willing \nto pay a huge bonus to the mortgage originators to steer families away \nfrom the very successful, humble, amortizing, fixed-rate mortgage into \nthis predatory, exploding interest rate mortgage, all the time posing \nas the family's counselor, saying it is my job to do what is best for \nyou.\n  Why did this predatory practice in 2003, that grew enormously over \nthe next 4 years, continue to go on? What happened to oversight of \nfairness, and what happened to the agency that was supposed to shut \ndown predatory practices? That agency was the Federal Reserve and the \nFederal Reserve is a very powerful organization. The Federal Reserve \nhas two responsibilities: employment and monetary policy. Those are the \ntraditional responsibilities, but they were given a third, which is \nconsumer protection. Somewhere in that vast, powerful agency on the \nupper floor, the head of the Federal Reserve and his key advisers were \nhard at work on monetary policy, deciding what interest rates they \nwould lend to our major banks, and they were hard at work, we would \nhope, on the employment side as well. But they seemed to have forgotten \nthey were also responsible for consumer protection. That mission was \nset aside. It was put down in the basement of the building and the \nlights were turned off and the doors locked and they did absolutely \nnothing about these predatory practices that were destroying the \nfinances of millions of Americans, that were betraying the fundamental \nrelationship between a family and its trusted mortgage originator who \nwas getting bonus payments for steering them into these loans. They did \nabsolutely nothing about a number of other predatory practices.\n  That is why the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created. It \ndoesn't have other responsibilities to distract it. It isn't going to \ntake the fate and success of our families and lock that mission down in \nthe basement and turn out the lights because this is the heart of why \nthis bureau exists.\n  This vote tomorrow is about whether we believe in the family value of \nfair deals that build the success of our families or whether we believe \nin the 1 percent exercising full predatory practices to destroy the \nfinancial lives of Americans, destroy the financial lives of our \nveterans for standing up for us in war and who are often a highly \ntargeted group when it comes to these types of mortgage practices and \nthese types of payday practices.\n  This is an important vote tomorrow. It is not a vote about the \nqualifications of the nominee because the nominee has the right set of \nskills to be highly qualified in a number of directions. It is a vote \nabout whether, in America, one believes it should be OK to be a \npredator or not OK. I believe it is not OK. I believe States and the \nFederal Government should do all they can to make sure deals are fair, \nto make sure there are not conflicts of interest, to make sure there \nare not payments that are undisclosed to a customer, to make sure there \nare not hidden clauses to convince customers by their trusted advisers \nto sign documents which cause the destruction of families' financial \nlives over the next 10 to 20 years as a result of that trust. Fairness \nmatters to the success of our families.\n  We should have a unanimous vote tomorrow to end this debate and get \non to the final vote of whether to confirm a very distinguished and \ncapable and honorable man who is prepared to fight for the success of \nAmerican families.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8410-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8410-S8411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr President, I would like to express my support for the \nMenendez amendment, which passed 100 to 0 and would sanction the \nCentral Bank of Iran. I was proud to be an original cosponsor of this \nimportant legislation. The Islamic Republic of Iran has proven through \nits recent behavior its blatant disregard for its international \ncommitments to the IAEA and for the universal declaration of human \nrights. Iran is a serious threat to the security of the United States, \nthe Middle East, and the world.\n  Last month's IAEA report on Iran said that the Agency had credible \ninformation that Iran may have worked on developing nuclear weapons. \nThis is the most damning report yet on Iran's nuclear program and has \nserved as a wake up call to the world. The United Kingdom has responded \nwith tough sanctions. Italy and France have expressed support for \ntougher measures.\n  This opinion has been held by many here in the Senate for a long \ntime. That is why we in the Senate have been so persistent in our \nefforts to pursue tougher sanctions to isolate Iran. This is why we \ncontinue to strive to provide all the tools necessary to ensure that \nmaximum pressure is brought to bear on the regime in Tehran.\n  I appreciate the administration's efforts to engage with the Iranian \nregime since coming into office. The administration has made serious \nefforts to diplomatically engage Tehran officials. But the regime has \nrejected requests by the United States and international community for \ntrue dialog. Regretfully, I do not think dialog will work with this \nregime.\n  The IAEA report was a culmination to months of events that showed \nIran's brazen disregard for international norms. In October, the regime \nplanned to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador to the United States. The \nIranian regime sought to kill a senior foreign official on U.S. soil.\n  There must be consequences for the planned attack on the Saudi \nAmbassador. There must be consequences for Iran's nuclear conduct as \nevidenced in the new IAEA report. This amendment makes these \nconsequences clear.\n  I am concerned that the administration's November 21 sanctions \nresponse is not adequate in responding to this new information on \nIran's intentions. European countries, led by the United Kingdom and \nFrance, have called for sanctioning of the Central Bank of Iran. My \nquestion to the administration is this: does the IAEA report indeed \nreflect a turning point for U.S. policy? And if so, what should the \nUnited States do to address this looming threat? The administration's \nannouncement of new sanctions on November 21 is a good step, but the \nUnited States must take this one step further and sanction Iran's \nCentral Bank. If the IAEA report does not indicate that we have turned \na corner with respect to this critical national security threat, I \ndon't know what does.\n  This administration has taken unprecedented measures to isolate the \nIranian regime. It understands the threat posed by a nuclear Iran. And \nwhile I appreciate the administration's focus on this issue at this \ncritical juncture in history, I believe that we must do more.\n  This amendment would restrict U.S. financial institutions from doing \nbusiness with any foreign financial institution that knowingly conducts \nfinancial transactions with Iran's Central Bank. With this amendment, \nwe are hitting Iran where it hurts. Eighty percent of Iran's hard \ncurrency comes from crude oil sales, which depend on transactions \nthrough the Central Bank. The Central Bank of Iran is complicit in \nIran's nuclear program. This amendment also has measures that would \nensure that the oil markets are not affected by isolation of the \nIranian oil industry. The amendment also requires the President to \nstart a ``multilateral diplomacy initiative'' to convince other \ncountries to cease oil imports from Iran.\n  It has become increasingly clear in the past month that the \ninternational community cannot negotiate with the current leadership in \nIran, which has proven incapable and unwilling to abide by its \ninternational commitments. This was made crystal clear by the planned \nattack on the Saudi Ambassador, credible evidence of illegal nuclear \nactivity in the IAEA report, and the attack on the British Embassy. I \nbelieve that we have turned a corner in how we should regard this \nregime in Iran.\n  This means that in addition to severe sanctions, the United States \nshould renew its support for democratic activists in Iran. Amid the \nremarkable change taking place across the region, the United States \nshould clearly place itself on the side of democratic forces in Iran. \nCompromise with the current regime is not possible, and we, working \nwith the international community, should work to engage fully with the \ndemocratic actors in the country.\n\n[[Page S8411]]\n\nThose who ransacked the British Embassy do not represent the Iranian \npeople. The majority of Iranians, based on the outpouring of support \nfor the Green Movement in 2009, aspire for a different future.\n  We have reached a pivotal moment, and we must stand on the right side \nof history. We must do all that we can to prevent Iran from gaining a \nnuclear weapon. I am proud to have cosponsored the Menendez amendment \nsanctioning the Central Bank of Iran. We must make it clear that there \nare substantial consequences to Iran's nuclear intentions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8411-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8411-S8412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL LOREN M. RENO\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nexceptional leader, superb officer, and friend, LTG Loren M. Reno, the \ndeputy chief of staff, logistics, installations and mission support for \nthe Air Force, as he prepares to retire after more than 38 years of \ndedicated and distinguished service to our Nation.\n  General Reno is a consummate professional and, truly, the most \nhumble, genuine general officer whom I have had the pleasure of working \nwith during my years in the Senate. Thankfully, I have had the \nopportunity to get to know him very well. We worked closely together \nduring his two tours at the Air Logistics Center in Oklahoma City, and \nthat relationship continued during his time back on the Air Force \nstaff.\n  General Reno accomplishments over his 38-year career have been \nremarkable. He is a senior navigator with more than 2,500 flying hours \nin the C-9, C-130, T-29, and T-43 aircraft, a master maintainer with \nover 24 years experience keeping the Air Force flying, and an \naccomplished leader of airmen. General Reno commanded two aircraft \nmaintenance squadrons, a technical training group, and the Defense Fuel \nSupply and Defense Energy Support Centers, and, of course, the Oklahoma \nCity Air Logistics Center at Tinker Air Force Base, OK.\n  A native of Port Jefferson, NY, General Reno graduated from \nCedarville University in Ohio in 1970 and spent 4 years teaching middle \nschool science before attending Officer Training School. After earning \nhis commission from OTS as the distinguished graduate and his initial \ntraining where he was also the distinguished graduate, he was assigned \nto the 21st Tactical Airlift Squadron in the Philippines. It was from \nthere that he flew missions into Saigon, Vietnam, at the close of the \nwar in 1975. His prowess as a navigator earned him selection to attend \ninstructor training at Mather Air Force Base, CA, in 1978, where he \nonce again graduated as a distinguished graduate. His subsequent \nperformance as an instructor earned him the award as the Instructor \nNavigator of the Year in 1979.\n  Next, General Reno worked in legislative affairs on the Air Staff in \nthe Pentagon and then for Air Mobility Command from 1981 to 1985. \nFollowing his staff tour, General Reno moved to Dyess Air Force Base, \nTX, in 1985 where he continued to shine on the ground and in the air as \nthe chief navigator for the 773rd Tactical Airlift Squadron. It was \nduring this assignment that he left the navigator career field and \ncross-trained as an aircraft maintenance officer. In 1987, General Reno \ntook command of the 463rd Avionics Maintenance Squadron and then the \n463rd Field Maintenance Squadron there at Dyess. After Air War College, \nhe moved back to the Air Staff from 1990 to 1992, working as a program \nmanager and as the chief of maintenance policy for the Air Force.\n  After two years in the Pentagon, General Reno moved back to Texas, \nthis time to Sheppard Air Force Base, where he commanded the 396th \nTechnical Training Group and the 82nd Training Group before moving to \nFort Belvoir, VA, to work in the Defense Logistics Agency from 1994 to \n1998 in positions of increasing responsibility, working on joint \nlogistics for contingency operations and strategic programming, before \nbeing selected as the commander of the Defense Fuel Supply Center and \nDefense Energy Support Center.\n  Upon the completion of his command at the DLA in 1998, General Reno \nmoved to my home State of Oklahoma to work at the Oklahoma City Air \nLogistics Center. While there, he was promoted to brigadier general and \nappointed as the center's deputy commander. After his first Oklahoma \ntour, General Reno returned to Scott Air Force Base in 2002 as the \ndirector of logistics for air mobility command. In this capacity, he \nwas responsible for developing policy logistics plans for 14 major \nactive air installations in the United States and 17 locations \nthroughout the world. It was also in this position that General Reno \nwas selected for his second star.\n  After this, General Reno returned to the DLA, where he served as the \nvice director and was responsible for providing logistics to the \nvarious military departments and combatant commands. We were able to \nget him back to Oklahoma in 2007 when he returned to command the \nOklahoma City Air Logistics Center, where he provided maintenance for \nthe Air Force's KC-135s, B-1, and B-52s, as well as numerous types of \naircraft engines while also commanding Tinker Air Force Base. He also \nhelped shepherd through one of the biggest growth opportunities for the \nbase by working with the local community to acquire an abandoned \nautomotive plant that was located adjacent to the base. The new \nfacility vastly increased the base's ability to accomplish the Air \nForce's depot maintenance mission and ushered in an era of new \npossibilities for Oklahoma City and the Air Force. It is this kind of \nperformance that characterized General Reno's whole career.\n  Based on this performance, he was promoted to lieutenant general and \nsent back to the Pentagon in 2009 to be the Air Force's deputy chief of \nstaff for logistics, installations and mission support. During that \ntime Lieutenant General Reno's demonstrated a mastery of complex \nissues, decisive leadership, and dedication to both mission and people. \nHe advocated and defended over $30 billion annually in logistics and \ninstallation programs and developed long-range strategic guidance for \nAir Force weapons systems, facility sustainment, military construction, \nand contingency support to achieve national security objectives. He led \nthe Air Force's first-ever worldwide inventory of all nuclear \ncomponents at 581 sites. This epic venture allowed the Air Force to \nreestablish control of more than 34,000 items valued at $1.3 billion \nand was the first of many crucial logistics milestones needed to \nreinvigorate the nuclear enterprise, the Air Force's No. 1 priority. \nHis leadership was invaluable to the success of the $1 billion \nExpeditionary Combat Support System Program, the culmination of a \ndecade-long effort in developing and modernizing Air Force business \noperations that will ultimately save the Air Force $9 billion in supply \nchain costs.\n  Finally, as a hands-on leader and champion of airmen resiliency \ninitiatives, he was instrumental in the creation of the Air Force's \nDeployment Transition Center providing a critical, strategic, physical, \nemotional, and spiritual respite for thousands of airmen. He provided \nthe leadership and support to ensure outside-the-wire airmen are \nprovided an opportunity to decompress before they return to their home \nstation and families.\n  What I appreciate most about Loren is his dedication to others. He \ndoesn't have hobbies because he works for the benefit of everyone else. \nHe set aside hobbies like golf and instead made spending time with his \nchildren and wife his hobby. As a man of deep faith in Jesus, he \nsacrificed personally so he could give extravagantly to missions and to \nministry. Although General Reno's service in the Air Force will come to \nan end, his service to God, his family, and his country continues. I \ncan't wait to see what's next.\n  On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I thank \nLieutenant General Reno, his wife Karen, and their entire family for \ntheir extraordinary commitment, sacrifice, contribution, and dedication \nto this great Nation during his distinguished career in the U.S. Air \nForce. I congratulate him on the completion of an exemplary career and \nwish him, his wife Karen, and their family God's speed and continued \nsuccess and happiness in the future.\n\n[[Page S8412]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8412-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             RECOGNIZING OLD FARM CHRISTMAS PLACE OF MAINE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, December in Maine invokes the \nclassic images of Christmas. The wonders of children sledding down \nsnow-covered hills and small towns enveloped in December's darkness \nwhile illuminated by the glow of twinkling lights. One of the most \nmemorable parts of any Christmas celebration revolves around the \nselection and decoration of the perfect tree. Today I rise to commend \nand recognize the Old Farm Christmas Place of Maine, a small business \nthat allows families throughout the Nation to enjoy the tradition of \nselecting and cutting down their own Christmas tree.\n  The Old Farm Christmas Place of Maine, located in the coastal town of \nCape Elizabeth, opened in November of 2010. Jay Cox, the owner of Old \nFarm, purchased the historic Dyer-Hutchinson farmhouse in 2001. Built \nin 1790, the Old Farm stands as a testament to Maine's rich history and \nin 1997 was accepted into the National Registry of Historic Places. \nAfter substantial renovations to the historic property, Jay planted his \nfirst Christmas trees in the spring of 2004 on the 50-acre property. \nFinally, last year, with roughly 18,000 trees planted and 1,000 trees \nready to be sold, Jay opened up his winter wonderland.\n  This small business provides a unique tree-cutting venture and \ninvites families to experience the joy of selecting the perfect tree. \nAt Old Farm, this is a journey that begins with a wagon ride over the \nfarmland onto the fields where families can explore acres of the \nbeautiful farm until they find their ideal tree. Once this perfect tree \nis selected, they will assist you in cutting down the tree and loading \nit into your car or even delivering it to local areas throughout the \nState. Lastly, as Maine's winters can be frigid, families can finish \nthe experience warming themselves by the fire inside the Old Farm store \nwhile sipping delectable cider and rich hot chocolate.\n  Jay comes from a family of Christmas tree enthusiasts; his parents \nowned and operated Dun Roamin' Christmas Tree Farm in Cape Elizabeth \nfor 25 years. That farm now makes wreaths which are sold at the Old \nFarm Christmas Place store. The storefront also carries several locally \nmade Christmas decorations and ornaments to adorn households near and \nfar, adding a new element to the traditional tree farm selection.\n  As opening a small business is a daunting task, Jay Cox's dedication \nfor nearly a decade to open a Christmas tree farm and storefront \nreminiscent of old times and tradition is truly inspiring. I am proud \nto extend my congratulations to everyone at the Old Farm Christmas \nPlace of Maine for their tremendous efforts and offer my best wishes \nfor continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8412-2", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8412-S8413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:35 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1541.

A bill to provide incentives to create American jobs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my friend and \ncolleague Senator McCaskill, to introduce legislation we believe is \nessential to restoring growth and creating jobs in our economy.\n  Our bipartisan bill is comprised of proposals in four general \ncategories. First: taxes--we would protect American workers from \npayroll tax increases and preserve and provide new tax incentives for \nsmall business job creators to help spur job growth.\n  Second: infrastructure--we propose restoring and expanding funding to \nrebuild our nation's crumbling roads, bridges, and water treatment \nplants, adding jobs now and ensuring that the critical infrastructure \nneeded for long-term economic growth is properly maintained.\n  Third: sensible regulatory reform--we focus on cutting the tangle of \nred-tape that is holding businesses back from expanding and adding \njobs.\n  Fourth: job training--we propose fundamentally reforming the hodge-\npodge of Federal jobs training programs to focus on what really works. \nWe also propose extending the charitable deduction for books and \ncomputers.\n  We would offset the cost of these proposals with a 10-year, 2 percent \nsurtax on those with incomes of a million dollars or more, but with a \n``carve out'' to protect small business owner-operators: our nation's \njob creators.\n  Let me discuss these proposals in further detail. With respect to \ntaxes, Senator McCaskill and I believe that action must be taken \nquickly to extend the two percent payroll tax cut for employees that is \nscheduled to expire at the end of this month. Unless we do so, 159 \nmillion Americans will face a tax increase of up to $2,000 at a time \nwhen the economy is still weak. With so many American families \nstruggling to make ends meet, the last thing we ought to do is to allow \nan automatic tax increase to take effect in less than a month.\n  But keeping taxes steady won't be enough to get the economy going \nagain. If we want more jobs, we must do more. That is why Senator \nMcCaskill and I are proposing that the two percent payroll tax cut be \nextended to employers, too, on the first $10 million of payroll. This \ntargets small and medium-sized employers who have historically been the \nsource of our nation's job growth.\n  We also extend bonus depreciation and Section 179 expensing at the \ncurrent level, to encourage businesses to use this tax benefit to \ninvest in the tools American workers need to remain the best in the \nworld.\n  In the global competition for jobs, American workers go head-to-head \nwith workers from China, India, and other countries, who are paid far \nless than Americans, and whose working conditions would rightly be \nviewed as unacceptable here in the United States.\n  The middle-class, the source of America's economic strength, was \nbuilt by making sure American workers had the best tools in the world, \nso they would be the most productive workers in the world. Productivity \nand tools go hand-in-hand, and in the global competition for jobs, the \nworker with the best tools wins.\n  The provisions I have described will help businesses invest and keep \nthe American worker ahead of the global competition.\n  There are several other tax benefits in our package. One is an \ninnovative proposal that originated with Senators Mark Pryor and Scott \nBrown to generate investment in new high-tech companies. We all know \nhow dynamic these young companies can be--a decade ago, Google was a \nfledgling search engine and Facebook didn't even exist. Today, Google \nexecutes billions of searches every week, and Facebook has 800 million \nmembers, and growing. Both are valued at more than $100 billion, but \nmost important, both employ thousands of American workers.\n  But without the right investment at the right time, these two \ncompanies would not exist. Nor would many other companies in the high-\ntech field, or the millions of jobs they have created. The tax credit \nwe propose will help the high tech firms of the future get the support \nthey need to get off the ground, and become a part of the American \nstory.\n  It is also important to help established companies stay on the \ncutting edge by extending the Research and Development tax credit.\n  Before I go on to describe the other provisions of this bipartisan \njobs bill, I would like to explain further the small business ``carve \nout'' we built into our offset. Many on my side of the aisle have \nvoiced the concern that a surtax would fall on small businesses. I \nshare that concern. Most of our nation's small businesses are \nstructured as ``flow-through'' entities, such as ``subchapter S'' \ncorporations. These flow-through entities do not pay taxes directly, \nbut instead distribute their income to their owners, who then pay tax \non that income on their individual income tax returns.\n  To impose a surtax on this income as if it were the owners' personal \nincome would be a mistake--we would be raising taxes on our nation's \njob creators at the exact same time we are trying to get our nation's \njob engine started again.\n  If we ignore this reality, we risk taxing small businesses as if they \nare ``the wealthy.'' They are not.\n  We cannot impose higher taxes on flow-through income without taking \nmoney out of small businesses--money that is needed to help those small \nbusinesses invest and add jobs. That is why Senator McCaskill and I are \nproposing to ``carve out'' owner-operator small business income so it \nis not subject to the surtax.\n  The way we would accomplish this is to separate ``active business \nincome'' from ``passive business income,'' tracking the passive \nactivity rules of Section 469 of the tax code. Basically, this\n\n[[Page S8416]]\n\nmeans that business owner-operators who ``materially participate'' in \nthe running of their businesses will be protected from the surtax, \nwhile those who are passive investors will pay higher rates.\n  This is as it should be. Owner-operators are actively engaged in \nrunning their small businesses. They are on the front lines of our \neconomy, and of the communities in which they live. The pass-through \nincome that shows up on their tax returns is critical to their ability \nto finance investment, and grow their businesses. Left in their hands, \nthis income will lead to more jobs and buy the tools that make American \nworkers more productive.\n  Let me turn now to the other provisions of our bill.\n  With respect to infrastructure, our bill would provide $10 billion to \ncapitalize the U.S. Department of Transportation's State Infrastructure \nBank program. These banks are revolving loan funds established and \nadministered by State DOT's to complement traditional funding by \nproviding loans, loan guarantees, and other forms of non-grant \nassistance that leverage private dollars. This one-time infusion would \nallow states to voluntarily utilize this additional funding, while at \nthe same time ensuring that there is sufficient oversight, reporting \nand public disclosure requirements.\n  Additionally, my bill would provide $25 billion in supplemental \nappropriations for existing highway and bridge formula programs. This \nfunding is meant to supplement and not replace the approximately $40 \nbillion appropriated annually under the current Surface Transportation \nauthorization for similar transportation programs. According to the \nFederal Highway Administration's most recent estimates, every $1 \nbillion spent on highway construction supported approximately 30,000 \njobs.\n  It is essential that we rebuild our nation's deteriorating \ninfrastructure. According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, \nit would cost more than $200 billion annually to substantially improve \nthe conditions of our nation's roads and bridges--far more than current \nlevels of national investment. Our legislation will not only create \njobs but also bolster important road and bridge investments throughout \nthe United States.\n  I am pleased to hear that the American Association of State Highway \nand Transportation Officials, AASHTO, a nonprofit, nonpartisan \nassociation, supports what we have proposed in our bill. These \ninvestments not only create jobs now when they are needed most, but \nthey also address our nation's aging infrastructure, a daunting but \nessential task.\n  There is also no shortage of sewer and drinking water infrastructure \nneeds in states and communities across the nation. The American Society \nof Civil Engineers' latest infrastructure report card gave the nation's \nwater infrastructure a D-, and the Environmental Protection Agency \nestimates $187.9 billion in wastewater needs and $334.8 billion in \ndrinking water needs over the next 20 years.\n  To help ensure the provision of safe water, we propose providing $800 \nmillion in additional funding to the Clean Water and Drinldng Water \nState Revolving Loan Funds, CWSRF and DWSRF, to help ensure these \ncritical infrastructure programs are funded at the fiscal year 2010 \nlevels of $2.1 billion for CWSRF and $1.387 billion for DWSRF. Water \ninfrastructure investments provide significant environmental, economic, \nand public health benefits in our states and communities.\n  Investment in water infrastructure also creates jobs. The National \nAssociation of Utility Contractors, for example, estimates that one \nbillion dollars invested in water infrastructure can create over 26,000 \njobs.\n  As I meet with businesses, a chief complaint is that regulations and \nred tape are preventing them from growing and adding jobs. Our bill \nalso contains important reforms to our regulatory system by \nincorporating provisions I offered earlier this year as the CURB Act, \nwhich stands for Clearing Unnecessary Regulatory Burdens. These \nprovisions are designed to force Federal agencies to cut the red tape \nthat impedes job growth.\n  All too often it seems Federal agencies do not take into account the \nimpacts to small businesses and job growth before imposing new rules \nand regulations. The bill we are introducing today obligates them to do \nso in three ways: first, by requiring Federal agencies to analyze the \nindirect costs of regulations, such as the impact on job creation, the \ncost of energy, and consumer prices.\n  Currently, Federal agencies are not required by statute to analyze \nthe indirect cost regulations can have on the public, such as higher \nenergy costs, higher prices, and the impact on job creation. However, \nExecutive Order 12866, issued by President Clinton in 1993, obligates \nagencies to provide the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs \nwith an assessment of the indirect costs of proposed regulations. Our \nbill would essentially codify this provision of President Clinton's \nExecutive Order.\n  Second, our bill obligates Federal agencies to comply with public \nnotice and comment requirements and prohibits them from circumventing \nthese requirements by issuing unofficial rules as ``guidance \ndocuments.''\n  After President Clinton issued Executive Order 12866, Federal \nagencies found it easier to issue so- called ``guidance documents,'' \nrather than formal rules. Although these guidance documents are merely \nan agency's interpretation of how the public can comply with a \nparticular rule, and are not enforceable in court, as a practical \nmatter they operate as if they are legally binding. Thus, they have \nbeen used by agencies to circumvent OIRA regulatory review and public \nnotice and comment requirements.\n  In 2007, OMB issued a Bulletin which contained a provision closing \nthis loophole by imposing ``Good Guidance Practices'' on Federal \nagencies. This requires agencies to provide public notice and comment \nfor significant guidance documents. Our bill would essentially codify \nthis OMB Bulletin.\n  Third, our bill helps out the ``little guy'' trying to navigate our \nincredibly complex and burdensome regulatory environment. So many small \nbusinesses don't have a lot of capital on hand. When a small business \ninadvertently runs afoul of a Federal regulation for the first time, \nthat first penalty could sink the business and the jobs it supports. \nOur bill directs agencies to search their files to determine whether a \nsmall business is facing a paperwork violation for the first time, and \nto offer to waive the penalty for that violation if no harm has come of \nit. It simply doesn't make sense to me to punish small businesses the \nfirst time they accidently fail to comply with paperwork requirements, \nso long as no harm comes from that failure.\n  One example of a planned onerous regulatory action by the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency is the Maximum Achievable Control \nTechnology standards for boilers and incinerators, known as Boiler \nMACT. While currently being reworked by the agency, these rules could \ncost manufacturers billions of dollars, and potentially lead to the \nloss of thousands of jobs, especially in some of the hardest hit areas \nacross the Nation. According to a recent study commissioned by the \nAmerican Forest and Paper Association, implementing the rule as \npreviously drafted could cause 36 pulp and paper mills around the \ncountry to close, putting over 20,000 Americans out of work--18% of the \nindustry's workforce. For this reason, our legislation includes the EPA \nRegulatory Relief Act, which currently has 40 bipartisan cosponsors, to \nguarantee the 15 months the EPA itself requested, to provide the agency \nwith the testing data needed for achievable rules and provide \nmanufacturers with the time needed for the capital planning to comply \nwith these very complex and expensive rules.\n  Maine has lost more than a third of its manufacturing jobs during the \npast decade, and I am wary of imposing costly new regulations that \ncould lead to more mill closures and lost jobs. I remain committed to \nworking with my Senate colleagues and the EPA to help ensure that the \nBoiler MACT rules are crafted to protect public health without harming \nthe forest products industry, which is the lifeblood of many small, \nrural communities.\n  We must also act to reform our Federal jobs training programs. In our \ncurrent fiscal climate, we need to ensure that our Federal dollars are \nbeing used\n\n[[Page S8417]]\n\nas efficiently and productively as possible. The Collins-McCaskill bill \nrequires OMB to study the consolidation of duplicative job training \nprograms and make legislative recommendations to Congress that \ncontemplate consolidating job training programs under a single agency. \nOf the savings that result from this consolidation, half will be \ndevoted to classroom, field, and hands-on training, and the other half \nwill be be used to reduce the deficit.\n  In closing, Senator McCaskill and I believe this is the first \ncomprehensive bipartisan jobs bill to be introduced in the Senate since \nthe President's speech before the Joint Session of Congress in \nSeptember. With the end of the year just three weeks away, we must take \naction now to protect the American public from a tax increase that will \noccur automatically on January 1. We must also work together to help \ngrow the economy and add jobs. In achieving these goals, I would ask my \ncolleagues to consider the approach Senator McCaskill and I have \nproposed in this bipartisan jobs legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Brown of \n        Ohio, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Franken, Mr. \n        Blumenthal, Mr. Casey, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Brown of Massachusetts, Ms. Ayotte, \n        Mr. Schumer, Mr. Webb, Mr. Begich, and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 1961. A bill to provide level funding for the Low-Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing the bipartisan LIHEAP \nProtection Act, along with my colleagues Senator Snowe from Maine and \nSenator Sanders from Vermont, and many of our colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle. I am pleased to see such broad support for funding for \nthis critical program even in the midst of our budget challenges.\n  Indeed, LIHEAP is a lifeline, providing vulnerable families with \nvital assistance when they need it most by helping low-income families \nand seniors on fixed-incomes with their energy bills.\n  Last year, Congress provided $4.7 billion for LIHEAP. In an effort to \ncontrol Federal spending, the Administration proposed an approximately \n45 percent cut in LIHEAP funds from last year's level, down to about \n$2.57 billion in 2012. The Senate and House Appropriations bills only \npartially restored this drastic cut, to roughly $3.6 billion and $3.4 \nbillion, respectively.\n  These cutbacks could put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, \nespecially as the number of households eligible for the program already \nexceeds those receiving assistance. Given the difficult economy and the \nprojected rise in household energy expenditures, as much as 8 percent \nmore than last year for those who heat their homes with heating oil \naccording to the Energy Information Administration, it does not make \nsense to cut vital LIHEAP funding.\n  We also need to act quickly. If funding is not finalized before \nwinter, millions of low-income households run the risk of not receiving \nassistance during the coldest months when they need it most. Given the \nuncertainty in the full year appropriations for LIHEAP, which resulted \nin the release of only $1.7 billion in LIHEAP funding to States in \nOctober, some States have already begun lowering LIHEAP grant amounts.\n  LIHEAP is a smart investment. For every dollar in benefits paid, \n$1.13 is generated in economic activity, according to economists Mark \nZandi and Alan S. Blinder.\n  I know we face a lot of difficult budget decisions around here, but \nI, along with so many of my colleagues, believe that LIHEAP should not \nbe the place where we seek savings.\n  I look forward to working to provide level funding for LIHEAP for \nfiscal year 2012.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1961\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``LIHEAP Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section--\n       (1) is to ensure the appropriation for fiscal year 2012 of \n     the total amounts described in subsection (b), for payments \n     described in that subsection, under this Act or prior \n     appropriations Acts; and\n       (2) is not to require the appropriation of additional \n     amounts for those payments, under appropriations Acts enacted \n     after this Act.\n       (b) Appropriation.--In addition to any amounts appropriated \n     under any provision of Federal law, as of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, there is appropriated, out of any \n     money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for fiscal \n     year 2012--\n       (1) an amount sufficient to yield a total amount of \n     $4,501,000,000, for making payments under subsections (b) and \n     (d) of section 2602 of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \n     Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621), and all of such total amount \n     shall be used under the authority and conditions applicable \n     to such payments under the Full-Year Continuing \n     Appropriations Act, 2011; and\n       (2) an amount sufficient to yield a total amount of \n     $200,000,000, for making payments under section 2602(e) of \n     the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. \n     8621(e)), notwithstanding the designation requirement of such \n     section 2602(e), and all of such total amount shall be used \n     under the authority and conditions applicable to such \n     payments under the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, \n     2011.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) this Act should be carried out in a manner consistent \n     with the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Public Law 112-25; 125 \n     Stat. 240);\n       (2) the Secretary of Health and Human Services should \n     continue and expedite program integrity efforts to identify \n     best practices used by grant recipients under the Low-Income \n     Home Energy Assistance Program, provide training and \n     technical assistance to such grant recipients, recommend \n     policy changes, and assess and mitigate risk at the Federal, \n     State and local levels, in order to eliminate any waste, \n     fraud, and abuse in the Program and strengthen the Program so \n     all Program funds reach the households who need them most; \n     and\n       (3) every Program dollar going to waste, fraud, and abuse \n     is a dollar not being spent as the dollar is needed or \n     intended.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about an issue \nof enormous importance to the people of the State of Vermont and people \nall over this country; that is, the issue of making sure that in \nAmerica this winter nobody goes cold, that nobody freezes to death, \nthat children do not become ill because the thermostats in their homes \nare turned down so low.\n  The issue I am talking about is to ask for support for legislation \nthat is being introduced by Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island and \nSenator Olympia Snowe of Maine which would level fund the LIHEAP \nprogram at $4.7 billion. As most of my colleagues know, LIHEAP is the \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n  Here is the problem we face. We are in the midst of a horrendous \nrecession. Unemployment is sky high. In many cases, wages are in \ndecline, poverty is increasing, and at the same time the price for home \nheating oil and propane gas is going up. According to the Energy \nInformation Administration, average expenditures for households that \nheat with oil or propane are forecast to be higher than in any previous \nwinter. Heating oil prices are currently averaging about $3.90 a \ngallon. So what people in the Northeast and people all over this \ncountry are looking at are the highest home heating oil prices we have \never seen, coming in the midst of a terrible recession, with \nunemployment high and wages in decline.\n  In Vermont, heating oil prices are already 34 percent higher than \nthey were at the same time last year. It is currently $3.82 a gallon, \ncompared to $2.85 a gallon last year. What is happening is that because \nof cuts--significant cuts--in LIHEAP funding, the average LIHEAP \nbenefit in Vermont is 45 percent less this year than it was last year, \nand that is $474 per family as opposed to $866 last year.\n  One thing that has to be understood about LIHEAP is that nearly 80 \npercent of funding from this program goes to our citizens who are \nelderly, families with preschool kids, and the disabled. So the people \nwho benefit from this program are some of the most vulnerable people in \nour country. Eighty percent of the funding, once again, goes to senior \ncitizens, families with preschool children, young children, and people \nwho are dealing with disabilities.\n\n[[Page S8418]]\n\n  It is not uncommon in the State of Vermont and in other States for \nthe temperatures to drop to 10 below zero or 20 below zero in the \nwintertime. When people do not have enough funds to heat their homes or \ntheir apartments, serious problems arise.\n  What I want to do is take a moment to read some comments my office \nhas received from Vermonters all over the State who are trying \ndesperately to stay warm this winter.\n  Josie Crosby, 81 years of age, of Brattleboro, VT, said this:\n\n       We will have money for one more tank. After that, I don't \n     know.\n\n  That is a woman who is 81 years of age who has money for one more \ntank of oil. After that, she is not sure how they will stay warm in the \nwinter.\n  A 48-year-old from Orleans County in the northern part of our State \nwrote this:\n\n       I was able to get 100 gallons of fuel last week, and for \n     that I am grateful. The struggle begins now on how to stretch \n     that fuel as long as possible. I had to buy a portable \n     electric heater to keep halfway warm while waiting for fuel \n     assistance. I don't even want to see how high my electric \n     bill will be. I am an honorably discharged disabled veteran \n     and have limited funds. I have already slashed my food bill, \n     so what goes next? My meds, my electric service, my home?\n\n  That is from a disabled vet in the northern part of Vermont.\n  A 59-year-old woman in central Vermont writes:\n\n       I have been keeping my thermostat as low as I can \n     ``almost'' tolerate. I bundle up in the house with several \n     sweaters, and even a coat and hat at times. When company \n     arrives, I am embarrassed at how ridiculous I probably \n     appear. I am just barely squeaking through each month. I have \n     made cuts everywhere possible, including food.\n\n  Wendy Raven, 62, from Whitingham, VT, writes:\n\n       I had to drag my bed out of my bedroom and put it in the \n     living room, then close off the bedroom for the winter. I \n     will have to eat even less than I do now in order to pay my \n     fuel bills. I have done everything I can to button up the \n     place, but now all I can do is pray I get through the winter \n     without a bill so large it will again take me until next fall \n     to pay it off.\n\n  Is that where we are in the United States of America--that we force \npeople to live under those conditions?\n  A 31-year-old woman from Bennington, VT, writes:\n\n       We are now trying to stay warm by scraping up enough for a \n     gallon or two of heating oil a week, and keeping the \n     thermostat down very low. I turn the furnace off during the \n     day when my child is in school and turn it on an hour before \n     she gets home so that the house gets warm. We are hoping to \n     qualify for crisis fuel assistance or we are in trouble, \n     because there is nowhere to get the extra money needed to pay \n     for the fuel, especially considering its continuously \n     increasing cost. We have to choose what bills to pay each \n     month and what ones not in order to put food on the table.\n\n  In this great Nation, in the midst of a recession, in the midst of \nhigh unemployment, in the midst of growing poverty, we as the Senate \nmust be very clear that nobody in this country is going to go cold this \nwinter; that we are not going to pick up a paper in Maine or Rhode \nIsland or Vermont or North Dakota and read that some senior citizen was \nfound frozen to death. That is not what we are going to allow. That is \nwhy Senators Jack Reed, Olympia Snowe, I, and many others are working \nhard so that at the very least we can level fund LIHEAP so that nobody \nin our country goes cold this winter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8418-1", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 345--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE \n            CLOSURE OF UMATILLA ARMY CHEMICAL DEPOT, OREGON\n\n  Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any related statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 345\n\n       Whereas, in December 2001, the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for fiscal year 2002 (Public Law 107-107) \n     was signed into law, which included authorization for a 2005 \n     round of defense base closure and realignment (BRAC);\n       Whereas, on February 16, 2004, Secretary of Defense Donald \n     Rumsfeld included the closure of the Umatilla Army Chemical \n     Depot, Oregon, as one of his recommendations for the 2005 \n     round of defense base closure and realignment;\n       Whereas, on September 8, 2005, the Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment Commission, in its report making recommendations \n     to the President, found that Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld's \n     assertion that the chemical demilitarization mission at \n     Umatilla would be complete by the 2nd quarter of 2011 was \n     optimistic, and wrote, ``An examination of status information \n     for the depot's mission completion and subsequent closure \n     revealed that dates may slip beyond the 6-year statutory \n     period for completion of BRAC actions.'';\n       Whereas, in that same report, the Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment Commission took the Secretary of Defense's \n     recommendation ``Close Umatilla Chemical Depot, OR'' and \n     changed it to ``On completion of the chemical \n     demilitarization mission in accordance with treaty \n     obligations, close Umatilla Chemical Depot, OR'';\n       Whereas, by doing so, the Defense Base Closure and \n     Realignment Commission acknowledged that the closure of \n     Umatilla Army Chemical Depot would happen when the \n     demilitarization mission is completed, even if that is after \n     September 15, 2011; and\n       Whereas Congress did not pass a joint resolution of \n     disapproval with respect to the Commission's report, and the \n     report and recommendations became law: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That, in light of the clear history, the Senate \n     reiterates its original intent and reaffirms its direction \n     that the closure of the Umatilla Army Chemical Depot, Oregon, \n     and subsequent management and disposal shall be carried out \n     in accordance with procedures and authorities contained in \n     the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A \n     of title XXIX of Public Law 101-510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2011/12/07/senate-section/article/S8419-3", "month": "12", "year": "2011", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, DECEMBER 8, 2011\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY.
